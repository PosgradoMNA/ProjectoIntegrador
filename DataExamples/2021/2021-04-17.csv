Data released by Johns Hopkins University on Saturday showed 3000225 deaths and 139963964 cases globally.

The figures come as a new wave of the pandemic in India pushed the number of cases in the country to almost 14.5m second only to the United States which has reported more than 32m.

India recorded 234692 new infections in the 24 hours to Saturday morning according to health ministry data the eighth record daily increase in nine days. Fatalities rose by 1341 to reach a total of 175649.

In Japan rising virus cases have stoked speculation that the Olympic Games – postponed last year due to the pandemic – could be cancelled.

Japan’s prime minister Yoshihide Suga in his first meeting with US president Joe Biden said his government was listening to experts and doing its “utmost” to prepare for the Tokyo games in July.

In Brazil the country with the third-highest death toll in the world night shifts have been added to several cemeteries as diggers work around the clock to bury the dead. Women have been advised to delay becoming pregnant because the virus variant that is devastating the South American country appears to affect expectant mothers more than earlier versions of the coronavirus.

Hopes that south Asian countries might have beaten the pandemic have been dashed with India recording more than 2m cases this month alone and Bangladesh and Pakistan imposing shutdowns.

India’s per-capita rates remain low by international comparison raising the prospect that infection numbers – fuelled possibly by a virulent new “double mutant” – may explode further.

After a national lockdown a year ago led to hundreds of deaths and one of the worst slumps of any major economy the Indian government has been desperate to avoid a second stoppage. However many states areclamping down including Maharashtra where the biggest city is Mumbai industry-heavy Gujarat and Karnataka which is home to the IT hub Bengaluru.

Uttar Pradesh state home to about 240 million people announced on Friday that all villages and cities would be under lockdown for one day on Sunday.

In the capital Delhi which has overtaken Mumbai as the worst-hit Indian city restaurants malls gyms and spas were shut for the weekend. Weddings can go ahead with guests limited to 50 while a maximum of 20 people can attend funerals. Movie theatres can open with one-third capacity.

“Don’t panic. All essential services will be available through the weekend” said the city’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

The northern state of Uttarakhand restricted gatherings to 200 people but exempted the vast ongoing Hindu festival Kumbh Mela.

The gathering in Haridwar has attracted as many as 25 million people since January including about 4.6 million this week alone with most people ignoring Covid-19 guidelines. One seer died from the virus on Thursday and 80 other holy men have tested positive. Experts fear that the millions of devotees will now take the virus back to their home towns and villages.

Election rallies are also going ahead in the eastern state of West Bengal with home minister Amit Shah attending two roadshows and one public meeting on Friday alone.

In state capital Kolkata railway employee Samaresh Tapna fell sick after attending one such gathering and was admitted to hospital. “I felt angry with myself ... I cursed my fate” the 42-year-old told Agence-France Presse.

Hospitals are running short of oxygen and coronavirus medicines such as Remdesivir prompting desperate people to pay exorbitant rates on the black market.

Social media is full of horror stories of desperate calls to help a loved one needing hospital treatment for Covid-19 or other complaints. “I lost a cousin on Saturday. He was not admitted after a stroke. Tried 4 hospitals” read one message on a Delhi neighbourhood WhatsApp group this week.

India’s drive to vaccinate its 1.3 billion people has also hit obstacles with just 117 million shots administered so far and stocks running low according to some local authorities.

“[It is] understandable that many people are sick of the restrictions and want to resume normal life. We must redouble our efforts to contain this disease as too many lives are at stake”

“This is a wake-up call to the world. Vaccines must be available to everyone everywhere rich and poor to overcome this terrible pandemic” said Udaya Regmi from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) calling the surge across south Asia “truly frightening”.

There was some better news in Europe where some countries are easing their lockdowns in response to not only fatigue but falling infection numbers and progress with vaccinations.

Italy announced on Friday it would ease coronavirus restrictions for schools and restaurants from 26 April. England eased some restrictions this week with other countries in the UK following closely behind. In the US nearly 200 million people have been vaccinated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGVzbGFtb3RvcnNjbHViLmNvbS90bWMvdGhyZWFkcy9zaG91bGQtcHBmLWxvb2stb2stZnJvbS01LWZlZXQtYXdheS4yMjYwMTgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should PPF look OK from 5 feet away?,"This is my first experience with paint protection film so I don't really know if it's supposed to look like this or not.

They've been in business for 40 years and do all the work for the local Lamborghini Bentley Ferrari etc. dealerships so they seem pretty legit.They charged a tear-jerking sum of money and needed the car for 2 full days to do just the front bumper nothing else - no headlights hood fenders mirrors etc. I requested 3M film although they said XPel would be a little cheaper is there any way to know what film I actually got?

The most noticeable blemish is the splotchyness on the top of the bumper which looks like minor collision damage in person but is hard to photograph. The cluster of small bubbles seems to be some gravel that got between the film and the paint and is really lumpy but not in a very noticeable location. They bashed in the tow hook cover a little but didn't bother to put any film on it. Anyone know how to pull it back out flush with the bumper?

It even weighs slightly more than the T-90 tank which remains the frontline armored vehicle of the Russian Army.

While both are based on the same Armata chassis the T-14 main battle tank has routinely been in the spotlight whether for its latest improvements that could allow it to be remotely operated or if one was even destroyed in Syria. However far less has been noted about the T-15 armored fighting vehicle which could be a significant component to the Russian Army.

It could even have as much effect on the Russian military as its heavier sister platform.

The T-15 was designed primarily as a transport and could carry a dozen soldiers including three crewmembers. However it was not quite an armored personnel carrier (APC)—such as the U.S. military’s Cold War-era M113 (APC) or newer Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV)—but not exactly an update to its BMP-3M infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) which is the latest update to a platform dating back to the early 1960s.

This vehicle exists somewhere between an APC and IFV. There is no NATO vehicle that is comparable to the T-15 and the closest equivalent could arguably be the Israeli-built Merkava which is essentially a heavy tank that can also carry troops. In the case of the T-15 however it is far more of a heavily armed and armored troop carrier.

The keyword could be heavy—in both cases.

As a troop transport the T-15 is unusually heavy and at forty-eight tons it is actually heavier than any serving Russian tank other than the T-14. It even weighs slightly more than the T-90 tank which remains the frontline armored vehicle of the Russian Army. This is because the T-15 shares the same Armata chassis as the T-14 which is about as beefy as they come today.

Unlike the true tank version of the Armata platform the T-15 features a remote-controlled Bumerang-EM/Empoch turret that is placed at the back of the tank while the engine is situated at the front of the vehicle. This has the added benefit of allowing the engine to shield the passengers from hits to the front.

The platform’s primary armament is a Shipunov 2A42 30-millimeter autocannon while secondary armament consists of a dual bank of Kornet anti-tank missiles and a 7.62 PKMT machine gun. The “fire and forget” missiles are capable of defeating reactive armor and active protection systems. These use technical vision with an automatic target tracker which makes it five times more likely to accurately hit a target at ranges from 150 to 10000 meters.

This mix of weapons along with the fire and forget ability actually allows the T-15 to fire at multiple targets simultaneously. The T-15 can carry a total of 500 rounds of ammunition including 160 armor-piercing and 340 high-explosive fragmentation rounds.

Latest Updates

Russian deputy defense minister Alexei Krivoruchko announced in August 2018 that a contract on 132 T-14 tanks and T-15 infantry fighting vehicles based on the Armata combat platform had been signed—but how many of each was unclear but deliveries of both have been repeatedly delayed and according to state media troops wouldn’t even get the first tanks until 2021. It isn’t known when deliveries of the T-15 would begin.

However both platforms were demonstrated to potential foreign buyers at Army-2020 international arms show last month.

This past winter Georgy Zakamennykh CEO of the Burevestnik Central Research Institute which is part of Uralvagonzavod manufacturer within the state hi-tech corporation Rostec also told Tass that the T-15 Armata heavy infantry fighting vehicle with the latest AU-220M combat module.

According to information from the Uralvagonzavod press office the AU-220M is an unmanned cannon and machine-gun module. It was designed to serve as the armament for various combat vehicles infantry fighting vehicles already in operation as well as new platforms such as the T-15.

The AU-220M has a firing range of up to 14.5 kilometers with a maximum rate of fire of eighty rounds per minute. Ammunition load typically includes eighty unitary fifty-seven-millimeter munitions including multifunctional remote-controlled armor-piercing and guided projectiles which allows effectively striking small-size unmanned aerial vehicles low-flying aircraft and helicopters and also land-based light-armored hardware and field fortifications.

However it remains unclear when the first T-15s to feature the AU-220M combat module will be deployed or for that matter if the hybrid APC/IFV will be rolling out even next year.

In total the bill to the State arising from successful personal injury claims by the Defence Force members from military training exercises totals €5.27m.

Along with the €3.22m paid out in damages an additional €2.05m was paid out in legal costs by the State.

However the overall estimated bill from injuries sustained by Defence Force members during military training exercises between finalised claims and claims currently in the system is €10.84m.

This follows the estimate by the State Claims Agency (SCA) — which handles the claims made against the Defence Forces — that the current liability from personal injury claims from military training exercises that are not yet finalised stands at €5.57m.

Average payout of €44.7k

The figures provided by the Minister for Defence Simon Covene to co-leader of the Social Democrats Catherine Murphy TD show that the average damages payout to defence forces personnel over the seven years was €44750.

The SCA has confirmed that the injuries sustained include hearing/sight injuries along with musculoskeletal and soft tissue injuries.

Other injuries sustained include emotional/traumatic suffering.

Last year the SCA paid out €481100 in damages to nine claimants while an additional €329811 was paid out in legal costs.

Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act

Asked to comment on the figures Gerard Guinan the general secretary of the representative body for members of the Defence Forces PDForra said Defence Forces members are subject to the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act in the same manner as other employers and therefore relative to past practises “training has become safer”.

Mr Guinan stated that as the figures show “accidents do happen” and PDForra does all it can to point out potential dangers to members.

""Members of the Defence Forces are somewhat unique in the public sector as they have to complete annual fitness tests and medicals in order to remain in service"" he said.

Injuries that impact on the ability of personnel to perform their work can have profound effects on career progression or even retention in the services.

Commenting on the figures Catherine Murphy TD said: “Firstly it has to be recognised that personnel in the Defence Forces are at a higher level of risk because of their profession so it’s not surprising to see injury claims.

We however need to ensure that lessons are learned and risks are mitigated to reduce the possibility of injury and any claims in the future that can be avoided.

A spokesman for the Defence Forces stated: “All Defence Forces training is conducted in line with the relevant Defence Forces Regulatory documents such as Training Instructions. Defence Forces Regulatory documents are amended where and as required in line with any court ruling or judgment.”"

Texans would rather vote for actor Matthew McConaughey than Gov. Greg Abbott according to a poll released by The Dallas Morning News and the University of Texas at Tyler.

The ""Dallas Buyers Club"" star has flirted with the idea of running for governor referring to it as a ""true consideration"" during a March appearance on ""The Balanced Voice"" podcast.

For months McConaughey has teased political pundits and TV talk show hosts with musings that he might enter politics in his home state.

If he were to take the plunge and run for governor the poll found 45% of Texas registered voters would vote for McConaughey 33% would vote for Abbott and 22% would vote for someone else.

McConaughey’s double-digit lead over the two-term Republican incumbent is significant. The poll conducted April 6-13 surveyed 1126 registered voters and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.92 percentage points.

But 56% of Republican voters said they’d vote for Abbott compared with only 30% for McConaughey.

Advertisement

While Democrats broke 66% to 8% for McConaughey and independents 44% to 28% more than twice as many Democratic primary voters — 51% — said they wanted a progressive candidate for governor than wanted a centrist — 25%.

That could pose a problem. McConaughey who has criticized both major parties has suggested he’s more of a moderate.

And in the GOP gubernatorial primary that’s also not obviously a ticket to success. Solid majorities of poll respondents who described themselves as conservative evangelical or retirement-age Republican primary voters said they’d vote for Abbott.

Only 20% of GOP primary voters preferred a more centrist Republican and 18% wanted someone more like former President Donald Trump. Fourteen percent preferred someone more conservative than Abbott who has been avidly courting the right wing of his party in recent weeks after several staunch conservatives including former state Sen. Don Huffines of Dallas were mentioned as possible challengers to him in the primary.

Some of the Trump supporters warm to celebrities and that sentiment along with the wishes of one-fifth of the primary electorate for a more moderate nominee might open a lane in the GOP primary for McConaughey said UT-Tyler political scientist Mark Owens who directed the poll.

“Matthew McConaughey gets a huge boost from tremendous name recognition and recognition for what he does to help Texans and add to the celebration of the state’s successes” Owens said. “Most of our survey respondents know his story but many are waiting to see how he opens his next chapter.”

Mark Harp a conservative independent voter from Midlothian said McConaughey’s appeal is similar to Trump’s: He’s a political outsider with a message that the system is corrupt ineffective and in need of reforms.

“He’s popular he’s colorful and he’s not afraid to tell it like it is” said Harp 47 a construction manager. “He has some of the same qualities of Donald Trump and that will play well in Texas.”

Still pollster Owens noted that in seven years as the state’s chief executive Abbott has “held together a traditional coalition of Texas Republicans and independents who continue to support him.”

Most oppose ‘permitless’ carry of handguns

The poll part of an ongoing collaboration between The News and UT-Tyler’s Center for Opinion Research was taken as debate over guns heated up in the Legislature which has just more than six weeks left to complete work in this year’s session.

By 58% to 26% Texans oppose a bill the House approved — and sent to the Senate Friday — that would allow people to carry handguns without a permit. Last month opposition was greater — 64% to 23%.

As a constituent of Tyler GOP Rep. Matt Schaefer a co-author of the bill Owens said “I’ve received multiple interest group messages on this.”

In two polls by The News and UT-Tyler early last year a majority of Texas registered voters endorsed a national ban on the sale of semiautomatic assault weapons. This month that slipped to support by a plurality 48% for and 33% against.

Poll respondent Dylan Tramel 25 a Rockwall County native who is temporarily posted in another state as a member of the armed services said he opposes gun control measures and supports “permitless” carry of handguns.

“I’m for constitutional carry” he said using proponents’ label. “It’s just taking the Second Amendment at face value.”

At the same time confidence that elected officials are doing enough to prevent mass shootings has ebbed. In early 2020 not long after Trump Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick mused publicly about possible gun law changes in the wake of the August 2019 slaughters in El Paso and Odessa-Midland up to 47% of Texans agreed that elected officials were doing enough to avoid repetition of the tragedies.

This month 38% agreed and 59% disagreed — including 86% of Black people 65% of Hispanics and 46% of Republicans.

Abortion immigration COVID-19

Nearly half a century after the U.S. Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade established a woman’s right to an abortion at least in the first three months of pregnancy a majority of Texans — and Republicans if barely — said the court should not overturn Roe.

Among all Texas registered voters 61% said Roe should not be overturned while 37% said it should be. Republicans split 51%-49% against overturning as did women 63%-35%. White evangelicals favored voiding the controversial ruling 56%-43%

Both GOP-controlled chambers of the Legislature are advancing a half dozen measures to restrict abortion.

Advertisement

In The News and UT-Tyler’s poll a plurality of Texas registered voters (42%-37%) supported a Senate-passed bill that would ban virtually all abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected usually about six weeks into pregnancy except in medical emergencies. Texas law currently bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy — or up to 22 weeks from the last menstrual period.

Though about two-thirds of Republicans and white evangelicals support the so-called “heartbeat” bill women narrowly oppose it 40%-38% as do Democrats 47%-31%.

As the new Biden administration in Washington struggles to get control of a crush of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border most Texans say those seeking political asylum at the border should be required to stay in Mexico while their claims are processed. While 37% say asylum seekers should be allowed into the U.S. while they wait 61% say they should be made to stay in Mexico.

Biden who’s under almost daily fire from Abbott over the sharp rise in Border Patrol encounters with migrants last month gets low marks from Texans for managing the situation.

While a plurality of Texans approve of the overall job Biden is doing as president (48%-41%) a slight majority — 52% — disapprove of his performance at handling immigration at the border. Just 30% approve.

Abbott enjoys a higher job-approval rating among Texans than does Biden: 50% approve 36% disapprove. But it’s Abbott’s lowest showing in eight tests by The News/UT-Tyler poll since January 2020 — and down from a high of 61% in April 2020. That’s when near the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic Texans appeared to rally around his shutdown orders.

Asked if they trusted the leaders to keep their communities healthy and safe during the public health crisis Texans narrowly said they trust Biden 51%-44%.

However a narrow plurality now distrusts Abbott to protect their communities from COVID-19: 46% trust the Republican governor 47% do not. It’s the first time in six polls that Abbott has sunk underwater on the question. In this month’s poll he’s especially lost ground among independents (30% trust him 59% distrust him) and Black people (20% trust 71% distrust).

As for activities during the pandemic Texans are more comfortable gathering with friends now: 44% are extremely comfortable while only 23% felt that way in April 2020.

Texans are not as comfortable though being in crowds: 16% are extremely comfortable now very close to the 15% who said they were extremely comfortable last April.

Sixty percent of Texans say they have been or definitely will be vaccinated against COVID-19 up from 57% last month. An additional 14% say they probably will get immunized. If they all do as many as 74% could be inoculated approaching the level many experts say is needed to achieve “herd immunity.” If all the state were Democrats combining the three responses would produce an 89% acceptance rate compared with 69% among Republicans and 66% among independents.

McConaughey spiel resonates

Abbott political adviser Dave Carney has proclaimed the governor to be in “a strong position” to win a third term next year though stressing that the incumbent 63 is not taking anything for granted

However McConaughey 51 has said he’s giving “honest consideration” to running. Politics is “a broken business” and it’s time for someone with his “aggressively centric” approach he told the Austin American-Statesman last month.

Owens the pollster said such talk resonates with the 33% of the electorate that does not identify as a partisan. McConaughey has a 16-point advantage with independents and his electoral path would have to include these voters who make up 31% of his potential coalition he said. The breakdown of Abbott’s coalition? 65% Republican 27% independent and 8% Democratic.

Even among voters who approve of the job Abbott is doing 35% prefer McConaughey over the incumbent Owens noted. While 54% of Texans say Abbott did well or very well in responding to the electricity and utility outages caused by February’s storm among the 44% who said he did “not well” or “not well at all” McConaughey clobbers him 57%-9%. Only among Texans over 45 does Abbott have an edge. Among younger voters the actor dominates.

Several veteran Texas political strategists though said the buzz created by McConaughey’s novelty could change quickly. As soon as he’s put into a party nominating contest he’ll draw fire they said. And in Texas governor races the alternatives — running as an independent or for a third party such as the Libertarian Party — have never yielded success they noted.

McConaughey’s strong name recognition reminds Vinny Minchillo a North Texas-based GOP political consultant of now-fading talk that Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan might run for office.

McConaughey’s fame far eclipses that of the entertainer Kinky Friedman who managed only a fourth-place finish running as an independent in the 2006 contest won by then-Gov. Rick Perry.

Despite an early edge in polls McConaughey would have a bumpy ride against Abbott who can raise up to $80 million or more activate a large voter-turnout organization and cast McConaughey as not fit for office Minchillo said.

“What it really comes down to is do you want the ‘Dazed and Confused guy’ running the state?” Minchillo said. McConaughey was one of the stars in the 1993 coming-of-age film set in Texas.

Harp the Ellis County admirer of McConaughey said it would be interesting to see whether the actor chose to run as a Republican or Democrat adding that being an independent candidate is a losing battle.

One Republican who responded to the poll said Abbott had nothing to worry about regarding 2022.

“I’ve been so happy with him” said Dallas resident Linda Green 65. “He’s been very steady.”

Green a former nurse said she’s disenchanted with national Republicans but pleased with Texas GOP leaders — largely because they’re seeking to end abortion.

She defended Abbott’s performance on the winter storm that left millions without power and factored into the deaths of at least 133 people.

“It’s human nature that when you suffer you want to find someone to blame” she said. “A leader has to trust the people underneath him. And the extreme weather did not cause the problem it revealed the problem.”

Corporate endorsements a problem?

McConaughey and his wife Camila have been raising money for storm victims through their Just Keep Living Foundation. Also McConaughey recently wrote a motivational book Greenlights. It has been on The New York Times’ bestseller list for 22 weeks ranking No. 11 in the combined print and e-book nonfiction category as of April 10.

Those would seem high-profile efforts from which to launch a candidacy.

Operatives close to Abbott’s much-vaunted political organization though have said privately that they doubt McConaughey will run in 2022 because he’d need time to untangle business commitments. McConaughey who in 2014 won a best actor Oscar for his performance in Dallas Buyers Club has prolifically endorsed products and companies.

They include Houston-based Reliant Energy an electricity retailer that’s a major participant in the Texas grid that lethally failed in February. That could be a problem for him — as could with different constituencies his 2016 agreement to serve as creative director for Campari Group’s Wild Turkey Distilling Co. of Lawrenceburg Ky.

Colin Strother a Democratic consultant in San Antonio who worked on Friedman’s campaigns said McConaughey should forgo a candidacy and instead “commit to campaigning for Democrats” especially in red counties that Beto O’Rourke stumped through in 2018. O’Rourke has said he’s not planning to challenge Abbott.

“I don’t think he can be successful as a candidate” Strother said “but he can be tremendously successful as an ally and partner” for state Democrats.

Jason Stanford who managed the campaign of second-place finisher and Democrat Chris Bell in the 2006 gubernatorial race said McConaughey poses no threat to Abbott.

“There doesn’t appear to be a huge groundswell of discontent for Abbott” Stanford said. Once McConaughey declares as a Democrat or Republican reality will set in with Texas voters he added.

“If you ID as a Democrat or a Republican you’re going to get different answers about him in polls” Stanford said. “He’s fun but once you put him in a political context things will change.”

Methodology

The Dallas Morning News/UT-Tyler Poll is a statewide random sample of 1126 registered voters conducted April 6-13. The mixed-mode sample includes 290 registered voters surveyed over the phone by the University of Texas at Tyler with support from ReconMR and 836 registered voters randomly selected from Dynata’s panel of online respondents. The margin of error for a sample of 1126 registered voters in Texas is +/- 2.92 percentage points and the more conservative margin of sampling error that includes design effects from this poll is +/- 4.1 percentage points for a 95% confidence interval.

The online and phone surveys were conducted in English and Spanish. Using information from the 2018 Current Population Survey and Office of the Texas Secretary of State. The sample’s gender age race/ethnicity education metropolitan density and vote choice were matched to the population of registered voters in Texas.

Matthew McConaughey? Actor Has Double-Digit Lead Over Incumbent in Poll,"Matthew McConaughey may not have officially entered the 2022 race to be the next governor of Texas but apparently Texans hope he will as he holds a 12-point lead over Republican incumbent Greg Abbott according to a poll released Sunday by The Dallas Morning News and the University of Texas at Tyler.

Among the 1126 registered Texas voters polled April 6-13 45% would vote for McConaughey 33% would vote for Abbott and 22% would vote for someone else. Of the Republican voters polled 56% said they’d vote for Abbott compared to only 30% for McConaughey. The margin of error is +/-2.9%.

The poll also shows however that McConaughey’s middle-of-the-road politics might be a hurdle if he decides to take the plunge as he has criticized both parties. Although Democrats leaned toward the Oscar winner by 66% to 8% only 25% of them said they would likely support a candidate who is a centrist while 51% want a progressive.

And on the flip side while independents broke 44% to 28% for McConaughey only 20% of GOP gubernatorial primary voters preferred a centrist Republican with 18% wanting for someone more like Donald Trump and 14% wanting someone more conservative.

“Matthew McConaughey gets a huge boost from tremendous name recognition and recognition for what he does to help Texans and add to the celebration of the state’s successes” UT-Tyler political scientist and poll director Mark Owens said. “Most of our survey respondents know his story but many are waiting to see how he opens his next chapter.”

Last month McConaughey said he was giving “true consideration” to throwing his proverbial cowboy hat into the Texas gubernatorial race. “It’s a very honorable consideration. So am I considering that? Sure. It’s a great thing to and an honorable thing to be able to consider” McConaughey told Al Roker on “Today.”

“What I’ve got to choose for myself is I want to get into a leadership role in the next chapter of my life” he added. “Now what role am I going to be most useful in? I don’t know that that’s in a political position or if that’s me as a free agent. So that’s something I’m personally working on is: What is my position of most use in a leadership role?”"

The new marketplace provides government agencies with a list of preferred suppliers for cloud consulting and cloud technology services. According to the DTA the providers selected are “experts in the cloud landscape” and provide “value-for-money” cloud services and solutions.

Cloud offerings are grouped into two procurement categories: cloud consulting and cloud services. The consulting category enables government buyers to tap cloud consultancies on a rate-card system. The cloud services category includes various IT capabilities offered under “as a service” delivery models.

A total of 348 suppliers have been selected for the marketplace including a number of heavyweight firms such as the Big Four accounting and consulting giants of EY KPMG and PwC mid-tier accountancy-origin firm BDO and global technology-oriented players such as Accenture Publicis Sapient Slalom Thoughtworks Tata Consultancy Services Tech Mahindra and Wipro.

The majority of suppliers are however mid-sized and small Australian enterprises building on the DTA’s policy to keep its third-party procurement as inclusive and varied as possible.

Only Accenture is bigger now.TCS is already India’s largest private sector employer. It’s also bigger than public sector undertakings (PSUs).Only the central government (including the armed forces and Indian Railways) and some of the state governments have more employees.TCS’s headcount rose by 40005 during fiscal year 2020-21 taking the total at the end of the year to 488469. The company has said it will hire about 40000 from campuses this year. There will be lateral hires too as also exits. Going by the total headcount growth in recent years and the company’s good order book position the employee strength should be around 5.3 lakh by the end of this fiscal. About 90000 of its employees are outside India.Accenture has 537000 employees. Over the past year it had risen by about 28000. TCS is adding more each year. If that trend continues it should cross Accenture in 2-3 years. It took TCS four years to get from 1 lakh to 2 lakh employees three years to get from 2 lakh to 3 lakh five years to get from 3 lakh to 4 lakh. The next one lakh may happen the fastest in 2-3 years.Peter Bendor-Samuel CEO of IT consulting & research firm Everest Group said the size of its work force demonstrates the significant role TCS plays in the labour market for technical resources both in India and in the US and Europe. “Having said that the size and scale of its workforce will at some point start to constrain its growth. This amongst other reasons is why TCS is investing heavily in developing IP (intellectual property) based business where their growth is not tied to increases in head count” he said.TCS’s chief human resources officer Milind Lakkad said the company’s National Qualifier Test (NQT) which is conducted four times a year would help it bring in more freshers and manage the rise in attrition levels. “NQT gives us scope to bring in people as and when we need so there will be no supply constraint” he said earlier this week.The war for talent has gone to a new level with skill sets like full stack developers React-Native UI/UX designers commanding a premium in the market.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZ2xhbWFkZWxhaWRlLmNvbS5hdS9nb29nbGUtam9pbnMtbG90LWZvdXJ0ZWVuLWVzdGFibGlzaGluZy1hZGVsYWlkZS1vZmZpY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google establish Adelaide base at Lot Fourteen,"Image for inspiration.

South Australia is welcoming global tech giant Google Cloud – with the organisation deciding to base their Google Cloud Public Sector presence at Adelaide’s Lot Fourteen.

This follows internationally renowned companies Accenture and Amazon also committing to South Australia.

Lot Fourteen will be a hub for Google Cloud’s Adelaide-based Public Sector team as well as a training and event venue to help its customers and partners work with their technology.

Premier Steven Marshall said it was a great accomplishment that Google Cloud has decided to invest right here in South Australia.

“This is now the third global company to choose South Australia as its home creating thousands of jobs in the high-tech digital space and defence industries.

“South Australia has world-leading capabilities in AI data analytics and cyber security that make us globally interesting and provides digital tech companies with an opportunity to come together to partner on projects that can literally change the world we live in” Premier Marshall said.

Minister for Trade and Investment Stephen Patterson said South Australia is rapidly becoming one of the best places to do business globally.

“We are building a world-class innovation ecosystem that’s underpinned by a competitive business environment that gets the fundamentals right for all businesses.

“Google Cloud joins a line-up of international hi-tech companies investing in South Australia in recent years including; Accenture Amazon Web Services and MIT.

“By working closely with industry to enhance our hi-tech capability across key sectors we are attracting the best of the best from around the world.”

The South Australian Government has been working closely with Google Cloud to showcase South Australia’s health ecosystem which includes the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI) SA Health SA NT DataLink and how the Australian Institute for Machine Learning and MIT bigdata Living Lab are collaborating within the health and medical industries.

Google Cloud’s Public Sector presence in South Australia is led by Mike Duhne who reports to Michael Grantham Director for Public Sector for Google Cloud in Australia and New Zealand.

“South Australia’s health capabilities are closely aligned with Google Cloud’s strategic priorities and the State’s commitment to the technology sector from Premier Marshall and the Department for Trade and Investment provides a unique environment for innovation and collaboration in the Technology Hub established at Lot Fourteen” Mr Grantham said.

“We look forward to working with the government other technology partners at Lot Fourteen and businesses to support South Australia’s economy.”",,,,,,

The longtime Los Altos resident founded Adobe in 1982 with a colleague from Xerox John Warnock and served in several high-profile roles until his retirement in 2000. The duo is credited with developing the Portable Document Format technology or PDFs.

“He was a famous businessman the founder of a major company in the U.S. and the world and of course he was very very proud of that and it was huge achievement in his life but it wasn’t his focus — really his family was” his wife Nancy “Nan” Geschke 78 said when reached by phone Saturday. “He always called himself the luckiest man in the world.”

The executive first came across computer science practically by accident. While teaching math at John Carroll University in the 1960s he was upset when he had to fail a master’s student out of the program Nan Geschke recalled. About a year later the student called to say he’d discovered computer programming and would love to teach Chuck Geschke the ropes — informal lessons that soon led him to pursue a PhD in the subject.

After graduating with a doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University Geschke began working at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center where he met Warnock. The duo broke out on their own in 1982 to found Adobe developing software together that helped fuel the desktop publishing revolution.

Geschke received various national recognitions for his contributions to the industry over the years including the National Medal of Technology and Innovation from President Barack Obama in 2009 an honor he shared with Warnock.

Yet he wore the mantle of success lightly recalled former San Jose mayor and businessman Tom McEnery in a phone call. McEnery likened the founder’s long-term partnership with Warnock to other famed Silicon Valley friendships such as Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.

The Adobe partners relocated their headquarters to downtown San Jose in 1996 partially wanting to put the city on the map as an important place in Silicon Valley McEnery said. They also supported the founding of the city’s Tech Museum of Innovation now called the Tech Interactive two years later.

“What he and Adobe did for San Jose — turning things that were ideas into concrete action — made Chuck Geschke just a very very good man” McEnery said.

In part because he was in his 40s when he cofounded Adobe Geschke was committed to being a dependable partner and father in spite of his workload his wife said. While employees were told they could work after dinner if they had to they were expected to first “go home to dinner with your family” she recalled.

The Geschkes suffered several traumas over the decades including the death of a fourth child at birth and Chuck Geschke’s dramatic 1992 kidnapping that made national news.

Arriving to work one morning two men seized Chuck Geschke then 52 at gunpoint and whisked him away to Hollister where he was held for four days. A suspect caught with $650000 in ransom money eventually led police to the hideout where he was held captive the AP reported at the time.

After retiring Geschke remained on the Adobe board until 2020 and otherwise dedicated himself largely to philanthropy his wife said. He also previously served on the boards for the San Francisco Symphony and the Commonwealth Club.

For fun the couple frequently golfed together in Indian Wells and Nantucket.

Despite his illustrious career Geschke always held the view that much of his success had to do with good timing and a healthy dose of luck according to his wife. More than a year of declining health made his passing Friday a blessing she added.

“He was really a humble humble man — I can say that as his wife” Nan Geschke said with a laugh. “He was very proud of his success of course but he was very circumspect about how much he had to do with that.”

In addition to his wife of 56 years Geschke is survived by three children and seven grandchildren.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvc2FsdG9zb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RyaWJ1dGVzLWZsb3ctZm9yLWFkb2Jlcy1nZXNjaGtlL2FydGljbGVfNmU1NDNiOTctOWM3OS01YTEyLWI2NTctMDk4NWI0YjZiZTRiLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tributes flow for Adobe's Geschke | News | losaltosonline.com,"Activate your all-inclusive access for print subscribers:

Charles M. “Chuck” Geschke a Los Altos resident who co-founded Adobe Systems and later was kidnapped for four days until he was freed by the FBI died on Friday at age 81.

“This is a huge loss for the entire Adobe community and the technology industry for whom he has been a guide and hero for decades” said Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen in an email to employees.

Geschke co-founded Adobe in 1982 with John Warnock a colleague from Xerox. They collaborated on Adobe PostScript a product that sparked the desktop publishing revolution.

Considered the priesthood

The son of a photo engraver Geschke grew up in Cleveland was educated in Catholic schools as a child and spent three and a half years at a Jesuit seminary studying to become a priest according to his Adobe biography. Ultimately deciding to forego the priesthood he enrolled in Xavier University where he received a bachelor’s degree in classics and a master’s degree in mathematics. He earned a Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University.

Geschke married his wife Nan in 1964. The couple had three children. They lived in Los Altos since 1972.

Geschke began his career as a scientist and researcher in the Computer Sciences Laboratory of Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center according to his biography. In 1980 he helped establish and became manager of Xerox’s Imaging Sciences Laboratory at the same location. His duties centered on overseeing and conducting research activities in the areas of computer science graphics image processing and optics.

Leaving Xerox and starting Adobe

In 1982 he and John Warnock who conducted interactive graphics research for Xerox became frustrated by the difficulty of moving their innovations and research beyond the laboratory and into production. The two decided to venture out on their own; they quit Xerox and created a new company Adobe Systems Inc. named after a creek that runs past their homes in Los Altos.

Their first product PostScript allowed for highly detailed professional documents to be sent from a personal computer to a laser printer. Within two years Geschke and Warnock reported Adobe revenues of $1.7 million.

In 1985 Apple Computer bought a 19% stake in Adobe and began packaging PostScript with its LaserWriter printer helping Apple to become the leading computer for graphic design.

In 1986 Adobe partnered with Texas Instruments to incorporate PostScript applications into its laser printers. Soon thereafter IBM licensed PostScript for its personal computers.

Adobe grew from 27 employees in 1984 to 3000 by 2001 the company said. Adobe had an IPO in 1986.

Another advance by Geschke and Warnock was the Adobe Type Library a collection of typefaces developed specifically for electronic application. Initially the Type Library offered 300 unique typefaces making it the largest collection available; the 2001 version of the Type Library (renamed as Font Folio) provided 2750 font choices according to Adobe.

Later Adobe would acquire PageMaker and PhotoShop allowing the company to sell a package of software to customers that would cover their graphic design needs.

When asked in 1995 by InformationWeek about any fear that Adobe was too heavily weighted toward the print industry Geschke replied “The move from paper-based to electronic documents doesn’t worry us. People still want authoring tools.” However in the years ahead Adobe would expand into the internet creating tools for building websites and applications.

Kidnapping

In 1992 Geschke was kidnapped at gunpoint from the Adobe parking lot in Mountain View by two men as he arrived for work. He was freed when a man caught with $650000 in ransom money led authorities to a bungalow hideout in Hollister the New York Times reported.

The two kidnappers Mouhannad Albukhari 26 of San Jose and Jack Sayeh 25 of Campbell were eventually sentenced to life terms in state prison.

Geschke served as co–chairman of the board and president of the company until 2000 when he retired as president. Geschke served as chairman of the board with Warnock from

September 1997 to January 2017 and member of the board until April 2020.

Awards and honors

In 1999 Geschke was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). In 2002 he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum. In 2006 Geschke along with Warnock received the American Electronics Association’s Medal of Achievement. In 2008 he received the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society. He also won the 2008 National Medal of Technology and Innovation awarded by President Obama. In 2010 the Marconi Society co-awarded Geschke and Warnock the Marconi Prize.

Geschke and his wife started a foundation that has been recognized for its philanthropic work. In 2012 the National Catholic Educational Association honored the couple with its St. Elizabeth Ann Seton award for its contributions to promote Catholic education. The foundation funded construction of the Geschke Learning Resource Center at the University of San Francisco.

Geschke served on the boards of the San Francisco Symphony the National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management the Commonwealth Club of California the Egan Maritime Foundation the Nantucket Boys and Girls Club and the computer science advisory board at Carnegie Mellon University.

“As much as his inventions changed the world it is his focus on people purpose and culture that has profoundly impacted each of us at Adobe” said Narayen the Adobe CEO. “As he always said Chuck wanted to create a company where he would want to work. He believed that good ideas come from everywhere in the company and that it’s not only what we do but how we do it that matters most.”

“This is a huge loss for the entire Adobe community and the technology industry for whom he has been a guide and hero for decades” Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen said in an email to Adobe employees.

”As co-founders of Adobe Chuck and John Warnock developed groundbreaking software that has revolutionized how people create and communicate” Narayen said. “Chuck instilled a relentless drive for innovation in the company resulting in some of the most transformative software inventions including the ubiquitous PDF Acrobat Illustrator Premiere Pro and Photoshop.”

Geschke earned a doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and then took a job at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center where he met Warnock. The pair left Xerox in 1982 and founded Adobe. Their first product was Adobe PostScript the programming language that helped boost the desktop publishing industry.

Geschke was chief operating officer of Adobe from December 1986 to July 1994 and president from April 1989 until his retirement in April 2000. He served as chairman of the board with Warnock from September 1997 to January 2017 and was a member of the board until April 2020 when became emeritus board member.

“I could never have imagined having a better more likable or more capable business partner” Warnock said in a statement. “Not having Chuck in our lives will leave a huge hole and those who knew him will all agree.”

In addition to his contributions to the technology industry Geschke was also known for surviving a 1992 kidnapping attempt. Two men snatched him as he arrived at work one morning and held him for four days demanding ransom. He was eventually rescued by the FBI.

President Obama awarded Warnock and Geschke the National Medal of Technology in 2009.

“He was a famous businessman the founder of a major company in the U.S. and the world and of course he was very very proud of that and it was huge achievement in his life but it wasn’t his focus — really his family was” his wife Nancy Geschke 78 told the Mercury News. “He always called himself the luckiest man in the world.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcGV0YXBpeGVsLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzE4L2ZvdW5kZXItb2YtYWRvYmUtYW5kLWRldmVsb3Blci1vZi1wZGZzLWNoYXJsZXMtZ2VzY2hrZS1kaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe Founder Charles Geschke Dies at 81,"Charles “Chuck” Geschke the co-founder of Adobe who helped with the development of the Portable Document Format or PDF died in his home of the San Francisco Bay Area suburb of Los Altos on Saturday April 17. He was 81.

According to the Associated Press Adobe’s CEO Shantanu Narayen wrote in an email to the company’s employees expressing his grief.

“This is a huge loss for the entire Adobe community and the technology industry for whom he has been a guide and hero for decades” Narayen wrote.

“As co-founders of Adobe Chuck and John Warnock developed groundbreaking software that has revolutionized how people create and communicate” Narayen said. “Their first product was Adobe PostScript an innovative technology that provided a radical new way to print text and images on paper and sparked the desktop publishing revolution. Chuck instilled a relentless drive for innovation in the company resulting in some of the most transformative software inventions including the ubiquitous PDF Acrobat Illustrator Premiere Pro and Photoshop.”

Geschke founded Adobe with fellow Xerox colleague John Warnock. The duo left Xerox Parc to create their own business after Xerox refused to commercialize a technology the two developed. That technology called PostScript is today still the graphics industry standard for printers.

“He was a famous businessman the founder of a major company in the U.S. and the world and of course he was very very proud of that and it was a huge achievement in his life but it wasn’t his focus — really his family was” his wife Nancy Geschke said to Mercury News. “He always called himself the luckiest man in the world.”

As noted in a brief history of Adobe the success of the company was at the cost of enormous risk. At the time dot-matrix printers were the norm. However that technology used printed dots to form shapes but struggled with images and typography since those shapes would always be blocky and imprecise. The next generation of printers was able to overcome this problem thanks to the PostScript code the Adobe founders created.

The founders’ lives did not become less interesting after the success of their company. The duo would go on to refuse a sale to Apple and Geschke himself survived a kidnapping and ransom attempt.

As reported by the AP in 1992 Geschke arrived at work only to be seized by two men at gunpoint who took him to Hollister California and held him for four days. A ransom was paid but the suspect was later caught with the $650000 in cash ransom who led police to the hideout where Geschke was being held. He was 52 at the time.

Geschke is survived by his wife of 56 years three children and seven grandchildren.

Damian Lewis has written a lengthy and emotional tribute to his wife Helen McCrory who has died aged 52 .

On Friday (16 April) Lewis shared a note to Twitter announcing that the Peaky Blinders star had died peacefully at home after “a heroic battle with cancer”.

Writing in The Sunday Times today Lewis who married McCrory in 2007 four years after they first met performing in a play together described the actor as “a meteor in our life”.

In the piece Lewis recalled a hilarious encounter McCrory had with the legendary actor Lauren Bacall who came backstage to see her after she starred in Uncle Vanya in New York.

Describing Bacall telling McCrory that her performance as Sonya was “magnificent” and “moved her to tears” Lewis wrote: “There was an awkward pause. ‘Oh I’m so sorry I think you want Emily next door – Emily Watson she played Sonya.’ [Lauren] was horrified: ‘Oh my god I’m so sorry!’

“Helen riposted ‘That’s alright Ms Hepburn I’m glad you enjoyed the show.’ Lauren Bacall threw her head back and laughed and bellowed ‘You’re my kind of dame let’s go out.’ And off they went into the night.”

Elsewhere in the tribute Lewis described how his wife remained a “people person” even as her illness worsened.

“I’ve never known anyone so consciously spread happiness” he wrote. “To say ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ and ‘you’re so kind’ as much as she did. Even when dying in her last few days when talking to our wonderful carers she repeatedly said ‘thank you so much’ in her half delirious state.”

The couple have two children together Manon and Gully who Lewis said have the “fearlessness wit curiosity talent and beauty” of their mother.

“As she said repeatedly to the children ‘Don’t be sad because even though I’m about to snuff it I’ve lived the life I wanted to’” he wrote.

“Only a couple of weeks ago she said to us from her bed ‘I want Daddy to have girlfriends lots of them you must all love again love isn’t possessive but you know Damian try at least to get through the funeral without snogging someone.’”

Ending his tribute Lewis wrote that McCrory had “normalised” her death.

“She’s shown no fear no bitterness no self-pity only armed us with the courage to go on and insisted that no one be sad because she is happy” he concluded. “I’m staggered by her. She’s been a meteor in our life.”

Mir a former UFC heavyweight champion and interim titleholder transitioned into the ring as a sizable underdog to a far more experienced foe in Steve Cunningham. It showed in the bout as Cunningham displayed his seasoning to get the win by unanimous decision with scores of 60-54 60-54 58-56.

The heavyweight bout was part of the Triller Fight Club main card at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The event aired on pay-per-view.

After weighing in 70 pounds heavier than Cunningham on Friday Mir attempted to put his size to use early in the fight. Cunningham was mobile though staying at range and attacking the body of Mir who whiffed on big early punches.

Mir showed more comfort as the fight wore on happily fighting from range and inside the clinch when the referee allowed it. Cunningham was a little too smooth though and retained better control and worked the body in the early and mid rounds. There were a couple thudding shots but nothing that took away the legs of either man.

As the fight went down the stretch Cunningham controlled the pace with his jab and the shots that came behind it. Mir tried to pressure from the inside but he was a little too plodding in his attacks an lacked accuracy.

In the end Cunningham controlled the overwhelming majority of the fight and was rewarded with the unanimous decision win.

In a recent Instagram video the actor shared how he injured his hamstring while filming the upcoming second season of the show sustaining a serious tear in his left hamstring during a sprint.

""My physiotherapist told me that if the tear was any more severe it would have been a rupture"" he said. ""That means that the tendon and the muscle leave the bone which would be really rather nasty.""

Cavill went into detail about the precise plan he is following to maximize his body's ability to heal starting by waking up each day between 4 and 5 a.m. for an aerobic flush session with his physiotherapist Freddie. ""That's essentially me lying on a bed with little electrical charges going through my left hamstring and him massaging both muscles just to make sure they're not too tight.""

He then demonstrated his daily recovery workout. After a gentle 10-minute warmup on the stationary bike to activate his leg muscles he performs horizontal hamstring curls designed to strengthen the bicep femoris (the point of injury) and calf raises to improve his running efficiency explosiveness and ability to change direction swiftly.

Then he moves onto cable hip flexions to increase strength in the anterior chain elevated side planks to work the hip joints and a series of dynamic stretches and drills to improve coordination and mobility. Cavill rounds out the workout with a 15-minute run and finally a sprint incrementally building speed with each session.

Why Are Americans Still at ...,"This article was produced in collaboration with Berkeley Journalism’s Investigative Reporting Program.

Brittany Liscord was at her job at the Children’s Museum & Theatre of Maine in 2018 when out of nowhere she received a warning from a colleague. It was about the massive petroleum storage tanks near her home.

“It came up that I was a runner in South Portland and I guess he had done some work in another city that had tanks” she said. “He said to me ‘You should be really concerned about the VOCs in your area.’”

Liscord went home and Googled “VOCs” while flashing back to a college introductory class on environmental science where the instructor had talked about the damage air pollutants could do to your lungs. She read that in significant amounts VOCs—volatile organic compounds—could be highly dangerous to health. Now all she could think about was the smell outside her home a noxious stench that on the worst days even made its way inside.

A company called Global Partners owned some of the tanks which stood just a tenth of a mile from where she and her husband Rob Liscord lived and held petroleum products including asphalt and a heavy fuel oil known as No. 6.

“I feel really fearful” Rob Liscord said adding that he gets headaches sometimes after he runs.

On any given day bulk storage tanks around the United States hold more than 2 billion gallons of asphalt or residual fuel much of it No. 6 according to the Energy Information Administration. Some of the tanks sit at refineries but a majority are located at terminals known as tank farms like the ones in the Liscord’s neighborhood in South Portland.

While emissions from petroleum products like gasoline or jet fuel have long been known to be dangerous and are subject to state and federal regulation asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil classified as “heavy refinery liquids” have been largely ignored by regulators because it was thought that their emissions were negligible.

But in an 18-month investigation Inside Climate News found that emissions from heated tanks containing asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil pose a risk to the health of millions of Americans who live close to the tanks one that federal and state regulators have failed to adequately address.

Changes in the petroleum refining process over the last 30 years have resulted in significant emissions from the two products when they are heated in tanks as they must be to keep their contents in liquid form. And these emissions often contain VOCs that can pose a threat to human health in some cases at levels high enough to violate federal clean air standards. The chemicals also combine with other pollutants to form ozone a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.

Yet companies that own the tanks have been routinely underreporting the extent of their emissions because instead of measuring the vapors from tanks they estimate them using a set of equations developed by the petroleum industry and approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

And those equations it turns out are often wrong.

Federal regulators and some industry insiders have known this for more than a decade but have taken no action to mandate that companies report emissions or measure them directly. As a result some states do not even require companies to track emissions from tanks containing asphalt or No. 6 and an overwhelming majority of states that do require it rely on the estimates from the petroleum industry equations.

Only when Inside Climate News began asking questions about the chemicals in the fumes in South Portland did the tanks receive wider public attention. Since then interviews with scientists regulators environmental advocates and government officials and documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act have made clear the national scope of the problem.

Tank farms line waterways across the country providing a critical stop in the distribution chain that brings the petroleum products to consumers. Owned by private companies like Global Partners they are knit into communities often just steps from neighborhoods schools and playgrounds. In South Portland the tanks sit near daycare centers and schools retirement homes and working-class neighborhoods like the one where the Liscords live.

Residents living near tanks that hold asphalt or No. 6 fuel oil have filed hundreds of complaints about noxious smells and reported symptoms—from headaches and breathing problems to cancers and other illnesses—that they worry might be connected to the tanks’ emissions.

The EPA has been aware of the flawed industry formula at least since 2007 when Global Partners disclosed as required by federal law that it had found substantially higher than expected emissions from No. 6 fuel oil tanks.

In a 2007 letter to the EPA and to environmental regulators in Massachusetts Global Partners which owns 25 tank farms around the country said that higher than expected emissions were not just the company’s problem. The higher emissions caused by the refining process changes and the inability of the formula to accurately predict emissions the company wrote were “an industry-wide issue.”

Global Partners’ letter set off an investigation by the EPA’s New England office into heated tanks owned by Global and other companies in the region and eventually led to agreements with two companies Global and Sprague Resources to make changes to address the emissions problem in several cities in the region including South Portland.

But the EPA did not direct its field offices in other parts of the country to look into heated tanks in their regions. And though the agency advised that the estimates based on petroleum industry equations should only be used if direct measurements were unavailable most companies and state regulators continue to rely on the estimates.

Not until late last year did the EPA issue an enforcement alert about the unexpected emissions levels from heated tanks and the flaws in the formula when applied to these kinds of tanks and the agency has taken no action since.

Edward Braczyk the northeast regional permit chief for the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection which worked closely with the EPA on its regional investigation said he had hoped that the agency would go on to take a far more aggressive nationwide look at heated tank emissions.

“It’s a shame” said Braczyk. “We put all this effort in trying to push EPA to do more.”

The routine underestimation of emissions some experts said is not limited to heated tanks but is a symptom of a much larger problem in which emissions from many petroleum sources are estimated rather than measured. Those estimates can be far off the mark indicating much lower—or much higher—emissions than is actually the case. In a 2006 report the Office of Inspector General of the EPA found that 62 percent of the equations used to calculate the estimates had been rated by the agency “below average” or “poor.”

“Everyone involved in the system has known about it. Has known the problems. Has known that shocking revelations are occurring” said John Walke the clean air director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “And yet we continue to live with this broken system and accept these problems these known deficiencies that are underreporting and under-controlling pollution.”

What is a Heated Tank?

Asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil are what is left once crude oil has been heated up and the high-value products like gasoline jet fuel and diesel have been removed leaving the thick sludge at the bottom of a vacuum stack. The sludge is so thick that it has to be heated to become liquid requiring special tanks for storage. And it is so deeply-refined that more volatile products are added back into the tank to make the products useful.

Inside a storage tank asphalt is frequently heated to more than 300 degrees. No. 6 is often heated to 130 degrees. In South Portland as in many ports massive tanker ships arrive with their hulls filled with the products. Pipes carry the liquids from the ships to the tanks. The tanks—typically more than three stories high and 115 feet wide—then hold the product until it’s ready to move on to the next step in the supply chain by truck or train. Historically regulators assumed that asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil products did not produce emissions of any significance just because they were so thick and depleted. The EPA which provides guidance to states on how to enforce the Clean Air Act does not even include asphalt in its handbook for estimating emissions from petroleum tanks although it does include No. 6. These assumptions have contributed to the impression in some states that asphalt and No. 6 oil do not need to be regulated according to the heads of state air agencies.

“To our knowledge the US EPA has not identified tanks storing these products as needing rules” under the Clean Air Act Doug Carr the chief of energy branch of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management air division said. “Therefore ADEM considers these tanks to be insignificant sources of air pollutants and they are not required to hold permits under our permit program.”

But as refineries have gotten better at squeezing every valuable drop out of the more profitable materials higher up in the vacuum stack the sludge at the bottom—what becomes No. 6 fuel or asphalt—has become even more depleted. And with a denser gooier product left behind refineries and terminals have mixed in additives to be able to work with it.

“Imagine you’re moving furniture on a floor and it doesn’t push really well” said John Jechura a chemical engineering professor at the Colorado School of Mines. “If you take a couple of small ball bearings and stick them under the furniture now suddenly you’re rolling.”

Additives—proprietary chemicals or lighter hydrocarbons that would normally be further refined into diesel—are small molecules that disperse among the heavy hydrocarbons that make up the asphalt or No. 6 oil. They can also drive up the vapor pressure leading to more emissions.

Both asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil have been found to produce emissions of VOCs though the emissions from No. 6 fuel oil appear to be greater.

When a team of experts studied emissions from heated tanks in Texas they discovered one reason the estimates were flawed: The vapor pressure for asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil were nearly impossible to determine because the liquids were so thick. As a result equations that estimated emissions by relying on vapor pressure—as the calculations used by most companies do—were at times off by several orders of magnitude because they relied on assumed vapor pressure values that were far too low.

A Broken System

The unexpected emissions that Global Partners discovered were a symptom of a larger problem in how air quality is regulated.

The EPA works hand-in-hand with state agencies to regulate pollutants from all sources. The EPA writes the regulations and for the most part the state agencies implement them.

“The whole giant [Clean Air Act] program as complicated as it is is designed to protect public health and the environment” said Joro Walker general counsel at Western Resource Advocates. “Because it’s so complicated the public really relies on state and federal agencies and sometimes their local air agencies to understand and enforce those requirements whether it’s in permitting or violations or whatever. We rely on those agencies to keep an eye on these facilities and make sure that they’re complying with the law.”

To do that the regulators rely largely on estimated emissions based on complex equations that take into account specifics about the emissions source.

Since 1968 the EPA has published a handbook with guidance for estimating emissions called AP-42. Today the reference document covers more than 200 different sources including heated tanks. Contained within AP-42 are the values or other equations—called emissions factors—used to calculate how much a facility might emit. States grant permits based on those calculations and companies then use the same process to estimate and report their annual emissions to the state.

For decades the EPA also offered a free software program called TANKS specifically for storage tanks that states and companies could use to make the estimates.

The handbook is intended to help regulators assess the emissions in a region not a specific location and it was based on averages not on specific sources of emissions. As a result the EPA handbook specifically states that using the emissions factors to estimate emissions from any specific source “is not recommended by EPA.” Yet across the country that is precisely how they are used.

The handbook’s chapter on storage tanks—heated and otherwise—contains an additional disclaimer: The equations in the chapter were developed by the American Petroleum Institute the largest U.S. trade association for the oil and gas industry.

“It’s in the industry’s best interest to make sure these emissions factors are low” said Ilan Levin the associate director of Environmental Integrity Project a nonprofit group that advocates for the enforcement of environmental laws which has sued the EPA over its emissions factors in the past.

Kirsten Rosselot a chemical engineer who worked on the analysis of vapor pressure and heated tank emissions said “The equations used to estimate the emissions from these tanks have never been validated. Estimates of emissions that are made using these equations don’t prove that emissions from heated tanks are below regulatory thresholds.”

In addition to the potentially flawed estimates that come from using the EPA handbook equations for specific sources TANKS the software the EPA gave to states to use does not take into account the fact that asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil have to be heated above 100°F which makes the products more volatile according to regulators in Texas and sources within the industry.

And the default values the handbook recommended for No. 6 fuel oil—and which some states and companies use for asphalt as well—were written before companies began using additives that have been found to produce higher vapor pressures.

In 2020 the EPA updated the handbook’s equations for heated tanks but it is still unclear whether they are accurate Rosselot said because of how challenging it is to find the actual vapor pressure of these products.

“Even if the equations that are used to estimate emissions work” said Rosselot “their result depends on the vapor pressure of the material being held and there is at present no commercially available way to reliably measure the vapor pressure of the material being held in heated tanks.”

What Happened in Chelsea

The waterfront in Chelsea Massachusetts is littered with oil terminals and industrial polluters. But in the 1990s there was one emissions source considered especially offensive to the city’s residents: asphalt.

Roseann Bongiovanni a lifelong resident of Chelsea said she used to roll her windows up as she drove down Marginal Street past some of the city’s massive asphalt tanks. “It was nauseating” she said. And it was worse for people who lived next door.

“I don’t think I realized what asphalt is—I mean isn’t that what’s on the ground?” said Bongiovanni who got a crash course in that as she helped the city take on the tanks as an 18-year-old freshman at Boston University. Twenty-five years later she is still fighting for clean air in Chelsea as the executive director of the nonprofit GreenRoots.

One of the tank farms in Chelsea was owned by Global Partners the same company that owns tanks in South Portland. In 1997 Global Partners sought to convert some existing tanks used for other products to asphalt and it was one straw too many for Chelsea residents. They teamed up with the city to fight back arguing successfully that the noxious smells from living close to asphalt tanks amounted to a nuisance which allowed the city’s board of health to ban new asphalt tanks from the city.

The board members knew from residents who lived near Global’s tanks that asphalt wasn’t the only problem and they next took aim at No. 6 fuel oil. Ultimately the board required Global Partners to install special equipment on its No. 6 tanks to help control the emissions.

Global opted to use a technology called carbon absorption canisters—equipment that could essentially filter out the pollutants and transfer them onto a solid surface.

“The carbon absorption canisters worked for a while then failed and were replaced and failed again” said Edmund Coletta a spokesman for the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality.

When Global sampled its emissions to figure out what was going on it discovered that the carbon was getting quickly saturated because the levels of emissions were much higher than expected. They were so high that the tank farm should have been considered a “major source” of emissions a designation that comes with heftier federal regulations and a requirement that companies use the best available technology to control their emissions.

In 2007 consultants working for Global Partners discovered that the company had received a shipment of No. 6 oil that “while meeting all of the standard specifications for No. 6 oil contained unexpectedly high levels” of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene hazardous chemicals which have a variety of health impacts.

But the company still did not know if the emissions it was measuring were from a bad batch of No. 6 fuel oil or if they represented a larger issue. According to Global’s letter to the EPA the consultants analyzed samples of No. 6 from “other available sources supplying the region” and found that the basic composition of the product they were receiving was fundamentally different from what it was in the past.

Those changes were resulting in VOC emission levels substantially higher than those predicted by AP-42 calculations” Global’s attorney wrote.

The company’s unexpected findings raised red flags with both state and federal environmental agencies. The EPA’s New England office began inquiries across the region soon after and Global began working with state regulators to find and implement an approved method for dealing with its emissions problem in Chelsea.

Ultimately Global Partners was able to install equipment to mitigate its emissions on its Chelsea tanks and avoid the financial burden of being classified as a major source of emissions. But no definitive health study was conducted to determine whether the emissions from the tanks might have harmed nearby residents.

But outside of Chelsea companies that owned heated tanks including Global Partners were still operating without emissions controls and underreporting their emissions.

An Investigation and Two Settlements

In 2010 in the wake of Global Partners’ discovery in Chelsea the EPA’s New England office sent letters to seven companies in the region asking questions about their heated tanks and informing them that the EPA was investigating whether the companies had violated the Clean Air Act.

Two companies Gulf and Motiva responded that they did not own any heated tanks.

But Global Partners and Sprague which did own heated tanks were asked by the federal agency to measure the actual emissions from the tanks.

The findings were surprising. At Sprague’s terminal in Searsport Maine emissions testing on one of the company’s No. 6 fuel oil tanks discovered emissions that were 500 times what the company had been reporting.

The emissions were still below a federal pollution threshold that would have required additional regulation. But the violations underscored what had been found in Chelsea: Chemicals that could have an impact on public health were being emitted without mitigation or acknowledgement by the company or the regulators.

Both companies contested the method the EPA required for sampling their tank emissions saying it falsely inflated the emissions but the EPA stood by its methodology.

“To my knowledge this is the only time that emissions from heated tanks were directly measured and made publicly available” said Rosselot. And the measurements in Maine she said may provide the only existing data about what the heated tanks that store asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil across the country are emitting.

Elizabeth Hernberg Sprague’s then-managing director for health safety and environment wrote in a 2012 letter to the EPA “The science of estimating #6 oil emissions has up until now been a theoretical approach.” Because of the actions of the EPA’s New England office she wrote “the bulk storage industry is becoming aware of the inconsistencies with TANKS and the #6 oil operating conditions and like Sprague is eager to find a better approach at estimating emissions … The industry nationally faces the same dilemma with potentially much greater significance at the much larger facilities in other parts of the country.”

The results were similar at Global Partners’ terminal in South Portland where the EPA-ordered testing revealed that the potential emissions from the No. 6 fuel oil and asphalt operations there alone exceeded 40 tons per year violating the Clean Air Act and putting the terminal over the threshold for being a major source of emissions that would fall under stricter regulations.

Both Global and Sprague also had been asked by the EPA to hire labs to determine the actual vapor pressure of their products. The sample of No. 6 fuel oil sent to the laboratory by Sprague was found to have a vapor pressure of 0.0083 psi—200 times higher than the default value the petroleum industry included in the EPA handbook at the time and four times higher than an updated figure the manual now includes. Because of the direct relationship between vapor pressure and emissions this was further evidence that the method being used to estimate emissions was inherently flawed.

As the EPA continued its investigation Maine’s state environmental agency in charge of regulating the facilities did little in response to the federal agency’s inquiry. In an October 2015 letter Susan Studlien then-director of the office of environmental stewardship at the EPA’s New England field office wrote to the state’s then-director of the bureau of air quality to express her concern about amendments to Sprague’s permit that had been approved by the state agency.

“I write to inform you of EPA’s view that the license amendments (of which EPA was unaware until after their issuance) fail to correct the underlying violations cited in the NOVs” she wrote referring to the citations or “notices of violation” the company had received. The company Studlien wrote should be using emissions controls on its heated tanks across New England.

In her letter Studlien said she was concerned that the state environmental department was not considering known technology fixes to reduce emissions specifically the technology used by Global Partners on its tanks in Chelsea. But since the EPA did not require companies to install such technology the agency could not force the companies to make the change.

As the years passed a new complication arose according to Braczyk from the Massachusetts DEP who was collaborating with the EPA. “When the Trump administration came in a lot of things just kind of froze” he said.

Processes that typically took weeks or a month took a year instead. “Everything had to get reviewed through the Department of Justice” Braczyk said. “And that’s where everything kind of stalled.”

In 2019 nearly a decade after beginning its investigation the EPA announced a proposed legal settlement with Global Partners. The agency cited Global for Clean Air Act violations at its facility near the Liscords’ home. According to the EPA the company’s asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil operations could have been emitting twice the level of VOCs that its permit allowed a problem that the EPA said went back about a decade.

Global Partners agreed that it would restrict how often its heated tanks ran and how much product they carried that it would add control technology to reduce the emissions and pay $190000 in fines.

“We strive to be good neighbors in all the communities we operate while we deliver the essential energy and products that families businesses and economies need for daily life” said Liz Fuller a spokeswoman for Global Partners. “Safety is the top priority and we operate our facilities under strict oversight from federal and state regulators.

On May 29 2020 the EPA and the state of Massachusetts announced a legal settlement with Sprague over its asphalt and No. 6 operations in Searsport and South Portland Maine; Newington New Hampshire; Everett and Quincy Massachusetts; and Providence Rhode Island. The company was cited for violating the federally enforced state requirements for VOCs and ordered to limit how many heated tanks it could operate and how much product could be processed at each facility to keep the company within its operating permit limits.

“The Consent Decree is now finalized and subject to coming to a consensus with the town and DEP we will obtain any necessary permits construct the approved solution and build a timeline for implementation” said Shana Hoch Sprague’s Managing Director Marketing & Customer Experience.

A Half-Hearted Pursuit

As EPA’s New England office investigated emissions at tank terminals around the region the office provided updates to the federal agency’s headquarters in Washington according to Dave Deegan a spokesman for the regional office. But it is unclear how far the EPA has pursued the issue in other parts of the country.

In response to questions an EPA spokeswoman said that in addition to the investigation of Global and Sprague in New England it has in progress “initial investigations of other sources.” The spokeswoman did not elaborate on where those cases were but Freedom of Information Act requests filed with the agency indicated that only two of the nine other EPA regional offices had taken any actions related to heated tanks.

In July 2019 inspectors in the Great Lakes regional office made an unannounced inspection at the Waterfront Petroleum Terminal in Detroit which had four heated tanks containing asphalt and five tanks containing No. 6 fuel oil. Using an infrared camera inspectors observed unexpected levels of VOCs being emitted from the vents of one asphalt tank and one No. 6 fuel oil tank. A spokesman for the regional office did not respond to questions about whether the agency took any punitive action or if the investigation was ongoing.

In EPA’s south central region investigators requested information from and visited the Houston Fuel Oil Terminal in 2015 which owned 128 tanks along the Houston Ship Channel some of which contained No. 6 fuel oil. The investigators found elevated levels of VOCs coming from the tanks. “We would not expect to see VOC emissions coming from a tank containing low vapor pressure liquids that is not in the process of filling” inspectors wrote in a 2015 report. More than five years later according to the EPA the investigation is ongoing.

In November 2020 after the legal settlements with Global Partners and Sprague the EPA published an enforcement alert titled “EPA Reminder About Inappropriate Use of AP-42 Emissions Factors” acknowledging what the agency had found in Maine and other states in its New England region.

In a four page memo the EPA reiterated its warning that the standard method for estimating heated tanks emissions—the petroleum industry’s equations included in the EPA manual—should not be used for specific sites.

The emissions and vapor pressure testing conducted in Maine in 2012 and 2013 the agency wrote “suggested that in those cases the use of the default vapor pressure in [the manual] had resulted in emissions estimates that were understated by a factor of 100 for permitting and reporting purposes.”

The memo went on to recommend a series of steps a company could take to ensure accurate emissions reporting including continuous emissions monitoring and the use of infrared cameras. In a list descending from most to least accurate the petroleum industry emissions estimation method in the manual was at the bottom.

“Remember AP-42 emission factors should only be used as a last resort” the memo said in bold font referring to the EPA manual adding “Even then the facility assumes all risk associated with their use!”

But the EPA still did not ban the use of the estimation method and not surprisingly given the costs of direct testing and measurement companies—and most states—have continued to use it.

A Patchwork of Regulations

When Inside Climate News surveyed regulators from air quality agencies in all 50 states a majority said that they relied on the industry equations included in the manual for estimating emissions and did not use direct site-specific measurements. Many also said they used the EPA TANKS program to calculate emissions from tanks containing asphalt or No. 6 fuel oil a method that cannot accurately estimate heated tank emissions.

In Arkansas for instance the communications manager for the state Department of Energy and Environment said they used the TANKS program because it “accounts for heated tanks.” But even the EPA—the creator of TANKS—has said that the program does not provide accurate estimates. The federal agency stopped updating the software in 2014 after finding that it was flawed.

Some states like Connecticut said that they did not even keep track of where tanks containing asphalt and No. 6 fuel were located because they assumed the emissions were negligible. “We have very little information on where a No. 6 oil tank would be located because historically the emissions were presumed to be so low as to not trigger any of our registration or permitting processes which would cause us to follow or track their emissions” said Jaimeson Sinclair the director of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection’s engineering section.

And while technology exists that could reduce the emission of VOCs—perhaps by as much as 99 percent—a recent review by the state of Maine found “the majority of tanks of this type being operated in the United States do not utilize any type of add-on control equipment to reduce emissions.”

In a few states though regulators have taken a keen interest in heated storage tanks.

In Texas for example state regulators in the early 2000s launched investigations into what’s known as the emissions gap—the difference between the amount of VOCs they expected based on known sources and the amount they found when they sampled the air. That allowed the regulators to pinpoint problems—flaring for instance—and try to close the gap. But even after resolving those problems a gap remained.

The Texas regulators suspected a possible reason for the discrepancy: The faulty assumptions about heated tanks and the vapor pressure of their products. They hired a team of researchers from the University of Texas including Rosselot to study the issue and in studies published in 2014 and 2015 they affirmed that emissions from heated tanks were almost certainly being undercounted and that the tanks were likely contributing to the emissions gap.

Russ Nettles a technical specialist with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality took particular interest in the issue. Nettles who died in 2017 began sounding an alarm about emissions from heated tanks at EPA conferences and in national industry workshops held in Texas. Emissions from heated tanks were being under-counted he said and the tools being used to estimate them—the petroleum industry equations in the EPA manual and the TANKS program—were wrong.

Nettles’ efforts resulted in some changes in Texas including the state dropping the use of the TANKS program and stressing that companies should test for the true vapor pressure of their products rather than using default values when possible. But the guidance echoed that of the EPA in saying that when site-specific monitoring was not available companies could use the petroleum industry equations in the agency’s manual to estimate emissions instead.

Asked about the continued use of the petroleum industry formula in most states the EPA spokeswoman said “We would recommend that States consider requiring testing to obtain more accurate emissions factors given that the Sprague and Global matters suggest the emission factors are not accurate.”

Is Our Health at Risk?

With few actual measurements of what is being emitted from the tanks residents who live near heated tanks like the Liscords in communities like South Portland are left wondering whether it is safe to breathe the air around them.

“People who live work and play downwind of heated tanks holding heavy refinery liquids are right to be concerned about the potential health effects of their exposure to the emissions from these tanks” said Rosselot who was among the team of experts who studied heated tank emissions in Texas at the request of state regulators.

While it has long been known that volatile organic chemicals like benzene and toluene in significant amounts can have serious health impacts virtually no research exists on the possible effects on human health of the VOCs emitted by heated tanks and the few studies that have been conducted have not been without controversy.

In 2007 for example the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) issued a report on health risks from asphalt emissions in response to years of complaints from communities across the country that were exposed to asphalt fumes.

The agency’s investigations primarily focused on asphalt plants in Arizona California Georgia New York North Carolina and Utah in the years from 1998 to 2004 but in one location—Salisbury North Carolina—the researchers looked at a tank farm. The terminal in Salisbury had been a source of hundreds of odor complaints from 1997 to 2001 from residents living near the tank farm and an asphalt plant and the state and county health agencies cited a high incidence of serious health problems in nearby residents and workers.

The agency investigators evaluated samples of tank emissions taken over the course of four months six years earlier in 2001. The study’s authors found that the chemicals contained in asphalt emissions from the tank did not exceed federal safety levels and did not pose a threat to public health. But the investigation was conducted after Associated Asphalt the company that owned the tanks had already installed technology to mitigate emissions.

Given the limited nature of the samples and the fact that the company had taken steps to control emissions the study’s findings did not instill much confidence in residents there.

No other direct study of the effect of emissions from heated asphalt tanks could be located but a handful of studies from federal agencies have looked at how workers who were exposed to asphalt fumes through their jobs were affected. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration lists headache skin rash sensitization fatigue reduced appetite throat and eye irritation cough and skin cancer as symptoms of asphalt exposure on its website.

When the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked into occupational exposure to asphalt in 2000 the study’s authors found that complaints of eye nose and throat irritation were common among workers who performed different kinds of jobs using asphalt including road paving shingle manufacturing and work at hot-mix plants and terminals. Some workers also reported skin irritation nausea headaches and fatigue. These reactions were found in workers whose exposure was below OSHA’s allowable limits. Some studies indicated elevated rates of lung bladder kidney brain and liver cancer among workers but the researchers were unable to draw a direct causal relationship.

The asphalt plant workers in the study were likely to have been exposed to higher levels of fumes than people who live near heated asphalt tanks. But the workers also went home at the end of the day while for residents who live near tanks the fumes are constant.

A subset of VOCs called Hazardous Air Pollutants or HAPs have been linked with symptoms like headaches and breathing problems in the short-term and some cancers and neurological problems in the long-term.

Exposure to high levels of the HAP benzene for example has been linked to acute myeloid leukemia and women who were exposed to high levels for an extended period had irregular menstrual periods and decreased ovary size. An acute exposure to benzene at very high levels can be fatal.

“Benzene is a known carcinogen thus there is no safe dose” said Joan Casey an environmental epidemiologist at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health.

But different states have different bars for what exposure level is considered acceptable.

The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention sets the bar for benzene at 0.4 parts per billion. At that level of ambient exposure there is an incremental lifetime cancer risk of 1-in-100000 over what would normally occur in the general population according to the state. In Massachusetts the allowable ambient exposure limit is much lower—0.03 parts per billion—a level associated with an incremental lifetime cancer risk of 1-in-1000000.

In South Portland Unsettled Questions

The Liscords considered buying a few different houses before they landed on the white craftsman style home on Reynolds Street in South Portland. It felt just right: It had an ideal layout it would be easy to make energy-efficient and it was on a street with friendly neighbors who said it was a good place to raise kids.

But that was before they knew about the smell. Once they moved in it was unavoidable on many days. When the EPA’s settlement with Global Partners—and later with Sprague—was announced their fears only grew.

The idea that Global’s tank emissions were so high in a place surrounded by tightly-knit neighborhoods came as a shock. That the EPA had been investigating this for nearly a decade without notifying residents only deepened the concern.

And though the EPA had determined what was being emitted by the tanks it did not study how those emissions might be affecting people who lived or worked or went to school near them. That work was left up to the state.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has had a network of monitors studying the air near the South Portland tanks since November 2019 and has found levels of naphthalene—a VOC that can cause respiratory and neurological problems—2.5 times the ambient exposure limit set by the state. But residents say the monitors are too far from the tanks to truly reflect what is coming from them and the state appears to agree—after more than a year of monitoring it has plans to move four of the monitors closer to the tanks.

There is reason to believe those monitors will find higher levels of VOCs. After the agreement between the EPA and Global Partners was announced in 2019 the state supplied air canisters to volunteers in South Portland who took samples of the air that were then analyzed in a state lab. Though not a rigorous scientific study the grab samples taken outside homes near the tanks found spikes of benzene as high as 5.8 and 8 times the state’s ambient air guidelines.

When Maine’s state toxicologist Andy Smith presented the initial findings at a City Council meeting in December 2019 he noted that the spikes found in the citizen-led samples did not rise above the acute risk threshold for the state meaning that a short exposure at that level would not be expected to have health impacts.

The International Liquid Terminals Association the trade association for tank terminals has downplayed the findings in the grab samples. “It’s unlikely that the storage tanks at terminals are a significant source of naphthalene emissions” said spokeswoman Cathy Landry. “Most airborne emissions of naphthalene result from the combustion (not storage) of petroleum products.” She also pointed to a statement from Maine regulators indicating that it’s not appropriate to use grab sample data to extrapolate about longer term levels.

Residents like the Liscords though worried that the spikes found in the citizen-led samples represented what they were breathing all day every day.

Daycare owners Gina Kostopoulos and Annmarie Marshall were concerned that the emissions might explain the headaches staff workers complained about on days when the air was thick with petroleum smells. And across a small cove from Global’s tanks Barbara Saulle wondered whether the fumes that regularly filled her home could have caused her miscarriages her migraines or two sons’ inexplicable liver disorders.

In community meetings over the last year and a half—held in person or and more recently virtually—residents have pressured state regulators to require more monitoring including 24/7 fenceline monitoring around the emissions sources and the use of more technology to control the emissions.

South Portland residents said that as a result of the settlements with both companies they have some reasons to celebrate including the pending installation of emissions control technology at Global Partners and Sprague facilities new state recommendations related to the use of infrared cameras to detect vapor leaks and emissions testing for new and modified heated tanks.

But unlike Massachusetts which now bans the use of the petroleum industry equations in estimating storage tank emissions Maine continues to allow it. A recent state report recommended against the use of continuous monitoring at the tanks or monitoring along the perimeter of the facilities also known as fenceline monitoring.

The Liscords say they want to stay in their home in South Portland but as they think about having kids they’re not sure it’s safe for them to stay there. They’re not sure they can go either.

“If we move someone else is going to live in this house” said Brittany Liscord. “The reality is people still live here.”

At its regular meeting Monday April 5 Council considered legislation that imposes new fees requirements and potential penalties for those renting out their rooms apartments or homes for short-term stays.

Although Planning Commission is separately considering steps to slow the proliferation of some types of transient guest lodging establishments or TGLs Council took the steps as part of its taxing authority.

Council’s goal is specifically to deter new TGLs that are run by those who do not live on the property Council members stated.

The move comes after Council members raised concerns that TGLs may negatively impact neighborhood cohesion reduce the availability of long-term rentals attract outside investors with no local ties and drive up real estate prices.

At the meeting Council Vice President Marianne MacQueen shared her worries about the effect of non-owner occupied TGLs on affordable housing.

“I would like to state emphatically that I think this could be a very serious problem because of our values [and] because of our need to house people who live here or want to live here” MacQueen said.

MacQueen added that she hopes Planning Commission also looks at how the zoning code could be strengthened to deter Airbnbs where people don’t live.

“That is what kills a neighborhood I think” MacQueen said.

There are currently 48 TGLs in the village 13 of which are non-owner occupied according to a Village presentation. Five of those are commercial establishments (Mills Park Hotel two Jailhouse Suites locations Morgan House B&B and Glen Helen Outdoor Education Center).

Last month alone Planning Commission granted two new permits for TGLs where the owner did not live at the property.

According to the draft legislation those wanting to run an Airbnb would have to receive a certificate to operate from the Village and pay an annual fee. The fee is $100 for those running a hotel or bed and breakfast or who operate their TGL where they live but jumps to $500 for those who live elsewhere.

The legislation also steps up enforcement mechanisms for TGLs that run afoul of local regulations. It imposes penalties on those who don’t pay the Village’s lodging tax who discriminate against renters or commit other violations. Those individuals may be fined cited have their identity shared publicly or have their permit revoked.

There are currently eight local TGL operators who have never reported income including five that are “active permits” according to Village Manager Josué Salmerón who said “fines and citations are forthcoming.”

With the finance director and YS Police Chief Salmerón is “working on pursuing actions on those individuals” he added. The Village has already subpoenaed evidence from Airbnb and other sources he said.

It was the first reading of the legislation. A second reading and public hearing is scheduled for the next Council meeting on April 19.

New TGL operators already have to apply for a conditional use permit and appear before Planning Commission before they open among other steps. Those measures were added in mid-2019 and did slow the growth of TGLs in town Village Planning and Zoning Coordinator Denise Swinger reported.

During the discussion Council members asked numerous questions of Village Solicitor Breanne Parcels about which restrictions would be legally possible.

For instance Parcels argued that the Village cannot ban all TGLs run by someone who does not live at the property as that could be considered a constitutional violation for “de facto taking.”

“You would probably be drawing a constitutional lawsuit” Parcels said. However she added the Village can “disincentivize” such rentals rather than disallow them in part through higher fees.

Council President Brian Housh said he wanted “to look at all strategies that will pass legal muster.”

Other restrictions that Council is considering include limiting the number of TGLs in a neighborhood limiting the number of days annually that a TGL can be rented out or limiting the number of TGLs on a single property to only one.

Not discussed was banning new TGLs entirely as some residents rent out rooms or apartments at their property in order to afford to live here Council members explained.

Parcels also summarized the detrimental impact that TGLs can have on local real estate.

“The affordability issue that has come up is a property owner can make more money renting out their property short-term versus to a long-term tenant” she explained. “That would take it out of the rental market driving up prices for the long-term rental market.”

The issue of short-term rentals came to the fore in 2017 when the Village passed a 3% lodging tax on all stays whether at an official hotel or residential guest house/room. At that time TGLs were changed in the zoning code from a conditional to a permitted use.

After Council again made them a conditional use in July 2019 the number of new applications dropped significantly. Of the 57 total permits issued only seven have been issued since then. But they are picking up again as four have been issued since the start of 2021.

Planning Commission steps

Planning Commission is also wrestling with TGL concerns and later this month the body will begin discussing new changes to the zoning code for Council to consider.

The issues arose as the commission considered two new conditional use applications for TGLs at its March 9 regular meeting.

In one case a couple who lives part-time in the village were seeking a second TGL for their duplex at 131 W. North College St. Mark Davenport of Columbus and Huan Li of Centerville already run a TGL in a second apartment at the property. They used to rent out the other apartment to a long-term tenant until the tenant’s passing Davenport explained.

Planning Commission member Matthew Kirk said he was concerned about approving the permit pointing out that while some TGLs are “additive” this one was “detracting from the existing housing stock” by removing an existing long-term rental unit.

“It’s hard to see how if we approve something like this what kind of precedent we are setting” he said. “Next month we could have five people who are existing landlords say ‘I don’t want to rent out long term anymore.’”

Davenport said he and Li applied for a second TGL because the first one was so popular it was always booked and they wanted to spend more time in town by staying in the second.

“We do view it as our second home” he said adding “We love Yellow Springs.”

The commission went on to weigh how or even whether it could deny the permit based on the fact that the property was not the owner’s primary residence.

But Solicitor Parcels told them they could not.

“You have to apply the code as it stands” she said. “Council has expressed a trend toward not allowing non-owner occupied households but as the code stands now there is nothing restricting or prohibiting that.”

Parcels added that there could be “grounds for denial” but did not specify what those might be.

An earlier motion to table the matter by Council member Laura Curliss Council’s liaison to Planning Commission did not pass after a 2–2 vote. Curliss said she wanted to delay the matter until after Council considered new legislation regarding TGLs.

Curliss argued that “the spirit of allowing TGLs” was so village residents could make some extra money due to the town’s high taxes but that in this case it’s more like a business and harms neighborhood cohesion.

“This community tries really hard and puts a lot of resources into trying to create housing for folks to actually live here full-time whether that’s rental or owner-

occupied” she said.

Fellow commission member Sarah Amend agreed with Curliss’ motion to table also highlighting negative impacts on neighborhoods.

“No one even locally right there in the neighborhood knows who is coming in and out if there is a problem” she said.

But Planning Commission Chair Frank Doden and member Steven Green voted against the motion to table. Kirk had earlier recused himself because he runs a TGL at a property he owns in the village. The conditional use later passed in a 3–1 vote with only Curliss dissenting.

At the same meeting Planning Commission approved another non-owner occupied TGL. Danyel Mershon who owns Wildflower Boutique downtown applied for a TGL at her property at 104 W. Limestone St. her former home.

The entire house which has four to five bedrooms will be rented out with a minimum three-night stay for up to 10 guests and might be ideal for yoga retreats and other groups Mershon said. She added that she plans to live there part-time and that the village is her primary residence.

Planning Commission members were more sympathetic to Mershon’s application as the house is located at the edge of the central business district and directly between the local hotel and the Morgan House B&B and would likely not be an affordable option if it were put up for sale they said. The final vote was 4–0.

Earlier this year Planning Commision approved two other TGL conditional use permits to Gavin Leonard for a TGL in a new accessory dwelling unit he built at the rear of his property at 143 Limestone St. and to Alex Melamed for a TGL in an accessory dwelling unit behind his home at 205 N. Walnut St.

Conflicts of interest?

Potential conflicts of interest were part of the discussions of TGLs at both Council and Planning Commission.

At the March meeting Planning Commission member Kirk recused himself from the discussion and vote after Solicitor Parcels advised him to do so since he runs a TGL. Parcels said that Kirk could benefit from denying a permit to a potential competitor.

“As far as a potential competitor he would recuse” Parcels said.

But Curliss did not recuse herself from discussions at either Planning Commission or Council. Curliss disclosed that she does have a TGL permit at her property but said she did not have any immediate intentions of renting out the apartment for short-term stays.

Curliss said it does not constitute a conflict “just because I own a non-functioning rental permit that I am making no money on it that I may use it as a TGL.” She added that her reading of Ohio law was that a conflict arose when there was a “direct pecuniary gain” not gain that is “speculative” or “indirect and remote.”

Parcels however disagreed with Curliss’ interpretation.

“If you have a TGL or have a property that qualifies as a TGL anything you do that could adversely affect a competitor due to the narrowing of the market” is a conflict she said.

Council member MacQueen formerly ran a TGL at her property but no longer does so she confirmed in an email to the News this week.

Teddy Ballgame is about to become Teddy Blockchain.

Hall of Famer Ted Williams is coming to the digital memorabilia market with a release of nine different cards that follow the No. 9’s career from skinny rookie to Cooperstown inductee. The collectors' items offered by Williams' daughter are hand drawn by Brazilian illustrator Andre Maciel known as Black Madre who created the non-fungible tokens for football star Rob Gronkowski that sold out last month for $1.6 million.

“I wrote to him. I told him who I was. I said ‘My dad is Ted Williams.’ I said ‘Here’s what I want to do’” Claudia Williams said adding that she didn't know whether Maciel would be familiar with the baseball star.

“For all he knows I’m just some person reaching out saying ‘Hey could you make me some NFTs?’” she said. “Just the respect that he showed the art I know that he knows who Ted Williams is.”

Eight cards come in limited editions numbered 1-9 with the ninth — titled “The Splendid Splinter” — a one-of-a-kind release that comes with an autographed bat three autographed pictures and an Airbnb stay at a house Williams lived in in Vermont Each of the 73 cards include the digital autograph of the Red Sox slugger who remains the last major leaguer to bat .400 hitting .406 in 1941.

The collection also recognizes Williams’ achievements as a fishing hall of famer and a fighter pilot who missed parts of five seasons to serve in WWII and the Korean War. Claudia Williams wrote the text on the back of each card.

The auction begins Monday and runs through Saturday.

“My life’s goal is to keep my dad as relevant and inspirational as ever"" Claudia Williams said last week in a telephone interview from her Florida home. ""I want to leave his legacy behind when his last surviving child is gone.”

Non-fungible tokens can be works of art video clips or even tweets or news articles tied to a digital record — or blockchain — that allows the collector to prove ownership. The NBA has gotten into NFTs by creating a market called Top Shot which has more than 800000 users and at least $500 million in sales.

Williams said if the auction is successful she will donate some of the proceeds to the Jimmy Fund a children's cancer charity that has been a favorite of the Red Sox since her father's playing days.

“It's all about inspiration and honoring my dad” she said. “I am very much my father’s daughter: I do not do squat if I don’t feel passionate about it.""

Williams played 19 years — all for the Red Sox — missing time for the two wars before retiring at the age of 41 in 1960 with a .344 average 521 home runs and 1839 RBIs. He was a 19-time All-Star two-time AL MVP and two-time triple crown winner.

Williams was also a notorious curmudgeon who derided reporters as “Knights of the Keyboard” and refused to tip his cap to the fans. But he was one of the few white players to argue for Negro Leagues players to be included in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Claudia Williams said her father might not have been an early adopter on NFTs but he encouraged his children to keep up on the latest technology. His book “The Science of Hitting” was ahead of its time. (Williams who died in 2002 has been frozen in liquid nitrogen at an Arizona cryonics facility in the hopes that medical advances will someday allow him to be brought back to life.)

“Daddy was so about cutting edge” she said. “When he learned about something new he embraced it. He might say “... I don’t know the first thing about this NFT but I think it’s great.' But he would learn about it and he would love it.”

Or follow us on Google News

Following the release of Tesla’s 1st quarter production and delivery numbers I wanted to take a closer look at Tesla’s long-term delivery trends. To make it a little more fun though I’m going out on a thin limb and also creating charts forecasting quarterly Tesla deliveries for the remainder of the year. Have a look and tell me where why and how I look like an idiot. (Also feel free to insert your own figures or charts in the comments below the article!)

I’ll start with the simplest topic — quarterly Tesla deliveries of all models combined. Then I’ll jump to quarterly deliveries of the Tesla Model 3 + Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model S + Tesla Model X which is what Tesla reports each quarter. Lastly I venture into the game of “choose your own noose” and split out delivery estimates for each of the 4 models.

Interactive charts are included on the bottom of the article. They are much better for viewing if you are not on a phone.

Clearly Tesla has had a strong rise in quarterly deliveries from 2013 to 2021. The past two quarters have been tremendous for Tesla and many thought Tesla could never reach this height. If you double Tesla’s Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 numbers to make a full-year estimate you get annual sales of 730740. Many people following Tesla’s story for the past decade (dare I say most?) thought that Tesla could never produce and deliver 500000 vehicles a year. The past few quarters have been the great vindication those of us who did believe in Elon Musk and Tesla have long been waiting for.

Though putting those numbers on the same scale as the following chart (as I did) you can tell that there’s also a lot of room for improvement. I expect that we will see enough improvement in the coming few quarters to fill out that space. Here’s my forecast which I have to say is powered in part by Rodney Hooper telling me in a podcast recording on Friday (which we’ll publish soon) that he sees Tesla reaching 900000 deliveries in 2021:

Naturally this is what the experts call a WAG (wild-ass guess) but my forecast for the next few quarters is: 210000 deliveries in Q2 2021 240000 deliveries in Q3 2021 and 275400 deliveries in Q4 2021.

The chart looks logical and the quarterly numbers rise as Tesla’s production capacity rises. I’m not going into the 1 million vehicle territory that I know some people are expecting. Others I’m sure expect no more than 700000 deliveries. We’ll see.

You can view specific quarterly figures in the interactive charts on the bottom.

Looking at the model split Tesla has published you may notice a trend.

Yes the mass-market models are booming. Meanwhile Model S and X production was at zero in the 1st quarter leading to lower-than-low deliveries.

I expect a Model S and X rebound of course but I don’t expect huge production capacity for these models and basically just forecasted a return to pre-collapse numbers as production capacity slowly ramps up.

Tesla’s focus will be on increasing production capacity of its physically smaller sales behemoths especially the Model Y.

The Model Y was the climber of the quarter last quarter — actually the only model that had its deliveries climb. It’s clearly trying to sprout to the Model 3’s level. And that shouldn’t take too long.

For various reasons I expect the Model Y to be in greater demand long term than the Model 3 — perhaps significantly greater demand. I also expect it to ramp to the Model 3’s current level faster than it took the Model 3 to ramp there. Approximately 75% of their parts are shared yet the Model Y offers more space and a higher seating position which people love. As Model Y production capacity ramps up in China especially I expect we’ll just see that model climb and climb and climb throughout the year.

After 2021 well we’ll see. We’ve got Giga Berlin and Giga Texas going online. The Cybertruck should be coming to market. Tesla should be able to toggle between Model 3 and Model Y production more as overall production capacity ramps and it sees where there’s more need.

Here are bar charts showing the same numbers in a different way but I’m only including the interactive ones (also note that these are not fixed-scale charts unlike the ones above):

Here’s the remainder of the interactive charts (versions of the static charts shared higher up):

The end.

Or follow us on Google News

Tesla has produced well over a million cars. Some of those cars get into accidents. As it turns out a much smaller percentage of them get into accidents each year than cars in the overall US fleet do. Though without a doubt the attention Tesla accidents get from national and international press is orders of magnitude higher than the attention given to accidents from any other brand vehicle. I’ll come back to the misinformation swirling around the latest accident in a moment. First though I want to try to explain something that somehow goes over the heads of so many Tesla critics.

The daily calls to ban Tesla Autopilot are mind-bogglingly stupid. Tesla Autopilot is essentially just an advanced version of cruise control. Old-school cruise control let you set a speed and drive that speed without putting your food on the pedal. Cool stuff. As tech in this realm improved and evolved we also got adaptive cruise control — which would slow down the car if cars in front of it slowed down. Cool beans. Then leaders in the market started implementing systems that would also keep the car in the lane. (Though many early versions ended up ping ponging the car from one lane marking to the other and back so much that the systems were more annoying than useful.)

What does Tesla Autopilot do now? For the hundreds of thousands of owners who bought an advanced Autopilot package you get a superb version of everything above (no ping-ponging) as well as the ability to initiate automatic lane changes and have the car automatically go from on-ramp to off-ramp on the Interstate — with your supervision. Tesla Autopilot is just another step forward in this long evolution of driver-assist technology and I have never met a Tesla driver who thought otherwise.

The current advanced-Autopilot package is called “Full Self-Driving” because firmware updates are expected to eventually create a system that can fully drive the car without human intervention from any Point A to any Point B. No new hardware is supposed to be needed just firmware updates. I’m quite certain everyone who owns a Tesla knows that the car cannot drive itself from Point A to Point B without human supervision — and even everyone who doesn’t have a Tesla should know that too imho). Also there is no button to turn on “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) in the car. I have the FSD package but if I want to use any of the driver-assist (advanced cruise control) features I have to initiate “Autopilot” — it is the name of the in-car application.

So let me just reiterate this: Tesla Autopilot is simply an advanced version of old-school cruise control — and I think that everyone driving a Tesla is aware of this.

Somehow despite this fact some people think Tesla shouldn’t be allowed to include automated driving features in its cars. (Only other brands should be allowed to include such features — inferior versions of them — in their cars.) Unfortunately it’s not just wackadoodles making this argument. Actually serious (and verified!) business and transportation journalists are!

Whether NHTSA gets tough on Tesla's marketing and use of automated systems which NTSB has said is dangerous remains one of the biggest questions hanging over Bidens DOT https://t.co/uxc7VW3ld2 — Sam Mintz (@samjmintz) April 18 2021

Goodness gracious. This brings such a bad look to such an important profession. Democracy dies without good journalism and the field has been under enormous attack in the past several years weakening one of the bedrocks of US democracy but it’s a special kind of shame to see people in the field hurting the profession’s reputation by making illogical arguments.

Aside from everything I wrote above the big hubbub about this unfortunately deadly accident in Spring Texas seems to be a bit misinformed. Apparently this accident happened on an unmarked residential street. You cannot turn Autopilot on on an unmarked residential street. It will chime very loudly at you and tell you that you can’t turn on Autopilot. I just confirmed this again myself on a residential road on the way to the grocery store where the car showed that it could identify where the center of the road was but would not turn on Autopilot because of a lack of lane markings. Tesla owner Alan Dail explains it well:

And here’s a video demonstration of the point:

No lane lines no Autopilot. It’s that simple. It can continue it the lane lines get faded or disappear yes. But it won’t turn on. @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/1oydg3t1wR — Whole Mars Catalog (@WholeMarsBlog) April 18 2021

Edit/update: Yes there are instances where you can get Autopilot to engage if it is tricked into thinking something is a lane marking. That’s extra unlikely at night due to worse visibility but it is technically possible. If someone was really gung-ho about tricking the car for example they could draw lane markings on a street with chalk. Again this seems highly unlikely in this scenario unless the people involved were dedicated to tricking the car in multiple ways.

Also noteworthy:

https://twitter.com/TeslaFruit/status/1383959800107524096

So yes it’s unfortunate that two men died in a Tesla on a residential street after a seemingly horrible accident but it had no connection to Autopilot or the FSD Beta that very few people have access to. More likely than not the driver decided to accelerate at a dangerous level and drove off the road very quickly into a tree. As sad as that is it happens with all kinds of vehicles every day in rather large volumes. Even more so guys driving performance cars have a higher tendency to do this.

Why wasn’t someone in the driver’s seat? I don’t know but they could have been thrown out of the seat if they didn’t have a seatbelt on or perhaps they moved from one seat to another for some reason.

Why are some people with blue checkmarks on Twitter calling for Tesla Autopilot and/or FSD to be banned in response to this news? Perhaps because they’ve been obsessively commenting on Tesla in this way for years and they can’t get over the fact that they are wrong about this topic? Or perhaps they’ve honestly never learned what Autopilot is and what it isn’t what it can do and what it can’t and how Tesla communicates all of that to Tesla drivers. Perhaps they are obsessed with the idea that Tesla should fail or with the idea that it should be held to different standards simply because its tech is popular.

Tesla offers the most advanced version of cruise control on the market. The term “Autopilot” is used because just like in a plane using autopilot the human in control gets some assistance from the automation systems onboard and Elon likes things that fly and used to fly a lot himself. “Full Self-Driving” is a package you can add to your Tesla for $10000. I don’t think people pay $10000 for something without finding out what it does and what it doesn’t do. It is well known — especially by people paying $10000 for the product — that the firmware is supposed to be improved routinely until the point where your car can drive itself without supervision and people who paid several thousand dollars for FSD are eagerly waiting for the firmware update that makes that happen and that also allows you to send your car out as a robotaxi. If you bought FSD every time there’s an over-the-air updated you read the update notes to see how your car has improved. You don’t just assume that your car can suddenly drive itself just because Elon Musk tweeted something about tech that’s in development. And no no one is assuming they turned robotaxi-level Full Self Driving on and then accelerating quickly into a tree.

I wish I could say this is the last time I’m going to respond to stupid statements from relatively high-profile people about Tesla driver-assist features and why they should supposedly be banned or renamed Boring Pilot or something. Unfortunately there’s a clear and strong push by certain people to try to get the Biden administration to cripple Tesla cars and bring them down to the level of inferior products that are less safe. So I feel compelled to respond rather than enjoyably writing about more fun topics.

By the way CNN or CNBC or MSNBC or Fox News if you’re going to cover this or related stories I’d be happy to come on to talk about them. I’ve been covering Tesla professionally since 2012 have co-owned a 2015 Tesla Model S with Tesla’s first-generation Autopilot and now own a Tesla Model 3 with the Full Self-Driving package.

According to the media For most cars it’s your job to drive responsibly. Unless you buy a Tesla -then you need to find ways to trick all of the safety features. If Tesla can’t stop you it’s their fault. — 🐶 𝔼𝕒𝕣𝕝 of FrunkPuppy 🐶 (@28delayslater) April 19 2021

I’m a little finnicky about the grips on my golf clubs because after all how can you not be? It’s the only connection you have to the golf club during your swing. The size the shape the feel; it all affects your physical and emotional connection to your golf club and your ability to swing the club with some consistency.

And so before the start of every golf season I have a little tradition: I regrip my entire set of clubs. You can do it yourself relatively easily or bring them to a golf store and pay them to do it for you but either way it’ll give your sticks a nice fresh feel. You should try it yourself especially because we just stocked some good grip options in our GOLF.com pro shop.

Personally I prefer a softer grip without many lines. Last season I installed a set of the Golf Pride Tour Wrap MicroSuede. They’re a softer tackier grip that wear surprisingly well for heavy users.

This year I’m trying some WINN Dri-Tac Wrap Oversize in the grey version. They’re not as tacky but incredibly soft and comfortable. I wear a glove on the course but these seem like a great option to consider for those who don’t.

Some golfers prefer a little ridge in the back of the grip which can help promote clubface awareness and therefore improve your alignment. Golf Pride’s “ALIGN” tech features a raised ridge towards the back which is noticeable and helpful without being bothersome.

One slightly out-of-the-box grip I tried recently and was thoroughly intrigued by is Golf Pride’s “Plus 4” variation which features a bulkier lower part to help golfers manage grip pressure and placement of their lower hand on the golf club.

And finally another intriguing piece of grip tech is Lamkin’s fingerprint design which features a pattern of ridges to form a “micro-texture” without relying on cord.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But don’t expect to be gathering around ye olde water cooler anytime soon.

While you’ve likely already heard of back-to-work trends like flexible days hot-desking (multiple workers using a single workspace at different times) and temperature checks there’s a lot more to come as many firms introduce changes to make the office safe and comfortable.

Welcome to the office 2.0.

Tent life

Steelcase has created stylish and versatile work tents as a mainstay for the workplace. The office-environment designer launched them to give an open-concept floor plan dedicated spaces and they’ve proved to be a huge hit.

“Created by an outdoor-gear expert the tents are a playful way to bring workers back to the office borrowing form and function from nature” said sociologist Tracy Brower Ph.D. a principal at Steelcase.

Other offerings from the company include desktop pods that can move from desk to desk a “boundary tent” to separate cubicles or serve as a Zoom background and options for “flex frame” walls that teams can arrange into their own configuration.

You might see a domed station in lieu of your former cube. One of the leaders in the space is MojoDesk which has created an electric sit-to-stand desk that moves up and down with the press of a button. In addition it also has a built-in adjustable privacy dome. Not only is it ergonomically appealing it also features dimmable LED lights.

“MojoDome was originally designed to eliminate echo decrease background noise and offer privacy to reduce distractions” said Barry Carson co-founder and president of MojoDesk and parent company Xybix a top player in ergonomic workstations. “With the added benefit of a physical barrier for built-in social distancing we anticipate these features will be extremely valuable to those in an open office.”

Take it outside

At New York-based Marx Realty they believe that bringing a hotel-like aesthetic into offices can promote a sense of calm making your 9-to-5 feel like a Zen escape. And perhaps nowhere is that more obvious than in outdoor workspaces such as the Ivy Terrace (above) at their offices at 10 Grand Central in Midtown.

For Craig Deitelzweig president and CEO of Marx Realty it’s not just about one-off innovations but updating the big picture in order to create a relaxing and safe experience for employees and guests.

“Tenants today increasingly demand outdoor space — it has always been a sought-after amenity and has become even more desirable in the age of COVID-19” he said. “At 10 Grand Central for example we frequently see employees eating lunch outdoors having coffee working on their computers and engaging in group meetings. We even see lots of employees enjoying a socially distant al fresco glass of wine together.”

Real-time apps

RXR Realty’s $20 billion portfolio ranges from 75 Rockefeller Plaza to the Starrett-Lehigh Building in Chelsea home to tenants like Ralph Lauren and Martha Stewart. They’ve launched the RxWell by RXR app in partnership with health experts and Microsoft which monitors social distancing mask compliance building capacity and more. The app even tracks cleaning schedules as it interacts in real time with tenants and visitors.

“Technology-enabled the extraordinary success of the world’s largest and most abrupt work-from-home experiment but it will also enable the opportunity for workplace innovation” said the company’s founder and CEO Scott Rechler.

RxWell is available to all 900-plus tenant organizations and 70000 employees across the RXR commercial portfolio.



Touchless tech

If you’ve been opening door handles with your sleeve for the past year (er half your life?) you’re not alone and there’s a whole slew of office designers looking to save you from coat-sleeve hell when it comes time to return to the office.

“Touchless solutions will become mainstream in the coming months but also hold value in the long term because in addition to being safer these technologies are more efficient” said Brad Sweet commercial marketing leader at Allegion a trailblazer in safety and security solutions.

Their automatic operators for doors contactless readers for credential technologies and mobile credentials for contactless access are gaining traction in healthcare facilities commercial offices K-12 schools and higher-education campuses.

“We’re seeing office spaces use UV-C sanitization tech in conference rooms entryways and HVAC systems” said Joe Heaney an air-quality expert and president of Lotus Biosecurity. “As offices reopen they’re doing so primarily to promote the type of in-person meeting and collaboration that is difficult to accomplish via Zoom making conference rooms and meeting areas some of the most utilized spaces. UV-C sanitizing ‘robots’ are used before and after meetings on a five- to seven-minute cycle to ensure that the next group entering the space is in a completely sanitized room with clean air and surfaces.”

Heaney is also seeing the implementation of “sterilockers” — cubbies that use hospital-grade UV-C light originally designed to sanitize doctors’ white coats. “It wipes out any germs you or someone you are meeting may have inadvertently picked up say on the subway or in an elevator” he said.

Lastly Heaney said there’s an uptick in UV-C as a method of air purification that has been effectively used in the HVAC systems of hospitals and other high transmission-risk areas for decades. “The efficacy of these systems are up to 99.99 percent when designed properly” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If Sergey Brin has anything to do with it the future of humanitarian aid could come in the form of giant airships roaming the skies.

Brin the Google cofounder worth over $99 billion has been working on a secretive airship company for over four years. Known as LTA Research and Exploration — ""LTA"" being short for ""lighter than air"" — the company got its start inside NASA's Ames Research Center in 2017. Over the past four years LTA Research has worked to bring its vision of zero-emission aircrafts to life.

Here's where Brin's interest in airships began and everything we know so far about his venture.

Brin has long had an affinity for all types of aircraft

Back in 2005 Brin and his Google cofounder Larry Page made an unusual purchase: a Boeing 767-200 a wide-body jet capable of carrying 180 passengers. The pair refurbished the plane to accommodate 50 passengers and serve as their executive jet a far cry from the standard and significantly smaller Gulfstream jet typically favored by executives.

According to court documents that were later published by The Wall Street Journal Page and Brin ended up arguing over what type of beds to put in the so-called ""party plane"" and they also wanted to install features like hammocks and a cocktail lounge.

Brin's interest in aircraft extended beyond a company jet: In 2012 during the launch of Google Glass Brin had a team of skydivers leap from a Zeppelin hovering over San Francisco. The skydivers captured footage on the headset and Brin aired it live onstage.

Brin also oversaw the development of various types of aircraft during his time at X Google's moonshot lab. Projects under the X umbrella included Loon a way to deliver internet connectivity via balloons; Makani which planned to provide electricity using kites; and Wing a drone delivery project. Loon and Makani have since been shut down.

Brin started working on LTA while he was still president of Alphabet Google's parent company

According to a 2017 Bloomberg story by Ashlee Vance Brin decided to build his own airship in 2014 after visiting the Ames Research Center which is located near Google's Mountain View California headquarters.

Ames was previously home to the USS Macon a massive airship built by the US Navy in the 1930s — it was that airship that inspired Brin's project according to Bloomberg. The USS Macon called ""Queen of the Skies"" later crashed into the Pacific Ocean 45 miles off the coast of San Francisco essentially ending the Navy's airship program.

In 2017 Insider revealed that LTA had paid $131000 to lease hangar space from Alphabet. The hangar was located at Moffett Field a NASA airfield adjacent to Ames that's currently operated by Google.

In December 2019 Brin and Page stepped away from their duties at Alphabet.

LTA plans to build a massive expensive airship

According to a 2017 report from The Guardian's Mark Harris the airship is expected to be nearly 200 meters long equivalent to about 656 feet or nearly two football fields in length.

By comparison the infamous Hindenburg Zeppelin was 245 meters long which is longer than three Boeing 747s.

Sources told The Guardian that at the time LTA was being funded by Brin himself to the tune of over $100 million. It's not clear four years later how much Brin has spent on the airships.

The airship will be used for humanitarian missions

The aircraft will be used to used to bring humanitarian aid including food and supplies to remote areas of the world — because airships wouldn't require a traditional airport runway to land the blimp could theoretically reach regions that are otherwise inaccessible.

""With these next-generation airships we strive to improve humanitarian aid delivery and reduce carbon emissions while providing economic opportunity and new jobs to Americans"" LTA's website reads.

According to The Guardian Brin also wanted the blimp to be luxuriously appointed so it could serve as an ""intercontinental air yacht"" for his friends and family.

LTA's airship will also be more climate-friendly than an airplane

According to SFGate's Madeline Wells airships are faster than cargo ships and produce 80% to 90% fewer emissions than traditional aircraft.

LTA says on its website that its goal is to eventually build ""a family of aircraft with zero emissions.""

Airships like the Goodyear blimp have been filled with helium since the Hindenburg disaster — the Hindenburg relied on hydrogen to lift it off the ground but hydrogen is extremely flammable.

But LTA appears to be revisiting the use of hydrogen with its aircraft. A recent LTA job listing spotted by TechCrunch stated that the company was looking for a hydrogen program manager — according to TechCrunch the company wants to develop its own massive hydrogen fuel cell which would weigh less than a lithium-ion battery and be powerful enough that the airship could cross oceans.

LTA would still rely on helium in order to lift the aircraft off the ground TechCrunch reports.

An LTA airship could take to the skies in 2021

TechCrunch reports that LTA has already built a prototype aircraft called Pathfinder 1. The airship will still be powered by lithium-ion batteries have 12 electric motors and be capable of transporting 14 passengers.

It may be ready to fly as soon as this year according to TechCrunch.

LTA has also been contributing the nation's COVID-19 response

The company says on its website that it used the laser cutters and 3D printers at its facilities in Mountain View and Akron Ohio to produce roughly 150 components for face shields per day contributing over 250000 free face shields to hospitals medical practices and emergency workers nationwide in the early months of the pandemic.

LTA later partnered with NGOs around the world ultimately providing over 5 million face shields globally the company says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNodGltZXMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZ29vZ2xlLXVzZWQtZG91YmxlLWlyaXNoLXRvLXNoaWZ0LTc1LTRibi1pbi1wcm9maXRzLW91dC1vZi1pcmVsYW5kLTEuNDU0MDUxOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google used 'double-Irish' to shift $75.4bn in profits out of Ireland,"Google shifted more than $75.4 billion (€63 billion) in profits out of the Republic using the controversial ""double-Irish"" tax arrangement in 2019 the last year in which it used the loophole.

The technology giant availed of the tax arrangement to move the money out of Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company via interim dividends and other payments. This company was incorporated in Ireland but tax domiciled in Bermuda at the time of the transfer.

The move allowed Google Ireland Holdings to escape corporation tax both in the Republic and in the United States where its ultimate parent Alphabet is headquartered. The holding company reported a $13 billion pretax profit for 2019 which was effectively tax-free the accounts show.

A year earlier Google Ireland Holdings paid out dividends of €23 billion having recorded turnover of $25.7 billion.

Google has used the double Irish loophole to funnel billions in global profits through Ireland and on to Bermuda effectively putting them beyond the reach of US tax authorities.

Companies exploiting the double Irish put their intellectual property into an Irish-registered company that is controlled from a tax haven such as Bermuda.

Ireland considers the company to be tax-resident in Bermuda while the US considers it to be tax-resident here. The result is that when royalty payments are sent to the company they go untaxed – unless or until the money is eventually sent home to the US parent.

The “double Irish” was abolished in 2015 for new companies establishing operations in the Republic. However controversially it allowed those already using it until the end of 2020 to phase it out.

Google overhauled its global tax structure and consolidated its intellectual property holdings back to the United States in early 2020 meaning 2019 was the final year in which it availed of the arrangement.

Up to late 2019 Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company was an intellectual property licensing company with turnover derived from the licensing of IP to subsidiaries. The accounts state it had no employees and that it was tax resident at the time in Bermuda where the “standard rate tax is 0 per cent”.

Holding company

Commenting on the movement of the profits out of its Irish unit a spokeswoman for Google said: “In December 2019 in line with the OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) conclusions and changes to US and Irish tax laws we simplified our corporate structure and started licensing our IP from the US not Bermuda. The accounts filed today cover the 2019 financial year before we made those changes.

“Including all annual and one-time income taxes over the past ten years our global effective tax rate has been over 20 per cent with more than 80 per cent of that tax due in the US” she added.

The accounts state that Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company became tax resident in Ireland from January 1st 2021 and that it now just operates as a holding company.

Turnover for the holding company rose from $25.7 billion in 2018 to $26.5 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a rise in turnover recorded by the company’s subsidiaries which results in higher royalty payments.

Dividend income from shares in group undertakings jumped from just $2.9 million in 2018 to $597.5 million a year later. The accounts also show a $3 billion increase in research and development costs in 2019 with the company incurring R&D expenses of $10.4 billion under a cost-sharing agreement with other Google entities globally.

Google Ireland the tech company’s main operating Irish subsidiary with over 4000 employees recorded €45.7 billion in revenues in 2019 with pretax profits amounting to €1.94 billion. It paid €263 million in tax that year down nearly €9 million versus 2018.

It is estimated that US multinationals were holding more than a $1 trillion in profits offshore via mechanisms such as the double Irish and the so-called Dutch sandwich by the end of 2017. Tax cuts introduced by former US president Donald Trump in 2019 have led to some of those profits being repatriated to the United States.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xOC9vbmNlLXZtd2FyZS1pcy1mcmVlLWZyb20tZGVsbC13aG8tbWlnaHQtZmFuY3ktYnV5aW5nLWl0L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xOC9vbmNlLXZtd2FyZS1pcy1mcmVlLWZyb20tZGVsbC13aG8tbWlnaHQtZmFuY3ktYnV5aW5nLWl0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Once VMware is free from Dell who might fancy buying it?,"TechCrunch has spilled much digital ink tracking the fate of VMware since it was brought to Dell’s orbit thanks to the latter company’s epic purchase of EMC in 2016 for $58 billion. That transaction saddled the well-known Texas tech company with heavy debts. Because the deal left VMware a public company albeit one controlled by Dell how it might be used to pay down some of its parent company’s arrears was a constant question.

Dell made its move earlier this week agreeing to spin out VMware in exchange for a huge one-time dividend a five-year commercial partnership agreement lots of stock for existing Dell shareholders and Michael Dell retaining his role as chairman of its board.

So where does the deal leave VMware in terms of independence and in terms of Dell influence? Dell no longer will hold formal control over VMware as part of the deal though its shareholders will retain a large stake in the virtualization giant. And with Michael Dell staying on VMware’s board it will retain influence.

Here’s how VMware described it to shareholders in a presentation this week. The graphic shows that under the new agreement VMware is no longer a subsidiary of Dell and will now be an independent company.

But with VMware tipped to become independent once again it could become something of a takeover target. When Dell controlled VMware thanks to majority ownership a hostile takeover felt out of the question. Now VMware is a more possible target to the right company with the right offer — provided that the Dell spinout works as planned.

Buying VMware would be an expensive effort however. It’s worth around $67 billion today. Presuming a large premium would be needed to take this particular technology chess piece off the competitive board it could cost $100 billion or more to snag VMware from the public markets.

So VMware will soon be more free to pursue a transaction that might be favorable to its shareholders — which will still include every Dell shareholder because they are receiving stock in VMware as part of its spinout — without worrying about its parent company simply saying no.

Who could afford to buy VMware?

If you accept that this move puts VMware in play the price tag means that the number of firms that could afford such a deal are few and far between.

Yesterday Todd R. Weiss from Enterprise AI wrote a post in which some analysts speculated that Intel might be interested in buying VMware. The move would unite Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger’s old company with his new one and give Intel a big play on the software side of the cloud to go with its silicon.

Intel clearly doesn’t have enough cash but it has the value with a market cap over $264 billion and it could borrow enough to make a transaction possible. Whether that’s something Gelsinger is considering is unknown but it certainly would make for an interesting acquisition.

Let’s look at some other companies that might be interested in VMware and could possibly afford the likely hefty price.

Microsoft

Last week Microsoft bought Nuance Communications for $20 billion so we know it has a taste for big deals and it has over $136 billion in cash to play with (at least it did prior to the Nuance deal). Furthermore Redmond has been chasing Amazon in the cloud market for years making it the only viable competitor for AWS today. Microsoft could afford a deal of this scope and might be willing to pull the trigger if the transaction would push it closer to its primary rival in the cloud infrastructure market.

Oracle

Larry Ellison was in love with the Dell-EMC deal but the company was building up its cloud infrastructure at the time and didn’t have the cash to pull off a deal. Today Oracle has over $40 billion in cash and a market cap of over $226 billion. It would be like Ellison to make a big splash like this and having access to the VMware market would be a good way to push his company’s cloud business in a major way.

IBM

Big Blue bought Red Hat in 2018 for $34 billion to force its way into the hybrid cloud market. IBM is in the midst of a spinout of its own letting go of its managed services business a move announced last year. And the company has struggled financially for a number of years as it tries to make the transition to selling a hybrid cloud solution. If it could afford to buy the virtualization giant the deal would definitely put it back on the map with Red Hat and VMware in the fold but the affordability question looms large.

Google/Alphabet

As with IBM Google’s cloud computing business has been growing more slowly than its primary rivals at the top of the market Amazon and Microsoft. Google is sitting at around 10% market share today and while it has been growing under the leadership of Thomas Kurian it has been costly to gain share. Bringing VMware into the fold could make a huge difference in terms of its position in the enterprise market. It’s also worth noting that prior Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene was one of the founders at VMware.

Amazon

Amazon’s cloud arm AWS is a $50 billion company on its own. It has a substantial market share lead over its closest competitor Microsoft. And it has a broad partnership with VMware already. While it could probably afford to bring VMware into the fold it’s not clear it would make sense to pay that price to do it given that Amazon already enjoys market dominance thanks to AWS sans buying VMware.

Other players include the usual highly acquisitive enterprise suspects such as SAP or Cisco if they could swallow the cost.

It was the last year that the company availed of the so-called ""double-Irish"" tax arrangement before it changed its tax structure.

In 2014 the Government announced that the ""double-Irish"" loophole would be phased out with companies that were already using it able to continue to do so until last year.

""In December 2019 in line with the OECD's BEPS conclusions and changes to US and Irish tax laws we simplified our corporate structure and started licensing our IP from the US not Bermuda"" a Google spokesperson said.

Until November 2019 the activities of the company were that of a holding management trading investment and intellectual property licencing business with its turnover derived from the licensing of intellectual property to a subsidiary.

But in November of 2019 the company distributed intellectual property licence rights to its immediate parent along with other intangible assets and equity investments worth a total of $15.5bn.

The following month the company also distributed the bulk of its debt security investments and other financial assets worth a total of $29.7bn.

During the year it also approved and paid dividends and distributions worth $30bn to its immediate parent up from $22.9bn.

In total Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited paid out dividends and other payments worth $75.4bn in 2019 up from $22.9bn a year earlier.

Since the end of 2019 its main activities have been that of a holding company.

During 2019 the company's turnover rose to $26.5bn from $25.7bn a year earlier primarily due to the increase in turnover recorded by its subsidiaries which resulted in higher royalty payments.

It made a profit before tax of $13.7bn down from $15.5bn a year earlier.

However it did not have to pay any tax on that because it was tax resident in Bermuda.

It was reported that the new policy makes it binding for the users to simply accept the terms and conditions so as to maintain their WhatsApp account information and provides as to how it will share personalised user information with Facebook Inc and its subsidiaries.

Introduction of case

Instant messaging Whatsapp’s controversial policy update has led CCI to question its anti-competitive behaviour. CCI is of the opinion that the update could lead to excessive data collection and will amount to stalking of its users. Later Facebook and Whatsapp have separately filed a petition in Delhi high court to dismiss CCI order that called for an investigation into the new privacy policy update by Whatsapp.

Facts of the case

Whatsapp Inc has updated its privacy policy and terms of service for WhatsApp users. It was lay to rest alia reported that the new policy makes it binding for the users to simply accept the terms and conditions so as to maintain their WhatsApp account information and provides as to how it will share personalised user information with Facebook Inc and its subsidiaries. Thus the notification shows that in order to use the services of Whatsapp from 08.02.2021 onwards users will have to compulsorily accept the new terms and policy in their entirely. The Competition Commission of India in its meeting on 19.01.2021 decided to take suo motto cognisance of the matter. Facebook has submitted that Facebook Inc is the parent company of WhatsApp Facebook and WhatsApp are distinct legal entities. It is WhatsApp (not Facebook) that gives and operates WhatsApp instant messaging service that’s the topic of the Hon’ble Commission’s Order. Facebook humbly submits that it should not be arrayed as a party to these proceedings and WhatsApp is the appropriate entity to provide the Hon’ble Commission with the information sought. As far as WhatsApp cares it filed public version of its response dated 03.02.2021 vide its submission dated 25.02.2021. WhatsApp did not suit the directions of the Commission but has also taken the pleas which are ex facie untenable. In this regard the Commission notes that the reference to the provisions of Section 35 of the Act by WhatsApp is meticulously gone astray. WhatsApp has cited the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Competition Commission of India v. Bharti Airtel Limited and others (2019) 2 SCC 521 and stated that the said decision highlights the need to maintain civility between decisions of different authorities on the same issues reported that the Commission should only exercise jurisdiction after the proceedings before the sectoral regulator had concluded and attained the climax. WhatsApp has also relied on the choices of the Commission in Harshita Chawla v. WhatsApp Inc Case No. 15 of 2020 (‘Harshita Chawla case’) also as XYZ v. Alphabet Inc Case No. 07 of 2020 to contend that issues associated with data localization and data sharing needn’t be looked in under the Competition law. In light of its averments WhatsApp has submitted that the 2021 Update raises no concerns from a contest perspective. 2021 Update focuses to provide greater transparency by further explaining the usage collection and sharing of data which users had consented to under the 2016 Update. The Commission had an affair to look at the relevant market within the context of business practices of WhatsApp and Facebook in Harshita Chawla case wherein an Information was filed before the Commission alleging inter alia infringement of the provisions of Section 4 of the Act against WhatsApp and Facebook for abusing their dominant position in initiation of their payment app services. WhatsApp in India operates in the ‘market for Over-The-Top (OTT) messaging apps through smart phones in India. The Commission concluded that WhatsApp is dominant in the relevant market for OTT messaging apps through smart phones in India. In light of the said holding of the Commission in the Harshita Chawla case there is no occasion to separately and independently examine the issue of relevant market and dominance of WhatsApp.

Provisions concerned in this case

During an important development the Competition Commission of India ordered a hunt into the new privacy policy of WhatsApp once creating a clear observation that it absolutely was violating the Competition Act 2002.

The CCI in its meeting considered and observed that the reply was not in accordance with Regulation 35 of the Competition Commission of India (General) Regulations 2009 (the ‘General Regulations’). The Commission proceeds to examine the issues on merit to prima facie assess whether the Opposite Parties have violated provisions of Section 4 of the Competition Act.

The challenging conduct of data-sharing by WhatsApp with Facebook evidently amounts to degradation of non-price parameters of competition which is quality. That lead to objective damage to consumers with none acceptable justification. Such conduct clear amounts to imposition of unfair terms and conditions upon the users of WhatsApp electronic communication app in violation of the provisions of Section 4(2)(a)(i) of the Competition Act.

CCI held

On 24th March 2021 the Competition Commission of India directed the Director General (‘DG’) to cause associate in nursing investigation to be created into the matter underneath the provisions of Section 26(1) of the Competition Act. The Commission conjointly directs the decigram to finish the investigation and submit the investigation report at intervals an amount of sixty days from the receipt of this order.

Delhi High Court held

The Delhi high court has set aside the order as of now on Facebook and Whatsapp pleas challenging the CCI’s order for an examination concerning the messaging app’s privacy policy and the matter is up for another hearing at a later date.

A single bench consisting of Justice Navin Chawla reserved the order after the counsel of all the sides closed their contentions. The court was hearing both the petitions challenging the order which was passed by CCI directing a test into the new privacy policy and that the test ought to be finished within 60 days.

Facebook and Whatsapp included in their arguments that since the issue of Whatsapp’s privacy policy is being dealt by the Supreme Court therefore there was no need of CCI to order the probe and intervene in the matter.

Extra Comments

In a hearing in the Delhi High Court Whatsapp and Facebook collectively argued that the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has interfered in the matter by ordering an investigation into the Whatsapp new privacy policy and are overreaching its jurisdiction even after the issue of privacy is already being dealt by the Supreme Court. However the CCI argued that it looked into the competition aspect and are not alleging violation of personal privacy. Moreover they added in the court that whether the data collection by whatsapp and sharing it with Facebook would amount to an anti-competitive practice or abuse of dominant position can be examined only after the investigation.

Senior advocate Aman Lekhi who is representing CCI made his contentions that the new privacy policy of whatsapp would lead to excessive data collection and “stalking” of consumers for targeted advertisement to bring in more users and is therefore an alleged abuse of dominant position. The matter is being heard by Justice Navin Chawla and WhatsApp and Facebook are represented by senior advocates Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi.

Aman Lekhi argued that“ the data collected would include a person’s location the kind of device used the internet service provider and whom they are talking to would result in creation of a customer profile and preference which would be monetised by way of targeted advertisement and all this amounts to stalking.”

Senior Advocate Harish Salve informed the Delhi High Court that the matter is pending before the Supreme Court and this is an attention-seeking endeavour by CCI.

Representing Facebook Mukul Rohatgi said that CCI proceedings must be kept in temporary suspension.

The counsel further notified the court that the Whatsapp policy was challenged in the Supreme Court in 2016 when Facebook bought the messaging app whatsapp in 2016 and the Centre had submitted a proper framework on this. Harish Salve on this note stated that this is not a competition issue.

The counsel on behalf of whatsapp added that user conversation is protected by end to end encryption. He also informed the court that the 2021 policy is also pending before the court. “Respect for privacy is coded since WhatsApp was started” the advocate representing Whatsapp Harish Salve said that it does not retain messages and are deleted from the servers after it is delivered.

Mukul Rohatgi who was appearing on behalf of Facebook informed the court that Facebook does not work according to WhatsApp’s policy.

Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi representing CCI in this matter stated the court that it is not a matter of privacy but of access to data.

Lekhi responded that data can have a privacy or competition facet. He also said that the issue is completely based on competition as to understand consumer behaviour and preferences that enable targeted advertising.

Concluding remarks as to why CCI intervened in the matter

The CCI is of opinion that  “users as owners of their personalised data are entitled to be informed about the extent scope and purpose of sharing of such data by WhatsApp with other Facebook Companies”. Nevertheless it appears from the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service which many of the information categories described therein are too broad vague and meaningless. For instance information on how users “interact with others (including businesses)” is not clearly defined what would constitute “service-related information” “mobile device information” “payments or business features” etc. are also undefined. It is also suitable to note that in countless places in the policy while illustrating the data to be collected the list is typical and not comprehensive due to usage of words like ‘includes’ ‘such as’ ‘For example’ etc which suggests that the scope of sharing may extend beyond the information categories that have been expressly mentioned in the policy. Such vagueness open-endedness and incomplete disclosures hide the actual data cost that a user incurs for availing WhatsApp services. It is also not clear from the policy whether the historical data of users would also be shared with Facebook Companies and whether data would be shared in respect of those WhatsApp users also who aren’t present on other apps of Facebook.

Conclusion

Data has such a noteworthy importance for businesses than at any other time whether it is for customized services or internal investigation or targeted advertising it has become capable of shifting competitive advantage. The CCI’s suo motto cognizance of Whatsapp’s privacy policy is one of the instances of this fact. It could be likewise of characteristic of CCI’s expectations to adopt more interventionist approach where it accepts that user’s data bring abused in a way that makes obstructions to entry and otherwise impacts competition or interests of the consumer. The CCI has wide powers under the Competition Act in the event of finding abuse of dominance and may pass such orders or requests as it deems fit. It will likewise be intriguing to perceive how the convergence among privacy and competition in the context of Data plays out over time and specifically how the CCI encompasses the limits of competition privacy and data protection concerns.

If Sergey Brin has anything to do with it the future of humanitarian aid could come in the form of giant airships roaming the skies.

Brin the Google cofounder worth over $99 billion has been working on a secretive airship company for over four years. Known as LTA Research and Exploration — ""LTA"" being short for ""lighter than air"" — the company got its start inside NASA's Ames Research Center in 2017. Over the past four years LTA Research has worked to bring its vision of zero-emission aircrafts to life.

Here's where Brin's interest in airships began and everything we know so far about his venture.

Brin has long had an affinity for all types of aircraft

Back in 2005 Brin and his Google cofounder Larry Page made an unusual purchase: a Boeing 767-200 a wide-body jet capable of carrying 180 passengers. The pair refurbished the plane to accommodate 50 passengers and serve as their executive jet a far cry from the standard and significantly smaller Gulfstream jet typically favored by executives.

According to court documents that were later published by The Wall Street Journal Page and Brin ended up arguing over what type of beds to put in the so-called ""party plane"" and they also wanted to install features like hammocks and a cocktail lounge.

Brin's interest in aircraft extended beyond a company jet: In 2012 during the launch of Google Glass Brin had a team of skydivers leap from a Zeppelin hovering over San Francisco. The skydivers captured footage on the headset and Brin aired it live onstage.

Brin also oversaw the development of various types of aircraft during his time at X Google's moonshot lab. Projects under the X umbrella included Loon a way to deliver internet connectivity via balloons; Makani which planned to provide electricity using kites; and Wing a drone delivery project. Loon and Makani have since been shut down.

Brin started working on LTA while he was still president of Alphabet Google's parent company

According to a 2017 Bloomberg story by Ashlee Vance Brin decided to build his own airship in 2014 after visiting the Ames Research Center which is located near Google's Mountain View California headquarters.

Ames was previously home to the USS Macon a massive airship built by the US Navy in the 1930s — it was that airship that inspired Brin's project according to Bloomberg. The USS Macon called ""Queen of the Skies"" later crashed into the Pacific Ocean 45 miles off the coast of San Francisco essentially ending the Navy's airship program.

In 2017 Insider revealed that LTA had paid $131000 to lease hangar space from Alphabet. The hangar was located at Moffett Field a NASA airfield adjacent to Ames that's currently operated by Google.

In December 2019 Brin and Page stepped away from their duties at Alphabet.

LTA plans to build a massive expensive airship

According to a 2017 report from The Guardian's Mark Harris the airship is expected to be nearly 200 meters long equivalent to about 656 feet or nearly two football fields in length.

By comparison the infamous Hindenburg Zeppelin was 245 meters long which is longer than three Boeing 747s.

Sources told The Guardian that at the time LTA was being funded by Brin himself to the tune of over $100 million. It's not clear four years later how much Brin has spent on the airships.

The airship will be used for humanitarian missions

The aircraft will be used to used to bring humanitarian aid including food and supplies to remote areas of the world — because airships wouldn't require a traditional airport runway to land the blimp could theoretically reach regions that are otherwise inaccessible.

""With these next-generation airships we strive to improve humanitarian aid delivery and reduce carbon emissions while providing economic opportunity and new jobs to Americans"" LTA's website reads.

According to The Guardian Brin also wanted the blimp to be luxuriously appointed so it could serve as an ""intercontinental air yacht"" for his friends and family.

LTA's airship will also be more climate-friendly than an airplane

According to SFGate's Madeline Wells airships are faster than cargo ships and produce 80% to 90% fewer emissions than traditional aircraft.

LTA says on its website that its goal is to eventually build ""a family of aircraft with zero emissions.""

Airships like the Goodyear blimp have been filled with helium since the Hindenburg disaster — the Hindenburg relied on hydrogen to lift it off the ground but hydrogen is extremely flammable.

But LTA appears to be revisiting the use of hydrogen with its aircraft. A recent LTA job listing spotted by TechCrunch stated that the company was looking for a hydrogen program manager — according to TechCrunch the company wants to develop its own massive hydrogen fuel cell which would weigh less than a lithium-ion battery and be powerful enough that the airship could cross oceans.

LTA would still rely on helium in order to lift the aircraft off the ground TechCrunch reports.

An LTA airship could take to the skies in 2021

TechCrunch reports that LTA has already built a prototype aircraft called Pathfinder 1. The airship will still be powered by lithium-ion batteries have 12 electric motors and be capable of transporting 14 passengers.

It may be ready to fly as soon as this year according to TechCrunch.

LTA has also been contributing the nation's COVID-19 response

LTA later partnered with NGOs around the world ultimately providing over 5 million face shields globally the company says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNodGltZXMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZ29vZ2xlLXVzZWQtZG91YmxlLWlyaXNoLXRvLXNoaWZ0LTc1LTRibi1pbi1wcm9maXRzLW91dC1vZi1pcmVsYW5kLTEuNDU0MDUxOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google used 'double-Irish' to shift $75.4bn in profits out of Ireland,"Google shifted more than $75.4 billion (€63 billion) in profits out of the Republic using the controversial ""double-Irish"" tax arrangement in 2019 the last year in which it used the loophole.

The technology giant availed of the tax arrangement to move the money out of Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company via interim dividends and other payments. This company was incorporated in Ireland but tax domiciled in Bermuda at the time of the transfer.

The move allowed Google Ireland Holdings to escape corporation tax both in the Republic and in the United States where its ultimate parent Alphabet is headquartered. The holding company reported a $13 billion pretax profit for 2019 which was effectively tax-free the accounts show.

A year earlier Google Ireland Holdings paid out dividends of €23 billion having recorded turnover of $25.7 billion.

Google has used the double Irish loophole to funnel billions in global profits through Ireland and on to Bermuda effectively putting them beyond the reach of US tax authorities.

Companies exploiting the double Irish put their intellectual property into an Irish-registered company that is controlled from a tax haven such as Bermuda.

Ireland considers the company to be tax-resident in Bermuda while the US considers it to be tax-resident here. The result is that when royalty payments are sent to the company they go untaxed – unless or until the money is eventually sent home to the US parent.

The “double Irish” was abolished in 2015 for new companies establishing operations in the Republic. However controversially it allowed those already using it until the end of 2020 to phase it out.

Google overhauled its global tax structure and consolidated its intellectual property holdings back to the United States in early 2020 meaning 2019 was the final year in which it availed of the arrangement.

Up to late 2019 Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company was an intellectual property licensing company with turnover derived from the licensing of IP to subsidiaries. The accounts state it had no employees and that it was tax resident at the time in Bermuda where the “standard rate tax is 0 per cent”.

Holding company

Commenting on the movement of the profits out of its Irish unit a spokeswoman for Google said: “In December 2019 in line with the OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) conclusions and changes to US and Irish tax laws we simplified our corporate structure and started licensing our IP from the US not Bermuda. The accounts filed today cover the 2019 financial year before we made those changes.

“Including all annual and one-time income taxes over the past ten years our global effective tax rate has been over 20 per cent with more than 80 per cent of that tax due in the US” she added.

The accounts state that Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company became tax resident in Ireland from January 1st 2021 and that it now just operates as a holding company.

Turnover for the holding company rose from $25.7 billion in 2018 to $26.5 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a rise in turnover recorded by the company’s subsidiaries which results in higher royalty payments.

Dividend income from shares in group undertakings jumped from just $2.9 million in 2018 to $597.5 million a year later. The accounts also show a $3 billion increase in research and development costs in 2019 with the company incurring R&D expenses of $10.4 billion under a cost-sharing agreement with other Google entities globally.

Google Ireland the tech company’s main operating Irish subsidiary with over 4000 employees recorded €45.7 billion in revenues in 2019 with pretax profits amounting to €1.94 billion. It paid €263 million in tax that year down nearly €9 million versus 2018.

It is estimated that US multinationals were holding more than a $1 trillion in profits offshore via mechanisms such as the double Irish and the so-called Dutch sandwich by the end of 2017. Tax cuts introduced by former US president Donald Trump in 2019 have led to some of those profits being repatriated to the United States.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xOC9vbmNlLXZtd2FyZS1pcy1mcmVlLWZyb20tZGVsbC13aG8tbWlnaHQtZmFuY3ktYnV5aW5nLWl0L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xOC9vbmNlLXZtd2FyZS1pcy1mcmVlLWZyb20tZGVsbC13aG8tbWlnaHQtZmFuY3ktYnV5aW5nLWl0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Once VMware is free from Dell who might fancy buying it?,"TechCrunch has spilled much digital ink tracking the fate of VMware since it was brought to Dell’s orbit thanks to the latter company’s epic purchase of EMC in 2016 for $58 billion. That transaction saddled the well-known Texas tech company with heavy debts. Because the deal left VMware a public company albeit one controlled by Dell how it might be used to pay down some of its parent company’s arrears was a constant question.

Dell made its move earlier this week agreeing to spin out VMware in exchange for a huge one-time dividend a five-year commercial partnership agreement lots of stock for existing Dell shareholders and Michael Dell retaining his role as chairman of its board.

So where does the deal leave VMware in terms of independence and in terms of Dell influence? Dell no longer will hold formal control over VMware as part of the deal though its shareholders will retain a large stake in the virtualization giant. And with Michael Dell staying on VMware’s board it will retain influence.

Here’s how VMware described it to shareholders in a presentation this week. The graphic shows that under the new agreement VMware is no longer a subsidiary of Dell and will now be an independent company.

But with VMware tipped to become independent once again it could become something of a takeover target. When Dell controlled VMware thanks to majority ownership a hostile takeover felt out of the question. Now VMware is a more possible target to the right company with the right offer — provided that the Dell spinout works as planned.

Buying VMware would be an expensive effort however. It’s worth around $67 billion today. Presuming a large premium would be needed to take this particular technology chess piece off the competitive board it could cost $100 billion or more to snag VMware from the public markets.

So VMware will soon be more free to pursue a transaction that might be favorable to its shareholders — which will still include every Dell shareholder because they are receiving stock in VMware as part of its spinout — without worrying about its parent company simply saying no.

Who could afford to buy VMware?

If you accept that this move puts VMware in play the price tag means that the number of firms that could afford such a deal are few and far between.

Yesterday Todd R. Weiss from Enterprise AI wrote a post in which some analysts speculated that Intel might be interested in buying VMware. The move would unite Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger’s old company with his new one and give Intel a big play on the software side of the cloud to go with its silicon.

Intel clearly doesn’t have enough cash but it has the value with a market cap over $264 billion and it could borrow enough to make a transaction possible. Whether that’s something Gelsinger is considering is unknown but it certainly would make for an interesting acquisition.

Let’s look at some other companies that might be interested in VMware and could possibly afford the likely hefty price.

Microsoft

Last week Microsoft bought Nuance Communications for $20 billion so we know it has a taste for big deals and it has over $136 billion in cash to play with (at least it did prior to the Nuance deal). Furthermore Redmond has been chasing Amazon in the cloud market for years making it the only viable competitor for AWS today. Microsoft could afford a deal of this scope and might be willing to pull the trigger if the transaction would push it closer to its primary rival in the cloud infrastructure market.

Oracle

Larry Ellison was in love with the Dell-EMC deal but the company was building up its cloud infrastructure at the time and didn’t have the cash to pull off a deal. Today Oracle has over $40 billion in cash and a market cap of over $226 billion. It would be like Ellison to make a big splash like this and having access to the VMware market would be a good way to push his company’s cloud business in a major way.

IBM

Big Blue bought Red Hat in 2018 for $34 billion to force its way into the hybrid cloud market. IBM is in the midst of a spinout of its own letting go of its managed services business a move announced last year. And the company has struggled financially for a number of years as it tries to make the transition to selling a hybrid cloud solution. If it could afford to buy the virtualization giant the deal would definitely put it back on the map with Red Hat and VMware in the fold but the affordability question looms large.

Google/Alphabet

As with IBM Google’s cloud computing business has been growing more slowly than its primary rivals at the top of the market Amazon and Microsoft. Google is sitting at around 10% market share today and while it has been growing under the leadership of Thomas Kurian it has been costly to gain share. Bringing VMware into the fold could make a huge difference in terms of its position in the enterprise market. It’s also worth noting that prior Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene was one of the founders at VMware.

Amazon

Amazon’s cloud arm AWS is a $50 billion company on its own. It has a substantial market share lead over its closest competitor Microsoft. And it has a broad partnership with VMware already. While it could probably afford to bring VMware into the fold it’s not clear it would make sense to pay that price to do it given that Amazon already enjoys market dominance thanks to AWS sans buying VMware.

Other players include the usual highly acquisitive enterprise suspects such as SAP or Cisco if they could swallow the cost. This is all clear speculation and the deal to spin out VMware won’t even close until the end of this year at the earliest. But the spinout does have the potential to put VMware in play at some point and it’s a useful exercise to look at the possible buyers.

""In December 2019 in line with the OECD's BEPS conclusions and changes to US and Irish tax laws we simplified our corporate structure and started licensing our IP from the US not Bermuda"" a Google spokesperson said.

""The accounts filed today cover the 2019 financial year before we made those changes.""

""Including all annual and one-time income taxes over the past ten years our global effective tax rate has been over 20% with more than 80% of that tax due in the US.""

The accounts show that Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company is a subsidiary of Singapore based Google APAC Technology Pte. Ltd whose ultimate parent is Alphabet Inc.

Until November 2019 the activities of the company were that of a holding management trading investment and intellectual property licencing business with its turnover derived from the licensing of intellectual property to a subsidiary.

But in November of 2019 the company distributed intellectual property licence rights to its immediate parent along with other intangible assets and equity investments worth a total of $15.5bn.

The following month the company also distributed the bulk of its debt security investments and other financial assets worth a total of $29.7bn.

During the year it also approved and paid dividends and distributions worth $30bn to its immediate parent up from $22.9bn.

In total Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited paid out dividends and other payments worth $75.4bn in 2019 up from $22.9bn a year earlier.

Since the end of 2019 its main activities have been that of a holding company.

During 2019 the company's turnover rose to $26.5bn from $25.7bn a year earlier primarily due to the increase in turnover recorded by its subsidiaries which resulted in higher royalty payments.

It made a profit before tax of $13.7bn down from $15.5bn a year earlier.

However it did not have to pay any tax on that because it was tax resident in Bermuda.

Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited is not the main company through which Google runs its local operations.

In 2019 the last year for which accounts are available that firm Google Ireland paid €263m in tax here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vc3VuZGF5Z3VhcmRpYW5saXZlLmNvbS9sZWdhbGx5LXNwZWFraW5nL3doYXRzYXBwLXByaXZhY3ktcG9saWN5LWNhc2Utc3VtbWFyeS1saWdodC1jY2nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Whatsapp privacy policy case summary in the light of CCI - The Sunday Guardian Live,"Whatsapp Inc has updated its privacy policy and terms of service for WhatsApp users. It was reported that the new policy makes it binding for the users to simply accept the terms and conditions so as to maintain their WhatsApp account information and provides as to how it will share personalised user information with Facebook Inc and its subsidiaries.

Introduction of case

Instant messaging Whatsapp’s controversial policy update has led CCI to question its anti-competitive behaviour. CCI is of the opinion that the update could lead to excessive data collection and will amount to stalking of its users. Later Facebook and Whatsapp have separately filed a petition in Delhi high court to dismiss CCI order that called for an investigation into the new privacy policy update by Whatsapp.

Facts of the case

Whatsapp Inc has updated its privacy policy and terms of service for WhatsApp users. It was lay to rest alia reported that the new policy makes it binding for the users to simply accept the terms and conditions so as to maintain their WhatsApp account information and provides as to how it will share personalised user information with Facebook Inc and its subsidiaries. Thus the notification shows that in order to use the services of Whatsapp from 08.02.2021 onwards users will have to compulsorily accept the new terms and policy in their entirely. The Competition Commission of India in its meeting on 19.01.2021 decided to take suo motto cognisance of the matter. Facebook has submitted that Facebook Inc is the parent company of WhatsApp Facebook and WhatsApp are distinct legal entities. It is WhatsApp (not Facebook) that gives and operates WhatsApp instant messaging service that’s the topic of the Hon’ble Commission’s Order. Facebook humbly submits that it should not be arrayed as a party to these proceedings and WhatsApp is the appropriate entity to provide the Hon’ble Commission with the information sought. As far as WhatsApp cares it filed public version of its response dated 03.02.2021 vide its submission dated 25.02.2021. WhatsApp did not suit the directions of the Commission but has also taken the pleas which are ex facie untenable. In this regard the Commission notes that the reference to the provisions of Section 35 of the Act by WhatsApp is meticulously gone astray. WhatsApp has cited the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Competition Commission of India v. Bharti Airtel Limited and others (2019) 2 SCC 521 and stated that the said decision highlights the need to maintain civility between decisions of different authorities on the same issues reported that the Commission should only exercise jurisdiction after the proceedings before the sectoral regulator had concluded and attained the climax. WhatsApp has also relied on the choices of the Commission in Harshita Chawla v. WhatsApp Inc Case No. 15 of 2020 (‘Harshita Chawla case’) also as XYZ v. Alphabet Inc Case No. 07 of 2020 to contend that issues associated with data localization and data sharing needn’t be looked in under the Competition law. In light of its averments WhatsApp has submitted that the 2021 Update raises no concerns from a contest perspective. 2021 Update focuses to provide greater transparency by further explaining the usage collection and sharing of data which users had consented to under the 2016 Update. The Commission had an affair to look at the relevant market within the context of business practices of WhatsApp and Facebook in Harshita Chawla case wherein an Information was filed before the Commission alleging inter alia infringement of the provisions of Section 4 of the Act against WhatsApp and Facebook for abusing their dominant position in initiation of their payment app services. WhatsApp in India operates in the ‘market for Over-The-Top (OTT) messaging apps through smart phones in India. The Commission concluded that WhatsApp is dominant in the relevant market for OTT messaging apps through smart phones in India. In light of the said holding of the Commission in the Harshita Chawla case there is no occasion to separately and independently examine the issue of relevant market and dominance of WhatsApp.

Provisions concerned in this case

During an important development the Competition Commission of India ordered a hunt into the new privacy policy of WhatsApp once creating a clear observation that it absolutely was violating the Competition Act 2002.

The CCI in its meeting considered and observed that the reply was not in accordance with Regulation 35 of the Competition Commission of India (General) Regulations 2009 (the ‘General Regulations’). The Commission proceeds to examine the issues on merit to prima facie assess whether the Opposite Parties have violated provisions of Section 4 of the Competition Act.

The challenging conduct of data-sharing by WhatsApp with Facebook evidently amounts to degradation of non-price parameters of competition which is quality. That lead to objective damage to consumers with none acceptable justification. Such conduct clear amounts to imposition of unfair terms and conditions upon the users of WhatsApp electronic communication app in violation of the provisions of Section 4(2)(a)(i) of the Competition Act.

CCI held

On 24th March 2021 the Competition Commission of India directed the Director General (‘DG’) to cause associate in nursing investigation to be created into the matter underneath the provisions of Section 26(1) of the Competition Act. The Commission conjointly directs the decigram to finish the investigation and submit the investigation report at intervals an amount of sixty days from the receipt of this order.

Delhi High Court held

The Delhi high court has set aside the order as of now on Facebook and Whatsapp pleas challenging the CCI’s order for an examination concerning the messaging app’s privacy policy and the matter is up for another hearing at a later date.

A single bench consisting of Justice Navin Chawla reserved the order after the counsel of all the sides closed their contentions. The court was hearing both the petitions challenging the order which was passed by CCI directing a test into the new privacy policy and that the test ought to be finished within 60 days.

Facebook and Whatsapp included in their arguments that since the issue of Whatsapp’s privacy policy is being dealt by the Supreme Court therefore there was no need of CCI to order the probe and intervene in the matter.

Extra Comments

In a hearing in the Delhi High Court Whatsapp and Facebook collectively argued that the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has interfered in the matter by ordering an investigation into the Whatsapp new privacy policy and are overreaching its jurisdiction even after the issue of privacy is already being dealt by the Supreme Court. However the CCI argued that it looked into the competition aspect and are not alleging violation of personal privacy. Moreover they added in the court that whether the data collection by whatsapp and sharing it with Facebook would amount to an anti-competitive practice or abuse of dominant position can be examined only after the investigation.

Senior advocate Aman Lekhi who is representing CCI made his contentions that the new privacy policy of whatsapp would lead to excessive data collection and “stalking” of consumers for targeted advertisement to bring in more users and is therefore an alleged abuse of dominant position. The matter is being heard by Justice Navin Chawla and WhatsApp and Facebook are represented by senior advocates Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi.

Aman Lekhi argued that“ the data collected would include a person’s location the kind of device used the internet service provider and whom they are talking to would result in creation of a customer profile and preference which would be monetised by way of targeted advertisement and all this amounts to stalking.”

Senior Advocate Harish Salve informed the Delhi High Court that the matter is pending before the Supreme Court and this is an attention-seeking endeavour by CCI.

Representing Facebook Mukul Rohatgi said that CCI proceedings must be kept in temporary suspension.

The counsel further notified the court that the Whatsapp policy was challenged in the Supreme Court in 2016 when Facebook bought the messaging app whatsapp in 2016 and the Centre had submitted a proper framework on this. Harish Salve on this note stated that this is not a competition issue.

The counsel on behalf of whatsapp added that user conversation is protected by end to end encryption. He also informed the court that the 2021 policy is also pending before the court. “Respect for privacy is coded since WhatsApp was started” the advocate representing Whatsapp Harish Salve said that it does not retain messages and are deleted from the servers after it is delivered.

Mukul Rohatgi who was appearing on behalf of Facebook informed the court that Facebook does not work according to WhatsApp’s policy.

Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi representing CCI in this matter stated the court that it is not a matter of privacy but of access to data.

Lekhi responded that data can have a privacy or competition facet. He also said that the issue is completely based on competition as to understand consumer behaviour and preferences that enable targeted advertising.

Concluding remarks as to why CCI intervened in the matter

The CCI is of opinion that  “users as owners of their personalised data are entitled to be informed about the extent scope and purpose of sharing of such data by WhatsApp with other Facebook Companies”. Nevertheless it appears from the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service which many of the information categories described therein are too broad vague and meaningless. For instance information on how users “interact with others (including businesses)” is not clearly defined what would constitute “service-related information” “mobile device information” “payments or business features” etc. are also undefined. It is also suitable to note that in countless places in the policy while illustrating the data to be collected the list is typical and not comprehensive due to usage of words like ‘includes’ ‘such as’ ‘For example’ etc which suggests that the scope of sharing may extend beyond the information categories that have been expressly mentioned in the policy. Such vagueness open-endedness and incomplete disclosures hide the actual data cost that a user incurs for availing WhatsApp services. It is also not clear from the policy whether the historical data of users would also be shared with Facebook Companies and whether data would be shared in respect of those WhatsApp users also who aren’t present on other apps of Facebook.

Conclusion

Data has such a noteworthy importance for businesses than at any other time whether it is for customized services or internal investigation or targeted advertising it has become capable of shifting competitive advantage. The CCI’s suo motto cognizance of Whatsapp’s privacy policy is one of the instances of this fact. It could be likewise of characteristic of CCI’s expectations to adopt more interventionist approach where it accepts that user’s data bring abused in a way that makes obstructions to entry and otherwise impacts competition or interests of the consumer. The CCI has wide powers under the Competition Act in the event of finding abuse of dominance and may pass such orders or requests as it deems fit. It will likewise be intriguing to perceive how the convergence among privacy and competition in the context of Data plays out over time and specifically how the CCI encompasses the limits of competition privacy and data protection concerns.

It opened last year. Amazon now has more than 50 warehouses in the Philly region. This warehouse has 283500 square feet. It is the largest of six Amazon facilities in the city but small by Amazon standards. Read more

When Connor Lord first arrived at the Amazon Fulfillment Center in West Deptford Township he was staggered by the sheer size of the place. After driving through the traffic light to the north of the warehouse its massive bulk dwarfed everything else in this stretch of suburban South Jersey.

“It’s intimidating at first seeing this big building it looked twice the size of the Linc” said Lord who worked as an apprentice carpenter at the Eagles stadium.

By square footage none of Amazon’s facilities in the Philadelphia area can match Lincoln Financial Field. But the company has infrastructure under construction in the region that comes close to the stadium’s size like a forthcoming mega-warehouse in New Castle Del. or the new fulfillment center in Carneys Point New Jersey down the river from the West Deptford facility.

Both of these warehouses will be well more than a million square feet once completed and are among nine new Amazon facilities that the company has announced for the region in the next year with more in the works. That’s in addition to 14 sites added in 2020 across the Lehigh Valley South Jersey northern Delaware Philadelphia and its collar counties.

According to the CoStar Group Amazon now has 57 buildings online or underway across this greater Philadelphia region. Real estate and industry analysts say they have never seen anything like the company’s explosive expansion.

“They’ve been gobbling up distribution space for more than five years in a big way but the pandemic really accelerated that growth” said Adrian Ponsen director of analytics with CoStar Group in Philadelphia. “There’s no single company that’s anywhere near on the scale of what they’re doing.”

Amazon’s expansion in Philadelphia is part of a worldwide hiring spree sparked by the pandemic. The company added roughly 500000 employees in 2020 according to company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including 400000 in the United States. Amazon hired nearly 175000 people from October through December alone far more than in any prior fourth quarter. The e-commerce giant employed 950000 Americans as of last year a company spokesperson said.

Meanwhile the company has grown its real estate footprint by 50% year-over-year in 2020 company executives told investors in February. Amazon now has more than 800 warehouses across the United States.

It’s not hard to see why the company is expanding. Amazon has done phenomenally well during 2020. Its already strong share price grew steadily throughout the early months of the pandemic reaching its highest-ever level in September as its fleets of trucks and legions of workers kept stay-at-home Americans well-supplied. In addition to delivering items Amazon is the nation’s largest cloud computing company and has a leading video streaming service. Already the world’s wealthiest man the company’s CEO Jeff Bezos saw his net worth grow by more than $60 billion in the last year to $190 billion Forbes estimated this month.

Amazon’s warehouse jobs start at $15 an hour while the company’s coveted high-paying positions are massing in other locations on the Northeast corridor. The second headquarters is being opened near Washington and 7000 highly paid white-collar Amazon jobs are now located in Boston. In New York City the company purchased the former Lord & Taylor flagship on Fifth Avenue as a hub for tech workers.

In the Philadelphia region during the pandemic Amazon began hiring for tens of thousands of jobs in its vast network of warehouses. The ecommerce giant posted more than 35000 job openings in 2020 by far the most of any employer in the metropolitan area according to the nonprofit University City District. The next closest were Lowe’s and Penn Medicine which posted about 5000 jobs each last year.

Amazon’s presence in the local labor market has grown exponentially. The 35000 job postings were a roughly 1600% increase from 2019. The University City District used data from Burning Glass Technologies a Boston software firm that scrapes the internet for public job postings. Amazon does not make regional-wide breakdowns available but said that it now has 25000 full- and part-time workers in Pennsylvania. Most of its infrastructure is concentrated in the southeast corner of the state.

The company’s regional strategy is partly focused on I-95 with the great majority of warehouses laced around the Northeast corridor highway. Many of Amazon’s earliest locations in the greater region were million-square-foot fulfillment centers in farther-flung locations like Easton Pa. and Robbinsville.

These enormous warehouses are where workers pick products for particular orders from vast subsections like toys or books and pack them for shipment to “sortation centers.” There they are arranged (“sorted”) by final destination and consolidated onto geographically targeted trucks.

From there packages go to the final-mile delivery centers like the warehouses in King of Prussia and South Philadelphia which are smaller and send out fleets of small vans to make direct deliveries.

Siting the warehouses along I-95 also allows the Philadelphia-area infrastructure especially the hulking fulfillment centers to help serve even larger markets to the north and south.

“From these centers they can serve not just Philadelphia but it’s pretty easy for them to hit either New York or Baltimore-Washington” says Ponsen. “It makes sense for them because it’s much cheaper to locate out there in Lehigh Bucks or South Jersey and those areas have big blue-collar population bases for them to hire.”

Amazon relied on shipping companies to deliver many items until about 2019 said Subodha Kumar a marketing and supply-chain professor at Temple’s Fox School of Business. Now the e-commerce giant is building the nation’s largest logistics firm to ship its own packages a sign of how much business it was giving its former partners FedEx and UPS. Amazon which also fulfills orders for third-party sellers using its platform will eventually ship more packages than its former partners Kumar said.

“This is where Amazon has really cracked the game or at least done an outstanding job compared to other companies” he said. “Initially they had some hiccups but now they have almost perfected the system.”

Amazon expects a surge in sales to continue this year and wants to move more shipments to two-hour delivery Kumar said. That combination of growing sales while slashing delivery times requires many more fulfillment and distribution centers close to customers.

”They have a grand agenda of going to 30-minute delivery as well” he said. “So that’s where we are going to see some big growth and this whole Northeast region is a big market for them.”

Philadelphia and Amazon have much to offer each other.

Amazon’s rapid growth in the region is not just a reflection of the increased demand for deliveries said economist Joel Naroff president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Bucks County. The Philadelphia area had been underserved by Amazon and was not a major distribution center.

“I think Amazon needed some catch-up in this area and that need was just accelerated by the pandemic” said Naroff.

The region also needs a fair share of the growing distribution sector calling warehousing “the new manufacturing job” he said. These jobs could be a good fit for Philadelphia which has a significantly underskilled workforce he added. Philadelphia trails other big East Coast cities like Boston and Washington in educational attainment according to Census estimates.

“Is $15 an hour with benefits a good job for an unskilled worker? I think the answer is ‘It’s a real good start’” Naroff said.

But many others want more despite the fact that Amazon this month handily defeated a concerted campaign to unionize workers at its Bessemer Ala. warehouse.

Some Amazon workers here have criticized their compensation and working conditions including one Philadelphia woman who claims she was fired for speaking up. Courtney Bowden 31 has a pending case against Amazon through the National Labor Relations Board.

Bowden was a package sorter at Amazon’s King of Prussia facility and an advocate for better working conditions. To campaign for paid time off she’d hand out red buttons reading “Amazonians United for PTO.” She’d also point out problems to management such as when Amazon was behind on paying workers for time spent on shuttle buses she said.

The King of Prussia facility did not have parking available for employees so the company picked up workers from a parking lot about five miles away she said and they were not paid for that travel time.

Amazon fired her in March 2020 just as the coronavirus started to sweep the country.

“They fired me because they knew that I was getting ready to start a coronavirus [safety] campaign” Bowden said. “I think they said ‘Courtney is definitely going to give us a problem.’” Amazon did not respond to questions about the case.

Some workers report the warehouse work to be dull with four 10-hour shifts a week that require near constant exertion. Nicholas Raymond Cicerone worked at the King of Prussia facility from May to November of 2020 but quit despite being upgraded from part-time worker to full-time.

“Honestly it was one of the worst jobs I ever had” said Cicerone who worked at Walmart on the weekends making $11 an hour while going to the Amazon site on weekdays for $15 an hour.

“At Amazon everything was nonstop but also the exact same every day” said Cicerone. “I liked working at Walmart a lot better. They were more accommodating and tried to make their employees happy.”

Amazon maintains that its attrition rate is on par with the industry average but did not provide numbers for the region.

Amazon’s technology

Other warehouse workers say that Amazon compares favorably with other jobs they’ve had in the sector citing its technology.

Since October Doun Yang has been working at the new Amazon last-mile delivery warehouse on 2400 Weccacoe Ave. behind the South Philadelphia Ikea. Yang says that the warehouse -- the largest of Amazon’s six facilities in Philadelphia but still small by the company’s standards -- is clean well-ordered and features up-to-date technology that makes the work less difficult and safer than a similar job he held at a UPS warehouse.

“I left UPS because the technology wasn’t up-to-date and I didn’t enjoy doing it as much because it’s not as organized” says Yang. “Amazon has their own system they follow and better equipment which makes the job a little easier.”

The warehouse where Yang works used to house a Hyundai-Rotem factory that manufactured train cars for public transit agencies in cities such as Philadelphia and Boston. Many of Amazon’s new facilities are similarly sited on old industrial sites like the former Fairless steel mill in Bucks County or the company’s forthcoming project in Wilmington where General Motors closed a factory in 2009.

CoStar’s Ponsen says these sites are useful both for their scale and because they virtually guarantee vast reserves of labor nearby which the company’s business model demands.

“One of the reasons that Harrisburg Lehigh Valley Bucks County have attracted so many of these distributors is because there needs to be some density of blue-collar labor where they’re going” says Ponsen.

With pay beginning at $15 an hour and health and retirement benefits included for full-time workers Amazon’s jobs can easily compete with most nonunion jobs though they don’t pay as much as traditional manufacturing jobs.

“It’s been decades since anyone was trying to rapidly expand in places like Lehigh Valley and lower Bucks County hiring thousands of non-college-educated workers” said Ponsen. “These are not as family-sustaining jobs as a lot of manufacturing sites that they’re filling in but it’s still a significant difference from companies leaving and nothing coming in.”

Amazon’s future growth in the region will depend on the extent to which brick-and-mortar retail can bounce back from the pandemic. It will also depend on the profitability of last-mile distribution centers.

“Amazon is a dynamic business and we are constantly exploring new locations” said Andre Woodson a Amazon spokesperson via email. “We weigh a variety of factors when deciding where to develop future sites to best serve customers. However Amazon has a policy of not commenting on our future roadmap.”

Amazon’s big rival is Walmart

During the pandemic Amazon has been competing with Walmart for the home-delivery market. The two companies are the largest private employers in the nation and Walmart is one of the few that operates at similar scale to Amazon.

“Amazon is grabbing all this customer base and they are at war with Walmart” says Richard Gorodesky senior managing director with Colliers International. “They have two different models Amazon doesn’t have stores for pickup -- at least not yet -- while Walmart has stores and has started home delivery. Assuming the consumer pie remains the same it’s a question of how the pie will be divided.”

In Amazon’s hunger for growth Gorodesky says it has been paying above-average industrial rents as it consumes ever more space.

“The question is ‘Do the last-mile delivery centers make money for them?’ If the answer is yes [long term] then they’ll continue to grow” says Gorodesky.

At the West Deptford Fulfillment Center Connor Lord said he liked working for Amazon at first. While physically exhausting it was relatively easy and he enjoyed getting to know his coworkers in the brief moments he had time to talk with them.

After the holiday crush however Lord grew increasingly disillusioned and compared Amazon’s culture unfavorably with his time in the National Guard.

“Coming from the Army officers always talk down on soldiers but they try to get acquainted with them too” says Lord. “But the bosses at Amazon they wouldn’t really care. They would think of you as more of a number or a robot.”

Lord ended up quitting in mid-March after four months confident that he can find a better-paying and less alienating job.

Where is Amazon headed?

Reflecting on his time at Amazon Lord feels something needs to change. He’d been following the Amazon unionization drive in Alabama where 6000 warehouse workers opted not to organize in the face of intense opposition from the company.

In an interview before the election results were known Lord said that unionization might actually make Amazon’s jobs sustainable as a longer-term career. His relatives have jobs as electricians carpenters or nurses. Many belong to unions.

“My family members their jobs the time they put in it definitely pays” said Lord. “Whereas with Amazon it’s more of a short-term job for someone who needs a few months’ wages to get by.”

Labor leaders in the Philadelphia region would not comment on whether they have plans to organize any Amazon facilities. But they do note that warehouse work has been unionized historically and that many jobs in the area still are especially in companies like UPS.

“There are talks about it” said Richard Hooker president of Teamsters Local 623 which counts many warehouse workers among its members. “We have to talk about how to stop this antilabor company from dominating all aspects of work. They are a grocery a delivery warehouses they are in everything. It’s not over. This is just the beginning.”

Labor sympathizers note that it took unionization campaigns to turn the manufacturing jobs of earlier decades into the family-sustaining positions that are eulogized today.

President Joe Biden at least seems to like the idea. In a precedent-breaking move he issued a video reminding workers in Bessemer that it was their right not the company’s to decide if they want to unionize. Although labor supporters cheered the statement it did not sway the outcome of the vote which Amazon won by more than a 2-1 ratio.

Bezos famous for keeping a ‘day-one’ start-up mentality at Amazon isn’t satisfied with the victory. “It’s clear to me that we need a better vision for how we create value for employees — a vision for their success” he wrote to shareholders last week.

For his part Lord said Amazon “might turn into a better place. But we got to see how Amazon plays it. They’re a powerful monopoly and they’re very intimidating. Time will tell with that.”

The company went public last month on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the biggest initial public offering (IPO) to date this year. The company is often dubbed “the Amazon of South Korea” but the comparison is overstated. The US online behemoth turned its first yearly profit nine years after its founding. Coupang ten years after its launch has yet to turn a profit. Over the past decade the South Korean equivalent to Amazon has amassed about $4.2 billion in losses.

It is almost a norm for early-stage start-ups to focus on revenue and investment growth at the expense of earnings. However less than two years ago Coupang — which raised $84.5 billion in its IPO — was on the edge of a crisis. It was quickly burning through the $2.7 billion received from its Japanese backer SoftBank — as the company attempted to outcompete other e-retailers and even encroach on big-box retailers’ perishable aisles with a series of aggressive moves such as early-morning and late-night deliveries in tune with the daily life of the country with the longest working hours in the wealthy world.

With this expansion Coupang could not recast South Korea’s highly competitive retail industry to its advantage in ways Amazon did in the United States nor break open a clear path to profitability or an IPO — up until 2019 Coupang’s operating loss almost irreversibly engulfed revenue thus overburdening Softbank which had been burned by the $9 billion WeWork debacle.

During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns boosted demand for Coupang’s online deliveries which helped narrow net losses to $567.6 million in 2020 from $770.2 million. This was good enough for the company to go public on the NYSE which was keen to embrace another cash-burning start-up regardless of its dubious potential for profitability. But the offering’s $84.5 billion windfall did not brighten the prospects for profit with one Coupang backer diverting a question by CNBC about profitability to instead focus on cash flows.

Still Coupang is an Amazon clone that exceeds the US company in its abusive labor practices. The South Korean company had aggressively expanded its logistics network to the point that 70 percent of the country’s population of 52 million is now within a seven-mile radius of its fulfillment centers.

The combination of a multitiered employment structure and algorithm-based surveillance of workers keeps money-losing operations efficient for management — and deadly for workers. To date eight fulfillment workers including two temporary ones have died of overwork according to an affiliate of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions. The latest victim was a forty-eight-year-old night-shift foreman identified only by his surname Yi.

Before he died of a cerebral hemorrhage in early March Yi might have considered himself a survivor: he was very close to gaining regular employee status after a year of temping. He worked nonstop at his fulfillment center and after hours he used Coupang’s supervisory app on his smartphone to track deliveries in hopes of becoming full-time with benefits under a fixed-term contract longer than a year — he had to outdo his coworkers and outlast two separate short-term contracts to join the top 15.5 percent of Coupang’s 13000-strong fulfillment workforce. Yi died two days after being posted to a new job with his new status.

Coupang is now the country’s third-largest employer behind only Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motors. In addition to an army of contract workers like Yi the company hires about forty thousand people on a daily basis via a smartphone app for the fulfillment centers. All these are possible thanks to a large pool of platform labor populated by precarious workers who depend on apps to land their gigs. As of 2019 one in every four South Korean workers is temporary according to the OECD.

Central to Coupang’s highly automated operations are algorithms meant to surveil and track workers. Even its own public relations video reveals that fulfillment workers use little safety gear while feeding high-speed conveyor belts.

Workers are required to carry a handheld device that tracks every single movement and monitors the speed and volume of their work. Their performances are measured in how many units they process each hour (UPH). UPH is not an hourly quota — it is instead used to measure all workers on the same line one against another in per-hour movements. The metric ensures all workers new and experienced compete against one another to work harder and faster. They skip bathroom breaks to keep up. Supervisors often publicly scold the laggards who will eventually be denied a new contract or gig.

In February when local press reports singled out UPH as cause of death for fulfillment workers Coupang released a vaguely worded statement claiming it had ridden “all systems” of “individual UPH.” I asked the company’s media contact what has replaced UPH to measure individual performance at fulfillment facilities. They haven’t responded.

“It is difficult to confirm whether UPH is repealed entirely” says Kim Han-byoul an organizer with the Korean Public Service and Transport Workers’ Union the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) affiliate attempting to unionize Coupang delivery drivers named “Coupang Friends.” “Coupang uses APH to keep drivers delivering more and faster.” The average-per-hour (APH) measure works similarly to UPH as it is used to monitor and rank the hourly performances of drivers working their designated area.

In its prospectus Coupang says its fifteen thousand parcel delivery drivers are full-time employees with benefits. But Kim argues that’s wrong: “Drivers are temporary workers whose contracts have to be renewed every year.” As with their fulfillment coworkers Coupang Friends are faced with competition-driven performance goals and job insecurity.

The condition is even worse for Coupang Eats which now has more than 210000 couriers who deliver food. The 210000 milestone was important to Coupang says Park Jung-hoon president of the Rider Union organizing these couriers because they have accomplished economies of scale to slash wages for the couriers. Coupang uses a complex fee structure to pay couriers depending on region and peak hours. “Fees can change every five minutes” says Park.

Coupang runs on job insecurity and precarity pressing its temporary and gig workers to the point of fatal exhaustion. The company is not exceptional in this regard. Pundits on both the Left and the Right tend to misunderstand algorithms and artificial intelligence: these technologies are more about workplace surveillance and intimidation than labor displacement. From Amazon to Alibaba Uber Eats to Deliveroo logistics capitalists around the world use surveillance algorithms to whip up fear and extract increased labor from desperate workers fattening their own purses despite slim prospects for company profitability.

Deliveroo’s recent IPO flop was telling. The Amazon-backed British food delivery start-up gave London its worst IPO in history as investors worried that regulators could take action against the gig economy — a rare capitalist admission that what keeps these firms afloat is a cheap pool of unregulated gig labor.

“Employers aggressively capitalize on the vulnerability insecurity and precarity of workers in the form of platform labor” Dr Lee Youngju a senior researcher with the Emancipation Institute for Labor Studies a Seoul-based independent labor think tank says. “Globally there is no clear regulatory definition of platform labor yet.”

In South Korea both Park’s and Kim’s unionization drives are in their incipiency. The two organizations are now seeking a joint campaign to call upon the National Assembly to legislate their work status as employees not contractors. In the UK on April 7 riders for Deliveroo held a strike for better pay and working conditions coinciding with the first day of the post-lockup share trading for the startup. Around the world the labor movement needs a coordinated pushback against the prevalence of algorithm-driven platform labor and temporary work on offer from companies like Coupang.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMS9kaWdpdGFsL25ld3MvYW1hem9uLWNhbmNlbHMtbG9yZC1vZi10aGUtcmluZ3MtZ2FtZS0xMjM0OTU0MjIxL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMS9kaWdpdGFsL25ld3MvYW1hem9uLWNhbmNlbHMtbG9yZC1vZi10aGUtcmluZ3MtZ2FtZS0xMjM0OTU0MjIxL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Cancels Plans for ‘Lord of the Rings’ Massively Multiplayer Game,"While Amazon is shelling out an epic $465 million for season 1 of its “Lord of the Rings” TV adaptation the company’s games unit has canceled plans to send players to J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth.

In 2019 Amazon Game Studios had announced plans for a massively multiplayer online game set in “a time long before the events of ‘The Lord of the Rings’ exploring lands people and creatures never seen before by fans of the Tolkien universe.”

Amazon had inked a deal to develop the free-to-play console/PC game title with Leyou Technologies a Hong Kong-based games company. After Chinese media and entertainment conglomerate Tencent Holdings acquired Leyou in December 2020 in a deal worth $1.5 billion Amazon and Tencent failed to reach a deal on revised contract terms for the “Lord of the Rings” game as first reported by Bloomberg — resulting in Amazon Game Studios bailing on the project.

“We love the ‘Lord of the Rings’ [intellectual property] and are disappointed that we won’t be bringing this game to customers” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. The team that was working on the “LOTR” prequel game will be moved to different projects according to Amazon.

Popular on Variety

News of the cancelation comes after Amazon Game Studios last year scrapped plans for “Crucible” a third-person last-one-standing game “of trust and betrayal.” The unit’s much-delayed “New World” a sandbox MMO game in which players engage in a struggle to conquer and colonize a “new world” wilderness has been rescheduled for summer 2021 release.

The “LOTR”-based game project was separate from Amazon Studios’ massive adaptation of “The Lord of the Rings” which encompasses a multi-season production commitment produced in cooperation with the Tolkien Estate and Trust HarperCollins and Warner Bros.’ New Line Cinema.

Leyou’s Athlon Games had previously announced a long-term licensing agreement with Middle-earth Enterprises a division of the Saul Zaentz Co. that owns exclusive worldwide rights to Tolkien’s literary works to develop and publish a “Lord of the Rings” video game."

Leading stock indexes continued their winning streak with S&P 500 maintaining the uptrend for the fourth week in a row and hitting a new high.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 34000-mark for the first time adding around 150 points in the last session. The sentiment was buoyed by encouraging retail sales data and reports of jobless claims falling.

The first-quarter earnings season got off to a good start with banking giants JPMorgan Chase Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs unveiling their latest financial data mid-week. They were joined by software firm Infosys on Wednesday.

The spotlight stayed on financial services Thursday also when the closely followed reports of Citigroup and Bank of America came out. Delta Air Lines and soft-drink behemoth PepsiCo released earnings on the same day. The first phase of bank earnings concluded on Friday with Morgan Stanley’s blockbuster Q1 report.

It’s going to be mixed bag next week. For instance the companies scheduled to report on April 19 include United Airlines Holdings IBM and Coca-Cola. The important corporate houses preparing to report on April 20 comprise Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson as well as streaming giant Netflix which has been thriving on the COVID-driven boom. The earning reports of superbike company Harley-Davidson and Lockheed Martin are also slated for Tuesday.

The other major companies that can elicit investor interest include Halliburton Verizon Communications Chipotle Mexican Grill and Kinder Morgan – the companies will report earnings on April 21. The next day it is the turn of American Airlines and Southwest Airlines as well as tech firms AT&T and Intel. American Express is probably the only big player to report on April 23.

The market was abuzz with the news of Microsoft’s $20-billion buyout of cloud software company Nuance Communications. In another important deal in the cloud space Datadog completed the acquisition of the SaaS-based security platform Sqreen.

The otherwise quiet M&A market witnessed Dell Technologies becoming two standalone public companies by spinning off its 81% ownership in VMware. The other major deals include Amgen’s $2-billion purchase of Five Prime Therapeutics and the acquisition of Upchain by software firm Autodesk.

“It was kind of love at first sight for me” Bill Erter said.

They met one night on the dance floor of their favorite night club and the rest was history. Bonnie Erter learned the two-step through a dance group at her Methodist church.

“I was big into music already so dancing just came naturally” Bonnie Erter said. "" I danced quite a while before I met Bill and did compete.”

That’s what caught Bill Erter’s interest. Her skills on the dance floor and her experience in competition western dance something Bill Erter was interested in pursuing.

“Then we got invited to form a dance team and compete on the United Country Western Dance Council” Bill Erter said.

The dance council is basically the Olympics of country-western dance. They’ve won competitions and while their hard work is rewarded they really do try to make the most out of life.

It’s something that two people can do together and you can go anywhere in the world” Bill Erter said. ""As long as there’s a downbeat to the music you can dance.”

They now spread the joy of country-western dancing by teaching class at Billy Bob’s every Sunday.

They say the best part about it is that it brings people in from all walks of life. The Erters have been dancing together for more than 30 years and hope for many more years to come."

The United States has made previous attempts to reemerge as a dominant player in a rare earths supply chain that is responsible for some of the most important materials involved in electric vehicle production battery making renewable energy systems and technology manufacturing. Under the Biden administration the effort is receiving renewed focus with massive investments planned in climate change technology and a hard line being taken on geopolitical rivalries and the national security threat posed by China. In 2019 China was responsible for 80% of rare earths imports according to the U.S. Geological Survey although exports fell last year in part due to Covid-19. President Biden's sweeping $2 trillion infrastructure legislation seeks to remake the power and transportation markets in the U.S. and rebuild the country's semiconductor industry. It follows Biden signing an executive order in February designed to review gaps in the domestic supply chains for rare earths medical devices chips and other key resources and in March the Department of Energy announcing a $30 million initiative that will tap into researching and securing the U.S. domestic supply chain for rare earths and other important minerals in battery-making such as cobalt and lithium.

'Cornering of the market'

""It's absolutely correct there is a cornering of the market with lithium and other rare earths"" Biden climate envoy John Kerry recently said at a CNBC Evolve summit on the future of energy innovation. But efforts in the recent past to rival China in the rare earths market and rebuild a domestic industry have been stymied. ""It's technically possible to try and rebuild the entire supply chain because we once had it"" says Jane Nakano a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic International Studies' Energy Security and Climate Change Program. ""It's not that we're not experienced it's not that we have no idea of what the domestic supply chain may look like"" Nakano said but she added that business environmental and political factors may make the effort difficult to achieve especially over a short-time frame.

On May 26 Eamon Javers leads a critical discussion with two key players in cybersecurity: John Demers & Michael Orlando. Join them.

Success is dependent on whether the U.S. can quickly scale up processing and refining after the mining of the resources and compete on cost with a magnet-making and processing market that's heavily dominated by China. Once extracted from mines rare earths are shipped to separation facilities where they are separated from other minerals. Then rare earths are individually separated into oxides metals and finally magnets that are used in everything from missiles to wind turbines medical devices power tools cellphones and motors for hybrid and electric vehicles.

China's rare earths dominance

Rare earth metals are actually more abundant than their name suggests but extracting processing and refining are tricky for a myriad of technical and environmental reasons. These 17 elements — which are subdivided into the light rare earths and heavy rare earths subsets based on their atomic weights — exist in natural deposits globally. Heavy rare earths are often harder to source. They include metals like dysprosium and terbium which play a critical role in defense technology and electric vehicles. Neodymium and praseodymium are some of the most sought-after light rare earth elements crucial in products such as motors turbines and medical devices. Demand for them exploded in recent years with the growth of technology and will continue to climb amid the ongoing race to create a large electric vehicle market. While China is dominant now in the decades before the 1980s it was the U.S. that held a majority stake in this metals market. That changed as production growth abroad and mounting environmental pressures at home shifted production overseas and also offered cheaper labor costs. According to one 2018 report from the Department of Defense China ""strategically flooded the global market"" with rare earths at cheaper prices to drive out and deter current and future competitors. ""If the material specification fits and the price is a dollar better then you go for the dollar better"" said Koray Kose senior director of supply chain research at Gartner. The three most important materials used in magnets include neodymium dysprosium and terbium. Terbium is one of the toughest to come by because production extraction and magnet-making are focused on China. Trade wars and retaliatory tariffs can leave many companies sourcing these crucial materials in limbo even if they make up just a small portion of a product. Market dynamics can escalate so quickly that companies without a diversified supply chain bid aggressively materials get scarce and prices go up Kose said. In 2011 for example rare earth prices shot up when China restricted exports to maintain supplies for domestic industries which was the case again during the 2019 trade war.

Rebuilding a domestic supply chain

Domestic efforts to extract rare earths are taking place in states including Wyoming Texas and California but the recent past provides cautionary tales such as Molycorp which reopened the longstanding Mountain Pass mine in California in the early 2000s only to go bankrupt in 2015. MP Materials bought the mine and restarted production in 2017. The Las Vegas-headquartered company is vying to restore the domestic rare earths supply chain from mine to magnet and is hedging its bets on neodymium-praseodymium with the hope of becoming the lowest-cost producer. In recent years the Las Vegas-headquartered company received a myriad of grants and contracts from the Department of Defense and Department of Energy to research and improve domestic capabilities. One of the company's largest customers is Shenghe Resources a Chinese company responsible for processing distributing and refining which also owns a stake in the company. The connection raised some concerns among DOE scientists according to Reuters but government funding has continued for a rare earths separation facility. Shenghe Resources distributes the concentrate produced at Mountain Pass to refiners in Asia ""capabilities that simply do not exist at scale in the West"" according to an MP Materials spokesman. The company plans to reinvest the free cash flow generated from operations into expanding MP's U.S. capabilities including a restoration of domestic refining capability at Mountain Pass by next year. Ultimately the company which went public last year through a SPAC merger plans to ""restore the full rare earth supply chain"" to the U.S. the spokesman said including refining and separation and magnet-making by 2025 as the domestic electric vehicle market ramps up production. ""This is happening and I think it's happening much much faster than I think anybody had anticipated"" said Ryan Corbett the company's chief financial officer. ""We can compete and we're going to continue to do it."" Another key player in the space is Lynas Corporation  one of the largest processors of rare earths outside China. The Australian mining company which operates a separation facility in Malaysia recently received $30.4 million in funding from the Pentagon to build a Texas light rare earths processing facility and earned another contract in partnership with Blue Line Corp. also based in Texas to build a heavy rare earths separation facility. A Lynas spokeswoman referred to the new facilities in an email to CNBC as an ""essential foundation"" for renewing downstream metal making and implementing magnet manufacturing into the U.S. She wrote that diversifying outside the Chinese magnetic materials supply chain is important to create competitive markets and meet the growing demand for 21st-century technologies.

Resource extraction and the environment

While companies like Lynas and MP Materials are eager to ramp up the domestic supply chains extracting rare earths is a difficult process due to a combination of environmental technical and political factors. Many regions including the European Union have an abundance of these resources but lack the expertise that other countries like China have in the processing and magnet production Nakano said. The rare earths industry has come under fire for environmental concerns. Many rare earth elements reside among mineral deposits with radioactive materials that can leach into the water table. Mining processing and disposal can also contribute to ecosystem disruption and release hazardous byproducts into the atmosphere. Although the U.S. is making strides to advance the rare earths supply chain and develop alternatives to mining rare earths environmental regulations are often more stringent than inside China. In recent years Lynas came under scrutiny from activists and the Malaysian government for radioactive waste that it produces as part of its enrichment process. Lynas has said that the low-levels of radioactive waste were not dangerous and the Malaysian government ultimately renewed the license and green-lighted a construction plan for a permanent disposal and waste treatment facility in August 2020. Some companies have proposed extracting rare earths from coal while others suggest setting up a system for recycling old batteries or disk drives. Suggestions include calls to utilize shipping services like Amazon or USPS to set up a recycling system but these endeavors can be costly Nakano says. Recycling of key raw materials used in the EV space is receiving greater investment focus. Some emerging battery recycling leaders include Redwood Materials a start-up from former Tesla CTO JB Straubel and Li-Cycle which recently announced plans to go public through a SPAC-merger. The Ames Laboratory in Iowa is one of the many Department of Energy's national laboratories working on projects aimed at substituting rare earths or finding new more eco-friendly methods to recover them. One initiative by researcher Ikenna Nlebedim is a rare-earth magnet recycling process designed to recover rare earth oxides without the hazardous acids or fumes associated. Scientists are also using the process to recover byproducts like copper and nickel. Another laboratory in Idaho is looking at how potato wastewater can be used as a cheap food source for a bacterium that can assist in recycling rare earths. ""We already have the magnets here"" says Tom Lograsso director of DOE's Critical Materials Institute at Ames. ""Why can't we just retain that and close the circle domestically rather than throwing them in a landfill.""

Limits to countering China

In a recent interview with CNBC following the UAE's Regional Climate Dialogue Kerry addressed the president's $2 trillion infrastructure proposal in relation to rivalry with China. The legislation includes $35 billion for climate research and innovation $46 billion in renewable energy manufacturing and $174 billion to boost the electric vehicle market. China which accounts for roughly 30% of carbon dioxide emissions globally claims it plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2060 and outspent the U.S. roughly 2-to-1 on energy transition-related investments in the last decade according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data.

(Published 2021),"Chinese regulators met with executives from Tesla recently after several government agencies reported “an unusual acceleration” of complaints from consumers about battery fires and other quality issues with the company’s electric cars.

In a post on the Chinese social media platform WeChat the State Administration for Market Regulation said officials from five government agencies interviewed Tesla executives and “asked them to strictly abide by Chinese laws and regulations strengthen internal management and implement corporate quality and safety regulations.”

Tesla acknowledged its “shortcomings in the business process” and agreed to improve the quality and safety of its vehicles the regulator said in the posting.

The electric carmaker has struggled with quality issues as it has scaled its production from tens of thousand cars a year to 500000 in 2020. On social media customers have documented numerous problems with new Teslas including large gaps between body panels poor paint jobs and chipped glass. Those complaints have been echoed in surveys about and reviews of the company’s cars by J.D. Power and Consumer Reports.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3JvYWRzaG93L25ld3MvdG95b3RhLWJ6NHgtZXYtY29uY2VwdC1zdXYtZGVidXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toyota BZ4X EV concept launches new 'Beyond Zero' branding,"Toyota has announced a new global series of seven full-electric vehicles under its ""Beyond Zero"" brand. The first of this battery-powered batch to wear the ""BZ"" badge is the BZ4X Concept SUV which makes its debut this week.

The automaker's larger push toward carbon neutrality includes expanding its global electrified vehicle portfolio -- which includes hydrogen fuel cell electric hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles -- to a total of 70 models by 2025. Of those 15 will be full battery electric vehicles seven of which will be part of the Beyond Zero brand. And yes Toyota trucks will get in on the action with hybrid and BEV powertrains coming for the automaker's pickup lineup ""in the near future.""

The BZ4X Concept is a battery electric SUV built on Toyota's e-TNGA platform though most of Roadshow's staff think it looks pretty close to production-ready based on the released photos. The exterior design reminds me of the RAV4 but amazingly even more angular and sharply creased. Contrasting trim around the wheel arches is finished in glossy black -- rather than the more common rugged matte -- and up front the BZ4X's fascia has been sculpted for the unique aerodynamic and cooling needs of an electric car. That means significantly smaller grille openings than the gaping maws of Toyota's current design language.

Scale is difficult to tell from photos but the SUV looks to be approximately the same length as the RAV4 but with the long wheelbase and short overhangs afforded by the electric vehicle platform. Think Lexus NX length with the RX's wheelbase; Hyundai and Kia will pull off a similar trick with their upcoming Ioniq 5 and EV6 electric SUVs.

Inside the BZ4X features an ""open-concept interior"" with an oddly positioned digital instrument cluster. The gauge display sits low and far forward on the dashboard atop what I'm calling an inverted cowl. Toyota says this orientation will ""help expand the vehicle's sense of space but also help increase visibility to aid in safe and secure driving."" I think it just looks weird.

At the center of the dashboard is what appears to be a large widescreen display above a bank of climate control buttons. Further down on the floating center console are the electronic shifter and physical buttons for various vehicle and safety systems including what appears to be a button for a one-pedal driving mode similar to the Nissan Leaf's e-Pedal.

Even with the weird gauge placement the interior looks production ready. Toyota

Near the base of the center console is what appears to be a large translucent blue panel. Maybe it's a touchpad for the infotainment; maybe it's a fancy cover for a storage nook. I'm hoping for the latter: Trackpads are for laptops not cars.

Toyota hasn't announced powertrain details or range but we know that the BZ4X is a joint development with Subaru and will feature electric all-wheel drive. Subaru is rumored to be working on its own electric SUV -- likely called the Evoltis -- built on the same e-TNGA platform.

Looking at the BZ4X closely it's hard to consider it a concept. The design appears to have all of the street-legal exterior bits. The interior is fully realized right down to the button blanks. Plus Toyota seems poised to crank up BZ4X production in Japan and China soon. Worldwide sales are starting in 2022. Details regarding US availability will ""be shared at a later date.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzE3L3VuLXJlYmVsLWRlbmlzLWhhbGxpZGF5LW9uLXRoZS1jb2xsYXBzZS1vZi10aGUtdXMtZG9taW5hdGVkLXdvcmxkLW9yZGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UN rebel Denis Halliday on the collapse of the U.S.-dominated world order,"Denis Halliday is an exceptional figure in the world of diplomacy. In 1998 after a 34-year career with the United Nations — including as an assistant secretary-general and the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq — he resigned when the UN Security Council refused to lift sanctions against Iraq.

Halliday saw at first hand the devastating impact of this policy which had led to the deaths of as many as 500000 children under the age of five and hundreds of thousands more older children and adults and he called the sanctions a genocide against the people of Iraq.

Since 1998 Halliday has been a powerful voice for peace and for human rights around the world. He sailed in the Freedom Flotilla to Gaza in 2010 when 10 of his companions on a Turkish ship were shot and killed in an attack by the Israeli armed forces.

I interviewed Denis Halliday recently from his home in Ireland.

Denis 20 years after you resigned from the UN over the sanctions on Iraq the United States is now imposing similar ""maximum pressure"" sanctions against Iran Venezuela Cuba and North Korea denying their people access to food and medicines in the midst of a pandemic. What would you like to say to Americans about the real-world impact of these policies?

I'd like to begin with explaining that the sanctions imposed by the Security Council against Iraq led very much by the United States and Britain were unique in the sense that they were comprehensive. They were open-ended meaning that they required a Security Council decision to end them which of course never actually happened and they followed immediately upon the Gulf War [of 1991].

The Gulf War led primarily by the United States but supported by Britain and some others undertook the bombing of Iraq and targeted civilian infrastructure which is a violation of the Geneva Conventions and they took out all electric power networks in the country.

This completely undermined the water treatment and distribution system of Iraq which depended upon electricity to drive it and drove people to use contaminated water from the Tigris and the Euphrates. That was the beginning of the death knell for young children because mothers were not breast-feeding they were feeding their children with child formula but mixing it with foul water from the Tigris and the Euphrates.

That bombing of infrastructure including communications systems and electric power wiped out the production of food horticulture and all the other basic necessities of life. They also closed down exports and imports and they made sure that Iraq was unable to export its oil which was the main source of its revenue at the time.

In addition to that they introduced a new weapon called depleted uranium which was used by the U.S. forces driving the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait. That was used again in southern Iraq in the Basra area and led to a massive accumulation of nuclear debris which led to leukemia in children and that took three four or five years to become evident.

So when I got to Iraq in 1998 the hospitals in Baghdad and also of course in Basra and other cities were full of children suffering from leukemia. Meantime adults had gotten their own cancer mainly a blood cancer diagnosis. Those children we reckon perhaps 200000 children died of leukemia. At the same time Washington and London withheld some of the treatment components that leukemia requires again it seemed in a genocidal manner denying Iraqi children the right to remain alive.

And as you quoted 500000 that was a statement made by Madeleine Albright the then-American ambassador to the United Nations who live on CBS was asked the question about the loss of 500000 children and she said that the loss of 500000 children was "" worth it "" in terms of bringing down Saddam Hussein which did not happen until the military invasion of 2003.

So the point is that the Iraqi sanctions were uniquely punitive and cruel and prolonged and comprehensive. They remained in place no matter how people like myself or others and not just me alone but UNICEF and the agencies of the UN system — many states including France China and Russia — complained bitterly about the consequences on human life and the lives of Iraqi children and adults.

My desire in resigning was to go public which I did. Within one month I was in Washington doing my first congressional briefing on the consequences of these sanctions driven by Washington and London.

So I think the United States and its populace who vote these governments in need to understand that the children and the people of Iraq are just like the children of the United States and England and their people. They have the same dreams same ambitions of education and employment and housing and vacations and all the things that good people care about. We're all the same people and we cannot sit back and think somehow ""We don't know who they are they're Afghans they're Iranians they're Iraqis. So what? They're dying. Well we don't know it's not our problem this happens in war."" I mean all that sort of rationale as to why this is unimportant.

And I think that aspect of life in the sanctions world continues whether it's Venezuela whether it's Cuba which has been ongoing now for 60 years. People are not aware or don't think in terms of the lives of other human beings identical to ourselves here in Europe or in the United States. It's a frightening problem and I don't know how it can be resolved. We now have sanctions on Iran and North Korea. So the difficulty is to bring alive that we are killing people with sanctions. They're not a substitute for war — they are a form of warfare.

I think that brings us to another question. Whereas the sanctions on Iraq were approved by the UN Security Council what we're looking at today in the world is for the most part the U.S. using the power of its financial system to impose unilateral sieges on these countries even as the U.S. is also still waging war in at least half a dozen countries mostly in the greater Middle East. Medea Benjamin and I recently documented that the U.S. and its allies have dropped 326000 bombs and missiles on other countries in all these wars just since 2001. That's not counting the First Gulf War.

You worked for the UN and UNDP for 34 years and the UN was conceived of as a forum and an institution for peace and to confront violations of peace by any countries around the world. But how can the UN address the problem of a powerful aggressive country like the United States that systematically violates international law and then abuses its veto and diplomatic power to avoid accountability?

Yes when I talk to students I try to explain that there are two United Nations: there's a United Nations of the Secretariat led by the secretary-general and staffed by people like myself and 20000 or 30000 more worldwide through UNDP and the agencies. We operate in every country and most of it is developmental or humanitarian. It's good work it has real impact whether it's feeding Palestinians or it's UNICEF work in Ethiopia. This continues.

Where the UN collapses is in the Security Council in my view and that is because in Yalta in 1945 Roosevelt Stalin and Churchill having noted the failure of the League of Nations decided to set up a United Nations that would have a controlling entity which they then called the Security Council. And to make sure that worked — in their interests I would say — they established this five-power veto group and they added France and they added China. And that five is still in place.

That's 1945 and this is 2021 and they're still in power and they're still manipulating the United Nations. As long as they stay there and they manipulate I think the UN is doomed. The tragedy is that the five veto powers are the very member states that violate the charter violate human rights conventions and will not allow the application of the International Criminal Court to their war crimes and other abuses.

On top of that they are the countries that manufacture and sell weapons and we know that weapons of war are possibly the most profitable product you can produce. So their vested interest is control is the military capacity is interference. It's a neocolonial endeavor an empire in reality to control the world as the way they want to see it. Until that is changed and those five member states agree to dilute their power and play an honest role I think we're doomed. The UN has no capacity to stop the difficulties we're faced with around the world.

That's a pretty damning prognosis. In this century we're facing such incredible problems between climate change and the threat of nuclear war still hanging over all of us made possibly more dangerous because of the lack of treaties and the lack of cooperation between the nuclear powers notably the U.S. and Russia. This is really an existential crisis for humanity. There is also of course the UN General Assembly and they stepped up on nuclear weapons with the new Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) which has now officially entered into force. And every year when it meets the General Assembly regularly and almost unanimously condemns the U.S. sanctions regime against Cuba.

When I wrote my book about the war in Iraq my final recommendations were that the senior American and British war criminals responsible for the war should be held criminally accountable and that the U.S. and the U.K. should pay reparations to Iraq for the war. Could the General Assembly possibly be a venue to build support for Iraq to claim reparations from the U.S. and the U.K. or is there another venue where that would be more appropriate?

I think you're right on target. The tragedy is that the decisions of the Security Council are binding decisions. Every member state has got to apply and respect those decisions. So if you violate a sanctions regime imposed by the council as a member state you're in trouble. The General Assembly resolutions are not binding.

You've just referred to a very important decision which is the decision about nuclear weapons. We've had a lot of decisions on banning various types of weapons over the years. Here in Ireland we were involved in anti-personnel mines and other things of that sort and it was by a large number of member states but not the guilty parties not the Americans not the Russians not the Chinese not the British. The ones who control the veto power game are the ones who do not comply. Just like Clinton was one of the proposers I think of the ICC but when it came to the end of the day the United States doesn't accept it has a role vis-à-vis themselves and their war crimes The same is true of other large states that are the guilty parties in those cases.

So I would go back to your suggestion about the General Assembly. It could be enhanced and there's no reason why it couldn't be changed but it requires tremendous courage on the part of member states. It also requires acceptance by the five veto powers that their day has come to an end because in reality the UN carries very little cachet nowadays to send a UN mission into a country like Myanmar or Afghanistan.

I think we have no power left we have no influence left because they know who runs the organization they know who makes the decisions. It's not the secretary-general. It's not people like me. We are dictated to by the Security Council. I resigned effectively from the Security Council. They were my bosses during that particular period of my career.

I have a lecture I do on reforming the Security Council making it a North-South representative body which would find Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa You'd get very different decisions. You'd get the sort of decisions we get in the General Assembly: much more balanced much more aware of the world and its north and south and all those other variations. But of course again we can't reform the council until the five veto powers agree to that. That is the huge problem.

Yes in fact when that structure was announced in 1945 with the Security Council the five permanent members and the veto Albert Camus who was the editor of the French Resistance newspaper Combat wrote a front-page editorial saying this was the end of any idea of international democracy. So as with so many other issues we live in these nominally democratic countries but the people of a country like the United States are only told what our leaders want us to know about how the world works. So if reform of the Security Council is needed it would be a massive process of education and democratic reform around the world to build a popular movement to demand that kind of change.

Another thing that is very underreported in the U.S. is that out of desperation after 20 years of war in Afghanistan Secretary of State Tony Blinken has finally asked the UN to lead a peace process for a ceasefire between the U.S.-backed government and the Taliban. That could move the conflict into the political realm and end the civil war that resulted from the U.S. invasion occupation and endless bombing campaign. There is supposed to be a meeting soon in Istanbul led by an experienced UN negotiator Jean Arnault who helped bring peace to Guatemala and then between Colombia and the FARC. The U.S. specifically asked China Russia and Iran to be part of this process as well. Both sides in Afghanistan have agreed to come to Istanbul and see what they can agree on. So is that a constructive role for the UN? Does that offer a chance of peace for the people of Afghanistan?

If I were a member of the Taliban and I was asked to negotiate with a government that is only in power because it's supported by the United States I would question whether it's an even keel. Are we equally powerful can we talk to each other one-to-one? The answer I think is no.

The UN chap whoever he is poor man is going to have the same difficulty. He is representing the United Nations a Security Council dominated by the United States and others as the Afghans are perfectly well aware. The Taliban have been fighting for a hell of a long time and making no progress because of the interference of the U.S. troops which are still on the ground. I just don't think it's an even playing field.

So I'd be very surprised if that works. I absolutely hope it might. I would think in my view if you want a lasting relationship within a country it's got to be negotiated within the country without military or other interference or fear of further bombing attacks or all the rest of it. I don't think we have any credibility as the UN under those circumstances. It'll be a very tough slog.

The irony is that the United States set aside the UN Charter when it attacked Yugoslavia in 1999 to carve out what is now the semi-recognized country of Kosovo and then to attack Afghanistan and Iraq. The UN Charter at its heart prohibits the threat or use of force by one country against another. But that is what the U.S. set aside.

And then you have to remember that the U.S. is attacking a fellow member state of the United Nations without hesitation with no respect for the charter. Perhaps people forget that Eleanor Roosevelt drove and succeeded in establishing the Declaration of Human Rights an extraordinary achievement which is still valid. It's a biblical instrument for many of us who work in the UN.

So the neglect of the charter and the spirit and the wording of the charter by the five veto members — perhaps in Afghanistan it was Russia now it's the United States — the Afghans have had foreign intervention up to their necks and beyond and the British have been involved there since the 18th century almost. So they have my deepest sympathy. I hope this thing can work.

I brought that up because the U.S. with its dominant military power after the end of the Cold War made a conscious choice that instead of living according to the UN Charter it would live by the sword by the law of the jungle: ""Might makes right."" It took those actions because it could because no other military force was there to stand up against it. At the time of the first Gulf War a Pentagon consultant told the New York Times that with the end of the Cold War the U.S. could finally conduct military operations in the Middle East without worrying about starting World War III. So they took the demise of the Soviet Union as a green light for these systematic widespread actions that violate the UN Charter.

But now what is happening in Afghanistan is that the Taliban once again control half the country. We're approaching the spring and the summer when the fighting traditionally gets worse and so the U.S. is calling in the UN out of desperation because frankly without a ceasefire their government in Kabul is just going to lose more territory. So the U.S. has chosen to live by the sword and in this situation it's now confronting dying by the sword.

What's tragic Nicolas is that in our lifetime the Afghanis ran their own country. They had a monarchy they had a parliament — I met and interviewed women ministers from Afghanistan in New York — and they managed it. It was when the Russians interfered and then the Americans interfered and then bin Laden set up his camp there and that was justification for destroying what was left of Afghanistan.

And then Bush Cheney and a few of the boys decided although there was no justification whatsoever to bomb and destroy Iraq because they wanted to think that Saddam Hussein was involved with al-Qaida which of course was nonsense. They wanted to think he had weapons of mass destruction which also was nonsense. The UN inspectors said that again and again but nobody would believe them.

It's deliberate neglect of the one last hope. The League of Nations failed and the UN was the next best hope and we have deliberately turned our backs upon it neglected it and distrusted it. When we get a good Secretary General like Dag Hammarskjold we murder him. He was definitely killed because he was interfering in the dreams of the British in particular and perhaps the Belgians in Katanga. It's a very sad story and I don't know where we go from here.

Well where we seem to be going from here is to a loss of American power around the world because the U.S. has so badly abused its power. In the U.S. we keep hearing that this is a Cold War between the U.S. and China or maybe the U.S. China and Russia. As you say the UN Security Council needs reform and hopefully the American people are beginning to understand that we cannot unilaterally rule the world that the ambition for a U.S. global empire is an incredibly dangerous pipe dream that has led us to an impasse.

Perhaps the only good thing coming out of COVID-19 is the slow realization that if everybody doesn't get a vaccine we fail because we the rich and the powerful with the money and the vaccines will not be safe until we make sure the rest of the world is safe from COVID and the next one that's coming along the track.

This implies that if we don't do trade with China or other countries we have reservations about because we don't like their government — we don't like communism we don't like socialism whatever it is — we just have to live with that because without each other we can't survive. With the climate crisis and all the other issues related to that we need each other more than ever perhaps. We need collaboration. It's just basic common sense that we work and live together.

The U.S. has something like 800 military bases around the world of various sizes. China is certainly surrounded and this is a very dangerous situation totally unnecessary. And now the rearming with fancy new nuclear weapons when we already have nuclear weapons that are 20 times bigger than the one that destroyed Hiroshima. Why on earth? It's just irrational nonsense to continue these programs and it just doesn't work for humanity.

I would hope the U.S. would perhaps start retreating and sorting out its own domestic problems which are quite substantial. I'm reminded every day when I look at CNN here in my home about the difficulties of race and all the other things that you're well aware of that need to be addressed. Being policeman to the world was a bad decision."

Centurion Lounge Policy Change “Disclosed”

American Express has changed who can access its Centurion lounges beginning in February 2023. However they didn’t really announce the new $50 per person guest charge rather they simply changed their terms and conditions and astute bloggers caught it. The new change maintains that Hong Kong and London Centurion lounge guest access will remain unchanged likely due to contractual agreements with cardholders therein.

The current policy allows American Express Platinum and Centurion cardholders to access the lounge so long as they present a boarding pass showing confirmed reservations for same-day travel. Each cardholder (including authorized users) is presently permitted to bring two complimentary guests into the lounge with them.

Centurion cardholders will remain exempt from the limitation as will those who achieve spending of $75000 in a calendar year with 2022 as the first year in which that spend will be tallied.

The Problem They Are Trying To Solve

There are too many people in American Express Centurion Lounges. That was true before the pandemic and social distancing hasn’t helped matters. Airport rent is expensive and making larger lounges has to stop at a certain point. This is especially true since there’s no direct revenue from the lounges just an implied reason for holders of the personal and business Platinum card from American Express to continue paying their annual fees.

Turning guests away or asking them to wait to visit is not popular among members nor is the increasing difficulty in securing seats at many of the lounges. American Express already invests an incredible amount into the soft product with expensive chef-designed menus and premium cocktails. But even the wi fi in many locations is becoming constrained.

The bank simultaneously needs more customers more revenue and fewer visitors – a tall order.

Collateral Damage

There are some affected by this change that really do not contribute to the problem. Families occupy a minor presence in the lounges but are significantly affected.

Take my situation for example. I hold both a business and personal version of the Platinum card my wife holds one too in her own right. My daughter however will not be eligible for an authorized user account for several years (minors cannot be added as authorized users until they reach the age of 13.) In my specific example my family pays three annual fees but unless I pay an additional entrance fee my family won’t be permitted which will leave all of us on the outside looking in.

Before you dispute my assertion to suggest that it’s actually freeloading families bringing in parties of six on a single annual fee and an authorized user (with their two guest children each) I’d point you in the direction of the family rooms. My family frequents the Centurion lounge whenever we travel together on a major trip in which we have time to visit. We have encountered precisely one other child (without their parent no less) in the family room on any of those dozens of visits.

I have seen plenty of consultants (one of the many hats I wear) bringing in co-workers filling their plates at the buffet and trading stories at the bar. To be fair Platinum card members are well within their right to bring up to two guests free of charge and they should – Platinum and Centurion AMEX cards aren’t cheap.

However I find little merit in the suggestion that it’s all these pesky families causing problems of crowding. Families generally consume less food on a per guest basis far less alcohol and often occupy space exclusively for them leaving the rest of the lounge to other cardholders. Families are not the problem.

Three couples on a weekend getaway enter the lounge on a single annual fee and an authorized user. Each cardholder can access the lounge plus their two guests each.

In 2023 that option goes away for all the examples (my family weekend three couple trip consultant and peers) but in our specific case and those with children under the age of 13 we don’t even have the opportunity to add them as authorized users. The consultant could pay one time and add up to three additional cardholders for the same $175 fee (which actually could make the problem worse) but younger families are ineligible.

Conclusion

There’s no perfect system to process policy/impact how and where product changes are made. Centurion lounges need a manner by which to reduce their visitor load and this accomplishes that goal. However families are disproportionately affected as collateral damage for other bad actors which is both frustrating and disappointing. This cardholder would at least like a provision that allows for a “family pass” or a younger authorized user to be able to enter as we expect. If holding three Platinum cards isn’t enough to get three people through the hallowed gates of the Centurion lounge then maybe I don’t need any Platinum cards at all.

What do you think? Are families disproportionately affected by this change? Should there be a lower age requirement for adding authorized users?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZHMvYWlybGluZXMvdW5pdGVkLXF1ZXN0LXZzLWRlbHRhLXNreW1pbGVzLXBsYXRpbnVtLWFtZXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comparing the United Quest Card to the Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.

For a long time there were primarily two classes of rewards credit cards: Those that cost $100 or less per year in annual fees and then ones that were $500 or more per year. Naturally the $500-plus per year premium cards came with many more perks than those that cost under $100. But there's a whole lot of runway between those two annual fee amounts.

Luckily for those looking for a different option in the sweet spot between the entry-level and premium tiers in recent years the space for credit cards with annual fees costing between $200 and $300 per year has started to fill out a bit. This included splashes such as the big American Express® Gold Card revamp in 2018 ($250 per year; see rates and fees) and the trend continues now with the very recent introduction of the New United Quest Card which comes with an annual fee of $250.

In the world of airline credit cards the most head-to-head competitor to the United Quest Card at this mid-tier level is likely the Delta SkyMiles® Platinum American Express Card which also comes with a $250-per-year price tag (see rates and fees). These two cards are issued by different banks and provide miles and perks valid at different airlines but they also share many similarities.

Let's see how these two cards stack up in a head-to-head competition.

Welcome bonus

Both of these mid-tier airline cards come with impressive welcome bonuses right now.

The new United Quest Card offers up to 100000 bonus miles with its introductory offer. This bonus is awarded in two parts: 80000 bonus United miles after $5000 in spending in the first three months and another 20000 miles after a total of $10000 in spending in the first six months. TPG values the full 100000-mile bonus at $1300.

The Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex is currently offering 90000 bonus miles after you spend $3000 on purchases in the first three months of account opening for a limited time (offer ends May 5 2021). TPG values these 90000 miles at $990.

Which is better?

While TPG values the full United Quest bonus at over $300 more than the Delta Platinum Amex bonus making it the winner in this category your particular valuations may vary based on how you usually use your miles. Here are some of our favorite ways to redeem 100000 United miles.

It's also worth highlighting that earning the full 100000-mile bonus with the United Quest card requires a total of $10000 in spending while the Delta Platinum Amex requires just $3000 in spending to earn the full bonus which may be an easier assignment for some. Here are some ideas on big-ticket everyday expenses you could shift to your card if you need help reaching that $10000 total within six months.

Winner: United Quest Card

Main benefits and features

The United Quest Card offers some interesting perks that aren't replicated by many other cards.

There's a $125 annual statement credit against United purchases each year which is pretty easy to value at $125 for United travelers. It also awards two 5000-mile bonuses — one for each time you redeem miles per cardmember anniversary year up to 10000 total miles in a year. Based on TPG valuations that's a potential $130 in value each year.

On top of those unique offerings the card also provides a free first and second checked bag for the cardholder and one other on the reservation along with priority boarding and a 25% statement credit toward inflight purchases on United. Having this card also makes the cardmember eligible for upgrades on award flights if they have United elite status.

The Delta Platinum Amex's marquee ongoing benefit is the anniversary companion ticket awarded each year you renew the card. This ticket is only valid in Main Cabin (economy) and the first ticket must be charged to your Delta card. There are also some fare class restrictions which make the benefit unavailable on certain dates and routes. On the positive side the benefit can be used even if the cardholder is not on the flight making it shareable with friends or family.

Both cards offer elite-like benefits such as a certain amount of included checked bags when flying that airline (and using the card to purchase the tickets) priority boarding and a 20%-25% rebate on eligible inflight spending on snacks drinks etc.

Which is better?

While there is the potential for greater value out of the annual Delta companion ticket than the United $125 statement credit and two 5000-mile award bonuses more strings are attached to its use. There is also a reasonable chance the companion ticket benefit could go wholly unused in a given year if there isn't a trip that lines up with availability or the need to bring along a traveling companion.

Given all that we're calling this one a draw as both cards have similar base-level perks and either set of unique perks could be more valuable in different scenarios.

Tie: United Quest and Delta Platinum Amex

Earning miles

The United Quest Card provides 3x miles on United purchases (immediately after earning $125 United purchase credit) 2x on other travel charges (including other airlines hotels car rentals etc.) 2x on dining and select streaming and 1x miles on other purchases.

The Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex has a similar 3-2-1 earning structure to the United Quest Card. In the case of the Delta mid-tier card you'll earn 3x miles on eligible purchases with Delta and hotels (made directly with the hotels) 2x miles at restaurants and U.S. supermarkets and 1x on other purchases.

Which is better?

While getting 3x miles for charges with their respective airlines isn't bad the truth is neither of these mid-tier airline cards is truly great when it comes to spending bonus categories.

That said keep in mind the different TPG valuations for the miles. For example earning 2x United miles per dollar is a 2.6% return on spending if you use TPG valuations while 2x Delta miles is just a 2.2% return given the lower valuation per mile.

However if you want to earn United miles you're really better served with the Chase Sapphire Reserve's 3x points awarded on dining and travel since you can transfer those Chase Ultimate Rewards points to United at a 1:1 ratio.

If it is Delta SkyMiles you seek you can earn 5x Membership Rewards points on airfare booked directly with the airlines via The Platinum Card® from American Express (up to $500000 on these purchases per calendar year) and/or 4x points per dollar spent at restaurants and U.S. supermarkets with the American Express Gold Card. You could then transfer those Amex Membership Rewards points at a 1:1 ratio to Delta SkyMiles.

In short neither is great when it comes to spending bonuses but both are respectable.

Tie: United Quest and Delta Platinum Amex

Elite benefits

The United Quest and Delta SkyMiles Platinum cards both make it easier to inch to the next elite status level with spending put on the cards. However both require a lot of spending to move the needle up the status chain very far.

The United Quest Card awards 500 Premier qualifying points for every $12000 charged to the card with a max of 3000 points with $72000 in annual spending.

For context in 2021 United will require 3000 PQPs and eight flight segments or 3500 PQPs and four flight credits for the entry-level Silver status tier. The next tier Gold would require 6000 PQPs and 16 flight segments or 7000 PQPs with four required flight segments on United or United Express. In other words assuming you had at least four segments on United-operated flights in the year you could charge your way to United Silver status with $72000 in spending on the card.

With the Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex you earn 10000 Medallion Qualification Miles after spending $25000 in a calendar year on the card. You can then unlock an additional 10000 MQMs after spending a total of $50000 in a calendar year.

Delta requires 25000 MQMs and $3000 Medallion Qualification Dollars (essentially dollars spent with the airline) for entry-level Silver status and 50000 MQMs and $6000 MQDs for Gold status. This means you normally could not spend your way to Silver status with Delta the way you could with United assuming you met the flight segment requirement.

With Delta if you don't meet the Medallion Qualification Dollar thresholds in a calendar year you can still qualify for Platinum Gold and Silver Medallion status if you have earned the required Medallion Qualification Miles or Medallion Qualification Segments and make at least $25000 in eligible purchases on your card that year. If you want top-tier Diamond status and didn't meet the MQD threshold you must make at least $250000 in eligible purchases on your card that year to unlock that status level.

Which is better?

The reality is these benefits are very similar though each program works a bit differently. Frankly I don't like how the benefit works on either card very much as I'd rather see it possible to make incremental progress with everyday spending than have to hit a five-figure amount of annual spending before you make any progress at all.

However I'm giving the edge to United because you can charge your way to enough PQDs for Silver status assuming you hit the flight segment requirements.

With Delta you can actually also do that this year with a 2021-only opportunity for an additional 2500 MQMs each time you spend $25000 in purchases on your Platinum Card up to two times but it's not a normal offering. If that becomes a permanent addition it could likely sway me to ranking Delta as the victor in this category.

The Delta Platinum Amex now provides cellphone coverage for stolen or damaged phones when you use it to pay your monthly cell phone bill. Coverage is valid up to $800 per claim with each claim coming with a $50 deductible and a maximum of two claims per 12-month period.

Club access

United Quest

Unlike the United Club Infinite Card — and even the United Explorer Card that provides two annual one-time passes — the United Quest card does not provide any United Club access benefits.

Delta Platinum Amex

TSA/Global Entry

United Quest

The card offers a statement credit of $100 every four years against application fees for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck when charged to your card.

Delta Platinum Amex

You can receive a statement credit every four years after applying for Global Entry ($100) or a statement credit every 4 1/2 years after applying for TSA PreCheck (up to $85).

Which card should you get?

If you fly a couple of times per year with either of these airlines both are cards worth considering.

Personally I have the Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex primarily for the annual companion certificate but also so that I have some elite-like perks when it comes to waived bag fees and priority boarding. When combined with other limited-time offerings that come and go (such as the current $15 monthly statement credit at U.S. restaurants) I easily cover the $250 fee per year in value.

I also very much want the United Quest Card. The $125 annual statement credit on United purchases and two 5000-mile credits when you redeem miles each anniversary year are enticing to me as a regular United flyer. Trying the card out while it has a bonus of up to 100000 miles is likely going to be enough to get me to apply before that bonus ends.

Between the two cards which is best for you likely comes down to which airline you reliably fly at least a few times per year.

In the case of the Delta SkyMiles Platinum Card its best ongoing perk (the companion certificate) requires that you fly at least once a year with a companion on a paid ticket. If you don't fall into that category I'd skip this card in favor of one of the other Delta options such as the Delta SkyMiles® Gold American Express Card that comes with an introductory annual fee of $0 for the first year then $99 (see rates and fees).

With the United Quest Card while it may be worth trying out during the introductory 100000-mile bonus period regardless of your exact travel patterns on an ongoing basis this card will be best for those who fly on a mix of paid and United award flights every year. Otherwise the $95-per-year (waived the first year) United Explorer Card may be a better match for less frequent United flyers.

It's entirely possible that both the United Quest and Delta SkyMiles Platinum cards deserve a spot in your wallet — I hope to end up with both of them in mine.

Bottom line

It's fun to rank two similar competitors against each other and see where one shines the brightest.

The United Quest card currently has the stronger introductory welcome bonus better built-in travel protections and a slight edge when it comes to elite status earnings.

However the Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex is the heavyweight champion if you travel on paid domestic flights with a companion if you want ongoing cellphone protection or if you want to check bags for more than two people on your reservation. Personally speaking I'm about to move my own cellphone bill over there to help offset the cost of future unfortunate drops.

These mid-tier cards both make compelling cases to join your credit card lineup. If you only want to choose one the best one for you will likely be the one that aligns with the airline you fly most consistently.

Yet three Minnesota executives from Best Buy Medtronic and U.S. Bank are carving out distinct paths to raise their children and build fulfilling careers.

Amelia Williams Hardy is undaunted by busy schedules but she also recognizes that daily life can quickly deteriorate into chaos when both parents are corporate executives trying to raise four children.

Hardy is vice president of inclusion and diversity strategic initiatives at Best Buy. Her husband Cordell is vice president of global corporate research and development operations at 3M. Their children are Elijah 3; Eden 10; Elise 13; and Isaac 16.

“We live by our Google family calendar” Hardy says. “I always say ‘If it’s not on the calendar then it doesn’t exist.’ ”

But Hardy’s carefully constructed calendar was rendered irrelevant in March 2020 when Covid-19 forced her children’s schools to close and she and her husband shifted into work-from-home mode.

The Woodbury couple had to improvise.

Navigating the ‘Work/Life Sway’ For years executive women have talked about their desire to achieve work/life balance. But veteran journalist Joann Lublin says that elusive balance has been replaced by the concept of “work/life sway” which is embraced by young women business leaders. “They deliberately move back and forth between the professional and personal sides of their digital-centric lives accepting inevitable and aggravating disruptions such as taking youngsters to medical checkups during the workday” Lublin wrote in her new book.

“I had the dining room table for the first couple of months” Hardy says. “It’s not good for your back and neck.” Cordell Hardy was using the home’s office and the three oldest children often did their homework there too.

“The challenge was if he was on video calls which mainly he was then we’d spread out” Hardy recalls. “So you would get my youngest daughter working at the kitchen table my oldest daughter working in my youngest son’s room and then my oldest son would usually be in his room. We needed enough space to spread out so that you could still hear the conversations that you were a part of on the Zoom calls.”

Elijah’s day care center has remained open throughout the pandemic but Hardy says he’s been at home anytime he showed cold symptoms or had any illness.

“That was hard because he would be jumping in the background on my sofa or in the Zoom camera” Hardy says.

“It’s all a blur” is how she describes the early weeks of working from home and overseeing her children’s instruction. “I felt guilty that I wasn’t able to help them more” Hardy says. “We were still working and weren’t able to spend the full time with them that we needed to.”

The disruption that Covid-19 has caused for working mothers worries advocates of gender parity in corporate America.

“During Covid you’ve got so many more personal household responsibilities that women are juggling on average more than men” says Kweilin Ellingrud a senior partner in the Minneapolis office of McKinsey & Co. “[Women] are stagnating at work and so they’re less likely to get the promotion or take on new challenges.”

The annual Women in the Workplace study released in September and conducted for McKinsey and Lean In showed that the pandemic exacerbated the challenges women already face carrying heavy loads at work and at home. Some working women are “downshifting their careers” Ellingrud says while others are thinking about “stepping out of the workforce altogether because right now there are just too many things going on.”

“We don’t have traditional roles. My husband does most of the cooking and meal planning and I tend to do most of the activities.” —Amelia Williams Hardy vice president of inclusion and diversity strategic initiatives Best Buy

‘It’s a Catch-22’

Hardy 45 doesn’t plan to downshift her career but she acknowledges that she and her husband regularly talk about the family challenges associated with two demanding careers.

“It’s a tricky conversation and it’s hard” she says. “It’s a Catch-22. I think we both want each other to succeed and do what’s best for the other and I think we also want that for ourselves. It’s an ebb and flow for us. It definitely is an ongoing conversation. It’s a conversation that I don’t think is going to stop until we retire.”

As a Black woman who has reached the vice president level at Best Buy a publicly traded company Hardy is part of a small number of BIPOC women nationally. The recent McKinsey study documented the gender gap that still exists in the corporate pipeline. Just 19 percent of C-suite jobs are held by white women and only 3 percent are held by women of color. At the vice president level white women occupy 24 percent of the jobs with women of color in 6 percent of the positions.

Hardy a native of Overland Park Kansas initially wanted to be a doctor and earn her undergraduate degree at a historically black college. “I grew up in a suburb that was predominantly white” she says. “My whole experience growing up I never had a teacher of color. I was usually the only child of color in my class. I wanted to experience something different.”

Multiple internships piqued her interest in business and she went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Xavier University of Louisiana. After finishing her MBA at Tulane University she accepted a job at 3M in 2000 and climbed the ranks to global business unit manager over a 14-year run.

She married Cordell Hardy in 2003 after meeting him at Pilgrim Baptist Church in St. Paul where they were both part of the church’s young adult ministry. When they first met Cordell was finishing his Ph.D. at the University of Minnesota and the couple knew they both had strong career ambitions.

When firstborn Isaac arrived it kicked off the discussions about how to juggle children and careers. “Being a new parent I was nervous to send Isaac to day care” Hardy says so she and her husband hired a full-time nanny a young woman they knew from their church who was taking a year off of studies before beginning law school.

“After that we put our kids in day care” Hardy says. “Then when we moved to a bigger house when I was pregnant with our third child we realized that we needed more help. And that’s when we actually started looking into au pairs.”

Financial strain of child care

Their local insurance agent recommended that they try au pairs which typically involves a short-term contract arrangement with someone from abroad who lives with the family and takes care of the children. The Hardys employed au pairs until about two or three years ago and then returned to employing nannies.

It takes two to accommodate two demanding careers. The morning nanny helps get Elijah up and off to day care in the morning while the afternoon nanny picks him up and helps with after-school activities. When the pandemic hit the Hardys furloughed their nannies to follow safety protocols about limiting virus spread. After they learned more about Covid-19 they hired two new nannies who are now part of their Covid bubble.

About six years ago after Cordell’s mother retired she moved from Philadelphia to Woodbury so she could help with driving her grandchildren to events and taking them to doctor’s appointments.

Before the pandemic Hardy says her Kansas-based mother also pitched in. “If Cordell was gone to Asia for a couple of weeks she would come up and help during that time” she says.

Hardy acknowledges that her family has spent a huge amount of money on child care. “The accessibility of affordable child care at all levels is really hard to find” she says which is a major issue that can stymie women’s careers.

In her personal life Hardy says she’s talked to friends early in their careers who asked aloud whether it’s “worth it” to hold certain jobs because their salaries might equal or be less than their child care costs.

“The child care thing is big” Hardy says. “The government can help with that companies can help with that—whether through subsidization or policies to make it more equitable and accessible.”

Hardy says that she and her husband are united in balancing out the work of family life. “We don’t have traditional roles” she says. “My husband does most of the cooking and meal planning and I tend to do most of the activities.”

In their case she says they both have “the mindset” to play the position that’s needed at the given time. “People have to really be in it and intentional about making it work” Hardy says “and not holding so tightly to any stereotypical or familiar roles.”

Joann Lublin author of the new book Power Moms: How Executive Mothers Navigate Work and Life interviewed baby boomer executives and women holding executive roles in their 30s and 40s. “The calculus has changed in terms of the sharing of power on the home front” Lublin tells TCB. “This younger generation of executive moms tend to pick as their partners or husbands or wives individuals who share their outlook about co-parenting and also being partners in terms of the domestic tasks.”

Blazing her own path

Karen Parkhill 55 the chief financial officer of Medtronic just missed the cutoff for the baby boomer generation which contained what Lublin describes as trailblazer women executives.

Early in her career Parkhill encountered the vestiges of male domination in investment banking.

A graduate of Sacred Heart Academy a girls Catholic high school in Springfield Illinois Parkhill originally thought she wanted a career in medicine. But she shifted gears after three semesters at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. “It was an adviser actually who steered me toward the business school and finance because it was related to my love of math” Parkhill recalls. She ultimately earned undergraduate degrees in business administration and mathematics.

She began her professional career at a regional investment bank that’s now part of Dain Rauscher doing public finance work on municipal bonds for cities counties and other government units.

“One of the things that I tell women now is ‘Never ever put your personal life on hold for your professional life.’ ” —Karen Parkhill chief financial officer Medtronic

Three years later she enrolled in a full-time MBA program at the University of Chicago. She thought what she learned at Chicago’s Booth School of Business would be her ticket to the big leagues of investment banking.

She was right. She was hired by JP Morgan in 1992 and moved to New York. But she had a complicated personal life. She was dating Jeff Parkhill whom she had met as a fellow business school student and he had been hired to work for Kraft Foods in Chicago. “We had a long-distance relationship for almost two years” Parkhill says until she was able to land a job in JP Morgan’s new Chicago office.

The couple married on Dec. 31 1994 and planned to have children.

“Sadly back at that time in investment banking there were very few senior women role models” Parkhill says. “And there was this unspoken almost-rule that you shouldn’t have children before you were a vice president. I can’t think of any women back then who had children at a younger career age.”

Parkhill followed the cues of the other JP Morgan women. “I honestly waited until I was a vice president and by that time we were older and we had trouble getting pregnant” she says. “So we ended up having to go through in vitro [fertilization] which is why we were blessed to have twins.” Hayden and Hunter are now 21.

The couple later adopted their daughter Cheney who is 14.

“Things turned out fine” Parkhill says. “But one of the things that I tell women now is ‘Never ever put your personal life on hold for your professional life.’ ”

Before the twins arrived Parkhill needed to come up with a child care solution. “Both my husband and I had big jobs and we both traveled a lot” Parkhill says. “We needed to have the most flexibility that we could have. We had one nanny for the first two years of the boys’ lives and then we hired our second nanny. She is still with us and she is part of our family.”

For a good portion of her career Parkhill says she managed to get promoted by “just working harder than the next person to really prove myself.” Working in the male-oriented investment banking sector women tended to create their own breaks.

“There were a few really great men along the way in my career and all of them were men who either had a spouse who had their own career or had daughters who were ambitious and they wanted their daughters to have strong careers” she says.

Today Parkhill is the executive sponsor of the Medtronic Women’s Network subgroup Commit to Connect which bolsters the corporation’s women vice presidents around the globe. Parkhill says they offer mentors sponsors vice president group sessions and other support to help retain and promote the women into more senior positions at Medtronic.

Parkhill who serves on the board of American Express landed the plum Medtronic CFO job in 2016 after serving as CFO of the Comerica financial services company. She got on the CFO track after making what some might view as a risky move.

“I took a year sabbatical between my investment banking career and my CFO career” she says taking time off about 15 years ago. “I knew that I wanted to do something different and it was impossible for me to figure out when I was on the investment banking treadmill what that was.”

Following the sabbatical she became the CFO for JP Morgan’s commercial banking business.

She’s encouraged women executives at Medtronic to take time off adding when “they come back to the company they haven’t missed a beat.” She contends the sabbaticals are important for people who have long and challenging careers.

Taking a career ‘pause’

Liz Deziel 41 a former senior vice president at U.S. Bank is currently enjoying a sabbatical that she granted herself.

In late October she posted on LinkedIn: “Today was my last day with U.S. Bank. I’m thrilled to share that my next move is to hit pause on my career and spend time with our kids.”

She noted that over 15 years with U.S. Bank she had moved from an administrative assistant to senior vice president and along the way she earned an MBA through evening graduate school and she passed her Certified Financial Planner (CFP) exam. She appeared to be on the fast track in corporate America.

Now she’s focused on supervising the distance learning of her daughters Scarlett 9 and Noelle 7 who are pupils at Garlough Environmental Magnet School in West St. Paul. Deziel’s husband Tom Stukel is a technology professional for their local school district.

“I think women would be more interested in [senior management] roles if they were convinced that the hours the stress the demands and the culture would not suffocate their lives outside of work.” —Liz Deziel former senior vice president U.S. Bank

The couple met when they were undergraduate students at the College of St. Benedict and St. John’s University. “I was fiercely independent” Deziel says with a laugh. “I definitely wasn’t there searching for a husband but I was lucky enough to meet him there.”

Tom was a peace studies major from the small town of Granite Falls while Liz a Burnsville native had a self-designed liberal studies major with philosophy and sociology emphasis areas. She also earned a minor in gender and women’s studies.

Their academic pursuits may have provided an early indicator of the egalitarian relationship they would develop. The couple married in September 2003.

After their daughter Scarlett was born they came up with a child care plan that’s still somewhat rare. “The decision that we made for him to become a stay-at-home dad was one of the easiest decisions we ever made” Deziel says. “I was loving my career and had just landed my first manager role and I had completed my MBA in recent years. Tom had been working for a small nonprofit and enjoyed his work too.”

They had the flexibility to live off of Deziel’s U.S. Bank salary so Stukel stayed home with Scarlett and Noelle and did not return to the workforce until December 2019.

Liz Deziel’s decision to leave U.S. Bank wasn’t made hastily during the pandemic. It had been in the works for a year or so. She had started to feel like she wanted to “trade places” with her husband as the at-home parent.

“In the earlier years he was better suited for that role” she says. “When the kids were babies and toddlers I felt like I had the easier job going to the office. And I liked my work. He handled the exhaustion and the social isolation. He was better at getting on the floor and playing with them and so I didn’t necessarily wish I was in his shoes when the girls were younger.”

At the time she left U.S. Bank Deziel had been working in the bank’s corporate social responsibility area. Previously she had been a senior vice president in the bank’s wealth management business. A few years ago she competed with a male colleague for a market leader position in the Twin Cities. She didn’t get the local job but was offered market leader positions in two other metro areas in the United States. She turned down those opportunities.

“Having family here and having been to college here I feel pretty rooted here and invested in the community” Deziel says. “I have so much history here and I feel so connected to so many aspects of this community that it wouldn’t be worth it to me to give all of that up for a job.”

For the first eight months of the pandemic Deziel was the primary parent at home with her daughters. Deziel did her U.S. Bank work while the girls studied. On some of those days she says “I felt like I was constantly pushing them off” by encouraging them to keep themselves busy while she took part in work video meetings.

Since she left her job the decks are clear for Deziel to enjoy spending time with her daughters and she’s started to cook and do chores around the house that her husband used to do. “I can hang out with [my daughters] on their class breaks and we can play games while they are on a break” she says. “I know they won’t always want to hang out with their mom as much so I am soaking that up. And I’m also enjoying having more open space in my life.”

Deziel emphasizes that she is taking a break from the work world not leaving it for good. As a graduate of a women’s college and longtime

supporter of women’s careers she says she “absolutely” believes that more women should hold C-suite jobs.

However she also urges companies to take a second look at what constitutes success in senior management roles in their workplaces.

“I think women would be more interested in those roles if they were convinced that the hours the stress the demands and the culture would not suffocate their lives outside of work” Deziel says.

Since she posted her career “pause” news on LinkedIn last year she’s engaged in conversations with many women who are reassessing their work and personal lives especially in light of the pandemic.

Women have the capability to perform well in any C-suite job in major companies Deziel says but adds that some women aren’t going to step forward to pursue jobs that currently are designed to be all-consuming and require people to be available 24/7 on a regular basis.

“I have recalibrated what my goals are and I think I’ve realized I am far more motivated by meaning and fulfillment than I am by money and power and status” Deziel says. She hasn’t put a specific timeline on when she’ll reenter the workforce or decided whether she’ll work in the private public or nonprofit sector.

But she’s clear-eyed about her values at home and at work. Deziel says “I look forward to doing more work in the Twin Cities community for a second act after I’ve taken this break and I am excited to pursue that work feeling recharged.”

Rural areas the next e-commerce frontier?

The pandemic accelerated e-commerce growth across most countries during 2020 when lockdown policies restricted much in-store retail shopping.

Cities around the world saw a huge increase in online shopping with companies like Amazon and Walmart reporting gains in users and revenue by as much as 79%.

The next frontier for e-commerce is regional cities and rural areas according to Mark Stanton general manager at PowerFleet for supply chain.

“COVID accelerated what was going to happen in e-commerce; some people say it accelerated by five years or 10 years what was already going to happen” Stanton told FreightWaves. “Mixed into that is the migration of a lot of people out of the largest cities whether it’s New York or Los Angeles Detroit moving to smaller or more rural areas whether that’s in Texas Florida or elsewhere around the country.”

Woodcliff Lake New Jersey-based PowerFleet provides telematics and fleet management software.

Stanton said the e-commerce shift to smaller regional areas could disrupt supply chains that are not prepared.





“If the population is moving around in a slightly different way or even a significantly different way than it was expected to then businesses need to somehow respond to that” Stanton said. “If last-mile deliveries have to drive another 10 or 50 or 100 miles to deliver that product to dozens of consumers there is an additional cost to that. The more spread out delivery areas are the more it adds costs to supply chains.”

In the past several months e-commerce giant Amazon has announced fulfillment and sorting centers in regional cities such as El Paso and Amarillo Texas as well as even smaller cities such as Orland California and Seaford Delaware.

Amazon has also announced plans to open facilities in regional cities across Mexico including Hermosillo Apodaca and Mérida.

Other online retailers such as WalMart and MercadoLibre have announced major expansion plans across the U.S. and Mexico as well.

“Supply chains just can’t just suddenly grow a new warehouse or fulfillment center in a month; these things take potentially years to build” Stanton said. “One of the things that organizations are doing is looking at their existing real estate portfolio to repurpose existing facilities to be used in different ways. That’s a very innovative and interesting response not just to COVID-19 but also to the shifting in the supply chains.”

The move to repurpose malls and underperforming stores is not new. Walmart began converting Sam’s Club locations into e-commerce fulfillment centers in 2019. Amazon has been purchasing disused malls to turn them into fulfillment centers since as far back as 2016.

In recent months Amazon has purchased malls in Baton Rouge Louisiana Knoxville Tennessee and Worcester Massachusetts in order to transform them into distribution facilities according to a recent report by NBC News.

American International Group’s investment arm bought an 88-property portfolio of industrial properties across the U.S. for $1 billion on Tuesday from Partners Group and Equus Capital Partners.





The transaction was fueled in part by the rise of e-commerce according to Ron Lamontagne Partners Group’s managing director and co-head of private real estate Americas.

“Partners Group built this portfolio of assets across attractive industrial markets gaining exposure to key transformative trends such as the rise of e-commerce and relatively outsized expansion of regional growth cities” Lamontagne said in a release. “We have conviction in last-mile distribution facilities smaller urban logistics warehouses and cold storage facilities which are supported by resilient structural market trends.”

The properties are located across the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions of the U.S. including Georgia Tennessee and Virginia.

Stanton said as e-commerce spreads to more rural areas the challenge for telematics firms like PowerFleet will be to gather timely data for clients that can be used to create solutions.

“Whether the data is location time who’s doing it are they doing it safely? Really bring that information back whether it’s artificial intelligence or machine learning” Stanton said.

“Working with customers such as the big e-commerce sellers plus FedEx UPS and the USPS you have to have huge networks of vehicles and people bringing that information back and being much more intelligent about how we analyze that information how we utilize that data so that it can be used to answer some of these challenges. I think that’s our biggest challenge over the next four years five years” Stanton said.

Texas FedEx distribution center acquired by Arcapita

Arcapita Group Holdings has acquired the Cedardale Distribution Centre in Dallas.

The property is currently leased to FedEx Ground a subsidiary of FedEx Corp. and is part of FedEx’s distribution network. The price of the transaction was not disclosed.

The Cedardale Distribution Center development totals more than 1.07 million square feet and includes two cross-dock distribution/warehouse centers.

“With the accelerated growth of e-commerce and increasing supply chain sophistication the demand for modern logistics and warehousing space will grow exponentially” Martin Tan Arcapita’s chief investment officer said in a statement.

Arcapita is based in Manama Bahrain. The global investment manager also has offices in Atlanta London and Singapore.

Authentic Logistics opens Phoenix office

Authentic Logistics recently added an office in the Phoenix area aiming to grow its customer base in the western United States.

The Evanston Illinois-based logistics brokerage works in the metal paper and plastic recycling industries. The company also facilitates shipments of garden and gravel items lumber personal protective equipment and rock salt among other materials.

Authentic Logistics’ services include container drayage end dump flatbed hazmat intermodal and cross-border shipping with Mexico and Canada.

CBP seizes $350K worth of counterfeit N95 masks in Houston

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers working at Port Houston recently intercepted a shipment of counterfeit N95 masks from China.

On April 7 officers found 171460 fake masks with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) logo in boxes. CBP determined the shipment was not licensed through NIOSH.

The masks which were bound for White Plains New York were valued at $350000 and were turned over to CBP’s penalties program.

The United States has made previous attempts to reemerge as a dominant player in a rare earths supply chain that is responsible for some of the most important materials involved in electric vehicle production battery making renewable energy systems and technology manufacturing. Under the Biden administration the effort is receiving renewed focus with massive investments planned in climate change technology and a hard line being taken on geopolitical rivalries and the national security threat posed by China. In 2019 China was responsible for 80% of rare earths imports according to the U.S. Geological Survey although exports fell last year in part due to Covid-19. President Biden's sweeping $2 trillion infrastructure legislation seeks to remake the power and transportation markets in the U.S. and rebuild the country's semiconductor industry. It follows Biden signing an executive order in February designed to review gaps in the domestic supply chains for rare earths medical devices chips and other key resources and in March the Department of Energy announcing a $30 million initiative that will tap into researching and securing the U.S. domestic supply chain for rare earths and other important minerals in battery-making such as cobalt and lithium.

'Cornering of the market'

""It's absolutely correct there is a cornering of the market with lithium and other rare earths"" Biden climate envoy John Kerry recently said at a CNBC Evolve summit on the future of energy innovation. But efforts in the recent past to rival China in the rare earths market and rebuild a domestic industry have been stymied. ""It's technically possible to try and rebuild the entire supply chain because we once had it"" says Jane Nakano a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic International Studies' Energy Security and Climate Change Program. ""It's not that we're not experienced it's not that we have no idea of what the domestic supply chain may look like"" Nakano said but she added that business environmental and political factors may make the effort difficult to achieve especially over a short-time frame.

Success is dependent on whether the U.S. can quickly scale up processing and refining after the mining of the resources and compete on cost with a magnet-making and processing market that's heavily dominated by China. Once extracted from mines rare earths are shipped to separation facilities where they are separated from other minerals. Then rare earths are individually separated into oxides metals and finally magnets that are used in everything from missiles to wind turbines medical devices power tools cellphones and motors for hybrid and electric vehicles.

China's rare earths dominance

Rare earth metals are actually more abundant than their name suggests but extracting processing and refining are tricky for a myriad of technical and environmental reasons. These 17 elements — which are subdivided into the light rare earths and heavy rare earths subsets based on their atomic weights — exist in natural deposits globally. Heavy rare earths are often harder to source. They include metals like dysprosium and terbium which play a critical role in defense technology and electric vehicles. Neodymium and praseodymium are some of the most sought-after light rare earth elements crucial in products such as motors turbines and medical devices. Demand for them exploded in recent years with the growth of technology and will continue to climb amid the ongoing race to create a large electric vehicle market. While China is dominant now in the decades before the 1980s it was the U.S. that held a majority stake in this metals market. That changed as production growth abroad and mounting environmental pressures at home shifted production overseas and also offered cheaper labor costs. According to one 2018 report from the Department of Defense China ""strategically flooded the global market"" with rare earths at cheaper prices to drive out and deter current and future competitors. ""If the material specification fits and the price is a dollar better then you go for the dollar better"" said Koray Kose senior director of supply chain research at Gartner. The three most important materials used in magnets include neodymium dysprosium and terbium. Terbium is one of the toughest to come by because production extraction and magnet-making are focused on China. Trade wars and retaliatory tariffs can leave many companies sourcing these crucial materials in limbo even if they make up just a small portion of a product. Market dynamics can escalate so quickly that companies without a diversified supply chain bid aggressively materials get scarce and prices go up Kose said. In 2011 for example rare earth prices shot up when China restricted exports to maintain supplies for domestic industries which was the case again during the 2019 trade war.

Rebuilding a domestic supply chain

Domestic efforts to extract rare earths are taking place in states including Wyoming Texas and California but the recent past provides cautionary tales such as Molycorp which reopened the longstanding Mountain Pass mine in California in the early 2000s only to go bankrupt in 2015. MP Materials bought the mine and restarted production in 2017. The Las Vegas-headquartered company is vying to restore the domestic rare earths supply chain from mine to magnet and is hedging its bets on neodymium-praseodymium with the hope of becoming the lowest-cost producer. In recent years the Las Vegas-headquartered company received a myriad of grants and contracts from the Department of Defense and Department of Energy to research and improve domestic capabilities. One of the company's largest customers is Shenghe Resources a Chinese company responsible for processing distributing and refining which also owns a stake in the company. The connection raised some concerns among DOE scientists according to Reuters but government funding has continued for a rare earths separation facility. Shenghe Resources distributes the concentrate produced at Mountain Pass to refiners in Asia ""capabilities that simply do not exist at scale in the West"" according to an MP Materials spokesman. The company plans to reinvest the free cash flow generated from operations into expanding MP's U.S. capabilities including a restoration of domestic refining capability at Mountain Pass by next year. Ultimately the company which went public last year through a SPAC merger plans to ""restore the full rare earth supply chain"" to the U.S. the spokesman said including refining and separation and magnet-making by 2025 as the domestic electric vehicle market ramps up production. ""This is happening and I think it's happening much much faster than I think anybody had anticipated"" said Ryan Corbett the company's chief financial officer. ""We can compete and we're going to continue to do it."" Another key player in the space is Lynas Corporation  one of the largest processors of rare earths outside China. The Australian mining company which operates a separation facility in Malaysia recently received $30.4 million in funding from the Pentagon to build a Texas light rare earths processing facility and earned another contract in partnership with Blue Line Corp. also based in Texas to build a heavy rare earths separation facility. A Lynas spokeswoman referred to the new facilities in an email to CNBC as an ""essential foundation"" for renewing downstream metal making and implementing magnet manufacturing into the U.S. She wrote that diversifying outside the Chinese magnetic materials supply chain is important to create competitive markets and meet the growing demand for 21st-century technologies.

Resource extraction and the environment

While companies like Lynas and MP Materials are eager to ramp up the domestic supply chains extracting rare earths is a difficult process due to a combination of environmental technical and political factors. Many regions including the European Union have an abundance of these resources but lack the expertise that other countries like China have in the processing and magnet production Nakano said. The rare earths industry has come under fire for environmental concerns. Many rare earth elements reside among mineral deposits with radioactive materials that can leach into the water table. Mining processing and disposal can also contribute to ecosystem disruption and release hazardous byproducts into the atmosphere. Although the U.S. is making strides to advance the rare earths supply chain and develop alternatives to mining rare earths environmental regulations are often more stringent than inside China. In recent years Lynas came under scrutiny from activists and the Malaysian government for radioactive waste that it produces as part of its enrichment process. Lynas has said that the low-levels of radioactive waste were not dangerous and the Malaysian government ultimately renewed the license and green-lighted a construction plan for a permanent disposal and waste treatment facility in August 2020. Some companies have proposed extracting rare earths from coal while others suggest setting up a system for recycling old batteries or disk drives. Suggestions include calls to utilize shipping services like Amazon or USPS to set up a recycling system but these endeavors can be costly Nakano says. Recycling of key raw materials used in the EV space is receiving greater investment focus. Some emerging battery recycling leaders include Redwood Materials a start-up from former Tesla CTO JB Straubel and Li-Cycle which recently announced plans to go public through a SPAC-merger. The Ames Laboratory in Iowa is one of the many Department of Energy's national laboratories working on projects aimed at substituting rare earths or finding new more eco-friendly methods to recover them. One initiative by researcher Ikenna Nlebedim is a rare-earth magnet recycling process designed to recover rare earth oxides without the hazardous acids or fumes associated. Scientists are also using the process to recover byproducts like copper and nickel. Another laboratory in Idaho is looking at how potato wastewater can be used as a cheap food source for a bacterium that can assist in recycling rare earths. ""We already have the magnets here"" says Tom Lograsso director of DOE's Critical Materials Institute at Ames. ""Why can't we just retain that and close the circle domestically rather than throwing them in a landfill.""

Limits to countering China

In a recent interview with CNBC following the UAE's Regional Climate Dialogue Kerry addressed the president's $2 trillion infrastructure proposal in relation to rivalry with China. The legislation includes $35 billion for climate research and innovation $46 billion in renewable energy manufacturing and $174 billion to boost the electric vehicle market. China which accounts for roughly 30% of carbon dioxide emissions globally claims it plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2060 and outspent the U.S. roughly 2-to-1 on energy transition-related investments in the last decade according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data. ""I think that this is a huge economic opportunity not just for the United States with people all around the world"" Kerry said. ""This is not about China this is not a counter to China. This is about China the United States India Russia Indonesia Japan Korea Australia a bunch of countries that are emitting a pretty sizable amount the United States and China the most."" On April 17 Kerry and his Chinese government counterpart issued a joint statement on climate change cooperation.

China’s Foreign Ministry this month issued the most forceful defense of its policies in Xinjiang to date calling allegations of “genocide” in the region the “lie of the century.”

The statement – made in response to ongoing calls for a possible boycott of the 2022 Beijing Olympics – represents the culmination of a long evolution of China’s official narrative regarding its treatment of Uyghurs.

This evolving strategy from outright denial to hardened public defense is closely tied to the Chinese government’s own increased sense of confidence on the world stage and its willingness to confront its critics in the West head on be it over Xinjiang the South China Sea or Hong Kong a CNN analysis shows.

In recent months Xinjiang has become something of a patriotic litmus test in which those wishing to do business with China must pick a side – either stand with Beijing in implicit defense of its policies or face the consequences.

The propaganda campaign has also reached a fever pitch with state media reporters dispatched to Xinjiang to supposedly “prove” there is no oppression there a “La La Land”-inspired musical released to make Beijing’s case while critics overseas have faced sanctions and harassment.

While China has always maintained a sophisticated propaganda apparatus at home its recent campaign over Xinjiang particularly disinformation and harassment of critics overseas is more in keeping with similar efforts by Russia including deploying “whataboutism” in claiming any US denouncements are tainted by the legacy of slavery and genocide on the American continent.

Warning signs

After she was “de-radicalized” Amina Hojamet swapped her burqa for a silk dress put a traditional flower-patterned hat on her head and sang “Without the Communist Party there would be no New China.”

She didn’t know it at the time but Hojamet along with over a dozen other women from her village in Shufu County in western Xinjiang – whose story was recounted in a report by the state-run Xinjiang Daily – would serve as proof of concept for an “anti-extremism” campaign that has engulfed the Chinese region since 2017.

According to reliable scholarly estimates up to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities have passed through a system of detention camps set up throughout Xinjiang in recent years. In the camps they have been subjected to intense “re-education” designed to strip them of their Islamic faith and ethnic identity in the name of fighting religious terrorism and separatism.

Survivors of the camps report experiencing or witnessing widespread abuse and incidents of torture rape and forced sterilization. The crackdown has been denounced as “genocide” by the United States government and the Canadian and Dutch parliaments for its effects on the Uyghur people and their culture.

When reports of the camp system first began to emerge around 2017 China issued staunch denials or refused to comment altogether. As this has become increasingly impossible in the face of mounting international attention and subsequent condemnation Beijing has shifted to an angry defense of its “de-radicalization” program which it has even started to tout to like-minded countries as a way of dealing with their own Muslim “problem.”

Meanwhile evidence of the camp system such as early reports in state media like one which gave Hojamet’s story in late 2014 have been scrubbed from the internet altogether and are accessible only in archived form a CNN analysis shows. Other materials researchers relied on to expose the camp system – such as government tenders and official documents – have also been deleted.

Multiple foreign journalists who reported on the camp system have been expelled from China while academics activists and survivors who sought to expose its reach have been denounced and harassed. Those who have dared speak out inside of China have been silenced or detained.

The clampdown has been accompanied by a new coordinated propaganda campaign touting the successes of the “vocational training” system with heavily choreographed media tours for sympathetic outlets interviews with “graduates” praising the system and disinformation which aims to sow confusion about the scale of the camp system and the abuses experienced by detainees while painting Beijing as the victim of both violent extremism and Western misinformation.

Early reports in Chinese state media about de-radicalisation programs in Xinjiang have since been scrubbed from the internet.

Crackdown

Located in the far west of the People’s Republic of China Xinjiang is among China’s most ethnically diverse regions. It is home to about 11 million Uyghurs a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority who speak a language closely related to Turkish and have their own distinct culture as well as significant populations of Kazakhs.

Rich in natural resources especially oil and gas the region has seen a large influx of Han Chinese the country’s majority ethnic group amid recent concerted efforts by the government to tie Xinjiang closer to the wider economy.

Xinjiang – the name means “New Frontier” in Chinese – has long been of strategic importance for its rulers in Beijing. The vast region borders Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan and Afghanistan as well as Mongolia and Russia in the north and Pakistan and India in the south. Its importance has only increased with the advent of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative a trade and infrastructure mega project connecting China to markets across Central Asia to Europe and beyond.

In the 1990s and 2000s as the number of Han migrating to Xinjiang increased and the government ramped up efforts to integrate the region protests and occasionally violent ethnic unrest became more common.

Information about such incidents was often hard to come by with reports in state media sporadic and sparsely detailed. Few foreign journalists ever visited Xinjiang both due to the region’s remoteness from Beijing and the harassment and surveillance by local authorities of those journalists who did travel there.

Such controls only increased as the situation became more unstable and the authorities cracked down harder. In 2009 following deadly ethnic riots in the Xinjiang capital of Urumqi the entire region was cut off from the internet for almost a year and many Uyghur writers and intellectuals were jailed.

In October 2013 a group of Uyghurs were alleged to have driven a sports-utility vehicle into pedestrians on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. Five people died in the incident described by authorities as a terror attack including three in the car. Some 40 people were injured.

Following the incident Xinjiang’s anti-terrorism budget doubled. The regional government meanwhile said it was “determined to curb the spread of religious extremism as well as prevent severe violent terrorist attacks.” As part of this what was called “vocational training” could be provided to those “more easily manipulated by religious extremism.”

In early 2014 31 people were killed and more than 100 were injured during a knife terror attack in a crowded train station in Kunming in China’s southwestern Yunnan Province. Four people were convicted of plotting the attack which the government blamed on Uyghur separatists.

During a visit to the region in April 2014 in the aftermath of the Kunming attack President Xi called for an all-out “struggle against terrorism infiltration and separatism” according to leaked internal speeches published by the New York Times.

Around this time in a village in Shufu County near the ancient Silk Road trading stop of Kashgar in western Xinjiang local officials identified 16 women in need of “educational transformation” according to the Xinjiang Daily article. Their offense? Wearing the burqa.

These women one of whom was Hojamet were initially “very resistant and unwilling” but “gradually realized the essence and harm of religious extremism” eventually choosing to abandon conservative Islamic dress for regular clothing.

Another woman also told the paper her husband had been detained by the police for religious extremism and taken for “de-radicalization” in an unspecified location. “I hope that he will receive a good education transform well and reunite with us soon” she was quoted as saying.

Cover-up

While in 2014 and 2015 the burgeoning “re-education” system was still years away from reaching its current scale or from becoming public knowledge it was clear the situation in Xinjiang had escalated following the high-profile Kunming attack.

Visiting the region weeks later Ursula Gauthier a journalist with the French magazine L’Obs reported an intense system of surveillance police checkpoints and widespread fear of being reported or denounced among any Uyghurs she spoke to.

“In Xinjiang where the police respect legal procedures even less than in the (rest of China) arrests are not reported to families. They simply disappear” Gauthier wrote adding many Uyghurs reported being constantly afraid such that fear “creeps into all parts of life poisons relationships and paralyzes the most serene minds.”

This experience was at the forefront of her mind when about seven months later ISIS-linked terrorists attacked targets across Paris killing 130 people and wounding hundreds more.

Disgusted by the bloodshed in her home capital Gauthier was also dismayed by the reaction from the Chinese government which she felt was attempting to take advantage of the incident to gain international support for its crackdown in Xinjiang.

In expressing sympathy with France Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China was also a victim of terrorism and complained about a “double standard” in the West in which media and politicians minimized or sought to justify terrorist incidents against Chinese.

In a column for L’Obs Gauthier noted the astonishing outpouring of sympathy and solidarity she had experienced in Beijing from ordinary people while pointing out what she felt were the Chinese government’s “ulterior motives” in conflating ISIS attacks with violence in Xinjiang.

While other outlets made similar observations – “China Responds to Paris Attacks Through a Domestic Lens” read a headline in the New York Times – Gauthier’s article struck a nerve.

The Global Times a nationalist state-run tabloid published multiple articles attacking her and she was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explain herself. She was told to apologize but refused saying she was being accused of saying things – such as that Chinese victims of terror deserved to die – she never wrote.

Fanning the controversy Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang accused Gauthier of having “blatantly championed acts of terrorism and slaughter of innocent civilians igniting indignation among the Chinese people.”

The authorities refused to renew her press card and on January 1 2016 she flew out of Beijing for good.

Exposed

While she was not alone in criticizing or exposing China’s policies in Xinjiang or even in calling out Beijing’s attempt to conflate ethnic unrest with global terrorism Gauthier appears to have been caught up in a shifting policy on Xinjiang as the government became far more sensitive to outside scrutiny.

“We know today that Xi Jinping had made the decision to change the policies in Xinjiang so in (late 2014) they were preparing the crackdown” she said. “It was just the fact that we didn’t know back then.”

The scale of this transformation would not be known for several years. Even as people began disappearing into the camp system which was built up between 2014 and 2017 before massively expanding that year the heavy surveillance in Xinjiang ongoing intense censorship of Uyghur issues on the Chinese internet and its relative remoteness compared to the rest of the country meant the news did not immediately spread.

But as human rights groups and members of the Uyghur diaspora started reporting increased disappearances and people being taken away for “political education” a number of foreign journalists were able to travel to Xinjiang to see if the stories were true.

In late 2017 a series of on the ground reports were published by US outlets BuzzFeed the Associated Press and the Wall Street Journal all testifying to the intense surveillance all Uyghurs in Xinjiang were subject to and to the burgeoning camp system.

“Since this spring thousands of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities have disappeared into so-called political education centers apparently for offenses from using Western social media apps to studying abroad in Muslim countries according to relatives of those detained” Buzzfeed’s Megha Rajagopalan reported.

While officials defended security measures in Xinjiang as necessary for preventing terrorism at first Beijing denied reports about the camp system with a foreign ministry spokesman telling Rajagopalan “we have never heard about these measures taken by local authorities.”

A similar denial would come from China’s representative to Kazakhstan who told reporters “we don’t have such a concept at all in China” when asked about a CNN report on Uyghurs being sent to political education camps in early 2018. More often the Chinese authorities simply refused to comment for stories about Xinjiang.

According to a CNN review of Chinese government statements from 2015 onwards officials largely avoided addressing the issue of Xinjiang until around mid-2018 when growing scrutiny made this impossible.

In particular China appears to have switched strategies in response to a hearing of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in August of that year where it was estimated by the Germany-based World Uyghur Congress that as many as 1 million people could have passed through the camps.

China’s representative to the committee said this was “completely untrue” while acknowledging people had been assigned “to vocational educational and employment training centers with a view to assisting in their rehabilitation.”

Speaking in mid 2019 Liu Xiaoming China’s ambassador to the UK gave a staunch defense of the program in an interview with the BBC saying “extremist ideas have easy penetration to the poorer areas. The idea is to help the people to lift them out of poverty.”

“They can leave freely. They can visit their relatives. It is not a prison. It is not a camp” Liu said.

Subsequent months saw the publication of multiple reports which drew on witness testimony satellite imagery and open source Chinese government data such as official tenders to map the size and scale of the camp system.

While China has sought sometimes successfully to muddy the waters on Xinjiang attacking individual researchers and think tanks and trotting out family members of survivors to criticize them in dubious videos much of the evidence showing the scale of the camp system is in fact open source.

For example the growth of a camp in Shufu County around 7 kilometers (4.5 miles) from Amina Hojamet’s village can be tracked via satellite imagery on Google Earth. The installation was first built around 2013 though it may have initially been used for another purpose. In the years since it has more than doubled in size and what appear to be watchtowers can be seen on walls around dormitory-like buildings according to a review of historical satellite imagery.

Other open source data helps confirm this: a tender for business issued by the Xinjiang government in 2017 reviewed by CNN seeks a $21 million refit and expansion of the camp – described as a Legal Education Transformation School.

As scrutiny over Xinjiang increased reports in state media about the “de-radicalization” program as well government announcements about the various camps and tenders for supplying them appear to have been scrubbed from the internet with only a small proportion surviving in archived form.

This effort appears to have been inconsistent with some materials surviving online along with reports in state media that can be used to track the evolution of the “vocational training” system even as similar articles which had been written about by human rights groups such as that which contains Hojamet’s story were deleted.

In the past year Chinese state media and officials have begun attacking researcher Adrian Zenz who was the first to use government documents to expose the camps and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute which popularized the use of satellite imagery to track their growth. Zenz was among multiple academics and politicians in the European Union and United Kingdom sanctioned by China in March.

Beijing has also punished those journalists who helped draw attention to Xinjiang early on. Rajagopalan the Buzzfeed reporter was forced to leave China in August 2018 after her visa extension was denied. Two years later Gerry Shih and Josh Chin who wrote early reports on Xinjiang for the AP and WSJ respectively were among a number of American reporters expelled from China in retaliation for Trump administration limits on US-based Chinese state media.

Pivot

While it would continue to officially deny any “camps” exist in Xinjiang with Foreign Ministry officials reprimanding reporters who used those terms from late 2018 onwards there has been a concerted shift in China’s messaging on this issue.

In October of that year the Xinjiang government all but acknowledged reports about the “re-education” system were correct calling on local officials to expand the number of “vocational skill education training centers” and “carry out anti-extremist ideological education.”

The following week Shohrat Zakir a high-ranking Xinjiang government official told state media the Chinese government was fighting “terrorism and extremism” in its own way and in accordance with UN resolutions.

Former detainees he said had been transformed for the better by their time in the “training centers.” Instead of being led by religion as in the past now they “realized that they are firstly citizens of the nation” Zakir said.

In a white paper published by the State Council Information Office in August 2019 China’s top administrative body wrote “Xinjiang is a key battlefield in the fight against terrorism and extremism in China.”

“(The government) has established vocational education and training centers in accordance with the law to prevent the breeding and spread of terrorism and religious extremism effectively curbing the frequent terrorist incidents and protecting the rights to life health and development of the people of all ethnic groups” the paper said adding “worthwhile results have been achieved.”

Sean Roberts an expert on Central Asia at the George Washington University and author of “The War on the Uyghurs: China’s Internal Campaign against a Muslim Minority” said many officials in Xinjiang appeared to have internalized Beijing’s narrative on the issue.

“People high up know the real extent of the threat and how minor it is but I think some of the lower level officials really do believe what they are doing is saving Uyghurs from extremism and terrorism” he said.

At the international level Beijing has leaned on its allies to push back on criticism from western countries over Xinjiang. After a representative for the United Kingdom issued a statement at the UN General Assembly in 2019 on behalf of 23 countries raising concerns about human rights abuses Belarus made its own statement on behalf of 54 countries voicing approval of China’s “counter-terrorism” program in Xinjiang. Signatories included close allies of China such as Russia Egypt Bolivia and Serbia.

“They have a kind of hubris about this” Roberts said of how China’s messaging has evolved since then. “There’s a level of confidence in having escaped a lot of criticism from the international community a sense that nobody is actually going to punish us for this.”

As well as securing international recognition (of sorts) for its efforts in Xinjiang Beijing has also sought to link its “de-radicalization” program with anti-extremism efforts elsewhere providing a sheen of legitimacy even in practice the comparisons are rather far-fetched.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi among other officials has claimed China’s system is in keeping with the UN “Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism.”

“The Plan of Action suggests early engagement and combining counter-extremism actions with preventive measures” Wang said in a 2019 speech. “That is precisely what Xinjiang has been doing. Visible progress has been made: There has not been a single case of violent terrorism in the past three years.”

That same year Zakir the region’s top Uyghur official said “most (detainees) have already gone back to society.”

“I can say 90% of them have found suitable and enjoyable jobs that bring them considerable income” he said adding many Uyghurs were originally lacking employable skills and jobless though records kept by overseas Uyghur groups suggest many intellectuals and highly-qualified individuals have also been sent to the camps.

Beginning around December 2020 according to a review of government statements officials also began to compare the situation in Xinjiang to programs elsewhere in the world such as the UK’s Desistance and Disengagement Programme and French de-radicalisation centers.

Both French and British programs involve individuals convicted of terrorism offences or on watchlists and are governed by both domestic human rights law and the European Convention on Human Rights. By contrast many detainees in Xinjiang are locked up for non-terror related offences such as breaching family planning regulations or for religious practices deemed to be indicative of alleged “extremism” such as wearing the burqa growing a beard or reading the Quran.

For its part the UN plan also notes “violations of international human rights law committed in the name of state security can facilitate violent extremism by marginalizing individuals and alienating key constituencies thus generating community support and sympathy for and complicity in the actions of violent extremists.”

Government tenders for expanding and stocking internment camps in Xinjiang provided early evidence of the system’s size and scope.

Propaganda

Months after censors scrubbed stories like Amina Hojamet’s from the internet in an apparent attempt to cover-up evidence of what was going on in Xinjiang a new wave of propaganda was pushed out by Beijing emphasizing both the supposed terrorist threat and the success of the government’s so-called “anti-extremism” program in tackling it.

In a video published by state broadcaster CGTN in late 2019 one prominent interviewee suggests – over footage of the 9/11 attacks and the Boston Marathon bombings – that the response to such attacks in the West may “have actually served to help the purposes of terrorists and their organizations.”

“In their responses you can see the main reasons why terrorism has failed to be curbed at the root” says Li Wei a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations a government think tank.

During an anti-terrorism symposium held on the sidelines of the UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva in 2020 co-sponsored by Beijing’s mission to the UN participants heard how “China is willing to share the ‘Chinese experience’ with the international community” according to an official write up of the event.

This shift may have been motivated by a wave of leaks – largely unheard of in Chinese politics – which exposed both the scale of the camps and the largely inconsequential “offences” which got detainees sent there as well as the involvement of President Xi and other top officials in putting the system in place.

While China denounced the leaks secret speeches credited to Xi published by the New York Times appear to line up with coverage in state media from the time they were given. With Xi so publicly identified as one of the architects of what has since been called a genocide in Xinjiang China’s propaganda bureau may have felt obliged to spin the entire situation as a success.

Xi himself said in September 2020 that the policy followed in Xinjiang has been “completely correct” and called on the government to “tell the story of Xinjiang in a multi-level all-round and three-dimensional manner and confidently propagate the excellent social stability of Xinjiang.”

Chinese state media particularly those outlets targeting foreign audiences have pushed this line hard. While stories such as Hojamet’s were scrubbed from the internet in what may have been a kneejerk reaction to international criticism they have been replaced by a glut of content showcasing happy successful graduates from the “vocational training” system.

“Through the training I realized that my past beliefs were completely wrong and religious extremism was our enemy. It’s a disease which poisons our body and a drug which leads us to death” one woman told reporters at a press conference held by the Xinjiang government. “I must stay away from religious extremism and lead a normal life.”

Foreign diplomats from countries close to China – including Iran Pakistan and Russia – have been invited to tour Xinjiang even visiting camps though representatives from the US and other countries have complained of being denied unfettered access to the region.

China’s propaganda organs have also organized tightly-controlled press trips to Xinjiang again mostly for media thought to be sympathetic though early on several international press agencies were invited to visit a camp resulting in embarrassment for Beijing when they reported the situation there largely matched the testimony of survivors.

Such visits have been denounced as “Potemkin-style propaganda tours for unwitting foreigners” by Amnesty International producing a stream of positive stories about the situation in the camps and China’s success in fighting terrorism which often blindly repeat official propaganda.

One of the few US publications able to send a correspondent to Xinjiang in recent years was International Focus a tiny Houston-based magazine which caters to the city’s diplomatic community.

According to a piece by publisher Val Thompson from May 2019 she was invited to go to Xinjiang by the State Council Information Office joining a multinational group of journalists.

Writing of visiting the government-run “Exhibition of Major Terrorist Attacks and Violent Crimes in Xinjiang” Thompson said the experience was “eye-opening I had no idea the PRC was dealing with extremist activity.”

At the Kashgar Vocational Skills Educational and Training Center she said she interviewed “several” detainees who “were or could be victims of extremist teaching.”

“They were treated well by their supervisors” Thompson wrote in her article which has been promoted online by China’s State Council. “For those who want to believe these young people may have been coerced I say you can’t fake happiness; and happiness is exactly what I saw.”

Thompson and International Focus did not respond to a request for comment.

In recent weeks China’s propaganda organs have ramped up their counter narrative including producing a musical – “The Wings of Song” – purporting to show the ethnic harmony that exists in modern Xinjiang.

State broadcaster CGTN which targets foreign audiences also dispatched a reporter to Kashgar last month from where she filed live reports signing off with the line: “There’s definitely no genocide so to speak. So Michelle back to you.”

One video released by CGTN may have made the opposite point however: a new documentary about the threat of “extremism” that existed prior to the recent crackdown gave as examples textbooks published and approved by China’s own propaganda organs demonstrating how previously innocuous references to Uyghur culture and Islam have become taboo.

Retaliation

This propaganda push appears to have been successful particularly in convincing many Muslim majority countries to back Beijing or at least in giving their leaders cover in doing so.

Not all journalists who were taken on government-run tours of Xinjiang were convinced however. The experience of Olsi Jazexhi since he first wrote about his trip is indicative of how far China will allegedly go to try and control the narrative over Xinjiang and tear down those who attempt to challenge it.

A Canadian-Albanian writer and historian Jazexhi said he wanted to visit Xinjiang after reading reports in Western media which he felt were exaggerated. He was highly suspicious of the involvement of the US government fearing it was attempting to promote extremism among Uyghurs or fabricate human rights abuses in order to attack China.

“I’m generally skeptical of Western propaganda about the rest of the world” Jazexhi said. “Very often they lie.”

After showing his writing and YouTube channel to the Chinese embassy in Tirana the Albanian capital Jazexhi was approved to join a trip to Xinjiang in August 2019 along with 20 other journalists most of whom were from Muslim countries he said.

“The desire of the Communist Party was that when we go back to our home countries we would say things are fine in Xinjiang and the Americans and whoever are lying about the Uyghur issue” Jazexhi said.

At first landing in Urumqi he was greatly impressed. The Xinjiang capital had undergone significant development in recent years and was in Jazexhi’s eyes “better built and more beautiful than Toronto.”

But then the real propaganda started with a series of lectures by Chinese historians and local officials as well as tours of terrorism exhibits such as that described by Thompson.

A historian of Islam and nationalism and knowledgeable about Central Asia Jazexhi was appalled by what he heard.

“The narrative was Xinjiang has always been a part of China and these Turks and Islam are latecomers” said Jazexhi. “It shocked not only me but even other Muslim journalists on the tour. It depicted Islam as a primitive religion and Uyghurs as invaders and newcomers who were Islamized by less civilized Arabs.”

Similar claims have been made in Chinese government documents and in interviews given by officials to state media such as one where the mayor and deputy Party chief of Urumqi described the idea of Uyghurs being native to Xinjiang as a “ridiculous ignorant and condemnable” fallacy.

“The Uyghur people are members of the Chinese family not descendants of the Turks let alone anything to do with Turkish people” he added.

Jazexhi’s experience in the “vocational training and education centers” his tour was taken to visit was even more eye-opening.

After “being brainwashed for two to three days that China is suffering from Islamic extremism” Jazexhi said he expected to come face to face with a Chinese version of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the former leader of ISIS.

Instead the people he spoke to – via a government interpreter – were normal men and women whose “only mistake to end up in this detention center was that they had read a history of East Turkestan online or read the Quran with their mother or prayed with their father.”

While his Chinese minders said the place was not a prison Jazexhi said they admitted detainees could not leave nor could they talk to relatives except via tightly-controlled weekly video calls.

“It was a prison but it was painted in such a way to give us an impression that it was a school” he said. “When we asked (detainees) questions in Turkish or English they did not dare to respond before asking their Chinese minders what to say.”

In one video taken by Jazexhi during his trip he spoke with a 23-year-old woman in a camp in Aksu. Through a government interpreter the woman said she had been detained for “watching unlawful videos” wearing a burqa and encouraging other women in her village to do the same.

He said the stories were “unimaginable” adding that two female journalists from the Middle East both of whom were veiled were particularly upset to hear from Uyghur detainees that they were there for wearing a hijab or burqa.

“From our visit to two camps in Kashgar and Aksu we saw beyond doubt that China is openly eradicating the Islamic identity and Turkish identity of these people” Jazexhi said. “I went to defend China but I found out I could not defend it.”

When he asked his fellow journalists if they planned to write about what they saw most demurred saying they would not be allowed to. Jazexhi’s minders meanwhile had apparently become aware the trip was not having the desired impression and began shadowing him ever more closely.

“They were really displeased by our attitude when we were inside Xinjiang because they understood in a way that they had failed with our group” he said. “They even warned us not to dare to report anything negative because that would be unacceptable.”

Upon returning to Albania and publishing his findings Jazexhi said he has suffered retaliation from China. A university he taught at canceled his courses which he said was due to Chinese pressure.

A spokesman for the Xinjiang government accused Jazexhi of being unethical and “spreading false information” while China’s ambassador to Turkey denounced an article by Jazexhi as one “in which facts are distorted and basic knowledge is absent.” Chinese state media suggested Jazexhi was driven by “malice” and his actions “went against the basic professional ethics as a reporter.”

The pushback against Jazexhi however is nothing compared to how vociferously Chinese officials have gone after some former detainees attacking the “inferior character” of one woman who had spoken to foreign reporters and publicising her alleged medical history.

Another critic Gulchehra Hoja a prominent Uyghur journalist who previously spoke to CNN about her family’s experiences in the camp system said she recently discovered she had been placed on a terrorist wanted list after China’s foreign ministry publicly denounced her and claimed she lied about her parents having been detained.

“It’s a completely baseless accusation and it’s outrageous” she told CNN. “My only crime is being a journalist reporting on what’s happening to the Uyghurs.”

This “with us or against us” attitude has ramped up considerably in recent months with new sanctions passed by Beijing against UK and EU lawmakers and think tanks as well as numerous boycotts of Western companies such as H&M and Nike which have expressed concern about using Xinjiang cotton in their supply lines.

A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Albania said Jazexhi’s claims were “untrue” and referred questions about his employment to his former university which did not respond to a request for comment. His former employer also did not respond.

“All my life I have criticized the Americans but never have I been blacklisted by the American government had my name condemned” Jazexhi said. “The Chinese are even more angry with me because they invited me I was their guest.”

He added that he had been told “that if I shut up I would have ‘opportunities’ but I said I cannot lie about the horror I’ve seen I’m a Muslim.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVzdHJvbmcuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTM3NjM3NDktbWFyYXRob24tc3RhdGlzdGljcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,86 Marathon Statistics You Should Know,"Marathon finishes make up only about 12 percent of global race results but completing a marathon is still a bucket-list goal for many runners.

Some of the marathon health benefits may even convince first-timers to give this distance a try.

Most marathons typically categorize runners into female or male groups which is why we use the terms ""women"" and ""men"" below.

Global Marathon Statistics

Wondering about the popularity of the marathon around the world? About 1.1 million runners complete a marathon each year which is roughly 0.01 percent of the world's population according to a 2019 report from the International Institute for Race Medicine (IIRM). But where speed is concerned Europe is home to some of the fastest marathoners in the world.

Marathon Statistics by Age

Younger doesn't necessarily mean faster in the marathon. Generally middle-aged runners tend to finish marathons most quickly.

The average marathon runner is about 40 years old according to the IIRM.

Runners above the age of 70 are the slowest marathon runners.

Runners in the 30- to 50-year-old age group are the fastest.

Fauja Singh who ran the Toronto Marathon in 2011 at 100 years old is the oldest person to ever complete the distance according to the Associated Press.

According to Meteor Run a running statistics platform these are the marathon finish times you'd need to run to place at the top of each age group:

What's the Best Age to Run a Marathon? There's no ideal age to run a marathon and your finish time will depend on a variety of factors (not just how old you are). But women tend to perform their best at about 32 years old whereas men generally run their best times around age 34 according to a June 2019 ​‌International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health‌​ study.

Marathon Statistics by Sex

Men tend to be faster marathon runners than women but as a whole women are becoming speedier each year while the average men's finish time has slowed down per the IIRM. Race participation is also growing faster among women than men according to RunRepeat.

About 30% of global marathon participants are women.

Between 2008 and 2018 women's marathon participation increased by 56.83% while men's participation increased by 46.91% according to RunRepeat.

196586 of the 443878 total marathon finishers in the U.S. in 2018 were women.

The average men's marathon finish time is about 4 hours 15 minutes according to the IIRM.

Men's average marathon pace is about 10 minutes 20 seconds per mile.



67.9% of male runners have completed at least one marathon.



The average women's marathon finish time is about 4 hours 45 minutes.



Women's average marathon pace is about 11 minutes 41 seconds per mile.



53.9% of female runners have completed at least one marathon.

The largest group of female marathon participants 31.5% are in the 30 to 39 age bracket according to Meteor Run.

The largest group of male participants 29.1% are in the 40 to 49 age group.

Marathon Finish Time Statistics

Globally the average marathon time is a little over 4 hours — and has been slowing down over the past decade per the IIRM.

Worldwide the average marathon time is about 4 hours 21 minutes according to Asics.

The average marathon pace is about 9 minutes 57 seconds per mile (or 6 minutes 11 seconds per kilometer). So anything faster than that average is generally considered a good pace for a marathon.

Per Meteor Run these are the average times you'd need to beat in order to win a marathon: Women: 2 hours 50 minutes 5 seconds Men: 2 hours 26 minutes

Historical Facts About the Marathon

You can trace the first marathon all the way to ancient Greece; however the race as we know it today wasn't established until 1908 according to World Athletics.

The first marathon distance ever run was 26 miles from Marathon to Athens Greece completed by a Greek soldier named Philippedes (also sometimes called Pheidippides) according to World Athletics.

The first Olympic Games held in Athens in 1896 established the 40-kilometer (about 24.85 miles) marathon race.

The marathon was then changed to 26 miles only to be increased by 385 yards (0.2 miles) at the 1908 London Olympics so that runners would finish in front of Queen Alexandra watching the games.

Abbey then 48 was at his day job in Glacier National Park. Working as an aspiring novelist in the 1970s didn’t pay all the bills so Abbey spent a good portion of his life employed by the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service working first as a ranger and then as a seasonal fire lookout.

In 1975 his seasonal stints as a lookout took him to Numa Ridge in the northwestern corner of Glacier National Park.

Like a lot of people Abbey didn’t always love his day job.

Abbey repeatedly attributed his distaste to a few culprits in the lookout’s official logbook: the presence of hikers and other visitors (“No hikers today. Good.”) the aforementioned lack of excitement due to an unusually wet summer in the park and the obnoxious prevalence of mosquitoes.

Many great works of literature have been written or inspired by summers spent manning fire lookouts across America scanning the horizon day in and day out in search of smoke.

Jack Kerouac the beatnik best known for writing “On the Road” included accounts of his job as a fire lookout on Desolation Peak in the North Cascades in several of his books and Norman Maclean of “A River Runs Through It” fame wrote about his time as a lookout in the Bitterroot National Forest.

Abbey the ecological philosopher behind such works as “Desert Solitaire” and “The Monkey Wrench Gang” spent the better part of a decade’s worth of summers as a lookout in Arizona California and Montana.

Abbey’s accounts of those experiences are documented in both his nonfiction and fiction. His novel “Black Sun” featured a protagonist who served as a fire lookout and many of his essays offer glimpses into his time on the job in Arizona.

Less well known is his summer in Glacier Park.

Abbey published just one short collection of journal entries from his summer in Glacier in a chapter of his book “The Journey Home” entitled “Fire Lookout: Numa Ridge.”

The 20-odd pages of his notes are detailed and written in the meandering metaphysical style that characterizes much of Abbey’s writing.

“We’ve been here ten days before I overcome initial inertia sufficient to begin this record” Abbey wrote in “The Journey Home.” “And keeping a record is one of the things the Park Service is paying us to do up here. The other of course it to keep our eyeballs peeled alert for smoke.”

Abbey and his fourth wife Renee Downing arrived at Numa Ridge on July 2 1975 to spend the summer earning a “generous wage” of $3.25 an hour to watch for any hint of smoke or flame in the peaks surrounding Numa Ridge which overlooks Bowman Lake and North Fork Flathead River vistas.

The account of his Glacier summer includes discussions of the books brought to the lookout (seven volumes of Proust and Robert Burton’s “Anatomy of Melancholy”) how he feels that he is cheating the solitary confinement of lookout life by bringing along his wife and many philosophical musings on the world.

“This is a remote place indeed far from the center of the world far away from all that’s going on” Abbey wrote. “Or is it? Who says so? Wherever two human beings are alive together and happy there is the center of the world.”

In contrast entries from the logbook which is held in the Glacier Park archives offers a rawer more intimate portrayal of life at the lookout.

Wed. July 16: “Have whipped wife in five games straight at chess now. She won’t play anymore. Have to think of something else.”

Tues. July 22: “Wife beats me two games of chess … Now she’s getting more interested.”

The prevalence absence and return of the mosquitoes is well documented in the Numa logbook. In contrast Abbey’s published journal spends a lot of time “thinking about GRIZ” although he never manages to track down Glacier’s most iconic fauna that summer.

His published account of July 21 waxes poetic about being an uninvited guest in the homeland of the grizzly bear but the official logbook for that day instead quotes a Ralph Hodgson poem.

“The days rush by with alarming speed. Why this headlong descent into oblivion? Must be some way to slow down that process of decay: need a higher tedium quotient in our daily round.

Time you ol gypsy man/

will you not stay/

put up ur caravan/

just for one day?

Etc.”

In truth from the chore lists to wildflower identifications many of Abbey’s words written in the logbook ring true nearly 50 years later and not just his gripes about mosquitoes.

An entry from August 7 sums up an environmentally focused curmudgeon’s view of Glacier National Park with what is still a complaint from visitors today:

“Too many people; Not enough Grizz [sic].”

The working fire season of 1975 was cut short due to the wet weather and early arrival of winter — Abbey reported two inches of snow on August 24 — with a departure date moved up to September 5 and then August 28.

The last entry is from August 28 just before Abbey packed down the mountain.

“Departure day & naturally it’s raining! Ah well what the hell it was a damn sweet summer.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s good for teeth skin weight control and even the ability to think straight. But drinking water contaminated with pathogenic bacteria heavy metals or other harmful substances can cause diarrhea brain damage infertility and cancer.

Bottled water is no guarantee of water safety. Not only is it not alwayssafe; bottled water is thousands of times more expensive than tap water and the plastic packaging and transport carries heavy environmental costs.

Despite the need for safe water and the myriad pollutants that can contaminate it there is no widely accessible method for everyone to quickly cheaply and accurately test their water’s safety.

Nearly 50 years ago the same was true with pregnancy testing. Early advertisements for at-home pregnancy tests argued that women have “the right to know” if they were pregnant “with the least possible fuss and bother in the least possible time.” This should also apply to drinking water quality.

Because the current water safety tests are still cumbersome to use for most people the goal is to make them as easy to use as a pregnancy test so that they can be easily deployed in homes day care centers and schools.

As professors at Northwestern University who research how to ensure water security for all we are working on democratizing water testing by developing a new kind of test for drinking water that is rapid cheap and accurate; and on quantifying water insecurity globally.

The intention is to implement this new water test into a format that nonscientists can easily use; one that is affordable and gives results within an hour for those who need them most.The technology is far from ready to sell; there is still much work to do to ensure that the lead tests are maximally user friendly.

These tests are different because they harness the power of naturally occurring sensors from biology. Using tools from the nascent field of synthetic biology the sensors can be programmed to change color when a target chemical is present in water.

Because these sensors work outside of cells they can be freeze-dried into tiny white clumps that are shelf-stable. These sensors are ready to indicate water contamination with only a drop of water so there is no need for any complicated laboratory equipment to use them.

These tests can be used to quickly detect lead copper arsenic and fluoride in water with more analytes on the horizon. Northwestern and a spinoff company one of us co-founded are partnering to detect COVID-19 in sewage.

Potential uses include lead testing for the millions of Americans who live in areas with a lead service line piping water from the city into their homes. This is important as many children are unknowingly exposed to the lifelong harms of lead toxicity.

Arsenic tests will be valuable for the millions worldwide who face naturally occurring arsenic in their groundwater. Tests for E. coli would be useful in emergency situations such as the millions in Texas living with boil water notices in February or those in Mississippi recently facing daily water crises.

To be sure most drinking water in the United States is safe. Municipal water treatment plants mostly do a great job testing for and treating standard contaminants like E. coli but sometimes this isn’t enough. For example the Environmental Protection Agency has identified more than 100 “contaminants of emerging concern” that are potentially harmful pollutants most of which are not screened for at all.

Contaminants can also be introduced after the water leaves the treatment plant such as when there are lead service lines leading from the city supply into homes as is the case for many residences in Washington D.C. and Chicago. Additionally 42 million Americans rely on well water which is often not tested.*

For these reasons it is important to understand the quality of water before drinking it to know if filtration is needed and if so the type of filter to use.

The field of rapid water diagnostics is in its early stages but holds much promise for democratizing knowledge about the safety of a substance integral to health and well-being in the U.S. and globally. With knowledge comes power and change; empirical evidence of lead contamination in Flint Mich. was key for bringing the injustices there to global attention.

Global water quality has been jeopardized by a range of catastrophes both invisible and unmissable: failing infrastructure massive fires sewage overflows agricultural runoff and forever chemicals sprayed in unexpected places.

Given the very real risks of drinking contaminated water accurate knowledge about water quality is imperative for both action and advocacy. This necessitates cheap fast and reliable methods of at-home testing that everyone can use.

This story is part of Covering Climate Now a global journalism collaboration strengthening coverage of the climate story.

No country is immune from water scarcity issues — not even the world’s wealthiest country the United States.

The southwestern states in particular have faced frequent and ongoing droughts over the past two decades and traditional water supplies are failing. As groundwater supplies in the region have depleted substantially rainfall has decreased and the costs of importing water have risen substantially.

The region looks to the Colorado River as its plumbing system which currently provides drinking water to 1 in 10 Americans — all while irrigating nearly 5.5 million acres of land. But it’s also being stretched to its limits: Population growth and expansive development are increasing agricultural demands. Meanwhile the pressure to ensure that there is sufficient water left in the environment to support ecosystems has accelerated. According to a study by the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation the demands on the Colorado River are expected to exceed supply by 2040.

On top of this each state has vastly different needs. For example Nevada’s needs are largely urban but Arizona and California require water for huge agricultural and urban sectors. Each year states argue over who has the superior right to water supplies. And once they have their allocation districts frequently end up in litigation over their allotment. There is always a shortage raising questions over who is responsible and who must mitigate for it.

Of course these variables can change year after year and all planning is dictated by a largely unpredictable snowpack and therefore an increasingly erratic river flow. While demand is increasing climate change has damaged supply — and the impact is two-fold as less water comes down the Colorado River people use more water due to increased temperatures.

Simply put there is only so much water.

“When you can’t make the pie bigger and you’re fighting over a finite supply it’s a misery index just an allocation pain for all parties” says Brad Herrema a lawyer who specializes in water law and natural resources.

“But if you can make the pie bigger there’s less fighting.”

Turning Wastewater Into a Resource

Our existing water supplies must go further and the technology exists to make this happen — by turning wastewater into drinking water. This is not a new science but the practice has evolved significantly in the past 50 years.

In the 1960s water availability became problematic in rapidly growing areas in the U.S. and water managers began to consider using wastewater to augment supplies. A number of water reuse projects were built in the following decades in California Virginia Texas and Georgia but larger developments in the 1990s were met with opposition. “Toilet to tap” narratives in the media fed misperceptions regarding the treatment process which helped to dismantle public support for these projects. What “toilet to tap” now misses are membrane filtration membrane desalination ozone and advanced oxidation to name but a few treatment options that make the purified water entirely safe to drink.

But advances in these very technologies associated with water reuse helped boost confidence in and acceptance of the practice among water professionals in the early 2000s. Now water reuse is entering the mainstream.

Almost half of all the potable reuse projects built in California since the first in 1962 have been installed in the past 10 years with several more on the horizon for the early 2020s. California — with more potable reuse projects than any other state — used around 1.5 million acre-feet per year (AFY) of reused water in 2020 with one acre-foot equivalent to about 326000 gallons and enough to cover a football field. The state plans to increase this to 2.5 million AFY by 2030 almost doubling the number especially once planned potable reuse projects are installed.

And according to a document by the Environmental Protection Agency and CDM Smith Inc. potable reuse also makes up “a significant portion” of the nation’s water supply once de facto reuse is factored in.

What’s clear is that some major U.S. cities are already delivering recycled wastewater to the consumer on a massive scale and making the pie larger.

How a city can recycle wastewater depends largely on the geography of the area financial resources — and perhaps most importantly the attitudes of the public.

Las Vegas

Las Vegas recycles nearly all of its water used indoors giving it a virtually inexhaustible supply of water for domestic consumption. The city benefits from its unique geography. Nearly 90 percent of southern Nevada’s water is taken from Lake Mead which lies on the Colorado River. It is then treated and run through the city’s system. After it’s flushed or drained the water makes its way to a wastewater treatment plant before it’s discharged into the Las Vegas Wash. From there it makes its way to Lake Mead where it is either drawn back out or stays in the river ensuring there’s enough water for cities downstream of Vegas.

One key element that makes Vegas’s reuse system so effective is the Wash: a 12-mile-long channel that acts “as the ‘kidneys’ of the environment cleaning the water that runs through … [it by] filtering out [any] harmful residues” on its way back to Lake Mead. Thanks to the Wash when the water is withdrawn again it does not need to go through a costly process of advanced treatment and instead undergoes just basic drinking water treatment.

Another key factor in Vegas’s success is that for every gallon of water Las Vegas puts into Lake Mead it can take a gallon back out — meaning the city is essentially recycling its indoor water in a closed loop. This is known as de facto water reuse.

Nevada is allocated 300000 AFY of water from the Colorado River each year. Bronson Mack who oversees water resources and operations at Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) says that in 2019 the city actually diverted 490000 AFY of water from the Colorado River but only consumed 234000 AFY. About 256000 AFY was returned to the lake.

“Our return flow credits system is unique” says Colby Pellegrino director of the water resources department for SNWA. “Once we return the water to Lake Mead we’re not charged for that water. We’re only charged for the total we depleted.”

Mack adds that local water utilities pay $313 for treatment and delivery of one AF of water and pass that cost on to the consumer. If Vegas could not return such a large proportion of its water that cost would rise dramatically.

De facto reuse is also vital for a city that can’t afford to gamble on the weather — Las Vegas is the driest city in the U.S. When the Colorado River ran at 40 percent of its usual capacity in 2002 the city was struck by drought but its citizens still had unlimited access to indoor water.

“Vegas couldn’t exist without [the] return flow credits approach” says Daniel Gerrity an assistant professor of environmental engineering at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. “Without that we’d have already maxed out.”

This means the city’s major conservation efforts go into limiting outdoor use. And so contrary to expectations it is not the casinos that are the problem — but the local residents who irrigate their gardens and wash their cars. After all water lost to evaporation is water lost forever.

However not every city has a Lake Mead or a Wash. For places without Vegas’s luck there are other ways to do water reuse.

Orange County California

Orange County Water District (OCWD) is a world leader in water reuse. Since 2008 it has provided drinking water to 2.5 million people — in a region with no more than 15 inches of annual rainfall — through its Groundwater Replenishment System (GWRS) project. This water would otherwise be discharged into the Pacific Ocean. By keeping it in the system there is less reliance on the Colorado River easing the strain on its supplies.

The city utilizes a process called indirect potable reuse (IPR). In the absence of an environmental filtration process like the Las Vegas Wash Orange County’s wastewater has to undergo advanced treatment before it is pumped to a groundwater basin. From there it is pumped to the consumer via a standard drinking water treatment train making it safe to consume and completing the cycle. The process not only turns wastewater back into a resource but also saves massively on the cost of pumping Colorado River water from hundreds of miles away.

GWRS which is a joint project of OCWD and the Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD) currently supplies north and central Orange County with 77 percent of its water supply and it is expanding its wastewater treatment capacity from 100 to 130 million gallons per day by 2023. OCWD’s executive director of engineering and water resources John Kennedy says the expansion will save providers in Orange County over $6 million per year as there will be more water available to pump from the basin. Currently he says the other 23 percent of the water requirement of Orange County must be bought at approximately three times the price of reused water from another regional wholesaler — the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California — that operates the Colorado River Aqueduct which is a 242-mile water conveyance. And so expanding the water reuse projects not only makes the pie bigger but there’s also an economic incentive attached to it.

“Orange County is the benchmark [for] water reuse system” says Gerrity.

Water managers from around the world visit OCWD to learn how they’ve managed such success.

Like so many regions innovating in water reuse drought forced their hand. In 1975 as imported water supplies became less available and another source of water was needed to fight seawater intrusion. In April 1975 OCWD unveiled a facility that took treated wastewater from the OCSD blended it with deep well water and injected it into a basin. In 1977 OCWD became the first in the world to use reverse osmosis to purify wastewater to drinking water standards.

The project was expanded in line with the demand in the ‘90s and the GWRS which has been operational since 2008 is now the world’s largest advanced water purification system for potable use.

And through it all OCWD managed to swerve the “toilet to tap” attacks that had ruined public support for such projects in other areas of California.

How?

“People expect to find out that our success is grounded in some secret technology but they find out it’s all about education education education” says Rob Thompson the director of engineering at OCSD which treats the water before sending it to the basin managed by OCWD. “Bringing the public on board with drinking [recycled] wastewater takes a lot of outreach. Getting over the ‘yuck factor’ is everything. We had to speak with NGOs governors the authorities politicians — you name it we spoke to them. Once you have enough people on board everyone starts to think it must be okay.”

“People have high expectations about the quality of their water and have a lot of questions” adds Megan Plumlee who heads OCWD’s research and development department. “We explain to the public what we’re doing and how it’ll benefit the district retailers and community.”

San Diego currently embarking on a huge potable reuse project followed OCWD’s lead when developing their project. Indeed sometimes it takes a leader in the field for a new process to take hold someone to show the way and prove something can be done safely on a large scale.

“We weren’t the first to try it but we were the first to succeed on such a massive scale. That’s because we were the first to really embrace education. Now others are doing the same” says Thompson.

Now 14 states have developed regulations that allow for IPR with several more IPR projects on the horizon that will help bolster water supplies — all without putting additional pressure on the Colorado River.

Another method of water reuse which is more efficient is yet to take hold in the U.S. — though it may be about to find its leader.

San Diego

Direct potable reuse (DPR) was labeled the final frontier of water reuse by Tracy Mehan the executive director for government affairs at the American Water Works Association (AWWA) in an essay written for A Bigger Planet: Forty Big Ideas for a Sustainable Future. The process does away with an environmental buffer and pumps wastewater directly through an advanced treatment train before it is purified and put straight back into the system in a matter of hours.

Given this reality DPR can deliver water more efficiently and cost-effectively by using existing infrastructure and without needing to build expensive and energy-intensive pipelines to a reservoir or groundwater basin. DPR can also allow for more water to be recycled than IPR as there are no limitations on the reservoir or groundwater basin.

Additionally DPR avoids regulations on putting water back into the environment by eliminating the buffer. And finally DPR can be more reliable and efficient: Jeff Mosher vice president and principal technologist at Carollo Engineers a leading firm in engineering water reuse systems explains that DPR can turn wastewater into drinking water in a matter of hours faster than IPR or any other method of reuse.

Only two facilities in the U.S. are currently equipped to operate DPR — both are in Texas. Big Spring in West Texas identified DPR as the most feasible way to address an urgent need to diversify the city’s water portfolio and increase its supply reliability for when rains failed to fill the city’s reservoirs — the project now serves around 135000 people. Wichita Falls in northern Texas serving 150000 people followed Big Spring’s example. Anticipating a water crisis with the city reservoirs at less than 20 percent capacity in 2012 and lacking a groundwater backup supply Wichita Falls determined DPR was a viable means of urgently meeting potable water demands. The two systems can supply 2 million and 5 million gallons per day respectively.

Both facilities have been successful and without incident yet the catalyst for both was an emergency. Such was the water crisis both cities were facing Texas had to use emergency water regulations in order to build the facilities without formal DPR regulations. DPR is yet to become a mainstream and a trusted water supply system and it still remains unused outside times of crisis and for larger communities.

Only Arizona has draft regulations that allow for DPR while formal regulations are drawn while California Colorado and Florida are actively pursuing regulations. This is mainly due to a lack of public acceptance. The speed at which DPR recycles wastewater makes it particularly vulnerable to “toilet to tap” attacks and this has consumers concerned who worry over the small room for error and the “yuck factor.”

An attempt to introduce potable reuse in San Diego in the 1990s failed after fears of “drinking sewage” diminished trust in the project and fostered uncertainty about the safety of the water.

And in 2005 just 28 percent of people randomly surveyed in San Diego strongly favored or somewhat favored using advanced treated recycled water to supplement the drinking water supply.

But that number is now 79 percent.

San Diego has changed its mind and now it may one day do for DPR what OCWD has done for IPR and pave the way for DPR use on a wider scale.

With lessons learned from OCWD outreach helped bring the community on board in San Diego. “We had to educate the community on the concept [of potable reuse]” Amy Dorman a senior engineer on San Diego’s Pure Water program says. “We ran focus groups with the community made ourselves flexible moving forward and recognized the importance of listening to the community. In the ‘90s there was not the right amount of education. Now it’s comprehensive. We do tours presentations websites mailers and [identify] all stakeholders — [ensuring] diligent and constant outreach.”

Dorman explains that 18665 San Diegans have visited the demonstration facility while the team at Pure Water has spoken to almost 30000 children in schools. They explain that 50000 lab tests have been carried out on the water supply each meeting every regulatory standard and producing exceptional water quality — typical tap water is actually less highly treated than DPR tap water.

But the key statistic is that 85 percent of San Diego’s water is already imported from the Colorado River and Northern California Bay Delta. In fact because the city is downstream Dorman says that the water has already been recycled 49 times by other water districts before it reaches San Diego. She says this usually quells fears that drinking recycled water is unsanitary since as it turns out residents have been doing it for years.

“What we know now is that it’s possible to convince people” adds Mosher. “We have proven that every community you go into that has concerns you can overcome.”

San Diego hopes that by 2035 a third of the city’s supply will come from locally supplied recycled wastewater instead of importing the majority of its water supply.

For phase one the Pure Water San Diego program — funded by the San Diego government — will use IPR to provide the city with 30 million gallons of water per day utilizing the nearby Miramar Reservoir as an environmental buffer in a similar way to how Orange County uses its groundwater basin.

But phases two and three target an additional 53 million gallons of water per day. In the absence of a groundwater basin and large enough reservoirs Pure Water San Diego plans to employ DPR to realize the project’s full scale.

Mosher says that cities with plans to do DPR one day don’t want the attention to be the ones to take the dive into doing it on a large scale. But with projects on the horizon in San Diego as well as El Paso Texas Mosher expects greater faith in the process by the end of the decade and a 2011 public opinion poll shows that citizens are 50 percent more likely to accept recycled water when they learn that other communities have done so already.

Without a leader in the field there is hesitancy among cities interested in doing DPR but Gerrity is positive about the impact San Diego can have countrywide.

“It’s a good platform to go forward” he says. “We have more options for facing water scarcity another tool in the toolbox to tap into. Conservation potable reuse [and] innovative technologies all extend supply and give high-quality drinking water to the public.”

Mainstreaming Potable Reuse

While water reuse is breaking into the mainstream there are still challenges going forward.

It is not simply a matter of copying Las Vegas Orange County or San Diego. The geography and finances of a region often dictate a city’s water supply — and that has a huge impact on what kind of reuse that city can attempt. De facto reuse as in Las Vegas is incredibly site-specific and requires the geography of an area to substitute for advanced treatment while the most successful IPR projects rely on large groundwater basins and nearby reservoirs.

Both types of potable reuse are also incredibly expensive and while they may save money in the long term they require a huge initial investment. The advanced water purification facility in Wichita Falls for example cost $13 million. OCWD serving 2.5 million people will have spent upwards of half-a-billion dollars once the final phase of their project is complete almost doubling their initial outlay. Irrespective of the size of your service area installing an advanced treatment facility is expensive.

There are ways to get around the financial obstacles though. Districts not doing potable reuse may help fund water reuse projects in exchange for a greater share of the pie. Take Las Vegas for example. It makes no sense for SNWA to build an advanced water purification facility — the city’s proximity to Lake Mead keeps pumping costs low and the lake itself acts as a natural cleanser. However SNWA is currently in discussions to potentially fund potable reuse projects in California in exchange for additional water from the Colorado River.

Gerrity says this could happen on a wider scale. “Anywhere with water scarcity it’ll make sense for us to realize by investing in water infrastructure we can alleviate problems.”

And working out what works best for one community is half the battle. Because there is no one size fits all thanks to the geographical nuances that help potable reuse or de facto reuse to work.

“You could take what Orange County does and it’s going to work but the question is whether that is the best approach for that location. So the challenge is now that we feel comfortable with one approach can we do it a different way?” says Gerrity.

Mosher is trying to compile all the information on water reuse into an easy-to-read guidance document that cities considering the process can use to inform which approach may be best for them.

“It’s about getting to a point where communities who want to try DPR don’t feel overwhelmed” says Mosher.

What’s clear is that the Colorado River can no longer be relied upon to provide such vast numbers of people with their water needs. If we are to continue asking so much of it then we have to start easing those pressures. Water reuse is a future imperative if the driest parts of the world are to continue growing without decimating the environment that relies as much on water as we do.

The man-made lakes that store water supplying millions of people in the U.S. West and Mexico are projected to shrink to historic lows in the coming months dropping to levels that could trigger the federal government's first-ever official shortage declaration and prompt cuts in Arizona and Nevada.

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation released 24-month projections this week forecasting that less Colorado River water will cascade down from the Rocky Mountains through Lake Powell and Lake Mead and into the arid deserts of the U.S. Southwest and the Gulf of California. Water levels in the two lakes are expected to plummet low enough for the agency to declare an official shortage for the first time threatening the supply of Colorado River water that growing cities and farms rely on.

It comes as climate change means less snowpack flows into the river and its tributaries and hotter temperatures parch soil and cause more river water to evaporate as it streams through the drought-plagued American West.

The agency’s models project Lake Mead will fall below 1075 feet (328 meters) for the first time in June 2021. That's the level that prompts a shortage declaration under agreements negotiated by seven states that rely on Colorado River water: Arizona California Colorado Nevada New Mexico Utah and Wyoming.

The April projections however will not have binding impact. Federal officials regularly issue long-term projections but use those released each August to make decisions about how to allocate river water. If projections don't improve by then the Bureau of Reclamation will declare a Level 1 shortage condition. The cuts would be implemented in January.

Arizona Nevada and Mexico have voluntarily given up water under a drought contingency plan for the river signed in 2019. A shortage declaration would subject the two U.S. states to their first mandatory reductions. Both rely on the Colorado River more than any other water source and Arizona stands to lose roughly one-third of its supply.

Water agency officials say they’re confident their preparation measures including conservation and seeking out alternative sources would allow them to withstand cuts if the drought lingers as expected.

""The study while significant is not a surprise. It reflects the impacts of the dry and warm conditions across the Colorado River Basin this year as well as the effects of a prolonged drought that has impacted the Colorado River water supply” officials from the Arizona Department of Water Resources and Central Arizona Project said in a joint statement.

In Nevada the agency that supplies water to most of the state has constructed “straws” to draw water from further down in Lake Mead as its levels fall. It also has created a credit system where it can bank recycled water back into the reservoir without having it count toward its allocation.

Colby Pellegrino director of water resources for the Southern Nevada Water Authority reassured customers that those preparation measures would insulate them from the effects of cuts. But she warned that more action was needed.

“It is incumbent upon all users of the Colorado River to find ways to conserve” Pellegrino said in a statement.

The Bureau of Reclamation also projected that Lake Mead will drop to the point they worried in the past could threaten electricity generation at Hoover Dam. The hydropower serves millions of customers in Arizona California and Nevada.

To prepare for a future with less water the bureau has spent 10 years replacing parts of five of the dam's 17 turbines that rotate to generate power. Len Schilling a dam manager with the bureau said the addition of wide-head turbines allow the dam to operate more efficiently at lower water levels. He said the turbines will be able to generate power almost to a point called “deadpool” when there won't be enough water for the dam to function.

But Schilling noted that less water moving through Hoover Dam means less hydropower to go around.

“As the elevation declines at the lake then our ability to produce power declines as well because we have less water pushing on the turbines"" he said.

The hydropower costs substantially less than the energy sold on the wholesale electricity market because the government charges customers only for the cost of producing it and maintaining the dam.

Lincoln County Power District General Manager Dave Luttrell said infrastructure updates less hydropower from Hoover Dam and supplemental power from other sources like natural gas raised costs and alarmed customers in his rural Nevada district.

“Rural economies in Arizona and Nevada live and die by the hydropower that is produced at Hoover Dam. It might not be a big deal to NV Energy” he said of Nevada's largest utility. “It might be a decimal point to Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. But for Lincoln County it adds huge impact.”

The 11-year-old isn’t one yet. But Will Meinhardt is quickly catching up to his 14-year-old brother Reid who last year was ranked number one in the world in his age group in slalom water skiing.

“There’s a lot more upstairs” murmured the older Meinhardt brother adjusting the white ribbons of the medals he won in August when he took first place in two skiing categories at a national championship in Louisiana.

Lifelong Alpena residents Will and Reid were both on water skis by the time they were three swept into their dad’s hobby and sometimes held in his arms as they splashed across Long Lake.

Now the boys are setting state and regional records and making friends from around the world as they quietly pursue — and achieve — greatness learning lessons about hard work and stick-to-it-iveness along the way.

Though both boys usually enjoy trick skiing the most they have mastered slalom skiing in which a skier runs as many passes as possible weaving among buoys and pulled by a boat going faster with each pass.

If the boat isn’t getting faster the rope connecting the boat to the boy gets shorter until the skier has to stretch and lean to make it around a buoy.

Reid who earned enough points at August’s championship tournament to be called the best in the world can get around a buoy on a rope that ends a foot-and-a-half short of the marker.

“That’s pretty good” Reid said talking comfortably in his family’s State Avenue home on Monday.

Trick skiing — in which Reid earned enough points at nationals to beat not only his age group but all the adults and other youth at the competition as well — involves completing as many spins flips and whirls as possible in two 20-second passes.

During the second pass “you put the rope on your foot which sounds crazy” Will said.

Toe work as it’s called earns more points and is more fun to watch incorporating graceful movements almost like a dance said the boy’s mom Anna Meinhardt as Will shared a smartphone video of one of his trick runs.

Will placed first in the country in his age division at the August competition in which the Meinhardt brothers made a big splash.

“We won a lot of it” Reid said.

Many summer days find the boys zipping down Long Lake entertaining residents as they practice slalom runs.

Trick skiing requires safer water where no passing boats could make even small waves that could lead to a sprained ankle. The brothers say they’re lucky to have access to a friend’s personal lake in an old quarry for the hours of practice they put into getting so good.

Though Alpena offers good training spaces much of their work is done in Florida at a professional water skiing school where young people from all over the world flock in hopes of excelling at their craft.

The boys have friends from Argentina Russia Germany Columbia and other faraway places. Sometimes Anna Meinhardt said Will and Reid are the only ones on the dock speaking English.

Many years the boys can only get to Florida during school holidays. The coronavirus pandemic has been a good fit for their sport though they said. Not only are they safely socially distanced when outdoors behind a boat they have also been attending school virtually full-time making way for training trips to Florida.

It took him three years of falls and failures to learn to do his first flip Reid said.

“As a mom you want to be like ‘Why don’t you stop trying’ admitted their mother describing watching her son crashing into the water dozens of times in a row.

When he did finally learn a flip though he took to it instantly and learned eight more in no time.

Sticking with a discipline has taught them about pursuing goals the skiers said.

Before the national competition Will set his sights on standing on the five-person podium. He worked hard to earn a spot in the top five — “And then I took first” Will said.

Reid was slowed by an injury several years ago and Will is catching up to his older brother holding four state records and winning five state state championships. Reid holds five Midwest records which Will may break before too long.

Competitions though they come with fun travels and stops at Chick-fil-A mean a lot of pressure for a skier driving across the county to only ski 40 seconds and maybe fall.

The experience teaches them it’s OK to try and fail the boys’ mom said — and to have fun along the way.

“Hard work pays off” Reid said a row of his and his brother’s medals and trophies stretched in front of him. “The more you work the better you’ll be.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDQvbmotd2F0ZXItc3lzdGVtcy1hcmUtZXhwb3NlZC10by1oYWNrZXJzLWEtbmVhci1kaXNhc3Rlci1pbi1mbG9yaWRhLXNob3dzLXRoZS10aHJlYXQuaHRtbNIBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uai5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA0L25qLXdhdGVyLXN5c3RlbXMtYXJlLWV4cG9zZWQtdG8taGFja2Vycy1hLW5lYXItZGlzYXN0ZXItaW4tZmxvcmlkYS1zaG93cy10aGUtdGhyZWF0Lmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,N.J. water systems are exposed to hackers.

A quick example of using python with the Dash pyvista and the dash_vtk libraries to import and view unstructured grid data in the browser Steve Kiefer · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 10 min read · Apr 19 2021 -- 1 Listen Share

Look ma! A mesh without the rainbow!

Introduction

Python needs no real introduction. Its mature has lots of powerful libraries and is easy to read and code. Plotly’s Dash framework is an easy to use way to develop web applications using only python. VTK is a mature C++ 3D library with a python port and VTK.js is VTK reimplemented for the browser that leverages webGL. VTK & Plotly recently announced the release of dash_vtk and hosted a webinar showing what it can do.

Years ago I dabbled in VTK-python building a couple applications using pyQt that could display and slice structural Finite Element Analysis mesh & results. Recently I have been pacing a lot of analysis related tools or databases into web-apps using Dash. Why? For starters its much easier to get something interactive & good looking. Looks may not be everything but they are certainly something! The web apps are also easier to control and update (no old copies floating around) and the Plotly graphing libraries look good without much tweaking.

The one thing missing with this new toolset has been good 3D visualization. Plotly has some capabilities and I have gotten by but its a bit lacking in 3D model support. So when I heard about dash_vtk I was excited! I could integrate my 3D results into some new apps except…..I didn’t see much support or discussion for what vtk calls unstructured meshes. An unstructured mesh is a general 3D mesh that is comprised of different element types & shapes (hexahedron tetrahedron quadrilateral etc) and the grid distances are not necessarily regular and there can be a mix of element shapes in any mesh. This is the most common (if not only) only mesh type used in structural analysis of general physical parts. So I decided to see if I could adapt what little I could remember from previously working with VTK (via python) and make it work in dash_vtk.

This article walks through creating a Dash web app that allows a user to upload mesh files (nodes & element data) and view results. To keep it relatively short and focused I’m going to assume the reader has some familiarity with Dash. If not check out the official Dash tutorial and documentation they have lots of examples posted.

Below is gif that shows the app in action. Here is the link to the github repo.

Spinning Models! Weeeeee!

Welcome Pyvista!

VTK is not a super user-friendly library at least for a novice like me. There are actors mappers controllers all kinds of objects that need to be created and connected to be able to display and interact with some 3D data. Soon after starting to explore dash_vtk I found the pyvista library (its pretty easy to find its mentioned a bunch on the dash_vtk documentation). Pyvista either wasn’t around when I was last using VTK or I just didn’t find it. I’m glad it exists and I sincerely thank the developers. It makes working with VTK objects much easier and more familiar.

Quoting the pyvista documentation:

PyVista is… “VTK for humans”: a high-level API to the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) mesh data structures and filtering methods for spatial datasets 3D plotting made simple and built for large/complex data geometries

Getting Mesh & Results Into VTK

The basic workflow for getting an unstructured mesh from some other tool into VTK is to:

Export the grid ID’s and locations relative to a common coordinate system Export the element IDs and the associated nodes Map the node ordering / element topology into VTK’s order Renumber / re-index so that element and grid IDs match the index position in their respective lists

To convert any other source mesh into VTK you will need to know the element node ordering & connectivity. You will need to reorder your grids assigned to each element so they fall in the order VTK expects or you will get twisted elements. No one wants twisted elements. These links show the VTK ordering:

Getting Mesh Data Out of Ansys Mechanical

I use Ansys Mechanical for most of my structural analysis. It is not open source and definitely not cheap. If you don’t use it and/or don’t care how I am getting the data out feel free to skip this section. This isn’t the main focus so I’ll be brief. The steps to exporting data from Ansys mechanical are:

Create a node named selection that contains all nodes of the part/body you want. A worksheet named selection can help convert bodies to nodes. Repeat step 1 for the elements Right click on each of those named selections and select Export Test File Create a results object with the same body of interest. Once the solve is complete right-click and again Export Text File

Below are the first few lines of each file this app is setup to process.

The Function

We will be using dcc.Upload components to allow the user to upload the files into the web app. When using these components the file objects get passed as base64 strings and must be decoded. Once decoded they can be added to a io.StringIO object and used like a filename. I created a function outside of the callbacks to process the base64 string data and convert it to a VTK / pyvista objects that we can use with dash_vtk.

Below is an abbreviated version of the function that does the main work getting our mesh data into VTK format. Let’s walk through it!

The function expects at least 2 files for creating the mesh and optionally a results file. lets start with creating the mesh. In the first few lines we get the base64 string decoded and read into a Pandas Dataframe. On lines 7–10 we are re-indexing so the node ids match the position in the list of nodes but allow for a single offset at the start. If your mesh (or portion you are processing) is not continuous this helps maintain alignment from the nodes to cells and results.

See the repo for converting and re-indexing the element data from the base64 object. We also need the number of nodes that defines each element and for this data we can pull it from the element names (eg Tet10).

At line 18 of this gist we have the dictionary that maps the element name to the VTK element type. The keys are specific to the Ansys Mechanical export you would replace these with whatever your tool FE tool names its element types. On line 25 we perform the mapping into the element dataframe and drop any elements that didn’t get mappped. At this point we have a nodes dataframe and element dataframe reindexed with all the info we need.

On line 28 we convert the portion of the nodes dataframe we need into a 2D numpy array that only contains XYZ locations. For the elements we need a separate array with just the VTK element types: cell_types . Next we convert the node id portion of the element dataframe to a numpy array and subtract the lowest grid id. This is again due to VTK using positions as the mapping rather than explicit ids. We then hstack the number of nodes per element array in front of the modified node ids array to get a 2D array:

[

[n_nodes node_index_1 node_index_2 node_index_3....]

[n_nodes node_index_1 node_index_2 node_index_3....]

...

]

Pyvista wants this as a flattened list so we ravel() on line 37. If your mesh is a mix of different element types (with different numbers of nodes) then you will have nans in this array. We remove them at line 39 then convert to int and pass them (along with the points array and cell types list) to the pyvista UnstructuredGrid function. Pyvista lets us work easily with numpy arrays and not have to convert to VTK data object in between. We now have an unstructured grid object!

Now we need to add the element results.

This gist picks up where the last one left off. We have a uGrid unstructured grid object. If the call to this function includes a results file we then enter this logic block to add the results to the grid.

Lines 2–12 of this gist imports the data from the base64 object and reindexes to once again map the results to the appropriate location in the list so the location and associated element id are the same. Here we are filling missing values with 0.0. Then we convert to a numpy array. Line 15 is where we can see the ease of use of pyvista just give the uGrid object a name (here I’m using ‘my_array’ ) and pass the numpy array! Easy-Peezy. We return the uGrid object and the min/max range of data (or a default) for the colorscale.

Now we have a function that can return a pyvista UnstructuredGrid object (with or without results) we can then pass to dash_vtk! Time to layout the app.

Laying Out the App

I really like to use dash_bootstrap_components to layout my apps. It makes them look nice with minimal work. A big thank you to those developers!

This app is arranged in 2 main columns. The left has upload & UI components and the right is the view object for dash_vtk.

Lines 8 19 & 31 have the upload components for nodes elements and element results. Line 44 has the dropdown that controls the contour when plotting results. That function was lifted with love from one of the dash_vtk examples. On line 52 we have the RangeSlider that allows the user to show only elements that fall within the….. range. The range is defined from 0.-1.0 and is relative to the maximum value in the results set. On line 68 we have a checklist that turns on and off element edges in the plot. I really like the switch mode from dash_bootstrap_components! I rarely seem to need more than 2 choices for any given option anyway and its nice and compact.

Here (line 81) I have nested the dash_vtk.View object in a couple of Divs. It appears to be a bit finnicky (or not obvious to me) when working directly inside dash_bootstrap_component divs. Again I leveraged the dash_vtk examples for div settings.

Setting Up The Callbacks

The callback is a bit…uncreative. There is certainly room for improvement and efficiency. Its basically driven by 1 large multioutput callback that leverages some advanced callback techniques to determine which callback fired and then checking the state of the uploads and selectively updating. I also use a dcc.Store object to store the condition if both nodes and elements have been uploaded. This basic logic allows the user to upload a new mesh file (nodes or elements) that in the condition there is already a mesh it clears the other file out. That way you don’t mix and match element and node files which would throw an error. Its not great but it works.

Scenario 5 (mesh but no results) & 6 (mesh and results) are the interesting ones that use the function we setup earlier. In Scenario 5 we call the ns_export_to_uGrid function and then use the dash_vtk helper function dash_vtk.to_mesh_state to convert the uGrid pyvista/VTK object to something dash_vtk can use. We send this mesh_state object into a dash_vtk.Mesh object which in-turn is in a dash_vtk.GeometryReprsentation object that we send back to the dash_vtk.View object we have in the layout. I have also set some opacity and edgeVisibility properties specific to the mesh-only view.

In Scenario 6 we do much of the same thing as Scenario 5 and get a basic mesh_state1 object for just the mesh (no results). In addition to that we perform some thresholding to create a new grid thresh based on the RangeSlider values. Pyvista doesn’t like performing the relative threshold function with 0. or 1. in the range so we have some logic to choose how to handle 0. or 1. in the RangeSlider value passed to the callback (lines 59–69). Pyvista is really helping here by allowing us to threshold directly on the grid object. It took me a while to wrap my head around this after having some experience with vanilla VTK-python. When we send the new thresh object (which is also an UnstructuredGrid object) to the dash_vtk.to_mesh_state function we use the optional kwarg field_to_keep and give it the name of the results array we assigned back when we added the results to the uGrid object (with the boring name of my_array ).

Now we have 2 mesh_state objects 1 without results and 1 with. In lines 80 I create a dash_vtk.GeometryRepresentation object basically the same as in Scenario 5 but with the properties adjusted. Here we have edgeVisbility to False and the opacity way down to 0.15. This creates a ghost-like part so when you view really small subsets of the mesh you can still tell where the elements are (a few floating elements in space isn’t that helpful). For the thresholded mesh_state object we assign some settings for the colorMapPreset and edgeVisibility based on the user inputs (they get passed to the callback. We are sending back 2 dash_vtk.GeometryRepresentation objects for the same mesh to 1 dash_vtk.View object and it just works!

3D is cool but…..Why?

Good question! Other than spinning models in a new way you might be wondering why would you want to view 3D unstructured mesh objects in a custom web-app. If you are already using another tool for solving it probably has some pre/post processing tools baked in right?

This is true but there are a few reasons why you might want to do this (at least that I can think of):

You have compiled the Nastran-95 source code and have a sweet well-established structural solver but no way to view the mesh or results. You have some custom criteria that you post process outside of the original solver and want to display (eg failure criteria for special materials) You perform superposition to combine unit loads results from the original solver but do it outside of the original software and want to show worst case (element by element) results over multiple load cases in 1 view.

dash_vtk is actively being worked. I built the original app using version 0.0.7 but noticed 0.0.9 is already out. Check it out maybe more features are there already!

Well I hope you found this helpful and appreciate yo taking the time to read!

Thank You!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9jb25uZWN0ZWRjYXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvYm13LWdyb3VwLWFuZC1udmlkaWEtZmFjdG9yeS1wbGFuLWluLW9tbml2ZXJzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BMW Group and NVIDIA Factory Plan in Omniverse | auto connected car news,"The BMW Group and NVIDIA are generating a completely new approach to planning highly complex manufacturing systems – with the Omniverse platform. The virtual factory planning tool integrates a range of planning data and applications and allows real-time collaboration with unrestricted compatibility. As industry leaders the BMW Group and NVIDIA are setting new standards in virtual factory planning.

Milan Nedeljković BMW AG Board Member for Production: “Together we’re about to make a huge leap forward and open up completely new perspectives in the field of virtual digital planning. In the future a virtual representation of our production network will allow us to realise an innovative integrated approach to our planning processes. Omniverse greatly enhances the precision speed and consequently the efficiency of our planning processes.”

“BMW does personalized manufacturing at a massive scale – their operations are among the most complex in the world” said Jensen Huang founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “In their vision of future factories people and robots work together engineers from all aspects of factory design collaborate in a shared virtual space and the entire factory is simulated with photorealistic detail. NVIDIA Omniverse was built to realize this future. I am delighted that BMW is using NVIDIA Omniverse to connect their teams to design plan and operate their future factories virtually before anything is built in the physical world. This is the future of manufacturing.”

Virtual factory planning is already widespread but until now it has required data to be imported from various applications. This is not only time-consuming but also raises compatibility issues. In addition the data is not always up to date. In the future the Omniverse platform will enable live data to be collected and collated from all the relevant databases to create a joint simulation – eliminating the need to reimport data. The goal is to enable modifications and adjustments to be assessed in the early stages of planning in order to create an overall view. This extreme transparency will allow planners and production specialists to plan highly complex production systems even more quickly and accurately without interface losses or compatibility problems. Omniverse integrates data from various professional design and planning tools from a range of different producers and uses it to generate photo-realistic real-time simulations in a single collaborative setting.

Outstanding photorealistic quality is just one of the many benefits of Omniverse. Another is that employees at different sites in different time zones can access the virtual simulation and work together to plan and optimise details of a process or production system whenever they need to. In addition Omniverse can be used in a multitude of applications: in the future planners and production specialists will collaborate using real-time data that is synchronised in the Omniverse cloud infrastructure. They will also be able to discuss the integration of new production systems with suppliers. Omniverse allows structure and facility data to be integrated as well as items and part numbers of materials in production. It can also be used for logistics planning offering unprecedented data consistency from planning through to production. “This is redefining collaboration” emphasises Board Member for Production Milan Nedeljković. The ability to carry out changes live will speed up decision-making noticeably.

P&I insurance covers risks that are not typically placed in the traditional insurance market. Typical P&I cover can include a carrier's third-party risks for damage caused to cargo during carriage war risks and risks of environmental damage such as oil spills and pollution.

Much has been said of applying a general increase as means of blanket raising premiums across all members regardless of individual account performance. With all the actuarial and modelling skills available P&I clubs should now be in a position to apply increases that relate to adverse loss records.

Clubs should adopt an analytical approach when seeking increases rather than a unilateral approach. When working with organizations a more detailed analysis of each member’s risk profile hand-in-hand with the context of club performance and the marketplace is encouraged.

In a study that will take place over the next six months researchers will attempt to detect early signs of respiratory illness with Apple Watches.

Participants in the study will wear Apple Watches throughout the study and complete weekly surveys on their iPhones. They will be tested for the coronavirus at the study's outset and at any point during the trial that they experience respiratory illness.

The Apple Watch will collect information about participants' health and activity and survey questions will collect additional data on participants' respiratory symptoms and lifestyle.

Those who become ill during the study will be tested for the coronavirus and other respiratory illnesses and will take additional health measurements using the Apple Watch.

July study completed by researchers from a number of groups including Stanford University School of Medicine hypothesized that changes in heart rate respiratory rate and other biometrics measured constantly by the devices may flag the early stages of virus infection so an otherwise healthy-looking person knows to self-isolate and seek a COVID-19 diagnostic test.

Smartwatch information from 31 people who tested positive for COVID-19 showed that 80% had data on their wearable devices that indicated infection at the time or before symptoms appeared. Wearable devices picked up the signals of infection early in an average of three days.

In one case the team found that a smartwatch was able to spot the first signal of potential COVID-19 infection nine days before more obvious symptoms were reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vYmdyLmNvbS90ZWNoL2lwaG9uZS0xMy1ydW1vcnMtZGVzaWduLWxlYWstc21hbGxlci1ub3RjaC1kaWFnb25hbC1jYW1lcmFzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,iPhone 13 leak reveals a surprising change coming to the camera,"The iPhone 13 series that’s widely expected to launch in mid-September and is also expected to feature the same basic design as the iPhone 12 line. Apple will launch four direct successors to the iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. The iPhone 12 design staying in place for one more year isn’t a surprise however. It’s one reason why the “iPhone 12s” moniker might make more sense for the 2021 iPhone refresh. Some claim that Apple will supposedly skip “13” and choose to call it the iPhone 12s instead.

Regardless of the naming scheme the new iPhones are expected to feature at least one design notable design change: A smaller notch. But a brand new leak tells us the iPhone 13 phones might deliver another fundamental design change.

MySmartPrice obtained the renders below that show the front and back designs of the base iPhone 13 model:

According to the report the device is almost the same size as the iPhone 12 and features the same iPhone 4-like design. But the iPhone 13 is 0.2mm thicker than its predecessor. Also the Face ID bezel isn’t as wide as the traditional notch that has graced iPhone models since the launch of the iPhone X. That’s because the top speaker is no longer present in the notch. Instead it sits on top of it integrated into the thin top bezel. A recent iPhone 13 leak offered the same design detail.

The rear panel is where the second design change can be seen. The main camera module has two separate lenses but they feature a surprising arrangement. They’re placed diagonally rather than vertically. It’s unclear why Apple would change the rear camera structure — not that it matters how the cameras are placed inside the protruding camera modules. We’ve seen plenty of smartphone vendors explore all sorts of rear camera designs and none of them are especially easy on the eyes. Camera performance trumps design however and the bump is something we all have come to accept in exchange for better camera performance.

It’s unlikely that Apple would change the design of the iPhone 13 camera just for the sake of making it look different. Instead something more complex might be at play assuming the leaked renders are legitimate.

One possible explanation comes from MacRumors which speculates that the sensor-shift optical image stabilization (OIS) could be the culprit behind the diagonal camera design. Recent rumors say that the sensor-shift OIS exclusive to the iPhone 12 Pro Max is coming to all iPhone 13 models.

Traditionally the iPhone 12 and its predecessors all the way back to iPhone X have featured two rear cameras placed vertically including a primary (wide) lens and a wide-angle lens. On the iPhone 12 the ultra-wide lens is actually on top of the wide-angle camera (as seen in the renders above).

The iPhone 12 Pro models feature an extra telephoto lens which is found at the top of the module (Pro Max as seen below) and bottom (Pro as seen above). The ultra-wide camera sits on the right side of both phones. The larger sensor-shift OIS might be responsible for the design asymmetry between the two iPhone 12 Pro phones. During its iPhone 12 Pro Max teardown iFixit took an X-ray of the rear camera module which reveals the sensor-shift camera’s size as seen below:

The primary camera sits under the telephoto lens on the iPhone 12 Pro Max but on top of the telephoto lens on the standard iPhone 12. The image below from YouTube channel JerryRigEverything shows a teardown of the two rear camera modules side by side:

Interestingly the sensor-shift lens is placed diagonally to the ultra-wide camera. The same could happen on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini if the leaked renders above are accurate.

This is all speculation however based on MacRumors’s assumption. Space is at a premium inside the iPhone so Apple would need a very good reason to shift the sensors around. The following clip shows Apple’s sensor-shift OIS tech in iPhone 12 Pro Max as demoed during the iPhone 12 launch event last fall:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9hcHBsZXMtbmV3LWltYWMtY291bGQtYmUtdW5sZWFzaGVkLW9uLWFwcmlsLTIwLXdpdGgtcnVtb3JzLW5vdy1jb21pbmctdGhpY2stYW5kLWZhc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple's new iMac could be unleashed on April 20 with rumors now coming thick and fast,"Apple could be planning to unleash a new iMac on the world at its ‘Spring Loaded’ event which takes place in just a couple of days on April 20.

Two sources on Twitter have just pushed this rumor one of those being well-known Apple leaker l0vetodream who tweeted an image of the graphic on the event invite alongside an old shot of G3 iMacs (as spotted by MacRumors). There’s no text but this is clearly a suggestion that a new iMac is about to debut as past speculation has contended that the revamped M1-powered all-in-one will be available in a choice of striking colors (as was the case with the G3 way back in 1998).

Furthermore Ian Zelbo (@RendersbyIan) who recently provided us with leaked renders of the Google Pixel Watch in conjunction with Jon Prosser posted a render of the purported incoming iMac on Twitter noting that based on leaks by Prosser (again) Apple is unleashing a new iMac at the big event on Tuesday.

Apple is expected to release a redesigned iMac on Tuesday’s Spring Loaded event. Hello again is a reference to the original iMac release.Based on leaks by @Jon_prosserApril 17 2021

Jon Prosser of course was the source of previous leakage including that the redesigned iMacs will be available in that wide range of colors.

All signs point to yes?

All this – plus some other recent nuggets from the rumor mill like the discovery of references to unreleased iMac models already being present in macOS Big Sur – is starting to make it seem like there’s a much stronger possibility of an iMac launch coming on April 20 than we previously imagined. Not to mention very recent reports of dwindling stock of existing iMac models in terms of the 21.5-inch version (which could obviously be seen as a clear-out before a new launch).

Apple’s event is expected to have a focus on the iPad Pro 2021 and much-rumored Apple Airtags but that’s not to say that there won’t be something else happening at ‘Spring Loaded’ on the iMac front (arguably the ‘loaded’ part of the title suggests a ton of stuff being announced theoretically including that revamped iMac).

Also worth bearing in mind is that leaker l0vetodream has previously floated speculation about the larger iMac coming with an even bigger screen – providing more real-estate than the current 27-inch panel – in its new form. As ever time will tell and in this case we really don’t have long to wait thankfully…

From U.S. smartphone giant Apple Inc. to China’s telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co. global tech companies are betting big on the transition of the automobile market to battery-powered vehicles that are increasingly autonomous.

The global electric vehicle (EV) market has been busy in recent months as new players rush in. Investors’ confidence in the fledgling market has been growing since last year partly fueled by the strong performance of industry leader Tesla Inc.

In 2020 Tesla’s global sales topped 500000 units driving a surge in the company’s market value by 743% to more than $800 billion exceeding the combined totals of established auto giants Volkswagen Toyota and Daimler.

In China the world’s largest EV market a new round of investment is also gathering pace led by major tech companies. The latest newcomer is smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. which pledged to invest $10 billion over the next decade to build smart EVs. Xiaomi’s entry fueled expectations that the car-building business can be the next growth opportunity for device makers.

Among all the hardware manufacturers vying to seize a share of the auto market Apple Inc. was one of the first. In 2014 the tech giant launched Project Titan to develop self-driving cars. In 2015 Apple COO Jeff Williams said “The car is the ultimate mobile device.”

Cover Story: Tech Giants Bet on the Smart-Car Revolution

At that time the business model for smart EVs was unclear while the cost of market entry for auto manufacturing remained high. Back then Tesla was still losing $10000 for every car sold.

Apple’s car business at that time focused on the research and development of the self-driving system. In a March 2017 interview with Caixin Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was researching autonomy a concept that extends beyond cars and can be applied to many mobile devices with the development of artificial intelligence technology. One month later Apple was licensed by the California Department of Motor Vehicles for autonomous vehicle testing and began open-road testing of its self-driving software.

After nearly six years of preparation the launch of a smart EV by Apple seems to get closer. Media reports have said the company has scheduled the launch of the vehicle for 2024 or 2025.

A former Apple employee recently told Caixin that the company is ready to make its own branded cars through partnership with contract auto manufacturers.

Apple has built up a completed system that includes self-developed chips battery technology operating system and an ecosystem built on its iSO operating platform as well as its own map services said the employee.

Compared with Apple Xiaomi is likely to face technology constraints in its auto business due to the lack of its own map services that are a key element in the development of autonomous-driving technology the employee said.

In January Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor Group and its subsidiary Kia said they were in talks with Apple on manufacturing Apple-branded vehicles. But Hyundai later took down that statement saying that all talks were in an early stage and no final decisions had been reached.

In a February research report Guo Mingqi an analyst at TF International Securities who has been tracking Apple’s business said Apple is unlikely to work with its major contactor Foxconn to build cars because of the iPhone supplier’s lack of car-building experience. Instead Apple would seek cooperation with traditional carmakers like Hyundai General Motors and Groupe PSA said Guo.

Chinese EV upstart Nio has seen Apple as its biggest competitor. Nio founder William Li said Apple has the ability funds and technology necessary to make intelligent vehicles. An executive from another auto company who asked not to be named said it usually takes about two years to design and finish production of a new vehicle and so Apple may not need to wait until 2025 to launch its new car.

But Apple still faces some notable challenges in auto manufacturing said the executive. As a developer of consumer-grade devices Apple lacks experience in vehicle-mounted components that will need to adapt to various environments and extreme weathers he said.

One of the most crucial technologies that will test Apple’s tech capacity is lidar the automotive radar technology which is key to achieving a higher level of autonomous driving technology. The highest Level 5 means the car can drive by itself without human intervention.

Automotive lidar uses spinning lasers to scan obstacles around a vehicle as it moves. It bounces laser pulses off surrounding objects and measures the return time of reflected light to calculate distances and shapes.

Apple last year launched the lidar-equipped iPhone 12 Pro. However its lidar sensor is still inadequate for automobile use.

The global smart EV boom will push up demand for automotive-grade lidar this year experts said. Radar makers including American firm Luminar Suzhou-based Innovusion Inc. and Huawei have set out plans to boost lidar production for auto use. Huawei said its new plant in Dongguan Guangdong province has the capacity to produce 100000 auto-grade lidar devices every year. The tech giant said the new capacity will help reduce the lidar price to around $200 from more than $10000 now.

Huawei’s ambition

Huawei has shown similar ambitions in the auto business as Apple although the company has repeatedly rejected speculation that it would build its own cars.

Huawei has footholds in various key technologies to power self-driving cars including radar sensors chips operating systems and map services. The Shenzhen-based telecommunications-gear maker recently said that it will invest $1 billion this year in self-driving and electric-car technologies.

Huawei said it will focus this year on software research and technologies related to EVs in an effort to move into new growth areas under the assumption that the U.S. won’t lift sanctions that have cut off Huawei from access to much of the global microchip supply.

Huawei set up a designated auto business unit in 2019 with a team of 4000 people and an annual budget of $500 million. Founder Ren Zhenfei said last year there is no profit requirement on the business for its first six years.

“For Huawei everything is like a mobile device and an automobile is just like a smartphone with wheels” said Wang Chenglu president of Huawei’s Consumer Business Group. The future car will not be a standalone device but will be built around mobile phones with mobile phone software applications projected onto vehicle screens said Wang.

Although Huawei executives have made commitments that the company will remain an auto technology supplier speculation on Huawei’s foray into car building has only grown stronger.

Huawei has so far set up partnerships with BAIC Group Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. Ltd. and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. Ltd. to build cars equipped with its autonomous driving technology according to Rotating Chairman Eric Xu.

Huawei’s autonomous-driving technology has already surpassed Tesla’s in some spheres for instance by allowing cars to cruise for more than 1000 kilometers (621 miles) without human intervention Xu said.

One of its bets ViacomCBS after skyrocketing collapsed by 60%.

Vast unreported and at the time unknown amounts of leverage blew up Archegos Capital Management dishing out enormous losses to its investors the banks that brokered the swaps and holders of the targeted stocks. The amount of leverage became known only after it blew up as banks started picking through the debris. ViacomCBS [VIAC] was one of the handful of stocks on which Archegos placed huge and highly leveraged bets thereby pushing the shares into the stratosphere until March 22 after which they collapsed by 60%.

Archegos is an example of how leverage operates: It creates enormous buying pressure and drives up prices as leverage builds and then when prices decline the leveraged bets blow up as forced selling sets in. Most of the leverage in the markets is unreported until it blows up. The only type of stock-market leverage that is reported is margin debt – the amount that individuals and institutions borrow against their stock holdings as tracked by FINRA at its member brokerage firms. Margin debt is an indicator for overall leverage and it has reached the zoo-has-gone-nuts level.

FINRA reported on Friday that margin debt jumped by another $9 billion to $823 billion in March having soared by $163 billion in five months and having exploded by 72% from March 2020 and by 51% from February 2020 to historic WTF highs:

Archegos is an example of how leverage is the great accelerator of stock prices on the way up and on the way down. Its massive bets on a handful of stocks powered by huge leverage drove up prices of those stocks because it created buying pressure with borrowed money. As prices rose Archegos could borrow more to increase its bets. And then suddenly when these stocks started selling off because other investors got out Archegos got the margin calls and leverage became the great accelerator on the way down.

While we don’t know how much total stock market leverage there is we can look at margin debt as a measure of the trend. And the trend has reached whopper proportions. History shows that a big surge in margin balances preceded – and perhaps was a precondition for – the biggest stock market declines:

In a chart like this that covers over two decades the long-term increases in the absolute dollar amounts are not critical since the purchasing power of the dollar with regards to stocks has dropped. What is critical are the steep increases in margin debt before the selloffs.

As the world has seen unfold with Archegos the amounts of other types of stock market leverage aren’t known. Even Wall Street banks that deal with their clients don’t know about their clients’ total leverage at other banks. Each bank knew how much leverage Archegos had with it but not how much it had with other banks or that it had any leverage with other banks.

And when banks issued their margin calls – said to have been the second largest margin call in US history after Lehman – and liquidated the underlying shares they were selling those shares against each other. The first-out-the-door including Goldman Sachs came away relatively unscathed. Late movers such as Credit Suisse got mauled.

That’s also a feature of leverage: The first-out-the-door pocket the gains and get away unscathed. Late movers get crushed.

And since everyone knows this everyone is trying to get out the door first which is not possible but it speeds up the selloff.

Among the types of stock market leverage in addition to margin debt are derivative products such as the swaps that sank Archegos portfolio-based lending and Securities-Based Loans. Each broker knows what they have on their books presumably but they don’t know what other brokers have on their books and no one knows the total and no one knows just how leveraged the markets are.

Even as profits have soared tax payments have declined. Fifty-five of the nation’s largest corporations — including FedEx Nike and the agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland — paid nothing in federal income taxes in 2020 despite collectively reporting more than $40 billion in profits according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.

The federal government lets companies avoid taxes by shifting profits earned in the United States to countries with lower tax rates. Every year American firms especially in the technology and pharmaceutical sectors brazenly pretend to earn billions of dollars in microstates like Barbados Bermuda and the Cayman Islands which are more than happy to play along. Companies and countries both profit at the expense of the United States.

American policymakers have rewarded this naked legerdemain with rounds of tax cuts most recently in 2017 partly justified as necessary to induce companies not to cheat. The tax cuts have also been sold as magic fertilizer that will cause the economy to grow faster.

This laissez-faire policy has crammed money into the pockets of wealthy shareholders while depriving the government of needed revenue. But it has failed to deliver its advertised benefits. Allowing corporations to keep a larger share of their profits has not catalyzed corporate investment nor has it showered Americans with trickle-down prosperity.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

La pandémie de coronavirus a mis à terre l'économie de cet archipel très dépendant du tourisme qui représente 25% de son PIB le Cap-Vert ayant enregistré en 2020 une récession historique de 148%.

Aucun des deux partis historiques n'est donné favori dans l'archipel de 550.000 habitants à environ 600 km au large du Sénégal qui connaît une flambée de cas de coronavirus.

Une nouvelle alternance est donc envisageable entre le Mouvement pour la démocratie (MpD centre droit) du Premier ministre Ulisses Correia e Silva et le Parti africain pour l'indépendance du Cap-Vert (PAICV socialiste) de Janira Hopffer Almada qui ambitionne de devenir la première femme à diriger le gouvernement de cette ancienne colonie portugaise.

Les premiers résultats provisoires sont attendus en fin de soirée.

Un changement de majorité serait tout sauf inédit depuis l'instauration du multipartisme qui avait mis fin au régime du PAICV comme parti unique en 1990 et les premières élections libres de 1991. En 2016 le MpD avait défait le PAICV au pouvoir depuis 15 ans en s'assurant une majorité absolue de 40 sièges sur les 72 de l'Asssemblée nationale.

Dans la cour d'une école du centre de Praia la capitale des files d'attente s'étaient formées dimanche matin devant les salles de classe servant de bureaux de vote.

A deux visages

Le vote prévu de 07H00 (locales 08H00 GMT) à 18H00 (locales 19H00 GMT) a démarré avec retard dans certains bureaux. Les 392.993 électeurs doivent voter dans un contexte sanitaire tendu après une flambée de cas de coronavirus.

Avec 189 cas de Covid-19 pour 100.000 habitants le Cap-Vert enregistre le plus fort taux d'incidence d'Afrique selon une étude du Centre de contrôle et de prévention des maladies du continent (Africa CDC) portant sur la période du 5 au 11 avril.

Mais la pandémie semblait y avoir des effets sanitaires relativement contenus avec 20.254 cas de contamination et 190 décès).

""La priorité est pour moi de voir le gouvernement réélu pour combattre le Covid développer l'économie et le tourisme"" a dit à l'AFP Luis Leit 44 ans après avoir voté à Praia.

Un autre électeur se présentant comme un juriste sous le nom de Carla a dénoncé ""la corruption"" dans ce pays réputé pourtant pour sa bonne gouvernance. Favorable à la liste conduite par Mme Almada il appelle à ""investir dans les secteurs clefs les plus touchés par la pandémie"".

Pour relancer l'économie les candidats ont promis la vaccination à une large partie de la population et des mesures pour diversifier les revenus du pays.

Jusque dans les rues de Praia la capitale où sont disséminées un peu partout les affiches des candidats deux profils différents s'affrontent.

D'un côté l'expérience. Ulisses Correia e Praia 58 ans ancien haut cadre de la banque du Cap-Vert ex-ministre et ex-maire de Praia. Le chef du gouvernement soigne son image moderne proche du peuple vêtu de jeans et utilisant comme musique promotionnelle du rap et autres musiques rythmées.

Faiseur de roi?

De l'autre Janira Hopffer Almada 42 ans qui a été deux fois ministre de la jeunesse. En 2014 l'avocate de formation est même devenue la première présidente (et la plus jeune) du PAICV ex-parti unique.

Elle pourrait surtout devenir en cas de victoire la première femme et la plus jeune Premier ministre de l'archipel. Energique Mme Almada a fait campagne sous le slogan ""un Cap-Vert pour tous"".

Si le Premier ministre s'est dit ""confiant"" mardi de l'emporter avec une majorité absolue aucun parti ne semble tirer son épingle du jeu. La solution pourrait venir d'un faiseur de roi inattendu: l'Union capverdienne indépendante et démocratique (Ucid démocrate-chrétien).

En 2016 le petit parti n'avait certes réussi à faire élire que trois députés devenant ainsi le seul avec le MpD (40) et le PAICV (29) à siéger au Parlement. En cas de majorité relative il pourrait faire basculer l'issue du vote. Trois autres petites formations sont également en lice.

Depuis les élections libres de 1991 le petit pays d'Afrique de l'Ouest réputé modèle de démocratie sur le continent n'a enregistré aucun incident ni violences liés aux élections et leurs résultats.

Elle poursuit : « Les parents signent une attestation sur l’honneur assurant qu’ils ne disposent pas d’autres moyens de garde pour leurs enfants ».

Chaque jour le centre accueille entre cinq et huit jeunes âgés de 3 à 11 ans. De 7 h 45 à 18 h 30 diverses activités leur sont proposées. Avec le beau temps l’équipe d’encadrants privilégie les activités de plein air : randonnée pêche jeux d’extérieurs jardinage…

Effectifs réduits

« Les effectifs sont réduits : habituellement nous accueillons une trentaine d’enfants » précise Maryline Coppi. « Ce qui est le plus contraignant ce sont les règles de distanciation car les jeunes ont envie de contact. Mais ils sont très à l’écoute et s’adaptent à notre demande. »

Le centre de loisirs est géré par la Communauté de communes Bastides Dordogne - Périgord. Il existe trois autres centres de ce type sur le territoire : à Beaumontois-en-Périgord à Lalinde et au Buisson-de-Cadouin.

« Si je suis élu président de la République c’est dès l’été 2022 que je prendrai la décision de lancer de nouveaux réacteurs je ne tergiverserai pas je prendrai cette décision très clairement » a souligné le président des Hauts-de-France sur la radio France Inter.

« Le nucléaire est une énergie d’avenir. C’est aussi toute une filière où la France a de l’avance où la France est synonyme d’excellence. Et c’est aussi ce qui permet aux Français d’avoir une facture d’électricité qui leur coûte beaucoup moins cher qu’en Allemagne » a ajouté Xavier Bertrand.

Pro-nucléaire revendiqué il s’est en revanche montré très critique envers l’éolien appelant à « changer les textes car on ne peut plus imposer des projets éoliens comme aujourd’hui ». « Je ne vois pas pourquoi on ne met pas le même accent sur le photovoltaïque sur toute l’énergie marine. C’est éolien éolien » a-t-il déploré. « Tous ceux qui font la promotion de l’éolien j’en vois très peu habiter au pied d’une éolienne » a-t-il souligné.

« La population y est favorable aussi »

Élu dans la région qui compte la plus grande centrale nucléaire d’Europe à Gravelines l’ancien ministre de Nicolas Sarkozy assure que les élus locaux sont favorables à un nouveau réacteur dans le Nord « et ça veut dire que la population y est favorable aussi ».

Le nucléaire promet d’être l’un des enjeux de la campagne présidentielle dans un pays qui produit quelque 70% de son électricité grâce à ses centrales dont la durée de vie a été rallongée jusqu’à 50 ans.

L’objectif est de ramener ce chiffre à 50% en 2035 afin notamment de permettre l’essor des renouvelables. Mais alors que le parc commence à vieillir la France n’a pas encore décidé de son avenir. Elle envisage de construire six réacteurs de nouvelle génération EPR et EDF doit présenter un dossier complet au gouvernement à la mi-2021. Mais la décision ne sera prise que lors du prochain quinquennat. L’exécutif veut en effet attendre le démarrage de l’EPR de Flamanville attendu fin 2022 après de nombreux retards et péripéties.

Thousands of ticketless fans forced their way – or “jibbed” – into the ground in the process causing criminal damage and injury to stewards other fans and themselves. It was one of the highest-profile scenes of crowd disorder since the bad old days of 80s hooliganism only this time captured in lurid detail on camera phones and by 24-hour rolling news.

That footage – fans stuffing flares up their backsides hordes descending on the Wembley turnstiles like a deleted scene from the Battle of Helm’s Deep – has proved to be catnip for Netflix which uses it as the basis for this feature-length documentary. Including testimony from some of those who successfully forced their way into Wembley the security staff who tried to prevent them and innocent fans caught in the middle Attack on Wembley offers a compelling tick-tock of events from the crowds forming across London as early as 8am right through to the final’s grubby aftermath.

What does go somewhat under-explored here is the cocktail of causes behind the carnage. The after-effects of lockdown – and the pent-up energy uncorked when it ended – is only glancingly touched on as is the role of alcohol and cocaine in the disorder. The stewards who bravely put themselves in the line of fire are rightly celebrated but nothing is made of the lax security measures – notably the absence of the “ring of steel” technique usually seen at major sporting events – that allowed ticketless fans to congregate outside the stadium in such vast numbers.

Still Attack on Wembley does convincingly convey the ugly feral atmosphere around the stadium that day. Particularly chilling is the testimony of a British-Asian England fan who says that he dreaded Saka missing his penalty not just because of the result but because of the hate it would unleash. Almost immediately at full time he is proved right with racial abuse aimed both at him on Wembley Way and at Black England players Saka Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho online. A shameful episode in a day full of them.

But only a sliver of students are participating or view it as a top issue according to a new Generation Lab survey shared exclusively with Axios. Why it matters: The poll hints that the war — and the accompanying protests — might not hurt President Biden's election prospects among young voters as much as previously thought.

By the numbers: Only a small minority (8%) of college students have participated in either side of the protests the survey of 1250 college students found.

Students ranked the conflict in the Middle East as the least important issue facing them out of nine options.

It landed behind health care reform racial justice and civil rights economic fairness and opportunity education funding and access and climate change.

What they found: The survey found that three times as many college students blame Hamas for the current situation in Gaza than they do President Biden.

Some 34% blame Hamas while 19% blame Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 12% blame the Israeli people and 12% blame Biden.

Zoom in: A large majority (81%) of students support holding protesters accountable agreeing with the notion that those who destroyed property or vandalized or illegally occupied buildings should be held responsible by their university per the survey.

A majority also said they oppose the protest tactics: 67% say occupying campus buildings is unacceptable and 58% say it's not acceptable to refuse a university's order to disperse.

Another 90% said blocking pro-Israel students from parts of campus is unacceptable.

The other side: Students were still more likely to say they support the pro-Palestininan encampments than oppose them.

45% said they support them either strongly or a little bit. 30% were neutral and 24% were strongly or a bit opposed.

Zoom out: More than 2000 people have been arrested on campuses across the U.S.

Worth noting: A majority of people (58%) who participated in or favored protests against Israel said they would not consider being friends with someone who has marched for Israel.

Meanwhile 64% of those who participated in a pro-Israel protest said they would still be friends with someone who has marched against Israel.

Methodology: This study was conducted May 3-6 from a representative sample of n=1250 students nationwide from 2-year and 4-year schools. The margin of error is +/- 2.7 percentage points. The Generation Lab conducts polling using a demographically representative sample frame of college students at community colleges technical colleges trade schools and public and private four-year institutions.

BOSTON (CN) — The First Circuit struggled at oral arguments Tuesday with a claim that it is unconstitutional for the Boston City Council to bar a group of Satanists from offering an invocation at its meetings.

“Suppose this was 1920s Boston and Jewish temples weren’t invited to speak” U.S. Circuit Judge William Kayatta said.

“I think you’d have a problem” the city’s lawyer Edward Whitesell conceded.

“So why not here?” Kayatta asked.

“Because the record shows that a lot of other religions were invited” to give invocations Whitesell answered.

Kayatta pressed on. “But there might have been a lot of other religions back then” he said. “Methodists. Lutherans. Isn’t this the exact same thing except we’re substituting Jews for Satanists?”

The lawsuit was brought by the Satanic Temple which was founded in 2013 and boasts that it’s the only Satanic organization that’s officially recognized as a religion by the IRS. It doesn’t believe in a literal Satan and operates in a gray area between a community of faith and a spoof of traditional religions drawing many members from the LGBTQ community. Last year it attracted some 800 attendees to SatanCon a gathering at the Boston Marriott.

The Boston City Council meets about three dozen times a year and typically begins meetings with a prayer poem or other introduction usually from a local religious leader. City councilors have absolute discretion as to whom to invite. From 2016 to 2018 the Satanic Temple repeatedly requested to speak and was rejected.

The invocations date from the 1800s and for years the city offered speakers a small stipend (a practice the temple calls “pray-for-pay”). But in 2017 the city abolished the payments at the suggestion of then-councilor Michelle Wu now Boston's mayor.

The temple claims the invitations favor some religions over others and thus violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment. It lost in the trial court.

One city councilor stated that it would be “absurd” to invite the temple to speak because it’s headquartered not in Boston but in nearby Salem (home of the witch trials). Another called the temple’s request a “publicity stunt” and added “I would not consider anyone that doesn’t have a positive impact on my community my constituents my family and me personally.”

In 2014 the U.S. Supreme Court held 5-4 that it's OK to start an official town meeting with a prayer. But in that case the town had compiled a list of local organizations and invited anyone who wanted to participate on a first-come-first-served basis including the chairman of a Baha’i temple and a Wiccan priestess.

By contrast Boston’s practice is “whim-based and politically motivated” said the Satanic Temple’s attorney Matthew Kezhaya of Minneapolis. “One councilor testified that this is a political reward. That’s a problem.”

Boston’s policy has “the potential for serious establishment clause concerns” agreed U.S. Circuit Judge Sandra Lynch a Bill Clinton appointee. “The system is designed to further the political careers of the Boston city councilors by permitting them to invite whoever is politically advantageous. Let’s assume … there is a consistent pattern of councilors choosing the majoritarian religion of their district and going on with effusive praise. Could there be an as-applied establishment clause problem?”

Whitesell said the temple would have to prove an intent to discriminate not just an intent to further a political career. “But that’s not the only route to an establishment clause issue” said U.S. Circuit Chief Judge David Barron a Barack Obama appointee. “If the selection criteria are whoever has the largest congregation” he said that would raise “very serious problems.”

Whitesell responded by insisting that the criteria aren’t merely political but also included recognizing civic leaders who had contributed to the welfare of the community. Kayatta also an Obama appointee then pressed Kezhaya on whether contributing to the community could be a valid selection criterion.

Kezhaya conceded that it could but he argued that in practice it’s impossible to separate that from the religious aspect and that the test isn’t applied neutrally because who benefits the community is determined by “whatever the councilor feels like.” He also said that the city had gone further and endorsed particular religions with “two to three minutes of gushing praise” for specific ministers which he called “religious gerrymandering.”

Before the Satanic Temple got involved 94% of invocations were given by Christians and the council president often told everyone in attendance to stand for prayers Kezhaya said.

Lynch asked if the Temple had contributed to Boston’s community welfare and Kezhaya answered that it had participated in the city’s pride parade and distributed free tampons to the needy.

“I’m confused as to the criteria” Kayatta complained. “Is it politics or who did good deeds?”

“They go hand-in-hand” Whitesell answered but Kayatta wasn’t satisfied: “On a Venn diagram they would overlap but not completely” he noted.

Barron closed out the argument by asking Kezhaya what he wanted as a remedy — did he want the judges to strike down Boston’s prayer practice altogether or did he want them merely to require the city to let the temple participate?

“We want in” Kezhaya answered.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vc3Rvcmllcy5zdGFyYnVja3MuY29tL3ByZXNzLzIwMjQvc3VtbWVycy1vbi1hdC1zdGFyYnVja3Mtd2l0aC1uZXctc3VtbWVyLWJlcnJ5LXN0YXJidWNrcy1yZWZyZXNoZXJzLWJldmVyYWdlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Summer's On at Starbucks with New Summer-Berry Starbucks Refreshers Beverages,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2024/summers-on-at-starbucks-with-new-summer-berry-starbucks-refreshers-beverages/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vc3Rvcmllcy5zdGFyYnVja3MuY29tL3ByZXNzLzIwMjQvc3VtbWVycy1vbi1hdC1zdGFyYnVja3Mtd2l0aC1uZXctc3VtbWVyLWJlcnJ5LXN0YXJidWNrcy1yZWZyZXNoZXJzLWJldmVyYWdlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Noting this you might see why digital twins are gaining traction in the architecture engineering and construction (AEC) industry notably driven by a company’s Digital Team.

But what is a digital twin and why should all construction professionals care? Let’s take a more detailed look.

What I s a Digital Twin?

So just what is a digital twin? As you may have already guessed a digital twin is an exact digital replica of something that exists in the physical world.

You might be wondering well isn’t that the function of BIM? Not always.

Often BIM is an important component of a digital twin but the concept of a digital twin is much broader. BIM might nearly replicate the physical asset but there are some key differences. The main difference between a digital twin and BIM is that the former is actually connected to a twin in the physical world. This is what is called a “digital thread.” According to Facility Executive magazine the digital twin is specifically designed to serve as the bridge between the physical and digital worlds through the use of sensors to collect data in real-time about a physical structure. The data that’s collected helps create this digital duplicate of the structure in question which can help a project team better understand optimize and manipulate it. Ultimately it can lead to a better more profitable project.

So what insights can you gain from the creation of a digital twin? Simply put when created project teams and asset owners can learn more about the performance of an asset thus making smarter decisions and improve predictability in how they deliver projects.

A Brief History of Digital Twins

When asked to provide my views on the growing demand for digital twins I took the opportunity to conduct some research on where the concept originated. In other fields they’re not a new concept and they’ve been utilized in the manufacturing industry for many years. It’s widely believed that the very first digital twin was used in conjunction with the Apollo 13 mission back in 1970 although it clearly wasn't referred to as a “digital twin"" at the time. I’m certain that had it not been for the use of digital twin (replicating reality before it happens) that space mission could have had a much different outcome. The ability to use digital twins to test solutions from the ground level behind a computer is one of the most important elements of utilizing digital technology to guarantee a desired outcome.

I also discovered that Dr. Michael Grieves a chief scientist of advanced manufacturing at the Florida Institute of Technology was the person responsible for creating the concept of a digital twin in the capacity it’s known today. In fact he’s believed to have proposed the digital twin as the conceptual model underlying product lifecycle management or PLM. However it wasn’t until 2010 that Dr. Grieves' concept was actually called a digital twin when NASA’s John Vickers referred to it as such in a report.

What Does a Digital Twin Include?

Now that we know a little bit about what it is and its history you might be wondering what is included in a digital twin when it comes to the design and built environment. As we noted earlier a true digital twin records every single step of the construction cycle so there is lots of data packed into each one. This data includes:

BIM and 3D models

2D information

Schedules

Contracts

Construction documents (i.e. submittals change orders RFIs etc.)

Operational data collected by the embedded sensors

Data from AI and machine learning technology

Wh y A re Digital Twins Used?

Creating a digital twin requires careful consideration so it’s important to be clear on what the benefits are

Here’s a look at top-level benefits of digital twins in the AEC industry:

Reduce risk: Digital twins can help identify predict  and analyze risk. In addition to reducing risk on a job site digital twins can also help facility managers identify potential risks for building occupants and visitors

Improve project efficiency and quality: Thanks to data collect ed from AI and machine learning digital twins can help project teams streamline operational efficiency and improve construction quality. Furthermore j obsites can run smoother with real-time information automation.

Aid decision-making: Simulations can help project stakeholders make better overall decisions regarding changes.

Lower costs: Digital twins can reduce construction costs which can help improve a project's profitability. Thanks to better risk mitigation and predictions certain costs can be avoided entirely.

Enhance coordination: Improved coordination potential is another benefit. Digital twins can allow project teams to have a greater overall understanding of how systems interact and where there are potential conflicts. They can also improve sequencing for installation and can help connect the office with the field improving overall day-to-day operations.

Provide security: Digital twins provide security of data and information in addition to physical security with better identification of safety issues.

Challenges of Creating a Digital Twin

Despite the benefits associated with the implementation of digital twins on construction projects like any new technology there are some challenges to creating one. The three challenges that loom the largest are technological monetary cultural and industry structure. Here’s a closer look:

Technological: To create a digital twin that’s going to drive value — and not a be a burden — the right technologies and systems must already be in place. Getting these systems up and running and then maintaining their performance can prove to be an obstacle for some companies if proper steps are not taken to ensure its success.

Monetary: Yes the return on investment (ROI) from implementing a digital twin on your next project has the potential to be great. However there comes an upfront cost with doing so — so you have to spend the money before you can save the money on a project. In an industry with notoriously low margins this can be difficult for some companies to wrap their heads around as they're essentially betting on an unknown upon implementation.

Cultural: What’s your company’s mindset core values and overall culture? Arguably this is the biggest hindrance when it comes to adopting new innovative technology on a jobsite even more so than the money and adopting the technology. If your company isn’t open to change and continuous improvement new initiatives such as digital twins are unlikely to gain any traction. That being said forward-thinking companies likely to stay ahead of the competition are increasingly looking to adopt innovative approaches to improve their operations .

Industry Structure: The Construction Industry is extremely fragmented. A key challenge is that the investment in creating a digital twin during the design and construction phases doesn’t always directly benefit those who are tasked with creating and populating the data. Owners therefor e must be invested in the process and commit to their teams creating a digital twin that yields the right results.

Unlocking the Success of Digital Twins

Digital twins are like anything in the sense that you’ll get out of it what you put into it. Hence if you buy into the digital twin concept and make every effort to ensure its success it’s more likely to benefit the overall project it’s being implemented on.

So how can you unlock the success of a digital twin? Here are the components that help make digital twins a success.

V isualization: BIM

Digital twins enhance BIM. Models on their own often can’t provide the same level of response that digital twins can. On this note make sure that you’re paying close attention to the changes in real-time that your digital twin is showing. When a BIM-centric digital twin is used the model has all the same data as the physical construction site would which improves knowledge on constructability.

When models are used in the handover a digital twin can provide the real-time operational response that models can’t do on their own – this is only true when it’s paired with the Internet of Things (IoT) which brings us to our next component.

Living Data: IoT

Much like how your BIM and digital twin should complement each other the same is true with your digital twin and IoT. IoT helps to create a digital thread that connects the twin to the actual physical structure that you're building. Since sensors are collecting data in real-time a digital twin is constantly updating working conditions and helping project teams better understand how a building is operating. The simulation environment that a digital twin can provide can help an operations team address any issues more effectively and efficiently.

Data Structure: Common Data Environment

Are you managing a digital twin in the right system? If you want to maximize its value you should be. A common data environment or CDE can assist when it comes to optimal asset management for digital twins. These systems provide the right standards and systems to avoid data silos and duplicate information creating a single source of truth.

Connection: Connected and Integrated

A digital twin should be connected and integrated if you want to have all of the appropriate data accurately and correctly inputted in the digital world. Make sure that the correct integrations and systems are there to permit data and information to flow without barriers between various teams and project phases.

Analy sis and Predict ion : Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial intelligence AI and machine learning play a big part in tapping into the full potential of a digital twin as each provides the power to put the data that has been collected to meaningful use. Digital twins open doors to analyze unrelated data sets to find new opportunities or risks. This can also help increase operational efficiency and help identify any threats faster and easier.

Build Your Project’s Twin

Are you looking to get started creating your own digital twin? Having the right technology in place is essential. And while the initial investment in the right technology can be high the payoff can be more than worth it in the long run.

This is how I read the word “tomorrow” for a few weeks.

I was in primary school—nine years old to be exact. I came across this ‘strange’ word whilst reading a story in an English textbook. The story was about Tom Mary and a weaver bird and I was convinced that “tomorrow” was a variation of Tom’s name.

The reason this has stuck in my memory could be because of the eccentricity of my reading—let alone understanding. This single incident seems to typify one element that makes going to school important.

According to the World Bank half the children in low and middle-income countries can’t read and understand a simple text by age 10. They read below the minimum proficiency level. While it’s essential that children attend school this alone isn’t sufficient to achieve the SDG goal of quality education.

The many students who read below the minimum proficiency level evidence weaknesses in education systems. With the pandemic and school shutdowns the situation is worse.

With schools closed and with limited or non-existent infrastructure to connect to distance learning services children’s education and therefore future opportunities are hampered significantly. Therefore it’s critical to connect schools and pupils to the internet.

To do this one needs to know the school’s locations and how connected they are. Unfortunately often these records don’t exist are incomplete or have errors. Furthermore creating detailed maps is an expensive and time-consuming process.

Fortunately advances in Earth observation—both in resolution and frequency—and new computational techniques such as deep learning present an opportunity to do things that weren’t possible before.

By integrating human knowledge in machine learning models the school mapping process can be faster and cheaper. It’s a new step toward using automated mapping tools to solve important social problems.

Development Seed an engineering and product company that applies earth data developed artificial intelligence (AI) models that use Maxar high-resolution satellite images to rapidly and automatically map schools in nine countries.

The project is part of Giga a Global initiative by UNICEF to connect every school to the internet.

The ultimate goal is to map every school in the world and show their connectivity in real-time. Such a map can help reduce the digital divide in education and improve access to information digital goods and opportunities for entire communities.

The nine countries covered by the Development Seed project are only a little piece of the map.

You must be wondering what results did Development Seed achieve by using AI?

The Outcomes

Approximately 18000 previously unmapped schools across five African countries—Kenya Rwanda Sierra Leone Ghana and Niger—were identified in the satellite imagery by a deep learning classification model. Thereafter expert mappers validated the schools before Development Seed added them to the map.

Furthermore Development Seed added and validated nearly 4000 unmapped schools in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (in Asia) and 1100 schools in Honduras (Central America).

In addition to finding previously unmapped schools the percentage of already mapped schools correctly identified by the model ranged from 43% to 79% depending on the country.

Here’s how they did it.

The Approach

Despite their varied structure many schools have identifiable overhead signatures that make them possible to detect in high-resolution imagery. Development Seed used deep learning techniques to search for schools from 60cm high-resolution Maxar imagery.

They developed and trained six country models two regional models and a global model.

Generally the regional models outperformed the country-specific models showing that models trained with more varied data are likely to be more accurate.

The Models

While most of the models used were image classification models one was an object detection model.

So what’s the difference?

Image Classification helps us to classify what is contained in an image. In this case a binary classifier that classified image tiles as ‘school’ or ‘not-school’ was used.

Object Detection specifies the location of multiple objects in the image. Object detection models take an image as input and generate bounding boxes predicted classes and confidence scores for each prediction.

A high-quality training dataset is essential for machine learning models. Therefore preparing a set of images with verified school locations and another with non-school locations was necessary to train the model.

Model Training

Training dataset generation went through the following steps:

Step #1: Sourcing Data on the Location of Mapped Schools From UNICEF

They supplemented this data with additional schools from OpenStreetMap (OSM).

Step #2: Validation of School Locations On the Imagery By Expert Mappers

Development Seeds’ experience from the successful school mapping exercise in Colombia informed the selection of identifiable school features from high-resolution satellite imagery.

The mappers compared the school location dataset with high-resolution satellite imagery. Based on identifiable features they classified each location as either:

‘YES’ overhead imagery contains a school

‘NO’ overhead imagery doesn’t contain a school

‘Unrecognized’ it’s uncertain whether or not overhead imagery contains a school

Some of the school features that they used as criteria are:

Building with sport fields

Group of the same type of buildings

Building with U shape

Buildings with L shape and empty field

A large building with an empty field

Buildings with a big sport field

Buildings around an empty field

Buildings with complex shape

Step #3: Generation of Training Data and Analysis

This step varies depending on whether the model is the tile-based school classifier or direct school detection.

Tile-Based School Classifier Model

Two categories of datasets ‘school’ and ‘not-school’ were generated as the training dataset. Category ‘school’ tiles were downloaded based on the location of schools that were tagged as “YES”.

The “not-school” category was more diverse than the “school” category because it included features such as forest desert critical infrastructures residential buildings and oceans.

Next the spatial resolution of the satellite image was maximised by zooming into the satellite image tiles to achieve a spatial resolution of 0.6m.

Afterwards they evaluated whether the training images are a representative sample of the desired deployment region.

Lastly to assess the model’s performance the two categories of the training dataset—‘school’ and ‘not-school’ tiles—were split in a 70:20:10 ratio as train validation and test datasets respectively.

Direct School Detection Model

The training dataset was created by drawing bounding boxes around school buildings using Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT). They then exported XML files from CVAT and generated training records for model development.

In this project Development Seed only developed a direct school detection country model for Kenya.

So what’s the catch?

The Challenges

In any AI model—as with human beings—bias always exists.

A significant limitation of the approach is that it relies on human input for both training data creation and school validation. As a result there’s a bias towards schools that follow common patterns and are therefore recognisable from space.

Consequently while the model can recognise schools by features such as a cluster of buildings with similar rooftops or swimming pools or basketball courts it may perform poorly at recognising schools with smaller building size in densely populated urban areas or housed in “non-traditional” structures.

This bias would not exist in the alternative—and more costly—approaches like field surveys and community mapping.

The Way Forward—Human-AI Integration

Different parts of the world have different school structures. Therefore to improve the models’ prediction power it’s necessary to bring in people with local knowledge of the area being mapped. Human-AI integration will ensure that the machine learning model can quickly identify unmapped schools.

Using people to map schools may take forever. However as evidenced by this project combining human knowledge in machine learning models can speed up the mapping process.

Note that UNICEF is always looking for more partners to validate—and add—to their existing school mapping datasets. Interested? Contact the School Mapping team.

“My daddy was 70” said LaTonya Craddock the victim’s daughter. “He was sick. He had COPD you wanna know what type of father he was or person he was? That if he would’ve saw somebody getting beat by two men even if his sick stage he would’ve jumped in. That’s what type of person my father was.”

70-year-old Leonard Craddock was a father a grandfather and a great grandfather. He was a navy veteran and an east Cleveland native. He loved sports and playing cards.

“The last time I saw my father it was here and we was playing cards and he was sitting on the porch” recalled Rayshawn Craddock the victim’s youngest son. “He was talking to my wife and he told my wife he said ‘my son did good.’ So we played a card game that day and we had fun. I didn’t think that was gonna be the last time I seen my father man.”

The elderly man was beaten to death at the AutoZone on Euclid Avenue in East Cleveland on April 14th in the middle of the afternoon. His family reached out to 19 News wanting the world to know what made him special.

“And y’all had witnesses but nobody stopped and helped my daddy” LaTonya said. “To the world he’s just another 70-year-old Black man that got killed but to me he was my everything. They took something from me that I can’t never get back. He was my daddy. He was Leonard Craddock to ya’ll but he was my daddy and they took him.”

The family says they don’t know why their father was at the AutoZone in the first place since he doesn’t have a car. They also don’t know if he knew the woman involved. Police say witnesses told them Craddock stole money from the woman but his children say their father would never do that. They believe surveillance video from AutoZone will prove that.

“That’s not of his character and it’s gonna be proven because what’s gonna happen is due to this 21st century that we live in technology so once the cameras get rolling we gonna see what happened” said Rayshawn.

Police arrested the woman involved Tiffany Gardner. Police believe Gardner got on the phone after having an argument with Craddock and called the two men to the AutoZone. Their motive is unclear but police wouldn’t rule out revenge. Those men are still on the loose.

“I thought COPD was gonna kill my father” said LaTonya. “I never thought people would kill them. Do you know how much hate you have to have in you to beat somebody to death? To watch them take they last breath? Do you know how much hate that is?”

“I think the most difficult part I think for more is the fact that I wasn’t there to protect my father at that time” said Maurice Craddock the victim’s son.

East Cleveland police are asking for your help in locating these two men. If you have any information you can call the East Cleveland Police Department at 216-451-1234 or contact the Cuyahoga County Crime Stoppers 216-252-7463. Either way your call can remain anonymous.

Leading stock indexes continued their winning streak with S&P 500 maintaining the uptrend for the fourth week in a row and hitting a new high.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 34000-mark for the first time adding around 150 points in the last session. The sentiment was buoyed by encouraging retail sales data and reports of jobless claims falling.

The first-quarter earnings season got off to a good start with banking giants JPMorgan Chase Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs unveiling their latest financial data mid-week. They were joined by software firm Infosys on Wednesday.

The spotlight stayed on financial services Thursday also when the closely followed reports of Citigroup and Bank of America came out. Delta Air Lines and soft-drink behemoth PepsiCo released earnings on the same day. The first phase of bank earnings concluded on Friday with Morgan Stanley’s blockbuster Q1 report.

It’s going to be mixed bag next week. For instance the companies scheduled to report on April 19 include United Airlines Holdings IBM and Coca-Cola. The important corporate houses preparing to report on April 20 comprise Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson as well as streaming giant Netflix which has been thriving on the COVID-driven boom. The earning reports of superbike company Harley-Davidson and Lockheed Martin are also slated for Tuesday.

The other major companies that can elicit investor interest include Halliburton Verizon Communications Chipotle Mexican Grill and Kinder Morgan – the companies will report earnings on April 21. The next day it is the turn of American Airlines and Southwest Airlines as well as tech firms AT&T and Intel. American Express is probably the only big player to report on April 23.

The market was abuzz with the news of Microsoft’s $20-billion buyout of cloud software company Nuance Communications. In another important deal in the cloud space Datadog completed the acquisition of the SaaS-based security platform Sqreen.

The otherwise quiet M&A market witnessed Dell Technologies becoming two standalone public companies by spinning off its 81% ownership in VMware. The other major deals include Amgen’s $2-billion purchase of Five Prime Therapeutics and the acquisition of Upchain by software firm Autodesk.

It has been a while since Wall Street has been able to present the kind of stellar results that America's banks announced to their investors on April 14th. JPMorgan Chase posted record revenues in the first quarter; those at Goldman Sachs were twice the level in the first quarter of 2020.

Broadway Financial executives and investment bankers completed their merger with Washington D.C.-based CFC Banc Corp. on April 1 creating CityFirstBroadway.



The new institution is the largest Black-led bank in the United States with more than $1 billion in assets. Its assets account for nearly one-fifth of the $5 billion-plus held last year by Black-owned financial institutions in the United States.



The merger comes amid a sharp decline in the number of Black-owned financial institutions. According to data compiled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. fewer than 20 remain in the United States a drop of more than half from 2001.



The falloff reflects the battles many Black financial institutions have lost against big banks which can offer lower-priced services as well as the impact of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions on their customer base.



The road to becoming the biggest wasn’t easy for Broadway which at one point nearly disappeared from the banking landscape after 75 years.



In the past year Broadway rejected buyout offers — including a hostile one — from Steven Sugarman the former chief executive of Santa Ana-based Banc of California. Sugarman eventually sold off his 1.8 million shares in Broadway last summer giving up on his takeover bid.



Broadway Financial Corp. is the holding company that will run the combined bank which will be known as CityFirstBroadway until a final brand can be settled on.



“We haven’t decided yet on the exterior signage or what the mats will look like when you walk into the door. Stay tuned on that” said Brian Argrett who became president chief executive and vice chairman of the merged bank. “CityFirstBroadway is a unifying name” he said.



Argrett who spent several years of his career in L.A. in the early 2000s ran Washington D.C.-based City First. He is taking the mantle of president and CEO from Wayne-Kent Bradshaw who had held the top spot at Broadway for more than a dozen years.



Bradshaw is stepping away from the bank as part of a succession plan. He will stay as chairman until April 1 2023 after which time he will retire.



The new company’s board will be composed of four board members from the Broadway ranks and five from the City First side of the ledger. City First chairwoman Marie Johns was appointed lead independent director.



The company will have dual headquarters in Los Angeles and Washington D.C.

“You should not anticipate that we will go heavily into branching” Argrett said.



Significantly the new bank has increased total equity to roughly $135 million which included a private sale of stock on April 7 to investors who added $32.9 million of equity.



Broadway plans to use the stock sale proceeds to drive more commercial lending and develop affordable housing offer loans to small businesses and jumpstart nonprofit development in financially underserved urban areas in Southern California and in the Washington D.C. area. according to Argrett.



“There is a lot of opportunity to expand” he said.



Major investors in the new institution include Walla Walla Wash.-based Banner Corp. a $15 billion bank holding company with a sizeable presence in L.A.; Banc of America Strategic Investments Corp. the private equity arm of Charlotte N.C.-based Bank of America Corp.; and Beverly Grove-based Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.



Other backers are New York-based Citigroup Inc.; San Francisco-based First Republic Bank; New York-based wealth manager Grace & White Inc.; New York-based banking giant JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Dallas-based Texas Capital Community Development Corp.; and San Francisco-based investment banking and brokerage firm Wells Fargo Central Pacific Holdings Inc. an affiliate of Wells Fargo & Co.

Bush wants ""more respectful"" tone on immigration","Former President George W. Bush (R) told ""CBS Sunday Morning"" that he wants the nation's immigration debate to be ""more respectful about the immigrant."" Why it matters: The Republican party has veered sharply to the right on the issue of immigration. Former President Trump built his campaign on the promise of building a new U.S.-Mexico border wall and issued strict policies for returning families and unaccompanied children.

More unaccompanied children are crossing the border and migrant advocacy groups are fed up as Biden continues some controversial immigration practices used by Trump.

The Biden administration is facing a growing humanitarian crisis at the border that could be just as bad as the ones faced by Barack Obama and Donald Trump if not worse.

On getting involved in the immigration debate: ""I do want to say to Congress: 'Please put aside all the harsh rhetoric about immigration. Please put aside tryin' to score political points on either side.­' I hope I can help set a tone that is more respectful about the immigrant which may lead to reform of the system.""

Norah O'Donnell: ""You gave an Oval Office address on immigration ... It's been 15 years. ... Still nothing's been done. ... Is it one of the biggest disappointments of your presidency?""

George W. Bush: ""Yes. It really is. ... The problem with the immigration debate is that ... one can create a lot of fear. 'They're comin' after you.' ... [A] nation that is willing to accept the refugee or the harmed or the frightened to me is a great nation. And we are a great nation.""

Bush supports a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who pass a background check and pay taxes.

O'Donnell: ""And if that were the proposal by President Biden would you lobby your own party to support that?""

""And if that were the proposal by President Biden would you lobby your own party to support that?"" Bush: ""Well I am right now. ... Whether my own party listens to me or not's another question.""

Bush who's out Tuesday with a new book of his oil paintings ""Out of Many One: Portraits of America's Immigrants"" said he hopes his portraits will create ""a better understanding about the role of immigrants in our society. Mine is just a small voice in what I hope is a chorus of people saying: 'Let's see if we can't solve the problem.'""

Minnesota is no longer the organizational heart that it was after former Norwest CEO Dick Kovacevich moved from Minneapolis to San Francisco in 1999 to become CEO of the merged bank-holding company that took the Wells Fargo name and California headquarters.

Wells Fargo under its third CEO in five years seems to have put behind it billions in fines and years of damage to its reputation that dimmed its star and capped growth and left Minnesota a declining regional hub.

Wells Fargo last week posted a strong $4.75 billion profit in the first quarter. And its stock price which peaked over $50 per share in 2018 when the worst emerged about its fake-accounts scandal has risen from under $20 per share a year ago to over $40 lately.

""I am confident that we are making progress though it is not always in a straight line"" Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf told investors and analysts last week.

Scharf 55 is a New York-based banker a protégé of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon whose single-most important hire may have been Bill Daley vice chairman of public affairs who followed Scharf from New York-based BNY Mellon to Wells. Daley a lawyer who also once worked for Dimon is a former federal official and chief of staff to ex-President Barack Obama. He led Scharf's two-year quest to end Wells Fargo's legal and political problems.

""Nobody is better wired than Bill Daley"" said Jim Campbell Minnesota CEO of Norwest-Wells Fargo until his 2002 retirement. ""He's in New York with Charlie. Let's face it. … Charlie has basically moved the heartbeat of the Wells Fargo enterprise to New York. That's where the major banks are headquartered.""

Wells Fargo which also has a regional hub in Charlotte N.C. is starting to get traction on its recovery.

In Minnesota Wells Fargo since 2018 has been led by Laurie Nordquist who has the titles of CEO in Minnesota and president of the company's Central States region.

Wells Fargo is the second-largest bank in the state with nearly $72 billion in deposits trailing only Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp.

Nordquist has a mandate to increase Wells Fargo's visibility.

""We are going to focus on affordable housing minority small businesses specifically and small business generally and the financial health of our customers and communities"" Nordquist said in an interview.

""We will be part of significant and positive change. Our team member involvement is as important as our dollars.""

Wells Fargo employment in Minnesota has declined from about 20000 to 18000 over the last decade amid its problems but also reflects a streamlining in financial services focused on electronic banking and fewer branch offices.

Yet Wells Fargo also this month announced plans to redevelop its 2020-destroyed office at Lake Street and Nicollet Avenue into a $50 million-plus 200-home housing project including a smaller branch office at a 2.5-acre site that was mostly a parking lot and a drive-through bank.

It's a working-class neighborhood including immigrant and minority entrepreneurs that needs housing. And it may mark better days ahead for Wells Fargo in the Twin Cities.

Nordquist a native of Elbow Lake Minn. and graduate of St. Olaf College noted that Wells Fargo opened a new regional headquarters campus on the east side of downtown in 2016 and made $7 million in ""diverse community capital grants"" to Twin Cities nonprofits in recent years.

Most recently Wells Fargo said it would refund nationally the $420 million it has made for processing SBA payroll-protection loans in 2020.

The first $112 million has been disbursed including $9 million to Twin Cities-area minority-business counselor-lenders such as Meda African Economic Development Solutions Neighborhood Development Center and WomenVenture.

They take fledgling capital-light entrepreneurs and help the most promising grow until they are bankable by traditional lenders.

Twenty years ago Kovacevich sensitive to public perception when he agreed to move the combined Norwest-Wells Fargo headquarters to San Francisco essentially gave Campbell about $280 million to buy renovate and expand the abandoned Honeywell campus into a Wells Fargo regional mortgage campus. Local employment skyrocketed.

Campbell his successor and Kovacevich proved at least for a decade that you could lose your national headquarters to a merger but still grow locally.

A lot of Twin Citians thought Wells Fargo was still based here which is just what Campbell and his colleagues hoped.

""Kovacevich left me with a lot of money and flexibility"" Campbell said. ""I got everything I wanted. The Honeywell campus was a fortuitous thing. My sense is that Wells Fargo still a heck of a franchise will ride through this period. But Minneapolis-St. Paul will never be within Wells Fargo what it was. They probably say the same thing in Charlotte.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

The redeveloped complex at the corner of Front and Summer streets called The Uptown after a movie theater that was once there will be reserved for residents who are 55 and older. In total it will add 50 rental units to 10 that were in the structure before it was redeveloped.

Forty-two of them will be for low-income renters according to the project’s developer The Szanton Company.

The housing shortage that’s affecting all Maine communities is particularly serious in the midcoast making it harder for workers in the region to find places to live. Among other communities trying to build more housing is St. George where voters will decide next week whether to give away town-owned land to build new homes.

The new development in Bath which will have a grand opening on Wednesday joins another project that Bath Housing has been working to develop at 520 Centre St. in recent years.

The first phase of the Bath Housing project will bring 18 rental units for low-income residents and the second phase is expected to include an additional 24 units of single-bedroom rentals for a range of incomes according to Executive Director Debora Keller.

Any additional housing will go a long way to easing the crisis Keller said.

She noted that The Uptown will help preserve the historic Moses and Columbia Block buildings which were constructed in 1893 and redeveloped for the project after Bath Housing acquired the properties in 2019 and sold them in 2022 to The Szanton Company.

The buildings have also hosted shops the movie theater and a YMCA over the years and they will continue to maintain six retail spaces now that they’ve been redeveloped. Keller says the new housing option will make it easier for residents to live within walking distance of a number of downtown amenities.

“I just think this is one of the neatest housing projects I’ve seen in years” Keller said.

Rental prices on the apartments will range from $794 to $1495 per month depending on residents’ income according to The Szanton Company. Most of the units are one-bedroom apartments while six of them are two-bedrooms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbml0eXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jdC8yMDI0L2FwcmlsLXdlYi1vbmx5L2phenptZW4tbG91aXMtYXJtc3Ryb25nLWR1a2UtZWxsaW5ndG9uLWNvdW50LWJhc2llLXR5ZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Duke Ellington Read His Bible in the Bath,"“Does Jazz Put the Sin in Syncopation?” asked a 1921 Ladies Home Journal article. Whimsical wordplay aside the question would become a serious one for mid-century America as parsons and priests blamed jazz for soaring juvenile crime rates drugs and extramarital sex. A 1960 poll found that among Black preachers just 1 in 5 wanted to let jazz or blues into their services. Decades before a religion editor at the Pittsburgh Courier had denounced Louis Armstrong’s “sacrilegious desecration of Spirituals.” Duke Ellington’s music was “considered worldly” counseled the Rev. John D. Bussey explaining why the local 1966 Baptist Ministers Conference had unanimously passed his resolution opposing a performance.

But whatever commandments they were breaking—and there were plenty from slighting the Sabbath to serial adultery—Duke Louis and king of swing Count Basie all seemed to take the Christian faith they’d been raised in seriously. And that faith found its way into their music.

For Louis Armstrong the connection was there from the very beginning when he learned to sing in his mother’s Sanctified church. “The ‘whole ‘Congregation would be “Wailing—‘Singing like ‘mad and ‘sound so ‘beautiful” he wrote with his characteristic expressive idiosyncratic punctuation. “I’d have myself a ‘Ball in ‘Church especially when those ‘Sisters ‘would get ‘So ‘Carried away while ‘Rev’ would be ‘right in the ‘Middle of his ‘Sermon. ‘Man those ‘Church ‘Sisters would ‘begin ‘Shouting ‘So—until their ‘petticoats would ‘fall off. … My heart went into every hymn I sang” he added. “I am still a great believer and I go to church whenever I get the chance.”

With Saturday night performances that stretched into Sundays that wasn’t often. But nearly half a century later Armstrong released an album the church sisters would have loved Louis and the Good Book with gassed-up versions of spirituals including “Go Down Moses” and “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen.” He recorded “When the Saints” the anthem of the Big Easy more than 100 times.

Count Basie was raised in the Black church too. Two of his uncles were ministers; his father was a founder and pillar of Pilgrim Baptist Church in Red Bank New Jersey. In oral histories and writings fellow musicians and friends use the word spiritual to describe what Basie brought to the band. Sideman Harry “Sweets” Edison compared their group to church organists and singers who inspire congregants to “get up to shout.” Basie was a spiritual presence offstage too. “Prior to eating he would do this elaborate silent prayer” recalls tenor saxophonist Eric Schneider. If the food came before he was finished “it was understood that we should go ahead and eat.”

Duke Ellington was perhaps the most pious of the three maestros. Growing up he attended two services each Sunday: African Methodist Episcopal Zion with his father Baptist with his mother. As a young man he consulted the Bible twice a day sometimes taking the book into the bathtub and reading until the water got cold. Though he shunned most jewelry he wore a gold crucifix around his neck and carried a St. Christopher medal in his hip pocket. His Christmas card bore a simple message in gold lettering: LOVE GOD.

In the last ten years of his life Ellington devoted himself to a series of sacred concerts performances that brought together jazz and classical music spirituals gospel and the blues. Suddenly he was getting more invitations to play in churches than in dance halls. Synagogues too. “These are things people don’t know about him” said singer-songwriter Herb Jeffries. “He had a great ministry. It was hidden in his music. … He was practicing his ministry moving about here and there making people happy!” When a reporter asked how he “as a religious man” could “play in dark dingy places where depravity and drunkenness reign” Ellington whispered “Isn’t that exactly what Christ did—went into the places where people were bringing light into darkness?”

He also pushed back against preachers who accused him of defiling their churches with his concerts. “Some people ask me what prompted me to write the music for the sacred concerts. I have done so not as a matter of career but in response to a growing understanding of my own vocation” Ellington wrote in his memoir. “I think of myself as a messenger boy one who tries to bring messages to people not people who have never heard of God but those who were more or less raised with the guidance of the church.” The sacred concerts this most accomplished of composers and bandleaders added were “the most important thing I have ever done.” They were important to audiences too. Take the girl who approached Ellington after one performance telling him “You know Duke you made me put my cross back on!”

Sacrilegious then isn’t the word to describe these jazzmen. Yes their faith was unorthodox and imperfect. But it also was warmly ecumenical and personally sustaining. You can hear it not just in their Christmas tunes but in all of their jazz music rooted in the gospels and Negro spirituals they grew up with. Their abiding belief in God all three maestros made clear is what emboldened and empowered them to write the soundtrack to the Civil Rights revolution to shape the soul of America.

According to his son Mercer Duke Ellington “was quite taken with the story of the ‘Juggler of Notre Dame.’” It’s a parable that applies to Armstrong and Basie too. “The man was a great juggler who would sneak into the church and juggle before the altar. As the story goes the priests found out about it and kicked him out. God intervened and told the priests to leave him alone. The man was celebrating His presence by using the gifts that He gave him.”

(NYSE:BAX) Shares Do Institutions Own?,"The big shareholder groups in Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) have power over the company. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger smaller companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. We also tend to see lower insider ownership in companies that were previously publicly owned.

Baxter International is a pretty big company. It has a market capitalization of US$44b. Normally institutions would own a significant portion of a company this size. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below) it seems that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups to learn more about Baxter International.

Check out our latest analysis for Baxter International

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Baxter International?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register especially if they are growing.

We can see that Baxter International does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Baxter International's earnings history below. Of course the future is what really matters.

Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company so they can collectively wield significant power. Baxter International is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data we can see that the largest shareholder is Wellington Management Group LLP with 10% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile the second and third largest shareholders hold 8.1% and 7.7% of the shares outstanding respectively.

A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Baxter International

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Baxter International Inc.. As it is a large company we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$65m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

With a 11% ownership the general public have some degree of sway over Baxter International. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Next Steps:

I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight we need to consider other information too. Be aware that Baxter International is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis  you should know about...

Braun Investing $500M to Overhaul Irvine Campus,"B. Braun a German-based infusion therapy company is making good on its promise to help end IV fluid shortages in the country.



It is about halfway through a $500 million overhaul of its plant and sprawling 30-acre campus in Irvine next to the Diamond Jamboree shopping center.



The company the fourth largest medical device maker in OC with 2200 employees is a manufacturer and seller of infusion pumps and IV fluids used to hydrate patients administer drugs and replace lost blood volume on a daily basis.



B. Braun’s ambitious plans in Irvine are for “the replacement of aging equipment upgrading utilities and production lines and increasing capacity across all seven product lines” Pete Klaes general manager and the top local official at B. Braun told the Business Journal.



Local renovations and upgrades account for half of B. Braun’s $1 billion corporate-wide reinvestment effort called Solutions for Life which was unveiled in 2019 after several years of supply issues brought on by destructive weather events and severe influenza seasons the company said.



Facilities in Pennsylvania and a new facility in Florida are also part of the investment plan. Once fulfilled B. Braun will have two IV fluid plants from coast to coast in the U.S. and “double the capacity for IV solutions” Klaes said.

OC Footprint



B. Braun a family-owned company founded in 1839 has maintained a local presence for several decades.



The company acquired Irvine-based IV bag maker McGaw—a subsidiary of Ivax Corp. now part of Teva Pharmaceuticals—for a reported $320 million in 1997. Since then its local base has run along McGaw Avenue just off Jamboree Road.



At one point the company’s holdings in Irvine reportedly totaled nearly 50 acres before it shed some excess land. Business Journal records estimate the company’s Irvine facilities to run nearly 700000 square feet with its main manufacturing plant running about half a million square feet.



The company’s been growing its local presence of late. Last June B. Braun paid nearly $8 million to buy an additional 30600-square-foot industrial building at 2206 Alton Parkway on the other side of the company’s campus.



“We’ve been committed to Southern California and manufacturing at this facility ever since (the McGaw acquisition)” Klaes said noting the local talent pool remains one of the major attractions to the area.



B. Braun remains one of the few IV fluid manufacturers in the U.S. along with Baxter International Inc. and Hospira Infusion Systems the latter of which ICU Medical Inc. of San Clemente (Nasdaq: ICUI) purchased for $900 million in 2017.



Products in Demand



B. Braun implemented a number of safety measures such as masking and temperature-checking ahead of state-mandated shutdowns last year allowing its Irvine operations to go on uninterrupted during the pandemic Klaes said.



The company carries safety inventory along with its distributor partners to ensure a steady supply of critical fluids. While demand is typically stable “that hasn’t been the case over the last year” Klaes said.



“We’ve seen spikes in demand for certain products.”



One example is increased orders for Heparin a blood thinner used to prevent blood clots from forming. Blood thinners decrease the need for organ support and reduce mortality among moderately ill COVID patients according to research from the National Institute of Health.



B. Braun also received federal clearance for the first and only acetaminophen injection available in multiple doses in February. The product is manufactured in Irvine and has “already exceeded initial expectations” Klaes said.",,,,,,,,,

Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Florida Network Realty's listing at 16 May St. known as The Pink Castle will be showcased in a special charitable event next month highlighting the home’s historical significance. The Mysteries of the Pink Castle takes place from 1 to 2:30 p.m. Saturday May 1 and includes a tour lecture concert and book signing.

Built in 1922 The Pink Castle was designed by sculptor C. Adrian Pillars as his own home and studio. Pillars lived in St. Augustine from about 1919 to 1932 before teaching at the Ringling School of Art in Sarasota. Pillar’s most famous work is the statue of Winged Victory in Jacksonville’s Memorial Park. The sculpture of a bronze winged youth rising above a globe is entitled ""Life"" which is also the name of a new biography by historian and author Dr. Wayne Wood.

""Life: The Untold Story of Charles Adrian Pillars"" is Wood’s 14th book. Each of the book’s 400-plus pages and 200-plus photos are rich with little-known facts about Pillars including two chapters that focus on his time in St. Augustine.

The event program will feature a slide-illustrated lecture on Pillars and the Pink Castle by Dr. Wood. Also on the schedule is a balcony concert by renowned violist Marcy Jean Brenner the current owner of the house and a guided tour of the house and gardens.

Limited tickets are available from the Jacksonville Historical Society at https://bit.ly/2Q4GBlu. The suggested donation is $30 per person with proceeds benefiting the St. Augustine Historical Society the Jacksonville Historical Society and the Memorial Park Association.

“Pillars' Pink Castle is a spectacular home with an impressive great room which was once his studio” said Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices President and CEO Christy Budnick. “The home includes original tiled floors grand pillars a splendid gallery staircase and stained glass windows. I encourage everyone to experience this distinctive architectural treasure.”

The home is listed by Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Realtor Mandy Sullivan of the Avondale/Ortega office.

Value investing is in the spotlight but not all value strategies are created equal. Benefiting from the recent value rally has likely been driven by your choice of value factor.

Let’s dig into how the various value factors have performed over recent and longer-term periods.

Every value factor has performed well since September 2020 but price-to-book and shareholder yield are the leaders of the value factor pack. The least expensive quintiles of the Russell 1000 Index as measured by price-to-book and shareholder yield have returned 42.8% and 38.2% respectively.1

More interesting is the performance differential between the least and most expensive quintiles of the market. The median outperformance of the inexpensive versus expensive quintiles across factors is 26%.2 The clear outlier of the group is price-to-book with 37.8% of value outperformance.3 This is a very notable shift in dynamic for price-to-book which was in the hot seat for many years as critics questioned its efficacy as a value factor with good reason.

Despite these recent value factor trends it would be remiss to neglect the past. In the last 10 years shareholder yield was the only value factor that “worked”—meaning it was the only effective way to screen the Russell 1000 Index for the least expensive stocks and outperform not only the expensive stocks but also the benchmark index itself.

Over this same period price-to-book was the least effective of the group with the most expensive quintile outperforming the least expensive by 8.7% annualized.

Please see Glossary for definitions of terms and indexes referenced.

The consistency of shareholder yield in the recent value upturn and over the last 10 years is an important differentiator. At WisdomTree we view shareholder yield as an effective value factor for both short-term tactical value investors and long-term strategic value investors.

Our Shareholder Yield Strategy—QSY

Since the value tide started turning in September 2020 our WisdomTree Quality Shareholder Yield Fund (QSY) has outperformed the Morningstar U.S. Fund Large Value category average by 990bps and the Russell 1000 Value Index by 776bps.4

For standardized performance of QSY please click here.

QSY is a quantitative active strategy that combines a methodical approach to ranking stocks on their shareholder yield and quality scores with the added ability to apply discretion where risks or opportunities to the quantitative model arise.

We recently rebalanced QSY to update the holdings for some notable repurchase activity taking place. Most importantly we added Berkshire Hathaway to QSY which repurchased 5% of its shares outstanding in calendar year 2020.5 In dollar amount and yield terms Berkshire repurchased $24.7 billion in shares relative to its approximately $580 billion market cap equating to a 4.2% shareholder yield.

Although repurchases are a recent development at Berkshire Chair and CEO Warren Buffett discussed the benefits of price-sensitive repurchases: “The math of repurchases grinds away slowly but can be powerful over time. The process offers a simple way for investors to own an ever-expanding portion of exceptional businesses.6“

In Buffett’s view prudently managed repurchase programs allow investors to increase their ownership in a given company without spending a single dollar of their own money.

QSY incorporates Buffett’s principles of investing on buybacks as well as his emphasis on investing in high-quality businesses at reasonable valuations. This is readily apparent in QSY’s fundamental characteristics. Relative to the Russell 1000 and S&P 500 benchmark indexes QSY boasts lower valuations on both shareholder yield and price-to-earnings with higher or top-tier quality metrics including return on assets return on equity and forward earnings growth expectations.

Please see Glossary for definitions of terms and indexes referenced.

The combination of a well-executed high-conviction buyback program with a consistent cash dividend has the potential to drive excess returns for investors across value factor cycles.

We suggest QSY as a potential solution for investors seeking exposure to large- to mid-cap U.S. companies exhibiting high-quality characteristics while returning significant amounts of capital to their shareholders.

Don't – buy a gaming laptop instead,"If you're present on any online computing or gaming forums then I'll bet you've seen messages from newcomers to the hobby asking for advice on their first PC build. Historically this would result in a slew of advice from all sides on the best components for every budget where to look for some great deals and general installation tips and being a part of that felt usually felt like being a part of a welcome community (excluding the weird elitists).



Over the past six months those usually helpful responses will have likely changed to something more along the lines of ""good luck"". For anyone unaware we're currently experiencing a stock shortage of graphics cards and high-end processors that have made it almost impossible for everyday folk to get their hands on the hardware needed to build or upgrade their computers.



For whatever reason though in these forums and social media threads full of frustration surrounding unavailable inventory I never see people discussing gaming laptops as an alternative option. Yes it isn't the best choice for everyone but as someone who frequently gets to put both laptops and desktops through their paces anyone dismissing gaming laptops in 2021 is missing a beat.



Given AMD hasn't yet released its Radeon 6000 series as mobile GPUs yet I'll focus on the tech I've actually used and tested out. I look forward to getting my hands on some of Team Red's offerings in the future but the recent releases by Nvidia with the latest RTX 3000 Ampere hardware have frankly blown me away and washed away some previous stigma I had about purchasing a gaming laptop.

But a desktop PC is cheaper/upgradable/etc...

I'm not trying to erase that the desktop vs laptop argument will have a clear winner depending on your circumstances but a lot of this is made with the assumption that you can simply head out to the store and buy what you need with little difficulty and at the manufacturer's recommended price at that. We live in a weird world right now and the argument to ""wait for the next generation of hardware before you upgrade"" has been going for years.



Due to a combination of the global silicon shortage reducing production scalpers using bots to buy up available stock to resell and massively inflated prices and the ongoing cryptocurrency boom motivating cryptominers to buy up gaming cards to build huge mining farms people have been unsuccessfully trying to buy hardware for months and this doesn't look like it's going to get easier any time soon.



Meanwhile I've found the mobile versions of this highly sought-after tech readily available in various branded gaming laptops across sites like Amazon Best Buy and other regional stores for the UK and Australia.



There is the argument that a desktop is a better choice given how easy it is to upgrade the components at a later date which is presumably fine when stock appears on the shelves again. This is completely valid and given how difficult it can be to make upgrades to a gaming laptop this is potentially a better 'future-proofing' choice.



A gaming laptop is also an expensive purchase so I do appreciate its easy for me to say ""buy this for $2000 instead of a GeForce RTX 3070 GPU with a suggested retail price of $500"" but the current climate doesn't actually make that choice very clear right now. Due to scalpers and retailers inflating prices due to demand it's highly unlikely you'll find your desired graphics card at the price Nvidia set as guidance.



If you're looking to make major upgrades on your desktop system beyond just the GPU or just getting started in the world of PC gaming then you may be happier buying a new Nvidia Ampere gaming laptop now than waiting around for the parts to build a computer – and the cost will likely be negligible especially counting in the cost of a monitor and keyboard.

Okay but laptops are less powerful right?

Without beating around the bush yes. But in practice it's not going to make a huge amount of difference unless you're looking to build something outrageous like a GeForce RTX 3090 with the most powerful Intel or AMD Ryzen CPU available for your system especially if you mostly play online titles that prioritize framerates over breathtaking graphics.



We frequently review and test gaming hardware and devices and we're rarely disappointed by the high-end laptop offerings. Products like the Gigabyte Aorus 17G or the Alienware m17 R4 handled literally everything we threw at them with satisfying framerates and great performance in everything from competitive FPS titles like Apex Legends and Fortnite to graphically intense behemoths like Cyberpunk 2077 and Assasins Creed Valhalla.



And yes those devices are expensive but even the cheaper offering such as the Asus TUF Dash F15 (available for as little as $1099 / £999 around AU$1400) comes with features like ray tracing a 144Hz display and next-gen hardware.



This makes gaming laptops the perfect choice for students or commuting workers who are frequently on the move and may not have the spare cash to splurge on a separate machine for work and play. Many of the releases we saw announced at this year's CES 2021 have adopted a 'hybrid' aesthetic that looks sleek and professional incorporating some blingy gamer RGB lights that can be switched off during working hours.

Will I still have ray tracing and DLSS?

Yes these features are still included in GeForce RTX graphics cards across desktop and mobile so you're not missing out on anything if you do choose to go the laptop route.



For the unfamiliar DLSS stands for 'deep learning super sampling' and is Nvidias AI-powered framerate booster. That's massively simplifying what it is but this feature has been hailed as a way to 'futureproof' hardware that would typically struggle with demanding tasks such as graphics upscaling. A demanding game may manage medium settings at a playable framerate but when you enable the DLSS feature you can scale up the graphics to high without sacrificing any precious FPS.



This makes it the perfect companion for RTX games given the criticisms around ray tracing. The results can be breathtaking – as I found myself when playing Minecraft RTX – but often at the cost of sacrificing framerate. With DLSS you can simply scale this back up and enjoy the best of both worlds.



And that's not all the help from artificial intelligence you'd be getting to help optimize your games if you use Nvidia-powered gaming laptops. Dynamic Boost 2.0 detects where power needs to be prioritized between your GPU and CPU shifting the demand between them as required which not only also helps to improve overall performance in your games but also ensures you're getting optimal power efficiency too.



Another AI-based tech is Whisper Mode 2.0 that helps to communicate your chosen minimum framerate to the laptop's hardware matching the temperature and fan speeds. In short the device will only ever be as loud as it needs to be rather than switching between 'fans off' and 'small jet taking off when you open Steam'. The result is usually a surprisingly quiet device outside of running very demanding programs so if fan noise was going to be an issue for anyone living in a shared space then you could certainly benefit from this.

Anything that'll give me the edge?

Yup that too. You get some of these laptops with up to a 300Hz display and 144Hz is common across the board so anyone who mostly plays ranked esports games will appreciate that you can take a laptop to local events (remember those?) without cramming your desktop setup into a vehicle or train.



On the topic of esports there's also Nvidia Reflex – a feature that reduces latency in games like Rust Valorant and Fortnite to make the period between you clicking a mouse button or tapping a keyboard to the game on your screen responding as fast as it can possibly be. This will make very little difference to anyone who isn't an absolute boss at competitive online titles like the above but the pros optimize this stuff for a reason. Even a few microseconds can be the difference between winning or losing.



I'm far from a diamond rank in anything being the typical runt who has to be carried through most FPS titles (my comforts lay in MMO and RPG titles) but even I can see the difference in all of these features especially compared to older hardware. My personal desktop PC until recently had an Intel i7-7700K CPU and a GeForce GTX 1070 Ti GPU still a respectable build even by today's demanding AAA standards. But every new gaming laptop I've tested against that rig completely wiped the floor with it.



Loading times were cut in half games look beautifully crisp and shiny running RTX and DLSS and the 144Hz / 300Hz displays were a clear difference against my own 60Hz display. A few even had built-in mechanical keyboards that were a significant improvement over the usual designs so all you'd need is a decent gaming mouse and you're good to go.



If you're looking to make some serious upgrades to your own system or starting from scratch then I'd heartily suggest looking into gaming laptops rather than racing against others to buy desktop hardware in the current shortage. Desktop PC's will always have their place at the top of the food chain but until people can actually get their hands on components at a reasonable price you'll have just as much fun playing games on a powerful gaming laptop.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdGVjaC9yZXZpZXdlZGNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzE4L3NlcGhvcmEtc2FsZS1iZWF1dHktaW5zaWRlcnMtY2FuLWdldC1za2luY2FyZS1hbmQtbWFrZXVwLXVwLTIwLW9mZi83MTU0OTQzMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sephora sale: Beauty Insiders can get skincare and makeup at up to 20% off,"Rebecca Norris Melissa Lee and Nicole Briese

Yet three Minnesota executives from Best Buy Medtronic and U.S. Bank are carving out distinct paths to raise their children and build fulfilling careers.

Amelia Williams Hardy is undaunted by busy schedules but she also recognizes that daily life can quickly deteriorate into chaos when both parents are corporate executives trying to raise four children.

Hardy is vice president of inclusion and diversity strategic initiatives at Best Buy. Her husband Cordell is vice president of global corporate research and development operations at 3M. Their children are Elijah 3; Eden 10; Elise 13; and Isaac 16.

“We live by our Google family calendar” Hardy says. “I always say ‘If it’s not on the calendar then it doesn’t exist.’ ”

But Hardy’s carefully constructed calendar was rendered irrelevant in March 2020 when Covid-19 forced her children’s schools to close and she and her husband shifted into work-from-home mode.

The Woodbury couple had to improvise.

Navigating the ‘Work/Life Sway’ For years executive women have talked about their desire to achieve work/life balance. But veteran journalist Joann Lublin says that elusive balance has been replaced by the concept of “work/life sway” which is embraced by young women business leaders. “They deliberately move back and forth between the professional and personal sides of their digital-centric lives accepting inevitable and aggravating disruptions such as taking youngsters to medical checkups during the workday” Lublin wrote in her new book.

“I had the dining room table for the first couple of months” Hardy says. “It’s not good for your back and neck.” Cordell Hardy was using the home’s office and the three oldest children often did their homework there too.

“The challenge was if he was on video calls which mainly he was then we’d spread out” Hardy recalls. “So you would get my youngest daughter working at the kitchen table my oldest daughter working in my youngest son’s room and then my oldest son would usually be in his room. We needed enough space to spread out so that you could still hear the conversations that you were a part of on the Zoom calls.”

Elijah’s day care center has remained open throughout the pandemic but Hardy says he’s been at home anytime he showed cold symptoms or had any illness.

“That was hard because he would be jumping in the background on my sofa or in the Zoom camera” Hardy says.

“It’s all a blur” is how she describes the early weeks of working from home and overseeing her children’s instruction. “I felt guilty that I wasn’t able to help them more” Hardy says. “We were still working and weren’t able to spend the full time with them that we needed to.”

The disruption that Covid-19 has caused for working mothers worries advocates of gender parity in corporate America.

“During Covid you’ve got so many more personal household responsibilities that women are juggling on average more than men” says Kweilin Ellingrud a senior partner in the Minneapolis office of McKinsey & Co. “[Women] are stagnating at work and so they’re less likely to get the promotion or take on new challenges.”

The annual Women in the Workplace study released in September and conducted for McKinsey and Lean In showed that the pandemic exacerbated the challenges women already face carrying heavy loads at work and at home. Some working women are “downshifting their careers” Ellingrud says while others are thinking about “stepping out of the workforce altogether because right now there are just too many things going on.”

“We don’t have traditional roles. My husband does most of the cooking and meal planning and I tend to do most of the activities.” —Amelia Williams Hardy vice president of inclusion and diversity strategic initiatives Best Buy

‘It’s a Catch-22’

Hardy 45 doesn’t plan to downshift her career but she acknowledges that she and her husband regularly talk about the family challenges associated with two demanding careers.

“It’s a tricky conversation and it’s hard” she says. “It’s a Catch-22. I think we both want each other to succeed and do what’s best for the other and I think we also want that for ourselves. It’s an ebb and flow for us. It definitely is an ongoing conversation. It’s a conversation that I don’t think is going to stop until we retire.”

As a Black woman who has reached the vice president level at Best Buy a publicly traded company Hardy is part of a small number of BIPOC women nationally. The recent McKinsey study documented the gender gap that still exists in the corporate pipeline. Just 19 percent of C-suite jobs are held by white women and only 3 percent are held by women of color. At the vice president level white women occupy 24 percent of the jobs with women of color in 6 percent of the positions.

Hardy a native of Overland Park Kansas initially wanted to be a doctor and earn her undergraduate degree at a historically black college. “I grew up in a suburb that was predominantly white” she says. “My whole experience growing up I never had a teacher of color. I was usually the only child of color in my class. I wanted to experience something different.”

Multiple internships piqued her interest in business and she went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Xavier University of Louisiana. After finishing her MBA at Tulane University she accepted a job at 3M in 2000 and climbed the ranks to global business unit manager over a 14-year run.

She married Cordell Hardy in 2003 after meeting him at Pilgrim Baptist Church in St. Paul where they were both part of the church’s young adult ministry. When they first met Cordell was finishing his Ph.D. at the University of Minnesota and the couple knew they both had strong career ambitions.

When firstborn Isaac arrived it kicked off the discussions about how to juggle children and careers. “Being a new parent I was nervous to send Isaac to day care” Hardy says so she and her husband hired a full-time nanny a young woman they knew from their church who was taking a year off of studies before beginning law school.

“After that we put our kids in day care” Hardy says. “Then when we moved to a bigger house when I was pregnant with our third child we realized that we needed more help. And that’s when we actually started looking into au pairs.”

Financial strain of child care

Their local insurance agent recommended that they try au pairs which typically involves a short-term contract arrangement with someone from abroad who lives with the family and takes care of the children. The Hardys employed au pairs until about two or three years ago and then returned to employing nannies.

It takes two to accommodate two demanding careers. The morning nanny helps get Elijah up and off to day care in the morning while the afternoon nanny picks him up and helps with after-school activities. When the pandemic hit the Hardys furloughed their nannies to follow safety protocols about limiting virus spread. After they learned more about Covid-19 they hired two new nannies who are now part of their Covid bubble.

About six years ago after Cordell’s mother retired she moved from Philadelphia to Woodbury so she could help with driving her grandchildren to events and taking them to doctor’s appointments.

Before the pandemic Hardy says her Kansas-based mother also pitched in. “If Cordell was gone to Asia for a couple of weeks she would come up and help during that time” she says.

Hardy acknowledges that her family has spent a huge amount of money on child care. “The accessibility of affordable child care at all levels is really hard to find” she says which is a major issue that can stymie women’s careers.

In her personal life Hardy says she’s talked to friends early in their careers who asked aloud whether it’s “worth it” to hold certain jobs because their salaries might equal or be less than their child care costs.

“The child care thing is big” Hardy says. “The government can help with that companies can help with that—whether through subsidization or policies to make it more equitable and accessible.”

Hardy says that she and her husband are united in balancing out the work of family life. “We don’t have traditional roles” she says. “My husband does most of the cooking and meal planning and I tend to do most of the activities.”

In their case she says they both have “the mindset” to play the position that’s needed at the given time. “People have to really be in it and intentional about making it work” Hardy says “and not holding so tightly to any stereotypical or familiar roles.”

Joann Lublin author of the new book Power Moms: How Executive Mothers Navigate Work and Life interviewed baby boomer executives and women holding executive roles in their 30s and 40s. “The calculus has changed in terms of the sharing of power on the home front” Lublin tells TCB. “This younger generation of executive moms tend to pick as their partners or husbands or wives individuals who share their outlook about co-parenting and also being partners in terms of the domestic tasks.”

Blazing her own path

Karen Parkhill 55 the chief financial officer of Medtronic just missed the cutoff for the baby boomer generation which contained what Lublin describes as trailblazer women executives.

Early in her career Parkhill encountered the vestiges of male domination in investment banking.

A graduate of Sacred Heart Academy a girls Catholic high school in Springfield Illinois Parkhill originally thought she wanted a career in medicine. But she shifted gears after three semesters at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. “It was an adviser actually who steered me toward the business school and finance because it was related to my love of math” Parkhill recalls. She ultimately earned undergraduate degrees in business administration and mathematics.

She began her professional career at a regional investment bank that’s now part of Dain Rauscher doing public finance work on municipal bonds for cities counties and other government units.

“One of the things that I tell women now is ‘Never ever put your personal life on hold for your professional life.’ ” —Karen Parkhill chief financial officer Medtronic

Three years later she enrolled in a full-time MBA program at the University of Chicago. She thought what she learned at Chicago’s Booth School of Business would be her ticket to the big leagues of investment banking.

She was right. She was hired by JP Morgan in 1992 and moved to New York. But she had a complicated personal life. She was dating Jeff Parkhill whom she had met as a fellow business school student and he had been hired to work for Kraft Foods in Chicago. “We had a long-distance relationship for almost two years” Parkhill says until she was able to land a job in JP Morgan’s new Chicago office.

The couple married on Dec. 31 1994 and planned to have children.

“Sadly back at that time in investment banking there were very few senior women role models” Parkhill says. “And there was this unspoken almost-rule that you shouldn’t have children before you were a vice president. I can’t think of any women back then who had children at a younger career age.”

Parkhill followed the cues of the other JP Morgan women. “I honestly waited until I was a vice president and by that time we were older and we had trouble getting pregnant” she says. “So we ended up having to go through in vitro [fertilization] which is why we were blessed to have twins.” Hayden and Hunter are now 21.

The couple later adopted their daughter Cheney who is 14.

“Things turned out fine” Parkhill says. “But one of the things that I tell women now is ‘Never ever put your personal life on hold for your professional life.’ ”

Before the twins arrived Parkhill needed to come up with a child care solution. “Both my husband and I had big jobs and we both traveled a lot” Parkhill says. “We needed to have the most flexibility that we could have. We had one nanny for the first two years of the boys’ lives and then we hired our second nanny. She is still with us and she is part of our family.”

For a good portion of her career Parkhill says she managed to get promoted by “just working harder than the next person to really prove myself.” Working in the male-oriented investment banking sector women tended to create their own breaks.

“There were a few really great men along the way in my career and all of them were men who either had a spouse who had their own career or had daughters who were ambitious and they wanted their daughters to have strong careers” she says.

Today Parkhill is the executive sponsor of the Medtronic Women’s Network subgroup Commit to Connect which bolsters the corporation’s women vice presidents around the globe. Parkhill says they offer mentors sponsors vice president group sessions and other support to help retain and promote the women into more senior positions at Medtronic.

Parkhill who serves on the board of American Express landed the plum Medtronic CFO job in 2016 after serving as CFO of the Comerica financial services company. She got on the CFO track after making what some might view as a risky move.

“I took a year sabbatical between my investment banking career and my CFO career” she says taking time off about 15 years ago. “I knew that I wanted to do something different and it was impossible for me to figure out when I was on the investment banking treadmill what that was.”

Following the sabbatical she became the CFO for JP Morgan’s commercial banking business.

She’s encouraged women executives at Medtronic to take time off adding when “they come back to the company they haven’t missed a beat.” She contends the sabbaticals are important for people who have long and challenging careers.

Taking a career ‘pause’

Liz Deziel 41 a former senior vice president at U.S. Bank is currently enjoying a sabbatical that she granted herself.

In late October she posted on LinkedIn: “Today was my last day with U.S. Bank. I’m thrilled to share that my next move is to hit pause on my career and spend time with our kids.”

She noted that over 15 years with U.S. Bank she had moved from an administrative assistant to senior vice president and along the way she earned an MBA through evening graduate school and she passed her Certified Financial Planner (CFP) exam. She appeared to be on the fast track in corporate America.

Now she’s focused on supervising the distance learning of her daughters Scarlett 9 and Noelle 7 who are pupils at Garlough Environmental Magnet School in West St. Paul. Deziel’s husband Tom Stukel is a technology professional for their local school district.

“I think women would be more interested in [senior management] roles if they were convinced that the hours the stress the demands and the culture would not suffocate their lives outside of work.” —Liz Deziel former senior vice president U.S. Bank

The couple met when they were undergraduate students at the College of St. Benedict and St. John’s University. “I was fiercely independent” Deziel says with a laugh. “I definitely wasn’t there searching for a husband but I was lucky enough to meet him there.”

Tom was a peace studies major from the small town of Granite Falls while Liz a Burnsville native had a self-designed liberal studies major with philosophy and sociology emphasis areas. She also earned a minor in gender and women’s studies.

Their academic pursuits may have provided an early indicator of the egalitarian relationship they would develop. The couple married in September 2003.

After their daughter Scarlett was born they came up with a child care plan that’s still somewhat rare. “The decision that we made for him to become a stay-at-home dad was one of the easiest decisions we ever made” Deziel says. “I was loving my career and had just landed my first manager role and I had completed my MBA in recent years. Tom had been working for a small nonprofit and enjoyed his work too.”

They had the flexibility to live off of Deziel’s U.S. Bank salary so Stukel stayed home with Scarlett and Noelle and did not return to the workforce until December 2019.

Liz Deziel’s decision to leave U.S. Bank wasn’t made hastily during the pandemic. It had been in the works for a year or so. She had started to feel like she wanted to “trade places” with her husband as the at-home parent.

“In the earlier years he was better suited for that role” she says. “When the kids were babies and toddlers I felt like I had the easier job going to the office. And I liked my work. He handled the exhaustion and the social isolation. He was better at getting on the floor and playing with them and so I didn’t necessarily wish I was in his shoes when the girls were younger.”

At the time she left U.S. Bank Deziel had been working in the bank’s corporate social responsibility area. Previously she had been a senior vice president in the bank’s wealth management business. A few years ago she competed with a male colleague for a market leader position in the Twin Cities. She didn’t get the local job but was offered market leader positions in two other metro areas in the United States. She turned down those opportunities.

“Having family here and having been to college here I feel pretty rooted here and invested in the community” Deziel says. “I have so much history here and I feel so connected to so many aspects of this community that it wouldn’t be worth it to me to give all of that up for a job.”

For the first eight months of the pandemic Deziel was the primary parent at home with her daughters. Deziel did her U.S. Bank work while the girls studied. On some of those days she says “I felt like I was constantly pushing them off” by encouraging them to keep themselves busy while she took part in work video meetings.

Since she left her job the decks are clear for Deziel to enjoy spending time with her daughters and she’s started to cook and do chores around the house that her husband used to do. “I can hang out with [my daughters] on their class breaks and we can play games while they are on a break” she says. “I know they won’t always want to hang out with their mom as much so I am soaking that up. And I’m also enjoying having more open space in my life.”

Deziel emphasizes that she is taking a break from the work world not leaving it for good. As a graduate of a women’s college and longtime

supporter of women’s careers she says she “absolutely” believes that more women should hold C-suite jobs.

However she also urges companies to take a second look at what constitutes success in senior management roles in their workplaces.

“I think women would be more interested in those roles if they were convinced that the hours the stress the demands and the culture would not suffocate their lives outside of work” Deziel says.

Since she posted her career “pause” news on LinkedIn last year she’s engaged in conversations with many women who are reassessing their work and personal lives especially in light of the pandemic.

Women have the capability to perform well in any C-suite job in major companies Deziel says but adds that some women aren’t going to step forward to pursue jobs that currently are designed to be all-consuming and require people to be available 24/7 on a regular basis.

“I have recalibrated what my goals are and I think I’ve realized I am far more motivated by meaning and fulfillment than I am by money and power and status” Deziel says. She hasn’t put a specific timeline on when she’ll reenter the workforce or decided whether she’ll work in the private public or nonprofit sector.

But she’s clear-eyed about her values at home and at work. Deziel says “I look forward to doing more work in the Twin Cities community for a second act after I’ve taken this break and I am excited to pursue that work feeling recharged.”

""At the moment BlackRock is a major part of the problem"" said Robin Wells an English teacher and activist with Fossil Free London who joined the U.K. city's demonstration in a statement from the global network BlackRock's Big Problem.

""Today we're giving notice that we'll be watching to see if BlackRock will actually pour any water on the flames it has started"" Wells said. ""We're here because we can't fix our planet with promises only action can do that.""

In addition to London activists demonstrated at BlackRock offices in Boston Dallas Miami New York City San Francisco and Zurich.

""CEO Larry Fink talks a big game on climate but the company is the top investor in oil gas and coal"" noted Patrick Houston of New York Communities for Change. ""As the season of shareholder annual meetings looms all eyes are on BlackRock.""

As BlackRock's Big Problem details on a webpage about this year's shareholder season:

In BlackRock's 2021 Stewardship Expectations report the asset manager finally acknowledged that voting against management and supporting shareholder proposals often leads to positive changes at companies. In January 2021 BlackRock expanded its voting criteria and announced that it will hold directors accountable when their companies fail to address climate change in their business plans. In March both BlackRock and Vanguard joined the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative a first move on climate for Vanguard. While acknowledgments and commitments may mark a change in thinking within BlackRock and Vanguard it is action that is needed to curb the climate crisis. So this shareholder season as the world looks toward COP26 their default position must be to vote in favor of pro-climate shareholder resolutions and against corporate boards when a company doesn't have a clear climate transition plan.

The network is focused on eight specific votes. In the oil and gas sector there will votes on resolutions for BP and Shell to set public targets consistent with the goals of the Paris agreement and against ExxonMobil chairman and CEO Darren Woods as well as lead independent director Kenneth C. Frazier for failing to implement plans consistent with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5oC the more ambitious Paris goal.

There are similar plans for financial services--votes on resolutions for Barclays and MUFG to set Paris-related targets and against Wells Fargo chairman Charles H. Noski for failing to implement plans consistent with the 1.5oC goal. There will also be a similar vote against Duke chair and CEO Lynn Good as well as independent lead director Michael G. Browning. Activists are also pushing for a resolution requesting Bunge issue a report about eliminating deforestation in its soy supply chain.

""At this point voting with corporate management to maintain business as usual is an active choice against climate action"" the network says. ""If asset managers continue to choose not to vote for climate action this shareholder season they will be actively working against progress science and the interests of their own clients and beneficiaries.""

While protesters aimed to raise awareness about the upcoming votes some also directed attention to the controversial Line 3 pipeline which opponents have dubbed ""a climate time bomb."" The Canadian company Enbridge is trying to replace a corroding pipeline with a larger one that would carry oil from Alberta through North Dakota and Minnesota to Wisconsin. Construction on the project has been repeatedly halted in recent months by water protectors' direct actions in Minnesota.

""My heritage is of a people whose rights were violently violated. My future is of a planet whose climate is being devastatingly altered. BlackRock should wield its vast financial power to mitigate the climate crisis"" declared 19-year-old climate justice activist Xiye Bastida of the Otomi-Toltec Nation. ""It can start by divesting from Enbridge the owner of the Line 3 pipeline before moving to divest from all tar sands.""

Last month Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) questioned Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on why the federal government hasn't deemed BlackRock ""too big to fail"" and subjected the firm to stricter oversight. The senator said during a hearing that ""it isn't just banks that pose a risk to the economy. In 2008 two investment companies Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers failed triggering the 2008 crash.""

The Biden administration faces mounting pressure to protect U.S. financial institutions and the economy from risks posed by the climate emergency as well as demands that the administration help end the flow of private finance from Wall Street to major polluters. Polling results released Monday show that a majority of U.S. voters support federal government action to prevent future climate-related economic crises.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmthbG1hbmFjay5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC9zdHV5LXRvd24tYm9vay1kZXRhaWxzLXdvcnN0LXJlYWwtZXN0YXRlLWRlYWwtaW4taGlzdG9yeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Stuy Town Book Details ""Worst Real Estate Deal in History""","Book purchases made through this link support New York Almanack’s mission to report new publications relevant to New York State.

A south Dublin businessman whose home was subject to a petrol bomb attack this week has been living under threat from Real IRA thug Nathan Kinsella after a car deal went wrong.

The family man who runs a high-end motor business was issued with an official Garda warning last year stating that he was under threat from Kinsella after the car dealer tried to collect money he was owed for a top-of-the-range Mercedes car.

Kinsella took the Mercedes E220 AMG from the dealer but never honoured the re-payment agreement for the €80k it was worth and when the businessman took back the car the thug began to intimidate him and demand compensation.

Nathan Kinsella

The businessman's home in Leopardstown has been amongst a handful of houses in the south Dublin area on a Garda rapid response list ever since and when a car was set alight in the driveway an emergency call was made from the property. Officers were quick to respond and arrested three men making their getaway on the M50 motorway.

Gangland hitman Robbie Lawlor

The men who are linked to slain gangland thug Robbie Lawlor have no obvious links to Kinsella but gardaí are investigating if he hired them to carry out the arson attack to force the businessman to pay up.

Kinsella has been living in nearby Blackrock with his partner and young children in a house owned by millionaire builder Gerry McGreevy. Kinsella has told friends that he is very concerned about an ongoing health problem he has and is desperate to raise funds so he can attempt to buy the property which he has already told close associates he owns.

Vinnie Ryan.

The unemployed hardman is understood to have created a web of lies around his finances even once claiming that he part-owned a hotel in Dublin. But as his health deteriorates his 'Walter Mitty' tales are fast crumbling and now officers believe he is desperate to shore up some funds so he can settle his affairs.

Kinsella moved into the house in Blackrock last year despite not holding down a job since his release from prison. The Real IRA enforcer was once feared in the underworld and was a close associate of murdered trio - brothers Alan and Vinnie Ryan and 'Fat' Deccy Smith.

The €80000 Mercedes E220 AMG

He pleaded guilty at the Special Criminal Court to membership of an illegal organisation in 2014 and spent two years in prison. He has been closely monitored ever since and when he moved to plush Richmond officers from the Special Detective Unit who investigate terrorism and dissident republican activities raided the property.

It is understood the raid formed part of a money-laundering investigation and that the ownership of it was established soon after. It is understood that Mr McGreevy has told officers that a rental agreement is now in place with Kinsella's partner.

Kinsella's gangland career has been on a downward spiral since he was a bootboy for Alan Ryan who caused mayhem by taxing drug gangs in Dublin until his murder in September 2012.

After his death paramilitaries displayed their might at his funeral when they turned out in their droves uniformed in black and white and let off a number of rounds of ammunition as their 'martyr' was lowered into his grave.

Despite the show of strength the organisation was falling apart at the seams and in the years that followed all of Ryan's inner circle would be targeted. Kinsella himself survived a kneecapping attack before he was arrested by officers who rounded up the funeral-goers after a massive public outcry.

Kinsella who had been a pallbearer at the funeral pleaded guilty to membership of an illegal organisation namely the IRA and was jailed for two years. After he got out he was collated a number of times at Jim Mansfield Jnr's Tasaggart House at Citywest.

It later emerged that on his release from prison he stayed near the Mansfield property and began a relationship with a woman who worked as an accounts clerk in a nearby hotel.

Over the course of the trial of Jim Mansfield Jnr currently adjourned for hearing later this year it was heard that he was paying protection money to members of the Real IRA. Evidence was heard alleging Nathan Kinsella used Mansfield's mansion as an office after he was hired for protection.

Kinsella recently visited Dubai in the United Arab Emirates where he took part in a medical treatment and has been hospitalised a number of times over the past year.

The businessman who was victim of the arson attack had just returned to his property at Orby Park at 10pm on Monday night when a number of men approached and set one car alight damaging another. It is understood that they were caught on CCTV cameras at the property and have also been captured on other systems in the area as they lay in wait.

One is already facing charges and the others are understood to be known criminals for hire. An Audi Q5 was damaged and a Volkswagen Golf was destroyed in the incident.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbHdheWRhaWx5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3BhcmtpbmctZmFjaWxpdGllcy1hdC1zYWx0aGlsbC1wcm9tLXRvLXJlb3Blbi1vbi1hcHJpbC0yNi_SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5nYWx3YXlkYWlseS5jb20vbmV3cy9wYXJraW5nLWZhY2lsaXRpZXMtYXQtc2FsdGhpbGwtcHJvbS10by1yZW9wZW4tb24tYXByaWwtMjYvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Parking facilities at Salthill Prom to reopen on April 26,"Car parks and parking along the Salthill Promenade and Silverstrand in Galway City will reopen on April 26.

The decision has also been scheduled to match government guidelines for the easing of COVID-19 restrictions which will see more outdoor attractions and sports facilities allowed to reopen on April 26.

Car parks and parking along the Prom at Blackrock Diving Tower and Silverstrand were closed in January at the request of the Gardaí.

This was due to difficulties with maintaining social distancing with large numbers of people in the area.

Social Distancing signage in all areas will be maintained the city council has said.",,,

The US fund management giant has agreed to sell the Milestone Logistics portfolio to ESR Milestone Partnership (EMP) a collaborative venture between ESR and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC for A$3.8 billion ($2.9 billion) according to a statement from ESR.

“The opportunity to secure such a large portfolio with extremely well-located assets across Adelaide Brisbane Melbourne Perth and Sydney strategically positions EMP to benefit from the continued growth in demand for warehouse space particularly as the robust demand for logistics real estate is expected to remain strong due to sustained growth in e-commerce” said ESR Australia chief executive Phil Pearce.

The sale which ends a bidding contest that pitted Hong Kong-listed ESR and its Singaporean partner against four other contenders is the latest logistics giga-transaction by Blackstone and sets a new bar for warehouse investments in Australia as increased competition squeezes investment yields.

ESR Australia Doubles

The Milestone purchase adds 45 assets covering 1.4 million square metres (15 million square feet) of gross floor area to ESR’s Australian holdings just over the 1.36 million square metres that it had under management at the end of last year according to its 2020 financial statement.

“You don’t get opportunities like this every day” Pearce told Mingtiandi. “It took them (Blackstone) five years to build the portfolio and it would take us five or six to build something similar so being able to get it done in one deal is a significant advantage.”

The portfolio buy which includes properties in Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Adelaide and Perth is nearly equal in value to ESR’s assets under management in Australia which totalled $3.4 billion as of 31 December after the pan-Asian logistics player first entered the Aussie market in 2018. Pearce indicated that beyond the existing built area in the portfolio the 3.6 million square metres of site area included in the purchase provides opportunity for future expansion.

“The portfolio is land-rich with low site coverage of only 38 percent providing plenty of opportunity for ESR to redevelop these assets over time” Pearce said. A typical logistics project in Australia covers 50-6o percent of the site area according to Pearce.

GIC which has already partnered extensively with ESR in Australia will be contributing 80 percent of the equity to the venture with ESR taking care of the remaining 20 percent. ANZ Bank MUFG Bank Standard Chartered Bank and United Overseas Bank are providing fully underwritten debt facilities for the acquisition.

Blackstone had engaged JLL and Eastdil Secured to market the Milestone portfolio since late last year with the firm having also dangled the possibility of an IPO for the set of warehouses which it had built up through a series of acquisitions over the past five years. Lead advisors to Blackstone from JLL were Tony Iuliano Stuart Crow and Adrian Rowse.

The US fund manager which has made logistics properties one of its mainline strategies in recent years had marketed Milestone through a two-stage tender process which attracted 10 first-round bids. The second round included ARA Asset Management’s Logos AXA Investment Managers of France Australia’s Dexus and Singapore’s Mapletree making separate competing offers before Logos and AXA reportedly joined forces last week. The transaction remains subject to approval by Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board.

Logistics Yields Enter Office Territory

Milestone’s tenants include Australian retail major Woolworths shipping firm Toll Group and Caterpillar dealer WestTrac as well as Michigan-based Lineage Logistics — the world’s largest cold storage firm.

Together Milestone’s occupiers generate about A$150 million in revenue annually which puts the sale of the portfolio at a capitalisation rate of around 4.5 percent and brings logistics transactions into a yield range previously more common for prime office deals. The averaged weighted time to lease expiry in the portfolio is 6.9 years and and an independent appraisal had valued the portfolio at A$3.43 billion.

“The Australian logistics market is very attractive to sovereign funds and international asset managers with the sector viewed as one of the most dynamic and resilient asset classes globally. Given the market’s growth prospects there remains huge unsatisfied demand for Australian logistics opportunities” said Stuart Crow CEO for Capital Markets in Asia Pacific at JLL. He added: “Increasingly we are seeing opportunities for investors to expand their exposure in logistics through platform deals.”

ESR which also has operations in China Japan India Korea and Southeast Asia has been rapidly ramping up its presence in Australia under the leadership of Pearce a one-time Goodman executive.

Last year the firm signed a pair of deals with GIC to develop and acquire A$1.5 billion in warehouse projects in Australia and just last month ESR picked up a business park in Sydney from fund manager AMP Capital for A$71 million.

The Milestone acquisition boosts ESR from having the sixth- or seventh-largest logistics real estate portfolio in Australia to rank the firm third in the country behind only market leader Goodman and fund manager Charter Hall.

Record-Breaking Warehouses

For followers of Blackstone’s thematic approach to investment the sale of the Milestone portfolio has echoes of a deal four years ago between the firm run by billionaire Stephen Schwarzman and China’s sovereign wealth fund.

In 2017 Blackstone scored Europe’s single largest real estate deal ever when it sold the Logicor platform to CIC for €12.25 billion (then $13.82 billion). That deal which involved 630 distribution centres in 17 European countries came after Blackstone had completed more than 50 transactions to acquire and tune the Logicor platform.

Two years ago Blackstone was the buyer in another record-breaking logistics deal when it purchased GLP’s US assets for $18.7 billion. That 2019 acquisition which was the largest private real estate transaction ever brought Blackstone 16.6 million square metres of properties on behalf of a pair of funds and nearly doubled the Manhattan-based firm’s US industrial portfolio.

Portfolios in the Making

During the past two years Blackstone has given the appearance of assembling fresh warehouse portfolios in Japan and India rhyming with the strategy it employed in Europe and Australia.

In 2019 the firm spent JPY 100 billion (then $920 million) to buy a set of six logistics facilities in Japan from a private fund managed by Mapletree. Blackstone then followed up in August last year by purchasing a set of four Japanese warehouses from Daiwa House Industry the property development division of the Daiwa conglomerate for around JPY 55 billion.

An India logistics platform also appears to be underway with local news reports indicating last week that Blackstone is set to buy Embassy Industrial Parks for $700 million from a joint venture between Warburg Pincus and local development titan Embassy Group which is also Blackstone’s partner in the Embassy Office Parks REIT.

Should the Embassy Industrial Parks deal be consummated it would add 2 million square metres of industrial space — primarily warehouses — to a portfolio that Blackstone has been assembling through development and acquisitions since 2019. Significantly the fund manager spent around $54 million one year ago to buy a 54 percent stake in Mumbai-based Allcargo Logistics Ltd’s warehousing business.

With the Milestone deal said to have been signed this weekend Blackstone may have a few extra Aussie dollars on hand for its pursuit of Crown Resorts with the US firm offering $6 billion for the casino operator’s business provided that it can hold onto its licences.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9ibGFja3N0b25lLWZ1bmVyYWwtaG9tZS9qZWFubmluZS1sYW1iZXJ0LWdpcmFyZC1vaGlvL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9ibGFja3N0b25lLWZ1bmVyYWwtaG9tZS9qZWFubmluZS1sYW1iZXJ0LWdpcmFyZC1vaGlvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeannine Lambert Girard Ohio,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wkbn.com/my-valley-tributes/blackstone-funeral-home/jeannine-lambert-girard-ohio/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9ibGFja3N0b25lLWZ1bmVyYWwtaG9tZS9qZWFubmluZS1sYW1iZXJ0LWdpcmFyZC1vaGlvL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9ibGFja3N0b25lLWZ1bmVyYWwtaG9tZS9qZWFubmluZS1sYW1iZXJ0LWdpcmFyZC1vaGlvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcm9sbGluZ3N0b25laW5kaWEuY29tL21hbGF5c2lhLXJvY2stYWN0LWJpbGxpZS1ibHVlLW5vd2hlcmUtbWVuLW9sZC1mcmllbmQtc29uZy_SAVhodHRwczovL3JvbGxpbmdzdG9uZWluZGlhLmNvbS9tYWxheXNpYS1yb2NrLWFjdC1iaWxsaWUtYmx1ZS1ub3doZXJlLW1lbi1vbGQtZnJpZW5kLXNvbmcv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Malaysian Rock Act Billie Blue and the Nowhere Men Talk New Single ‘Old Friend’ and India Connection,"When Kuala Lumpur rock band Billie Blue and the Nowhere Men went the acoustic route for their latest release “Old Friend” it didn’t necessarily mean they were mellowing down from their energetic psychedelic roots heard on songs like “Red Corduroy.” If anything they were putting forward a more openhearted perspective.

Over a video call from Malaysia singer-songwriter Billie Blue Blackstone tells Rolling Stone India “It’s lyrically one of the songs that I’m most proud of because I think it was the first time I managed to capture more of a sense of vulnerability in my lyrics.” Aided by the acoustic guitar of co-founder Soheil Sanjabi “Old Friend” was written in 2018 and is a nod towards the power of verse championed by the likes of Bob Dylan and Neil Young. Billie says the song draws from how “the most negative headspaces can become comforting and feel like an old friend.”

It’s a particularly important release for the bandleader who was at one point “scared of songwriting.” While Billie Blue and the Nowhere Men started out as a covers band (who were very selective and shunned top 40 hits in their setlists) around six years ago they began developing their own identity and sound and even released an album called Find Gold in 2018. Currently songs like “Emperor” and “Red Corduroy” are on streaming platforms in addition to “Old Friend.” She says “When we wanted to have original music I was like ‘Okay you know what you just gotta go for it.’”

Comprising Billie Sanjabi bassist David Harding and drummer Reuben Devanesan the band are about as multicultural as they come. Sanjabi was born in Tehran while Harding and Devanesan are native Malaysians. Billie is half American and half Malaysian born to a mother who is also a singer-songwriter and artist. Trotting around Japan Singapore and Kuala Lumpur Billie has been in Malaysia for the last eight years.

While the pandemic has them parched for gigs even as the situation slowly changes in Malaysia Billie Blue and the Nowhere Men found favor in India for virtual performances at college festivals such as Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati’s Alcheringa and Indian Institute of Management Bengaluru’s Unmaad in March. Their India connection was forged when they received an offer to perform at I.I.T. Madras’ annual festival Saarang in January last year. Billie adds “We figured if we were going all the way to India we might as well turn it into a tour.” In the span of eight days the band performed in Chennai to college goers in Goa for a vacation crowd and topped it off with two shows in Bengaluru; one for living room gig series Sofar and another at a city pub. “I really enjoyed the nightlife it was very happening. And we got to meet some local musicians in Bangalore which was great. When we were in India we kept saying we have to come back. Hopefully we’ll get the opportunity to someday” the singer says.

While some of their India tour costs were funded via a grand from the Cultural Economy Development Agency (CENDANA) in Malaysia the pandemic has put pause on recording budgets for Billie Blue and the Nowhere Men. There’s a new song tentatively titled “Eggs In A Basket” that Billie mentions (it has prog elements) but the band is more immediately keen to get back on stage breaking away from virtual acoustic performances. She calls it “soul crushing” that they can’t perform just yet. “It has always been the most enjoyable part of being a musician at least personally. I love the process of creating and writing music but the exciting part is really getting to perform those songs for other people and making that connection with an audience” Billie adds.

ESR Australia is paying $3.8 billion – the highest price outlaid in one line for a collection of Australian property assets – for the Blackstone Milestone logistics portfolio and managing business Milestone Operations Limited (MOP).

In February LOGOS paid Qube $1.65b for the Moorebank Business Park and investment holding Moorebank Warehouse Trust.

The deal is subject to Foreign Investment Review Board approval.

The 45 investments cover 360 hectares and contain more than 1.4 million square metres of gross lettable area.

They will be held in a new vehicle ESR Milestone Portfolio (EMP) – 80 per cent of which will be owned by Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC.

Post transaction ESR Australia will control $7.9b of local industrial real estate – making it the country’s third biggest manager of this product.

Blackstone was since 2016 the nation’s fifth largest owner.

ESR Group which was Main Board listed in late 2019 is the most sizeable logistics real estate manager in the Asia Pacific – its assets covering 2010ha worth $38.7b (US$29.9b).

ESR Milestone Portfolio

ESR Australia outbid Dexus Mapletree and a partnership comprising LOGOS and AXA Investment Managers for the Blackstone assets.

ANZ Banking Group Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Standard Chartered and United Overseas Bank will underwrite the debt.

The properties are in Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Perth and Adelaide (story continues below).

The blended yield is 4.5pc.

Low site coverage

ESR Australia chief executive officer Phil Pearce said the “transformative” deal positions EMP “to benefit from the continued growth in demand for warehouse space particularly as the robust demand for logistics real estate is expected to remain strong due to sustained growth in e-commerce sales”.

Australia Post Caterpillar Daimler Benz Mazda Toll and Woolworths are amongst the occupiers.

“The portfolio is land rich with low site coverage of only 38pc providing plenty of scope for ESR Australia to redevelop these assets over time” the leader added.

Colleagues co-founder and co-CEO Jeffrey Shen and Stuart Gibson said “this tremendous expansion not only adds immediate scale to our presence in Australia and the region but also extends our footprint and reaffirms our commitment to one of our highest conviction markets in Asia Pacific”.

In another landmark deal in February LOGOS agreed to pay Qube $1.65b for the 243-hectare Moorebank Business Park investment-holding Qube Moorebank Warehouse Trust and stakes in related businesses .

Six years ago Ascendas Reit spent $1.1b on 26 assets – held by Frasers Property Australia and coincidentally GIC.

In 2016 Blackstone paid Goodman $640m for assets which are now selling to ESR. Sources say the same vendor is presently close to selling a Manulife-led partnership 20 east coast logistics properties for c$850m.

More to come.

The potential electrical problem that prompted airlines to remove some 737 MAX planes from service has been found in more areas of the plane than initially known a report said Friday.

Boeing said on April 9 that the issue discovered during the manufacturing process requires ""verification that a sufficient ground path exists for a component of the electrical power system.""

But The Wall Street Journal citing Boeing reported Friday that the manufacturing issue affects ""more areas of the flight deck than previously known.""

Boeing did not directly comment on The Wall Street Journal report but said it plans to develop guidelines with Federal Aviation Administration oversight.

""Boeing is working with customers on service bulletins that will be submitted to the FAA for approval"" a Boeing spokesman said.

""The bulletins focus on ensuring a sufficient ground path in the flight deck of affected airplanes"" he added.

Southwest Airlines United Airlines and American Airlines all said last week that they were removing some of their MAX planes from service following the Boeing announcement. Boeing said it notified 16 carriers in all of the issue.

Shares of Boeing fell 1.2 percent to $248.18 losing ground following reports of the problem.

The electrical issue is a setback after the MAX was cleared in November 2020 to return to service after a 20-month grounding following two fatal crashes.

""Specific details regarding investigators' latest findings are scarce at the moment but it's troubling to learn that the electrical defect is being found in other parts of the plane"" said Briefing.com.

The $146bn Chicago-headquartered company holds its annual meeting on Tuesday as it attempts to recover its financial and reputational poise in the wake of the grounding of its 737 Max planes and the pandemic’s upending of the commercial travel market.

Boeing has made changes to the membership and structure of its board since a second 737 Max crashed in Ethiopia in 2019 including seven directors who have already left or are due to step down next week. The changes however have not included two key executives under attack from some family members and shareholders the chairman Larry Kellner and Edmund Giambastiani who heads the board’s safety panel.

“This is a board of private equity and celebrity politicians and failed GE cost-cutting people that are draining the company’s legacy assets for current gain for themselves and the shareholders” said Michael Stumo whose 24-year-old daughter Samya Rose died in the Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crash.

Speaking to the Guardian Stumo said Boeing had fired hundreds of engineers cut corners on quality and used profits to buy back stock options for executives.

“They’re trying to keep up with the Facebooks and the Googles on the stock price rather than using their enormous resources and legacy to make fantastic quality and safe airplanes” Stumo said.

Since the crashes Boeing has added four new members to its board. Kellner the former chief executive of the old US airline Continental said earlier this year that the board would work to identify “diverse candidates with appropriate expertise who bring qualified perspectives”.

Boeing says its slate of 10 directors up for re-election includes two women and two people of color. But recent reports including one in the Wall Street Journal have indicated that the challenges facing Boeing have hindered the company in acquiring new directors.

Fallout from the 737 Max crashes continues to reverberate after a series of congressional hearings unearthed a “culture of concealment” at the company and evidence that the company had ignored clear warnings from engineers that the model’s anti-stall technology was unreliable.

While an official Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) report into the crashes has yet to be issued Boeing has fought an intense PR campaign to win public acceptance of the 737 Max – which it now refers to as the 737-8 – after it went through modifications to achieve re-certification by air safety regulators – whom many believe were sidelined during the plane’s original safety certification.

In the process Boeing has made changes to its board’s oversight of management as part of what the chief executive David Calhoun a board member since 2009 has described as a “top-to-bottom” safety and engineering overhaul.

The changes include a policy calling for an independent chairman and a new committee focused on safety. But proxy advisory firms are divided on whether reforms have gone far enough.

One of those Institutional Shareholder Services has credited Boeing for “significant board and management changes and reforms to the company’s safety and compliance processes” and recommends that investors re-elect the company’s board of directors.

But another proxy-advisory firm Glass Lewis has recommended that shareholders vote against the re-election of Kellner and Giambastiani.

“We believe they are in part responsible for the board’s failings in regard to its risk assessment and management” Glass Lewis wrote in a 26 March report. “We question whether these directors should continue to serve on the company’s board.”

Boeing meanwhile points to the board’s four new directors as evidence of the board’s “deep commitment to refreshing its membership” and says its “highly qualified diverse board” has a mix of experiences needed to oversee the company’s management.

But Stumo maintains that shareholders should force Kellner and Giambastiani out next week.

He said: “We know that instead of doing something after the first crash [Lion Air flight 610] they fired up the public relations team to blame others and made false assertions of safety while collecting their board checks and stock options. Kellner is a private equity guy and failed CEO of Continental and Giambastiani chaired the safety committee which did nothing and was totally asleep at the wheel.”

Negative reports about interactions between Boeing and the FAA continue to proliferate. In an interview with the Seattle Times last month an FAA safety engineer and Boeing veteran Joe Jacobsen who had taken part in the 737 Max’s original certification of the plane’s flight controls said he believes additional upgrades are needed.

Jacobsen also called for the replacement of some of the people at “the highest levels of FAA management”. In its emergency directive after the Lion Air crash he said the agency had failed to warn pilots of potential malfunctions in the 737 Max’s throttle controls that may have contributed to the Ethiopian crash.

While the 737 Max has returned to service – and Boeing has announced new sales of the jet – problems persist. Earlier this month US airlines removed 67 of the planes from schedules after Boeing alerted to a potential electrical problem discovered during assembly of a plane in Seattle.

Shareholders have relatively limited options to push through changes at next week’s meeting. Directors who fail to win 60% of shareholder votes must offer their resignations. If the board does not accept they can continue to serve for a further year. That was the process that secured the retirement of two directors Susan Schwab and Arthur Collins next week.

But investment companies involved in board changes so far including Blackrock Vanguard and State Street have not yet indicated whether they will support or oppose Kellner and Giambastiani.

The remaining directors including Calhoun are what Stumo calls “representatives of Boeing’s erosion and entropy”.

“They stiff-arm whistleblowers and do just enough to meet the lowest possible compliance with FAA rules” says Stumo. “With its enormous assets and implicit government support Boeing could make the most fantastic 21st-century airplanes.

“But it needs someone with true leadership to clean house correct the problems supported by a board with experience in engineering and manufacturing.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzLXBpbG90LWNvbnZlcnNpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can Boeing Pilots Fly Airbus Aircraft?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzLXBpbG90LWNvbnZlcnNpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdWsuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9ib2Vpbmctc3VmZmVycy1tb3JlLWVsZWN0cmljYWwtaXNzdWVzLXdpdGgtNzM3LW1heC0wOTEwMzQzMzEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing suffers more electrical issues with 737 Max,"Suspected grounding problems have since been found in two other places on the flight deck.

An electrical fault that grounded dozens of Boeing (BA) 737 Max jets last week has caused fresh concern after engineers found similar issues elsewhere in the cockpit.

Just days ago the aviation company told 16 of its operators that its most-sold model should not be flown until the “production issue” is addressed.

It said at the time that it was working alongside the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on the issue which does not affect its entire fleet.

Boeing said it was not related to the flight-control system that suspended its planes previously.

However suspected grounding problems have since been found in two other places on the flight deck Reuters reported citing sources close to the matter.

These include the storage rack where the affected control unit is kept and the instrument panel facing the pilots.

Airlines including Southwest American and United said they had taken more than 60 planes out of service following the notice from Boeing last week. The issue is believed to have affected about 90 planes globally.

A Boeing spokeswoman said at the time that it was unclear how long it would take to solve the problem.

The global fleet of in-service 737 Max is currently a total of 176 aircraft according to Cirium fleets data. Those jets are operated by 22 airlines most based in North and South America but with some based in Europe Cirium shows.

The new issues are not related to the design problems that contributed to a 20-month worldwide suspension following two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people.

Lion Air flight JT610 crashed off Indonesia in October 2018. Five months later Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 crashed minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa.

Investigators believe the accidents were triggered by the failure of a single sensor specifically the MCAS software as well as the regulatory oversight failures of the FAA and the lack of training provided to pilots.

Story continues

Boeing is expected to draw up bulletins advising airlines how to fix the problems with the latest grounding or the electrical paths designed to maintain safety in the event of a surge of voltage Reuters said.

The bulletins must first be approved by US regulators.

It comes as Boeing’s total aircraft orders fell by around 800 jets in the last 12 months as the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc on the industry.

According to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) income across the travel sector fell by almost $4.5tn (£3.2tn) last year putting more than 62 million people out of work.

It is pressing for international travel to resume in June to stem further job losses.

Almost no company was hit harder by the coronavirus pandemic than Carnival (CCL -3.29%) the world's biggest cruise line operator.

Unable to facilitate social distancing and dependent on global travel and leisure cruise lines have essentially shut down during the crisis. Even during normal times some detractors regard cruise ships as floating petri dishes and the pandemic has rendered cruises inoperable in much of the world.

The CDC has issued a conditional sail order that has effectively banned cruises in the U.S. and Carnival said in February that it would suspend U.S. sailings at least through May. Meanwhile the broader prohibitions in international travel have also made it difficult to get cruises up and running again elsewhere.

Because of those challenges Carnival stock has plunged during the crisis falling as much 85% last spring. It's still down substantially from the start of 2020 as the chart below shows.

Uncertainty generally translates into opportunity in the stock market. Carnival which owns several other brands including Princess Cunard and Holland America and its cruise line peers continue to face plenty of uncertainty about when cruising can return to normal as virus variants circulate and the vaccine rollout faces a number of obstacles. That's one reason why the stock continues to attract a lot of attention from investors. Let's take a look at some others.

Value value value

Growth stocks were the stars of 2020 but value stocks are now coming back into vogue. The economic reopening should reverse trends from last year normalizing valuations for high-flying tech stocks and propelling beaten-down value stocks back up to their pre-pandemic levels.

Carnival doesn't fit the traditional definition of a value stock as the company is still burning through cash as it awaits safer travel conditions but it was a highly profitable business before the pandemic. Bulls expect those profits to eventually return.

There's no question that its recent financial results have been ugly. In its first quarter of fiscal 2021 which ended on Feb. 28 the company reported a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) loss of $2 billion and a monthly average cash burn of $500 million which it expects to continue into the second quarter.

Carnival also has $1.8 billion in debt maturing over the next four quarters though the company finished the quarter with $11.5 billion in cash and short-term investments giving it sufficient liquidity to survive for several more years even if conditions don't improve.

By contrast in fiscal 2019 before the pandemic Carnival generated $3 billion in net income on $20.8 billion in revenue showing cruise lines are a solidly profitable business model in normal times. Bulls expect the business to eventually return to those levels and therefore see value at the current price down nearly 50% from before the pandemic.

The pent-up demand question

The other cornerstone for the bull case for the stock is that pent-up demand will send Carnival's financial results to above pre-pandemic levels. There's plenty of evidence that people around the world are eager to travel once it's safe to do so. Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel observed in February that hotel bookings had surged in Israel as vaccination rates rose a sign of people traveling to see family or just to get away.

While cruise lines like Carnival may eventually benefit from a pent-up demand as avid cruisers are likely anxious to set sail again the sector will probably be the last one in the travel industry to recover as cruise lines face special challenges around docking in international ports and even reassembling crews. As long as variants are circulating countries may be reluctant to allow foreign cruise ships to dock in their ports.

The early tale of the Diamond Princess a Carnival ship where more than 700 on board contracted coronavirus and the ship was kept at sea for several weeks is a reminder of the risks the company faces as it returns to normal cruising. Another such disaster is likely to scare away many would-be passengers.

The ultimate litmus test

Investing in Carnival is possibly the best way to bet on a global recovery from the coronavirus pandemic itself as the stock's performance has basically been a litmus test for investor psychology around the crisis. Unsurprisingly shares surged in November when Pfizer and BioNTech announced a 95% efficacy rate for their vaccine but pulled back briefly earlier this week when the CDC announced a pause on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

Carnival's recovery can only take place if the pandemic is brought under control. Therefore the stock's prospects are closely linked to news about the virus. Investors should also remember that even if business gets back to normal levels net debt has exploded during the crisis jumping from $11.4 billion at the end of 2019 to $19.8 billion as of its most recent report and the additional interest expense from those borrowings as well as the repayments will be headwinds on the stock.

Carnival stock may eventually recover from the coronavirus pandemic but it could take several years. Even as the U.S. is rapidly deploying vaccines much of the world including Europe is still struggling to do so. Some countries are even experiencing surges in daily cases including India Brazil and Turkey. On a global scale daily case counts are moving higher not lower.

The lesson for Carnival investors at this point is much as it's been for the last year to continue to be patient.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYm5iLWNlby1icmlhbi1jaGVza3ktbmVlZHMtbWlsbGlvbnMtb2YtbmV3LWhvc3RzLWNuYmMtMjAyMS000gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9haXJibmItY2VvLWJyaWFuLWNoZXNreS1uZWVkcy1taWxsaW9ucy1vZi1uZXctaG9zdHMtY25iYy0yMDIxLTQ_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky says site needs millions of new hosts,"Airbnb's CEO on Friday said it needed millions more hosts for the post-pandemic travel boom.

Airbnb will need millions of new hosts to meet demand as the world exits the pandemic CEO Brian Chesky told CNBC on Friday.

""To meet the demand over the coming years we're going to need millions more hosts"" Chesky told the network's Deirdre Bosa on air.

As the world tiptoes out of the pandemic travelers are taking their first steps towards normal vacation routines. Many are wondering if Airbnb accommodations and hotels are safe.

He told CNBC: ""I think that we probably will have a high-class problem where there will probably be more guests coming to Airbnb than we'll have hosts for because ... we think there's going to be a travel rebound coming that's unlike anything we've ever seen.""

Airbnb lists 4 million hosts at present. As of the end of last year they had about 5.6 million active listings in more than 220 countries and regions according to the San Francisco company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Chesky's positive outlook echoed past statements and filings from the company. In a late February filing the company said its listings had remained steady at 5.6 million for the entirety of 2020 despite a decline in bookings because of the pandemic.

The company said: ""While we believe that travel will change as a result of COVID-19 the adaptability of our business suggests that we are well-positioned to serve this dynamic market as it continues to evolve and recover.""

""Similar to '20 when people are returning to travel they are choosing local (in country/close to home driving over flying) and more rural locations…which gives an edge to alternative accommodations"" Nowak said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vVHJhdmVsLU5ld3MvSG90ZWwtTmV3cy9BLWZpcnN0LWxvb2stYXQtdGhlLW5ldy1LYXlhay1Ib3RlbC1NaWFtaS1CZWFjaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A first look at the new Kayak Hotel Miami Beach,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Hotel-News/A-first-look-at-the-new-Kayak-Hotel-Miami-Beach on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vVHJhdmVsLU5ld3MvSG90ZWwtTmV3cy9BLWZpcnN0LWxvb2stYXQtdGhlLW5ldy1LYXlhay1Ib3RlbC1NaWFtaS1CZWFjaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

From slot machines and fitness clubs to record labels and hotel-casinos the Bally brand has been through many iterations over its nearly 90-year history.

The name was first tied to pinball machine manufacturer — and eventual slot machine maker — Bally Manufacturing Corp. in the 1930s and has since been attached to a diverse mix of industries through spinoffs and subsidiaries. Today the brand is controlled by one of the fastest-growing casino and online gaming operators in the country: Bally’s Corp.

The Rhode Island-based company has been aggressively purchasing properties and online gaming companies in recent months to bring its omnichannel vision to life. This year alone it has finalized or agreed to merger and acquisition deals with three companies and two casinos including the Tropicana in Las Vegas.

According to President and CEO George Papanier Bally’s Corp. is just getting started.

“We are confident that Bally’s will not only be a national powerhouse in the online sports betting and iGaming industry but the overall U.S. gaming industry” he told the Review-Journal. “There is no other operator with such a diverse and expansive portfolio or with the same momentum in the marketplace that we’ve achieved.”

Rapid growth

Before there was Bally’s Corp. there was Twin River Worldwide Holdings Inc.

The company launched in March 2004 and its original portfolio included four greyhound tracks and a horseracing track in Rhode Island and Colorado.

By June 2019 the company owned and operated four casino properties with three casino acquisitions in the works. That’s when Truist analyst Barry Jonas first started covering the property.

Back then he said there were “real concerns” about the company.

Wynn Resorts Ltd. was getting ready to launch its Encore Boston Harbor property the summer of 2019 just an hour’s drive from the company’s two Rhode Island casinos.

“At the time that was really the story. How can they respond to this new competition this new multibillion-dollar property?” Jonas said. “The stock was languished. There was a bit of an overhang there.”

But Twin River leaders proved that they were up for the challenge.

The company started making “very smart acquisitions at very attractive prices” Jonas said. Acquisitions are still top of mind for the company: It has 12 casinos in its portfolio across eight states with four more in the works including the Tropicana on the Strip a deal valued at $308 million.

The timing of the pandemic and Eldorado Resort Inc.’s acquisition of Caesars Entertainment Corp. last year was fortuitous for the growth of Bally’s.

The two Nevada-based companies shed several properties to be Federal Trade Commission-compliant ahead of their $17.3 billion merger in July. The companies — now operating as Caesars Entertainment Inc. post-merger — had agreed to sell six properties to Twin River worth a combined $550 million.

“The pool of acquirers was limited. Twin River had a pristine balance sheet and was the only qualified acquirer out there through COVID” Jonas said. “They turned out to be smart acquisitions.”

Bally’s is still keeping its eyes on potential markets for growth. The company is one of three finalists bidding for a gaming license in Richmond Virginia and it could be in play for a downstate New York license according to Jefferies analyst David Katz.

Bally’s “is currently not present in (Michigan) and (Maryland) but appears to be signaling interest in those markets” Katz said in a Tuesday note to investors. “As legalization for mobile wagering accelerates across states (the company’s) interest could extend beyond the four states.”

‘Unbelievable’ M&A

Online sports betting and iGaming growth has been another major focal point for the company.

In just the past four months the company has initiated or closed the acquisitions of daily fantasy sports platform Monkey Knife Fight free-to-play platform SportCaller and online sports betting operator Bet.Works’ technology platform. On Tuesday the company announced that it had agreed to acquire United Kingdom-based online gaming provider Gamesys Group plc in a deal worth $2.8 billion.

Papanier said the recent acquisitions should complement the company’s long-term partnership with Sinclair Broadcast Group a media company that owns and operates 188 local TV stations and 19 regional sports networks.

That deal announced in November gives Bally’s access to local sports fans across the county in return for sports betting and iGaming content. Also Sinclair’s regional sports networks are rebranding as “Bally Sports” replacing Fox Sports regional logos.

Shares of the company have gone up 92 percent since its partnership with Sinclair was announced.

The growth “is really unbelievable” said Marcus Prater executive director of the Association of Gaming Equipment Manufacturers and a former marketing director for Bally Technologies a spinoff of the original Bally Manufacturing Corp.

“I wouldn’t have given this Twin Rivers operation a second thought a couple years ago — and now look at what they’ve done just in the past six months” he added.

Papanier said the company’s focus on operating with little leverage and high liquidity has allowed it to snatch up a large number of assets in a relatively short amount of time.

“We have always been opportunistic yet disciplined in our (merger and acquisition) strategy” he said.

The power behind the name

Bally’s has had an audacious approach to growth but its most significant acquisition was one that didn’t come with any slot machines sports betting licenses or land — just the Bally’s name.

The company purchased the iconic brand from Caesars in October 2020. The sale allowed it to rebrand all of its portfolio properties under the Bally’s name and logo and maintain the Bally’s name for its Atlantic City property which it agreed to purchase from Caesars months prior.

It also gave it a “single prominent brand” under which its physical and online offerings could unite according to its latest annual report.

The name which used to be attached to the world’s largest slot machine manufacturing company is going through a renaissance under its new owner.

Just turn on a sports broadcast; there’s a good chance now that you will catch the Bally’s brand through the company’s recent rebranding deal with Sinclair.

“It’s almost like somebody flipped on a switch and the Bally’s ‘B’ is everywhere now” Prater said. “It’s now truly in the major leagues. … This is a remarkable extension of what is coming up on a 90 year old brand.”

The brand’s reach should only grow from here on now that Bally’s is gearing up to launch its Bally Bet sports app.

“I think the vision is we will be bombarded with Bally’s as consumers and really associate that name with sports betting as well as just general consumption of sports” Jonas said.

Charlie Lombardo a gaming consultant and a former head of slot operations at Bally’s Las Vegas said the name is instantly recognizable for many — especially along the East Coast home of Bally’s Atlantic City.

“The name was always strong” he said. “I think (the recent purchase by the former Twin River) is nothing but upside for the brand.”

Papanier told the Review-Journal that the brand name has “definitely been an integral component” to the company’s success.

It’s “associated with first-in-class properties and amenities so it aligns perfectly with our platform” he said. “Moreover the brand is proving to be extremely important to our growth and diversification strategy.”

It has yet to be seen just how far Bally’s brand will reach across the gaming space. At this point the company’s growth strategy has no end in sight.

“We are always on the hunt for attractive assets that complement our diverse and expanding portfolio” Papanier said. “Our goal is to become the premier truly integrated U.S. omnichannel gaming company with a (business to business to consumer) business model. … The possibilities are endless.”

Bally shares closed up 1.7 percent Friday to $58.78 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Almost all new antibiotics brought to market in recent years are variations of drug classes discovered decades ago according to a WHO report released on Thursday underscoring just how insufficient they may be in tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Drug resistance is driven by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics and other antimicrobials which encourages bacteria to evolve into “superbugs” and find new ways to beat the medicines. Previous studies have estimated AMR will kill tens of millions of people every year after 2050.

Out of the 43 antibiotics in development the WHO said 26 drugs target the 13 most dangerous “superbugs”. But the health agency said most of these antibiotics are derivatives of existing classes which could result in “rapid emergence of drug-resistance.”

The report said the impact of AMR is now most severe in poorer countries and among the very old or very young with an estimated 30% of newborns with sepsis dying from bacterial infections that are resistant to first-line antibiotics.

“The persistent failure to develop manufacture and distribute effective new antibiotics is further fueling the impact of antimicrobial resistance and threatens our ability to successfully treat bacterial infections” said Dr. Hanan Balkhy WHO Assistant Director General.

The 2020 annual report reveals a near “static” pipeline the WHO said as few antibiotics have been approved by regulatory agencies in recent years and with big pharma companies losing interest in antibiotics development as it is not seen as profitable.

Large drugmakers Novartis Bristol Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca Plc have abandoned development of their antibiotic programs in the past few months.

However for the first time the agency has included an overview of non-traditional therapies to weaken bacteria including bacteria-eating viruses called bacteriophages and immune therapies.",,,,,,

On May 17 1954 the nine justices unanimously ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that schools segregated by race did not provide an equal education. Students could no longer be barred from a school because of the color of their skin. To commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Brown decision I wanted to look at how far we’ve come in integrating our schools and how far we still have to go.

Two sociologists Sean Reardon at Stanford University and Ann Owens at the University of Southern California have teamed up to analyze both historical and recent trends. Reardon and Owens were slated to present their analysis at a Stanford University conference on May 6 and they shared their presentation with me in advance. They also expect to launch a new website to display segregation trends for individual school districts around the country.

Here are five takeaways from their work:

The long view shows progress but a worrying uptick especially in big cities

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

Not much changed for almost 15 years after the Brown decision. Although Black students had the right to attend another school the onus was on their families to demand a seat and figure out how to get their child to the school. Many schools remained entirely Black or entirely white.

Desegregation began in earnest in 1968 with a series of court orders beginning with Virginia’s New Kent County schools. That year the Supreme Court required the county to abolish its separate Black and white schools and students were reassigned to different schools to integrate them.

This graph above produced by Reardon and Owens shows how segregation plummeted across the country between 1968 and 1973. The researchers focused on roughly 500 larger school districts where there were at least 2500 Black students. That captures nearly two-thirds of all Black students in the nation and avoids clouding the analysis with thousands of small districts of mostly white residents.

Reardon’s and Owens’s measurement of segregation compares classmates of the average white student with the classmates of the average Black student. For example in North Carolina’s Charlotte-Mecklenburg district the average white student in 1968 attended a school where 90 percent of his peers were white and only 10 percent were Black. The average Black student attended a school where 76 percent of his peers were Black and 24 percent were white. Reardon and Owens then calculated the gap in exposure to each race. White students had 90 percent white classmates while Black students had 24 percent white classmates. The difference was 66 percentage points. On the flip side Black students had 76 percent Black classmates while white students had 10 percent Black classmates. Again the difference was 66 percentage points which translates to 0.66 on the segregation index.

But in 1973 after court-ordered desegregation went into effect the average white student attended a school that was 69 percent white and 31 percent Black. The average Black student attended a school that was 34 percent Black and 66 percent white. In five short years the racial exposure gap fell from 66 percentage points to 3 percentage points. Schools reflected Charlotte-Mecklenberg’s demographics. In the graph above Reardon and Owens averaged the segregation index figures for all 533 districts with substantial Black populations. That’s what each dot represents.

In the early 1990s this measure of segregation began to creep up again as depicted by the red tail in the graph above. Owens calls it a “slow and steady uptick” in contrast to the drastic decline in segregation after 1968. Segregation has not bounced back or returned to pre-Brown levels. “There’s a misconception that segregation is worse than ever” Reardon said.

Although the red line from 1990 to the present looks nearly flat when you zoom in on it you can see that Black-white segregation grew by 25 percent between 1991 and 2019. During the pandemic segregation declined slightly again.

Detailed view of the red line segment in the chart above “Average White-Black Segregation 1968-2022.” Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

It’s important to emphasize that these Black-white segregation levels are tiny compared with the degree of segregation in the late 1960s. A 25 percent increase can seem like a lot but it’s less than 4 percentage points.

“It’s big enough that it makes me worried” said Owens. “Now is the moment to keep an eye on this. If it continues in this direction it would take a long time to get back up to Brown. But let’s not let it keep going up.”

Even more troubling is the fact that segregation increased substantially if you zero in on the nation’s biggest cities. White-Black segregation in the largest 100 school districts increased by 64 percent from 1988 to 2019 Owens and Reardon calculated.

School choice plays a role in recent segregation

Why is segregation creeping back up again?

The expiration of court orders that mandated school integration and the expansion of school choice policies including the rapid growth of charter schools explains all of the increase in segregation from 2000 onward said Reardon. Over 200 medium-sized and large districts were released from desegregation court orders from 1991 to 2009 and racial school segregation in these districts gradually increased in the years afterward.

School choice however appears to be the dominant force. More than half of the increase in segregation in the 2000s can be attributed to the rise of charter schools whose numbers began to increase rapidly in the late 1990s. In many cases either white or Black families flocked to different charter schools leaving behind a less diverse student body in traditional public schools.

The reason for the rise in segregation in the 1990s before the number of charter schools soared is harder to understand. Owens speculates that other school choice policies such as the option to attend any public school within a district or the creation of new magnet schools may have played a role but she doesn’t have the data to prove that. White gentrification of cities in the 1990s could also be a factor she said as the white newcomers favored a small set of schools or sent their children to private schools.

“We might just be catching a moment where there’s been an influx of one group before the other group leaves” said Owens. “It’s hard to say how the numbers will look 10 years from now.”

It’s important to disentangle demographic shifts from segregation increases

There’s a popular narrative that segregation has increased because Black students are more likely to attend school with other students who are not white especially Hispanic students. But Reardon and Owens say this analysis conflates demographic shifts in the U.S. population with segregation. The share of Hispanic students in U.S. schools now approaches 30 percent and everyone is attending schools with more Hispanic classmates. White students who used to represent 85 percent of the U.S. student population in 1970 now make up less than half.

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

The blue line in the graph above shows how the classmates of the average Black Hispanic or Native American student have increased from about 55 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students in the early 1970s to nearly 80 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students today. That means that the average student who is not white is attending a school that is overwhelmingly made up of students who are not white.

But look at how the red line which depicts white students is following the same path. The average white student is attending a school that moved from 35 percent students who are not white in the 1970s to nearly 70 percent students who are not white today. “It’s entirely driven by Hispanic students” said Owens. “Even the ‘white’ schools in L.A. are 40 percent Hispanic.”

I dug into U.S. Department of Education data to show how extremely segregated schools have become less common. The percentage of Black students attending a school that is 90 percent or more Black fell from 23 percent in 2000 to 10 percent in 2022. Only 1 in 10 Black students attends an all-Black or a nearly all-Black school. Meanwhile the percentage of white students attending a school that is 90 percent or more white fell from 44 percent to 14 percent during this same time period. That’s 1 in 7. Far fewer Black or white students are learning in schools that are almost entirely made up of students of their same race.

At the same time the percentage of Black students attending a school where 90 percent of students are not white grew from 37 percent in 2000 to 40 percent in 2022. But notice the sharp growth of Hispanic students during this period. They went from 7.6 million (fewer than the number of Black students) to more than 13.9 million (almost double the number of Black students).

Most segregation falls across school district boundaries

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

This bar chart shows how schools are segregated for two reasons. One is that people of different races live on opposite sides of school district lines. Detroit is an extreme example. The city schools are dominated by Black students. Meanwhile the Detroit suburbs which operate independent school systems are dominated by white students. Almost all the segregation is because people of different races live in different districts. Meanwhile in the Charlotte North Carolina metropolitan area over half of the segregation reflects the uneven distribution of students within school districts.

Nationally 60 percent of the segregation occurs because of the Detroit scenario: people live across administrative borders Reardon and Owens calculated. Still 40 percent of current segregation is within administrative borders that policymakers can control.

Residential segregation is decreasing

People often say there’s little that can be done about school segregation until we integrate neighborhoods. I was surprised to learn that residential segregation has been declining over the past 30 years according to Reardon’s and Owens’s analysis of census tracts. More Black and white people live in proximity to each other. And yet at the same time school segregation is getting worse.

All this matters Reardon said because kids are learning at different rates in more segregated systems. “We know that more integrated schools provide more equal educational opportunities” he said. “The things we’re doing with our school systems are making segregation worse.”

Reardon recommends more reforms to housing policy to integrate neighborhoods and more “guard rails” on school choice systems so that they cannot be allowed to produce highly segregated schools.

This Is Us aired on NBC from Sept. 2016 to May 2022. The family drama centered on the lives of siblings Kevin (Justin Hartley) Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Randall (Brown) and their parents Rebecca (Moore) and Jack (Milo Ventimiglia). The series used multiple timelines showing stories that took place in the present as well as flashbacks to the siblings’ childhood and flash-forwards to later years.

The NBC drama earned numerous accolades throughout its run. It received 39 Emmy nominations winning four. Additionally it also received the Television Academy Honors Award in 2017.

The trio tells PEOPLE they've already recorded episodes with show creator Dan Fogelman as well as Susan Kelechi Watson who played Randall's wife Beth Pearson. They also have plans to welcome Hartley and Jon Huertas (Miguel Rivas) as guests on the podcast.

The podcast — which PEOPLE can exclusively debut its new trailer — will also feature an emotional support hotline for fans to call and share their thoughts about the show and its impact.

Brown 48 says knowing how much the show has meant to people and continues to resonate is ""incredibly gratifying.""

""While the show was incredibly timely when it was on the air it also has a certain sense of timelessness. So whenever folks come to it it can’t help but move you"" he says.

Sullivan 43 echoes his costar noting ""The themes of this show are eternal and they are presented in a way that allows the audience to explore these subjects within themselves and gives them the context to discuss these topics with the people they love. The show is about connection providing its audience with the opportunity to connect.""

Moore who has since welcomed two little boys of her own says she's particularly excited to now rewatch the series from a mother's perspective.

""It’s been such a thrill to rewatch this series. The cast and the writers are just so incredibly talented that each episode has copious amounts of takeaways"" she explains. ""There’s obviously a lot of excitement in reigniting conversations that meant a lot to fans as well as excitement in reuniting and reminiscing.""

""But what I’m seeing as we rewatch is that my viewing perspective has shifted and it’s like watching it all unfold for the first time"" she notes. ""It’s been eight years since This Is Us premiered and I’ve lived a lot of life since then. I’m now a mom with two little boys and so I’m excited to rewatch all the episodes and rediscover the stories from a new perspective.""

Another special moment for the cast has been revisiting episodes of their costars who are no longer alive and honoring their legacy. (Ron Cephas Jones who played Randall's biological father William Hill died in August 2023 at age 66.)

""We try to honor Ron at every turn. Rewatching his performance is an education on acting and humanity. He is one of the most self-realized people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing"" says Sullivan.

""Oh boy it’s gonna hit hard! I can’t tell you exactly how I’ll react but it’ll be powerful. It was powerful shooting it and powerful watching it the first time"" adds Brown. ""I don’t anticipate it being any different.""

Ron Cephas Jones as William Hill on 'This Is Us'.

Ultimately the cast is just looking forward to fans finally being able to hear their new project and reigniting the bond they had for so long during the NBC hit's six-season run.

""It’s human nature for us as a society to seek connection and This Is Us connects people all around the world with the storylines themes and topics that are presented in every episode"" says Moore. ""Fans continue to watch and rewatch sharing what This Is Us means to them how it helped them navigate life differently not feel alone and even heal from trauma.

Brown had a winding journey to the NFL. A Florida kid who played his college ball in the MAC at Central Michigan becoming a sixth round pick of the 2010 NFL Draft. Scouts questioned his level of competition his slight frame his 4.57 40-yard Combine time.

Pittsburgh took the chance on him late in the draft. He found the end zone on his first regular season touch taking a reverse for a touchdown on a kickoff against the Tennessee Titans. His role as a receiver was limited in the early goings but he made his name known in his debut playoff game. Tied 24-apiece against the Baltimore Ravens Brown made a 58-yard helmet catch down the right sideline on a 3rd and 19 heave from Ben Roethlisberger setting up the game-winning touchdown.

From there his career took off. He finished second on the team in receptions yards and touchdowns in 2011. His breakout year came in 2013 leading the team with 110 receptions for 1499 yards and eight touchdowns. His numbers became video-game like in 2014 leading the NFL in receptions (129) and yards (1698) and in his prime was essentially uncoverable. For six straight seasons he posted at least 100 receptions 1200 yards and eight touchdowns. In NFL history no one else has done it more than four times consecutive or not.

In his now famous interview with The Pivot in 2022 Mike Tomlin acknowledged Brown would never play for the Steelers again but spoke well of him.

“We had nine great years” Tomlin told Ryan Clark Fred Taylor and Channing Crowder. “I appreciate that dude in ways that I can’t explain to y’all that I won’t even bother to attempt to explain to y’all because it sounds like I’m defending him in some way…the nature of our relationship and what we all did together requires no defense.”

The feeling seems mutual.

“That guy Mike Tomlin always had my back always believed in me” Brown said. “So I’m always indebted to Mike Tomlin. He was one of those guys that’s stood in the foxhole for me. And that meant a lot to me.”

But Brown eventually felt like his time was up in Pittsburgh and he made a loud exit forcing the team to trade him. Brown hasn’t said he regrets the move telling Whitlock he was chasing a Super Bowl ring he eventually received with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. But had Brown stayed with Tomlin he might’ve gone down as the greatest receiver in NFL history. Instead he’ll be remembered for as much what he did off the field than on it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NsaXZlLmNvbS93b3JjZXN0ZXIvMjAyNC8wNS90aGlzLWlzLXdoeS1zb21lLXRhcC13YXRlci1pcy1icm93bi1pbi13b3JjZXN0ZXIuaHRtbNIBb2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NsaXZlLmNvbS93b3JjZXN0ZXIvMjAyNC8wNS90aGlzLWlzLXdoeS1zb21lLXRhcC13YXRlci1pcy1icm93bi1pbi13b3JjZXN0ZXIuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This is why some tap water is brown in Worcester,"A water main break at the intersection of Grafton and Maranda streets in Worcester on Tuesday turned some residents’ tap water brown.

Residents who live near the intersection and by Grafton Street posted to Reddit Tuesday afternoon that their tap water had turned brown with some asking whether the water was safe to drink.

Thomas Matthews a spokesman for Worcester City Manager Eric Batista told MassLive the reason for the brown water was a 16-inch water main break at 725 Grafton St. that happened at 2 a.m. Tuesday. According to Matthews the water main break resulted in some nearby residents having rusty water giving it a brown color.

“Residents are advised that the water is not harmful and encouraged to run their cold water in a tub for about 10 minutes to help clear it up as crews work to make a repair” Matthews said.

The water main break closed both sides of Grafton Street at Valmor Street according to the Worcester Police Department. In a post on X the department advised drivers to find another route.

Matthews told MassLive that the pipe had been turned off since it was broken and repairs to the main were underway as of Tuesday afternoon.

According to a document created by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection the main reason for tap water having a brown yellow orange or red color is because of rust.

“Rusty water occurs from sediment in the pipes or rust from the inside walls of the water mains” the document reads. “The rust can be disturbed and temporarily suspended in water with unusual water flows from water main breaks or maintenance or by flushing of a hydrant.”

Even though the color of the water may look different the MassDEP states that having rusty water is not dangerous to drink compared to water filled with bacteria or lead.

Water main breaks in Worcester have happened before. On Feb. 4 2023 water from a broken pipe flooded into an apartment building on 425 Pleasant St. The owner of the apartment the Worcester Housing Authority said the flooding resulted in “catastrophic damage to the building’s electrical fire alarm and sprinkler systems.” Nearly 250 residents were evacuated from the building and found shelter in hotels during the three-month repair process."

However electrical systems simulation is not confined strictly to calculating voltages and currents. Other physical simulations specifically heat transfer are equally as important to system verification.

Recognizing the value of simulating a PCB’s physical environment Cadence is making moves to expand its software suite.

The company made headlines this week when it acquired Pointwise a multi-physics simulation company that specializes in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This announcement follows Cadence's February acquisition of NUMECA another company Cadence hopes will expand its ""Intelligent System Design"" strategy with CFD system analysis solutions.

Complexity of Heat Transfer in Electronics

As a result of scaling electronics thermal management in electrical systems has become a central design focus for engineers.

Unfortunately heat transfer is not simple to model: a standard PCB has multiple ICs and discrete components dissipating heat independent from one another. Airflow from both the environment and fans needs to be accounted for.

As a result heat transfer becomes an extremely computationally expensive multi-physics problem.

Thermal modeling of a PCB can be very computationally expensive. Image used courtesy of Cadence

Trying to approach these simulations via a finite element of finite-difference analysis for an entire PCB would generally require a large amount of time. It is not uncommon for simulations of this sort to take hours to complete—meaning less time designing and money wasted.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)

Fortunately heat transfer on PCBs can be modeled as a CFD problem—a process that is less computationally expensive than FEM analysis.

CFD is a classical multi-physics problem in which multiple physical phenomena have feedback among one another. The process flow for CFD modeling and simulation starts with determining heat sources in the system modeling that heat conduction into the surrounding environment and finally modeling the heat transfer caused by airflow.

Determining heat sources is a straightforward process; heat is estimated based on expected power dissipation given their currents voltages and resistance values. For example one would use Ohm’s law to predict the heat of a resistor. Once the heat sources are known and defined the engineer can use CFD analysis to develop an electrothermal model of the system.

From there he or she can use a reduced state space approximation to efficiently simulate.

Cadence's CFD Strategy

Pointwise’s software isn’t explicitly aimed at PCB thermal modeling but it's possible that this feature was one of the values Cadence saw in Pointwise's CFD portfolio—especially in the context of the company's NUMECA acquisition.

Pointwise’s technology is said to leverage a proprietary mesh generation technique that creates multiple mesh types to provide a level of control ensuring converged and accurate CFD results. Mainly focused on the aerospace industry Pointwise develops software that has been previously used for wind tunnel experimentation and high-fidelity discretization of aircraft.

This technology will likely find its home in similar systems where thermal modeling is even more complex—perhaps even estimating a PCB's airflow in a rocket.",,,,,,,,,,,,

From slot machines and fitness clubs to record labels and hotel-casinos the Bally brand has been through many iterations over its nearly 90-year history.

The name was first tied to pinball machine manufacturer — and eventual slot machine maker — Bally Manufacturing Corp. in the 1930s and has since been attached to a diverse mix of industries through spinoffs and subsidiaries. Today the brand is controlled by one of the fastest-growing casino and online gaming operators in the country: Bally’s Corp.

The Rhode Island-based company has been aggressively purchasing properties and online gaming companies in recent months to bring its omnichannel vision to life. This year alone it has finalized or agreed to merger and acquisition deals with three companies and two casinos including the Tropicana in Las Vegas.

According to President and CEO George Papanier Bally’s Corp. is just getting started.

“We are confident that Bally’s will not only be a national powerhouse in the online sports betting and iGaming industry but the overall U.S. gaming industry” he told the Review-Journal. “There is no other operator with such a diverse and expansive portfolio or with the same momentum in the marketplace that we’ve achieved.”

Rapid growth

Before there was Bally’s Corp. there was Twin River Worldwide Holdings Inc.

The company launched in March 2004 and its original portfolio included four greyhound tracks and a horseracing track in Rhode Island and Colorado.

By June 2019 the company owned and operated four casino properties with three casino acquisitions in the works. That’s when Truist analyst Barry Jonas first started covering the property.

Back then he said there were “real concerns” about the company.

Wynn Resorts Ltd. was getting ready to launch its Encore Boston Harbor property the summer of 2019 just an hour’s drive from the company’s two Rhode Island casinos.

“At the time that was really the story. How can they respond to this new competition this new multibillion-dollar property?” Jonas said. “The stock was languished. There was a bit of an overhang there.”

But Twin River leaders proved that they were up for the challenge.

The company started making “very smart acquisitions at very attractive prices” Jonas said. Acquisitions are still top of mind for the company: It has 12 casinos in its portfolio across eight states with four more in the works including the Tropicana on the Strip a deal valued at $308 million.

The timing of the pandemic and Eldorado Resort Inc.’s acquisition of Caesars Entertainment Corp. last year was fortuitous for the growth of Bally’s.

The two Nevada-based companies shed several properties to be Federal Trade Commission-compliant ahead of their $17.3 billion merger in July. The companies — now operating as Caesars Entertainment Inc. post-merger — had agreed to sell six properties to Twin River worth a combined $550 million.

“The pool of acquirers was limited. Twin River had a pristine balance sheet and was the only qualified acquirer out there through COVID” Jonas said. “They turned out to be smart acquisitions.”

Bally’s is still keeping its eyes on potential markets for growth. The company is one of three finalists bidding for a gaming license in Richmond Virginia and it could be in play for a downstate New York license according to Jefferies analyst David Katz.

Bally’s “is currently not present in (Michigan) and (Maryland) but appears to be signaling interest in those markets” Katz said in a Tuesday note to investors. “As legalization for mobile wagering accelerates across states (the company’s) interest could extend beyond the four states.”

‘Unbelievable’ M&A

Online sports betting and iGaming growth has been another major focal point for the company.

In just the past four months the company has initiated or closed the acquisitions of daily fantasy sports platform Monkey Knife Fight free-to-play platform SportCaller and online sports betting operator Bet.Works’ technology platform. On Tuesday the company announced that it had agreed to acquire United Kingdom-based online gaming provider Gamesys Group plc in a deal worth $2.8 billion.

Papanier said the recent acquisitions should complement the company’s long-term partnership with Sinclair Broadcast Group a media company that owns and operates 188 local TV stations and 19 regional sports networks.

That deal announced in November gives Bally’s access to local sports fans across the county in return for sports betting and iGaming content. Also Sinclair’s regional sports networks are rebranding as “Bally Sports” replacing Fox Sports regional logos.

Shares of the company have gone up 92 percent since its partnership with Sinclair was announced.

The growth “is really unbelievable” said Marcus Prater executive director of the Association of Gaming Equipment Manufacturers and a former marketing director for Bally Technologies a spinoff of the original Bally Manufacturing Corp.

“I wouldn’t have given this Twin Rivers operation a second thought a couple years ago — and now look at what they’ve done just in the past six months” he added.

Papanier said the company’s focus on operating with little leverage and high liquidity has allowed it to snatch up a large number of assets in a relatively short amount of time.

“We have always been opportunistic yet disciplined in our (merger and acquisition) strategy” he said.

The power behind the name

Bally’s has had an audacious approach to growth but its most significant acquisition was one that didn’t come with any slot machines sports betting licenses or land — just the Bally’s name.

The company purchased the iconic brand from Caesars in October 2020. The sale allowed it to rebrand all of its portfolio properties under the Bally’s name and logo and maintain the Bally’s name for its Atlantic City property which it agreed to purchase from Caesars months prior.

It also gave it a “single prominent brand” under which its physical and online offerings could unite according to its latest annual report.

The name which used to be attached to the world’s largest slot machine manufacturing company is going through a renaissance under its new owner.

Just turn on a sports broadcast; there’s a good chance now that you will catch the Bally’s brand through the company’s recent rebranding deal with Sinclair.

“It’s almost like somebody flipped on a switch and the Bally’s ‘B’ is everywhere now” Prater said. “It’s now truly in the major leagues. … This is a remarkable extension of what is coming up on a 90 year old brand.”

The brand’s reach should only grow from here on now that Bally’s is gearing up to launch its Bally Bet sports app.

“I think the vision is we will be bombarded with Bally’s as consumers and really associate that name with sports betting as well as just general consumption of sports” Jonas said.

Charlie Lombardo a gaming consultant and a former head of slot operations at Bally’s Las Vegas said the name is instantly recognizable for many — especially along the East Coast home of Bally’s Atlantic City.

“The name was always strong” he said. “I think (the recent purchase by the former Twin River) is nothing but upside for the brand.”

Papanier told the Review-Journal that the brand name has “definitely been an integral component” to the company’s success.

It’s “associated with first-in-class properties and amenities so it aligns perfectly with our platform” he said. “Moreover the brand is proving to be extremely important to our growth and diversification strategy.”

It has yet to be seen just how far Bally’s brand will reach across the gaming space. At this point the company’s growth strategy has no end in sight.

“We are always on the hunt for attractive assets that complement our diverse and expanding portfolio” Papanier said. “Our goal is to become the premier truly integrated U.S. omnichannel gaming company with a (business to business to consumer) business model. … The possibilities are endless.”

Bally shares closed up 1.7 percent Friday to $58.78 on the New York Stock Exchange.

STORYLINES

Gafford winning over teammates with defensive playmaking

When the Wizards acquired Daniel Gafford from the Bulls in a three-team deal with Chicago and Boston general manager Tommy Sheppard and head coach Scott Brooks praised his ability to cover lots of ground defend the rim with elite athleticism and bring a dynamic element to the Wizards’ defense they had not seen in years. As Gafford grows more comfortable and sees his role expanding those aspects of his game are beginning to manifest – and its translating to team success. Gafford played the final 8:15 of the Wizards’ win on Friday including all five minutes of overtime recording three of his four blocks in that time.

“He was super active” Bradley Beal said postgame. “I know he was dead tired. We all were tired. He kept meeting those big guys at the rim. He kept battling with Steven (Adams) on the boards too. He had his work cut out but he stood his ground for sure. There were some big guys up there but he did his job standing his ground trying to make them finish over him and they couldn’t do it.”

“I think it was amazing” Russell Westbrook said of Gafford’s performance. “A lot of times we didn’t convert but we got so many stops down the stretch which was big…it just shows you over the course of this season when we’re able to put our minds to it we can defend with the game on the line and tonight we did a good job of that.”

Wizards keeping an eye on standings with play-in race tightening

With the Wizards’ wins mounting as the league enters the final month of the regular season the postseason picture is becoming clearer. Washington (22-33) has won three straight and five of the last six games to move into a tie for the all-important 10th place in the Eastern Conference with Toronto (23-34) and Chicago (22-33). New this season seeds 7-10 will take part in a three-day play-in series to determine the seventh and eighth seeds. While the Wizards have found their stride the Bulls have lost five consecutive games and 11 of their last 14. The Raptors have won two straight. After Friday’s win over the Pelicans Brooks and Beal both acknowledged they will be keeping an eye on standings as the postseason race progresses over the final month of the season.

“You know me I’m always eyeballing it” Beal said. “I know we were one game behind the play-in coming into (Friday’s win). I want to see if we can squeeze a little further. It’s tough with these games counting down but I think if we can put a nice little run together we can give ourselves a chance.”

Washington looks to avenge early-April loss to Detroit",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlbnRhbC1jYXItdGlwLXViZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How I saved nearly $250 on a one-day car rental by taking a $110 Uber ride,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here.

It's no secret there's a massive rental car shortage right now.

So I can't say I was completely surprised when I went to book a car back to Philadelphia after visiting family in Dayton OH last week and my search on Kayak returned prices starting (starting!) at a whopping $460 for a one-day economy vehicle rental.

I had already been in Ohio for three weeks after a one-week extension thanks to a last-minute opening to get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and needed to get home and had too much stuff (re: three weeks' worth of baked goods from my mom clean-out-the-closet junk an overstuffed suitcase and my pup Ruby) to get on a plane which probably would have been cheaper.

Thus I began my quest for a way home that wouldn't set me back almost $500.

Securing a car out of Dayton was out of the question. One-way rentals — available only at the Dayton International Airport (DAY) — were too astronomically priced to justify a mere eight hours of use. I figured I might have better luck in a larger market so I shifted my focus to the next closest major city that would take me in the same direction as my final destination -- Columbus OH. Sure enough cars were pricing out for a fraction of the cost. And by fraction I mean only $120 — $340 cheaper than the options in Dayton.

But before I could book I had to solve for one last issue: how to get the 70+ miles from my mom's house to the rental office in downtown Columbus. Despite the distance I priced out an Uber out of curiosity and found my solution. The fare was only $95 after applying the up to $15 monthly Uber credit from The Platinum Card® from American Express (enrollment required for benefit). Plus a $20 tip for the driver that I paid for with the twenty my mom slipped me on the way out (thanks Mom!).

That meant instead of spending $460 for a one-way rental out of Dayton I was able to reserve a car for only $120 out of Columbus plus $95 for the Uber to get there saving me $245 in the end. Not bad if you're willing to do a little schlepping.

To pay for the reservation I used my Chase Sapphire Reserve to take advantage of the rental protection.

Bottom line

The rental car shortage is very real especially if you are starting from a limited market like I was and don't have much flexibility in terms of dates and/or are making a close-in reservation.

That said there are workarounds if you're willing to get creative. Consider larger markets nearby and using alternative modes of transportation such as Uber to get there.

But their feats almost paled in comparison to the one player who scored the first goal of his career in the top-ranked Maryland men’s lacrosse team’s 18-8 throttling of No. 12 Ohio State Sunday evening before an announced at Maryland Stadium.

Sophomore goalkeeper Logan McNaney’s 60-yard bomb with the Terps down two men because of simultaneous penalties in the third quarter highlighted their first 9-0 start since 1987 and their fifth Big Ten regular-season championship in six years.

It also was part of a streak of seven unanswered goals bridging the second and third quarters for Maryland which has registered at least a 6-0 run in every game this spring.

“It was pretty cool” McNaney said almost nonchalantly.

With senior short-stick defensive midfielder Roman Pugliese serving a penalty for cross checking and junior defenseman Brett Makar flagged for tripping the Buckeyes had a six-on-four extra-man opportunity for one minute with 13:32 left in the third quarter. But McNaney turned aside a shot (one of his game-high 12) by senior midfielder Griffin Hughes and the Terps backed up the shot to regain possession.

With Ohio State employing a 10-man ride to try to force a turnover McNaney collected a pass from senior defenseman Nick Grill carried the ball a few strides and then launched a shot from the 30-yard line of Capital One Field that sailed over graduate student goalie Alec Van de Bovenkamp and bounced once into an empty net that Van de Bovenkamp had just vacated stationed at the 10-yard line on the opposite end of the field.

“We just recognized they were in a 10-man ride” said McNaney who said he had not scored a goal since he was “seven or eight.” “I was taking space and then the goalie came out. … I saw the goal open. Just decided to shoot and it went in.”

McNaney’s goal triggered a celebration among the Maryland players on the field and those on the sideline.

“I don’t think I’ve ever heard a 20-year-old scream like a 3-year-old but that was a first” senior midfielder Bubba Fairman quipped. “It was awesome. I think you could tell with our guys running onto the field how much that meant to us. And it gave us a lot of momentum. We practice 10-man all the time. So for our goalie to go out there and score and make the right play it was phenomenal.”

Maryland’s Jared Bernhardt leaps into Ohio State goalie Alec Van de Bovenkamp during a game Sunday in College.

McNaney’s goal was one of at least four that the Terps scored against the Buckeyes when they went to a 10-man ride. Coach John Tillman said the team spends a considerable amount of time in practices dissecting how to attack 10-man rides.

“We know that there are certain teams that if you’re not successful against it they’re going to do it all game long” he said. “So you’ve got to be prepared. We try to be aggressive and that’s usually something we talk about with the guys. Don’t be afraid to shoot the ball. When the goalie’s out and sometimes when they match it up the way that it is the only person open is the goalie. So you’ve got to make sure you back it up and you’ve got to make sure it gets there. Luckily I’m not sure it was the fastest goal ever but it got there. It was really good awareness by him.”

Maryland got its customary splendid performance from Bernhardt who did not register a point in the first quarter as Ohio State sent two defenders and sometimes three after him. But he scored three consecutive goals in a 2:13 span in the second quarter to remind observers of his impact on a game.

“Jared just makes so many different plays in transition” Tillman said. “So he’s going to get his opportunities and he always has the green light and we always trust him. So a lot of times for us it’s just ‘Hey let’s make sure he touches it.’ He’ll make the right decision. If they help too much he’ll move it. If they don’t respect him he’ll take it to the goal. So it’s certainly nice to have a guy like that on our side.”

If there appeared to be one note of concern injuries took a toll on redshirt senior attackman Logan Wisnauskas and junior long-stick midfielder John Geppert. Wisnauskas twisted his left ankle on Buckeyes freshman short-stick defensive midfielder Connor Cmiel’s left foot while backpedaling with 3:41 left in the second quarter and Geppert needed assistance walking off the field with 9:57 left in the fourth.

Tillman said Geppert was bothered by cramps and pointed out that Wisnauskas returned in the second quarter and played in the second half.

Graduate student attackman Tre Leclaire paced Ohio State (4-5 overall and in the Big Ten) with two goals and one assist but he also committed three turnovers while being shadowed by Grill. The loss matched the Buckeyes’ most lopsided of the season but Fairman would not go as far as calling that the Terps’ most complete game of the year.

“I think we put a lot of pieces together. I think we have a lot of work to do” he said. “I think in the middle of the field this was definitely our most complete game. Our defense played phenomenal too and our goalie had a goal and a ton of saves. I think offensively we can still work on a lot and get better. It’s not about who peaks now. It’s about who peaks at the end of the season. So we’re just going to keep working on the things we need to so that we can make sure we play complete games for the rest of the year.”

Regular-season finale

NO. 1 MARYLAND@JOHNS HOPKINS

Saturday 2 p.m.

TV: ESPNU",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25tLXN0YXRlLXdpcmUtZ292ZXJubWVudC1hbmQtcG9saXRpY3Mtam91cm5hbGlzbS1yaW90cy03MDE5MjgyM2YzNTM4MGI4NjBiNmYyNzA4OTA0YmM1Y9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Some Jan. 6 defendants try to use journalism as riot defense,"The Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in January created a trove of self-incriminating evidence thoroughly documenting their actions and words in videos and social media posts. Now some of the camera-toting people in the crowd are claiming they were only there to record history as journalists not to join a deadly insurrection.

It’s unlikely that any of the self-proclaimed journalists can mount a viable defense on the First Amendment’s free speech grounds experts say. They face long odds if video captured them acting more like rioters than impartial observers. But as the internet has broadened and blurred the definition of a journalist some appear intent on trying.

At least eight defendants charged in the Jan. 6 riot have identified themselves as a journalist or a documentary filmmaker including three people arrested this month according to an Associated Press review of court records in nearly 400 federal cases.

The insurrection led to the deaths of five people including a police officer and there were hundreds of injuries. Some rioters manhandled and menaced the reporters and photographers who are credentialed to cover Congress and were trying to cover the mayhem that day. A group of AP journalists had photographic equipment stolen and destroyed outside the building.

One defendant Shawn Witzemann told authorities he was inside the Capitol during the riot as part of his work in livestreaming video at protests and has since argued that he was there as a journalist. That explanation did not sway the FBI. The plumber from Farmington New Mexico is charged with joining in demonstrating in the Capitol while Congress was certifying Joe Biden’s electoral victory over Donald Trump.

“I seek truth. I speak to sources. I document. I provide commentary. It’s everything that a journalist is” Witzemann told a New Mexico television station after his arrest April 6. He did not respond to a social media message and email from the AP.

Witzemann’s nightly news show is titled the “Armenian Council for Truth in Journalism” — satirically his attorney says. On its YouTube page which has just over 300 subscribers the show says it “delivers irreverent and thought provoking commentary and analysis on an eclectic range of subjects.”

Another defendant works for Infowars the right-wing website operated by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Others have fringe platforms named “Political Trance Tribune” “Insurgence USA” “Thunderdome TV” and “Murder the Media News.”

But while the internet has given more people a platform to use their voice the definition of a “journalist” is not that broad when put into practice in court said Lucy Dalglish dean of the University of Maryland’s Philip Merrill College of Journalism who used to practice media law as an attorney.

She said it is an easy case to make that Capitol riot defendants were not journalists because reporters and photographers must have credentials to work there. She said any defendant captured on video encouraging rioters cannot credibly claim to be a journalist.

“You are at that point an activist with a cellphone and there were a lot of activists with copyrighted videos who sold them to news organizations” Dalglish said. “That doesn’t make them journalists.”

Even credentialed reporters and news photographers are not immune from prosecution if they break a law on the job said Jane Kirtley who teaches media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota.

“It’s not a get-out-of-jail-free card” Kirtley said.

Samuel Montoya an Infowars video editor was arrested Tuesday in Texas on charges including impeding passage through the Capitol grounds. Montoya spoke on an Infowars show about witnessing a police officer shoot and kill a woman inside the Capitol.

Montoya also recorded and narrated a video while walking through the building occasionally referring to himself as a journalist while wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat.

“We’re gonna do whatever it takes to MAGA” he said according to the FBI.

Montoya told a judge on Wednesday that he works for Infowars and mentioned that Jones also was in Washington on Jan. 6. Jones has not been charged in the riot but Montoya asked if returning to work or contacting his boss could violate his pretrial release conditions.

“I certainly understand what you’re asking because this was also a news event and you work in the news or information business but this is a line that you’re going to have to be careful of on your own” U.S. District Judge Susan Hightower said.

Far-right internet troll Tim “Baked Alaska” Gionet who was arrested less than two weeks after the riot streamed live video that showed himself inside the Capitol and encouraging other protesters to stay. Investigators say Gionet also profanely called an officer an “oathbreaker” and chanted “Whose house? Our house!”

Prosecutors dispute that Gionet is a journalist. His lawyer said the former BuzzFeed employee only went to Washington to film what happened.

“That is what he does. January 6th was no different” defense attorney Zachary Thornley wrote in a court filing.

Another defendant John Earle Sullivan leads the protest organizing group “Insurgence USA” and identifies himself as an activist and journalist who films protests the FBI said. Defense attorney Steven Kiersh challenged court-ordered restrictions on Sullivan’s use of the internet and social media.

Sullivan “is legitimately self-employed as a documentarian and it is oppressive to require that he not be allowed to continue his primary area of employment for an extended period of time” Kiersh wrote in court papers attaching receipts for work Sullivan has done for CNN and other news outlets.

Sullivan is accused of saying “Let’s burn this (expletive) down” after the mob breached a security barrier entering the Capitol through a broken window and telling officers inside to back down.

Witzemann’s lawyer argued that prohibiting him from traveling outside New Mexico would violate his First Amendment rights as a freelance journalist. The charges against Witzemann include violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.

After his arrest Witzemann told KOB-TV that others had breached barricades outside the Capitol before he arrived.

“My only goal was to get right up to the front of the action so to speak to film it” he said.

Other defendants identifying as journalists have been tied to an extremist group or movement by federal authorities.

Nicholas DeCarlo told the Los Angeles Times that he and another alleged rioter Nicholas Ochs are journalists. But the FBI said Ochs and DeCarlo are self-identified Proud Boys and content producers for an online forum called “Murder the Media News.”

Prosecutors say DeCarlo wrote “Murder The Media” on a door in the building. When authorities later searched DeCarlo’s home they found a framed photo of DeCarlo and Ochs posing in front of the door with a thumbs-up."

Cardinal Ribat said because of his underlying conditions his physician encouraged him to go and get vaccinated. He did it also to encourage the people not to be afraid of it.

“Infections will come anywhere in the world it will still come. We’ll face them doesn’t matter when you take vaccine it will still come we’ll take them. So what is it that we want to win faith? Now for me the truth is have a positive mind a mindset. If you have a negative mind in you you will not be able to do anything. You will be sitting there afraid and not moving to do anything at all.”

He encouraged people to have a positive mind set to think beyond this problem because we are people of faith living a physical life and these two cannot be separated as long as one lives because man has a soul and body.

“It doesn’t matter we are in the world many things will happen like this. Our faith in God will pull us through and will go beyond and we will do things and He will not leave us alone that is his promise to us. If we believe that He will be able to look after us.”

Cardinal Ribat said he had his fears and doubts too. But he is encouraged by the fact that he needs to care for his body just like he cares for his soul.

“I had my heart condition I am also I’m diabetic. And now what will happen to me will I die? But the thing is that the preparation is for both. For our physical life to be okay and also If you die you die and you go to your father. And that’s the faith you have.

“So you do not have to be afraid of anything of this. Know that you will be on earth this life will end yes we will die somehow. But not to think that this thing will kill us the virus will kill us nothing.” said Cardinal Ribat.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Can You Pay for a Car with a Credit Card?

Yes. Some dealerships will allow you to pay for a car with a credit card. However many dealerships place limits on credit card transactions so you might have trouble paying for an entire vehicle with your card and might have to settle for just making a down payment usually around $5000.

Tip: Check out the free app WalletFlo so that you can optimize your credit card spend by seeing the best card to use! You can also track credits annual fees and get notifications when you’re eligible for the best cards!

What dealerships take credit cards?

You’ll probably have to just ask around and call the dealerships anonymously to find out if they take credit cards.

I say anonymously because I would NOT reveal that I was using a credit card to make a purchase until it got time to close on the vehicle and the final price was already set in stone. Otherwise you risk them manipulating the price to cover the cost of the credit card transaction fee.

So consider calling in weeks ahead of time and not revealing anything about your desired car — you might even have someone else call in for you so that they don’t recognize your voice if you want to play it really safe.

If you have an Amex card there’s a specific web portal you can use to locate dealerships that take Amex credit cards. You’ll be able to search for specific types of vehicles sign-up to receive emails for deals and even review prices that others paid for the car you want. The program will also show you which dealerships have credit card limits (like $5000) and which dealerships will allow you to pay the full price for the vehicle.

And if you’re wondering about Carmax they do not take credit cards.

Why car dealers deny your credit card

Many car dealerships will tell you that they can’t take credit cards or that they don’t. Sometimes they are just telling you that because they don’t want to pay the transaction fee on the purchase but there are some legitimate reasons as well.

Transaction (interchange) fees

Credit card issuers make money when merchants pay transaction fees of 2% to 4% which is one of the ways many of these credit card companies make a lot of their money (especially Amex). So from the dealership’s eyes they are losing out on maybe 3% of a large transaction which will affect their profits and commission. (The profit margins for car dealerships can be much lower than you probably think.)

While a dealership may refuse to take a credit card and may not be contractually obligated to take your card you might be able to persuade them otherwise by offering to pay half or all of the transaction fee. Start with presuming you won’t pay any of the fee then ask about paying half then ask about covering the entire transaction fee.

Fraud and contested charges

Some dealerships are legitimately worried about fraud especially if the purchaser is coming in from out of state and has other shady characteristics (e.g. urgent reason for needing a vehicle etc.). If the dealership sells that car they’re going to take a huge hit if that card was fraudulently obtained. Also some people will contest their charges which could cause some major problems for the dealership.

Getting around limits on the purchase

Many dealerships place limits on the amount that you can put on a credit card. For example I was once told there was a $5000 limit on what we could pay with a card and other limits might be as low as $2000 or $3000. This again is sometimes just to avoid having to pay for the transaction fees so if you offer to cover that cost you might be able to get around these limits.

Other times it might just be company policy to limit transactions to $5000 regardless of who is covering the transaction fee. You can ask them to run multiple purchases of $5000 and they might be willing to work with you if that’s what is holding them back.

But some dealerships just don’t want any part of a huge transaction like that and won’t budge. If you really want to use your card you might to move on to the next dealership but I suggest trying to be reasonable. Sometimes you might need to consider it a win if you’re allowed to put any spend on a credit card at a dealership.

Some cars might be easier than others to purchase with a credit card.

Is it worth it to purchase a car on a credit card?

When trying to figure out if it’s worth purchasing a card on your credit card I think there are a few major considerations. The first is who is covering the transaction fee?

Dealership paying the transaction fee

If the dealership is paying for the transaction fee then it will usually be worth it to use your credit card whether you’re just earning points on the spend or if you’re hitting a minimum spend requirement. The key to remember is not to reveal you’re using a card too early so that the price doesn’t get inflated.

Tip: If you just want to save cash you could “decide” not to use your credit card at the last minute and offer to not use your credit card if they reduce the price by the amount of the transaction fee.

Customer paying the transaction fee

If you are paying for the transaction fee then you’re going to have do the math to see if it’s worth it.

If you’re trying to make a huge purchase like a $25000 car then you would be paying $750 in transaction fee costs (assuming a 3% transaction fee). If you were earning 2% back on that purchase with credit card rewards then you would be losing money on the purchase.

However if you were meeting the minimum spend requirement for a card offering a huge welcome bonus like the Chase Ink Business Preferred then you might be earning $1200+ worth of rewards. Plus you’d get $375+ worth of rewards from the 25000 points you’d earn on the purchase.

So in total you’d come out with over $1500 worth of rewards and paying a $750 transaction fee would cut into your earnings but still leave you with $750 extra left in your pocket.

If you’re not earning a sign-up bonus it could still be worth it just to earn the credit card rewards on the spend.

For example if you were using the Amex Blue Business Plus you will earn 2X on your purchase (up to $50000/yr) and if you value Amex Membership Rewards at 1.8 cents per point then you’d be earning 3.6% back. So even if you paid a 3% transaction fee you’d still come out on top.

However in most cases a simple 1% or 2% back card won’t earn you enough rewards to justify a transaction fee if you’re responsible for paying it.

Interest you don’t want to pay

If you’re using a credit card to purchase a car or even make a significant payment you need to have a plan to pay off that bill as soon as you can. If you have 0% APR for an intro period then carrying a balance can make sense but generally rewards credit cards are going to have high APRs (10 to 20%+) and you’d be able to get much better financing through the dealership a bank or a credit union at around 2% to 5% APR. Credit cards don’t make good car loans.

Interest you might want to pay

You might also want to think about the rewards you’d earn by making the monthly payments with a credit card. There’s a service called Plastiq that allows you to use a credit card to send out checks. It comes with a 2.5% transaction fee but if you earn referral credits you can make payments for free.

If you got great financing and could minimize transaction fees using a service like Plastiq a monthly car payment could allow you to more easily hit your minimum spend requirements for various credit cards over time and you could still come out on top with credit card rewards earnings.

Investing alternatives

If you are going to pay off your credit card in full after making the payment on the car don’t forget to factor in alternative uses for those funds such as investing. Let’s say you earned $750 in rewards by using a card to pay for a $25000 car like in the example above. That’s 3% back.

But if you’re a savvy investor you might be able to put that $25000 to use and earn much more back investing even factoring in the interest you’d be paying on an auto loan. Everybody’s going to be different but the goal is to maximize your rewards in a way that’s most comfortable to you.

What about credit card benefits?

If you were hoping to get credit card benefits for your purchase like extended warranty coverage or something along those lines automobiles are usually excluded from benefits like that.

For example for the Amex extended warranty they specifically exclude:

4. Motorized vehicles (passenger cars trucks motorcycles boats airplanes) and their parts subject to high risk combustion wear and tear or mileage stipulations

So don’t expect to get any special coverage from your credit cards.

What cards can you purchase a car on?

Depending on the type of car you’re after you might need an extremely high credit limit.

Charge cards

For car purchases a charge card will often be the best route because they have no established limit. While they have no limit you’re generally responsible for paying off the bill the next month.

The issue with charge cards is that it can take a while to build up the upper limits of your charge card’s “unofficial limit.” For example if you opened up an Amex Gold Card last month and that’s your only card with Amex Amex is probably not going to “know you well enough” to allow you to throw a $20000+ purchase on your charge card. Your card would get flagged and the chances of that transaction going through would be very small.

So the best way to use a charge card to purchase a car is to maintain a relationship with Amex for a while and try to use it for as many large purchases as possible. Then call into Amex and inquire about the spend power of your card (or check it online). That will tell you right there whether or not you’ll have the capacity to make the purchase.

The problem with this is that if you’re trying to hit a minimum spend requirement for the charge card that doesn’t leave you that long to show Amex your spending habits. Luckily there is a solution for this.

Make pre-payments

Something else that you can do is to make a pre-payment on your charge card. For example you could make a $10000 payment on your charge card so that your balance goes to -$10000. That would effectively increase your credit limit by $10000 — just make sure to run this by Amex or whatever issuer you’re working with before you do it. I know Amex will allow you to do this but I’m not sure about other issuers.

High limit credit cards

If you don’t want to go the charge card route you can look into getting cards that offer high credit limits. These are typically premium cards like the Black Card and cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve but other issuers can also provide you with large credit limits.

If you have enough room on your credit card for the purchase you should still contact your credit card issuer and put them on notice about the large purchase since you don’t want the purchase to get flagged for fraud.

Use multiple cards

One of the best strategies is to simply use multiple cards to make your purchase.

As mentioned above meeting a sign-up bonus for a credit card can easily justify the transaction fee. Well if you end up meeting the spend requirement for multiple credit cards then you can earn multiple sign-up bonuses which is definitely the best route for getting the most value from credit cards.

The amount of cards that you are able to use will depend on what the dealership decides but some have been able to use a half dozen to pay for their cars!

Assuming around a value of $500 per sign-up bonus that could be a way to earn $3000 in sign-up bonus value alone (plus you’d earn points from the spend).

Utilizing several credit limits will be necessary if you don’t have very high limits on your credit cards and it could help you stay under mandatory $5000 limit transactions.

Note that certain issuers like Chase will allow you shift credit between your cards so you could always allocate to one credit card to maximize the limit with that card. Also some issuers like Citi will allow you to request a credit limit increase (sometimes without a hard pull) so you could always raise your credit limit that way.

Cash advances off

Whatever card you use it’s a good idea to bring your cash advance limit down to $1 to avoid the purchase coding as a cash advance. Sometimes bringing down your cash advance to $0 can cause processing issues so I generally bring it down to $1 when I’m worried about something coding as a cash advance.

Pay for a Car with a Credit Card FAQs

Should you pay for a car with a credit card? Paying for a car with a credit card can often make sense if you are earning lucrative rewards (especially a new welcome bonus). Just make sure the car dealership is not increasing the price of the vehicle to cover the transaction fee. Does American Express allow you to buy a car with their credit cards? American Express has a special web portal to help you find dealerships that will accept American Express cards. What is the fee for buying a car with a credit card? Some car dealerships may not charge a fee while others will charge a 2% to 4% fee. Are car dealerships required to accept a credit card? No car dealerships are not legally required to accept a credit card. Can I get an extended warranty when buying a car with a credit card? Typically motorized vehicles are excluded from the terms of conditions when it comes to extended warranties on credit cards.

Final word

Using a credit card to pay for a card isn’t always easy. You’ll often be hindered by limits but if you shop around enough and negotiate properly you should be able to find a dealership that will work with you. You’ll need to factor in the transaction fees you might have to pay but even if you have to pay them it can still make sense to use your credit card to pay for a car.",,,,,,,,,,,,
CCL,Carnival,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA0LzE4L3doeS1pcy1ldmVyeW9uZS10YWxraW5nLWFib3V0LWNhcm5pdmFsLXN0b2NrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Is Everyone Talking About Carnival Stock?,"Investors are still banking on a recovery for the cruise operator.

Almost no company was hit harder by the coronavirus pandemic than Carnival (CCL -3.29%) the world's biggest cruise line operator.

Unable to facilitate social distancing and dependent on global travel and leisure cruise lines have essentially shut down during the crisis. Even during normal times some detractors regard cruise ships as floating petri dishes and the pandemic has rendered cruises inoperable in much of the world.

The CDC has issued a conditional sail order that has effectively banned cruises in the U.S. and Carnival said in February that it would suspend U.S. sailings at least through May. Meanwhile the broader prohibitions in international travel have also made it difficult to get cruises up and running again elsewhere.

Because of those challenges Carnival stock has plunged during the crisis falling as much 85% last spring. It's still down substantially from the start of 2020 as the chart below shows.

Uncertainty generally translates into opportunity in the stock market. Carnival which owns several other brands including Princess Cunard and Holland America and its cruise line peers continue to face plenty of uncertainty about when cruising can return to normal as virus variants circulate and the vaccine rollout faces a number of obstacles. That's one reason why the stock continues to attract a lot of attention from investors. Let's take a look at some others.

Value value value

Growth stocks were the stars of 2020 but value stocks are now coming back into vogue. The economic reopening should reverse trends from last year normalizing valuations for high-flying tech stocks and propelling beaten-down value stocks back up to their pre-pandemic levels.

Carnival doesn't fit the traditional definition of a value stock as the company is still burning through cash as it awaits safer travel conditions but it was a highly profitable business before the pandemic. Bulls expect those profits to eventually return.

There's no question that its recent financial results have been ugly. In its first quarter of fiscal 2021 which ended on Feb. 28 the company reported a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) loss of $2 billion and a monthly average cash burn of $500 million which it expects to continue into the second quarter.

Carnival also has $1.8 billion in debt maturing over the next four quarters though the company finished the quarter with $11.5 billion in cash and short-term investments giving it sufficient liquidity to survive for several more years even if conditions don't improve.

By contrast in fiscal 2019 before the pandemic Carnival generated $3 billion in net income on $20.8 billion in revenue showing cruise lines are a solidly profitable business model in normal times. Bulls expect the business to eventually return to those levels and therefore see value at the current price down nearly 50% from before the pandemic.

The pent-up demand question

The other cornerstone for the bull case for the stock is that pent-up demand will send Carnival's financial results to above pre-pandemic levels. There's plenty of evidence that people around the world are eager to travel once it's safe to do so. Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel observed in February that hotel bookings had surged in Israel as vaccination rates rose a sign of people traveling to see family or just to get away.

While cruise lines like Carnival may eventually benefit from a pent-up demand as avid cruisers are likely anxious to set sail again the sector will probably be the last one in the travel industry to recover as cruise lines face special challenges around docking in international ports and even reassembling crews. As long as variants are circulating countries may be reluctant to allow foreign cruise ships to dock in their ports.

The early tale of the Diamond Princess a Carnival ship where more than 700 on board contracted coronavirus and the ship was kept at sea for several weeks is a reminder of the risks the company faces as it returns to normal cruising. Another such disaster is likely to scare away many would-be passengers.

The ultimate litmus test

Investing in Carnival is possibly the best way to bet on a global recovery from the coronavirus pandemic itself as the stock's performance has basically been a litmus test for investor psychology around the crisis. Unsurprisingly shares surged in November when Pfizer and BioNTech announced a 95% efficacy rate for their vaccine but pulled back briefly earlier this week when the CDC announced a pause on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

Carnival's recovery can only take place if the pandemic is brought under control. Therefore the stock's prospects are closely linked to news about the virus. Investors should also remember that even if business gets back to normal levels net debt has exploded during the crisis jumping from $11.4 billion at the end of 2019 to $19.8 billion as of its most recent report and the additional interest expense from those borrowings as well as the repayments will be headwinds on the stock.

Carnival stock may eventually recover from the coronavirus pandemic but it could take several years. Even as the U.S. is rapidly deploying vaccines much of the world including Europe is still struggling to do so. Some countries are even experiencing surges in daily cases including India Brazil and Turkey. On a global scale daily case counts are moving higher not lower.

The lesson for Carnival investors at this point is much as it's been for the last year to continue to be patient.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlaW5kdXN0cnluZXdzLmNvbS9jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA0L2Nhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1saW5lLWZsZWV0LWxvY2F0aW9ucy1zaGlwLWJ5LXNoaXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Cruise Line Fleet Locations: Ship by Ship,"As Carnival Cruise Line hopes from encouraging news to restart in the United States it is keeping most of its fleet close to home.

The line which is part of Carnival Corporation will start cruising the Greek Islands from May 23 2021. The line has scheduled 23 different cruises from that time onwards which will go on sale on April 20 2021.

The Greek Islands

While AIDA has been eager to start cruising throughout the pandemic the line was unlucky in many cases with lockdowns happening before each planned restart.

The line has now decided to send AIDAblu to the Greek Islands. Last year AIDAblu was already momentarily stationed in Italy in October but the voyages had to be halted after a short time in operation.

At its reopening on May 14 2021 Greece will be one of the most popular vacation destinations for visitors. Several factors make a vacation in Greece so attractive: its gorgeous turquoise water fascinating ancient culture unique Greek flair and much more.

The 7-day voyages onboard AIDAblu around the Greek Islands are scheduled to include several of Greece’s best spots. Rhodes Crete Heraklion Katakolon (Olympia) and Piraeus are all listed as ports of call while Corfu will act as the homeport for embarking and disembarking the vessel. Guests have the opportunity to book a 14-day back-to-back cruise as well.

Voyages in Greece have as of yet not been declared to have a vaccination mandate like other cruise lines have done in Greece. However the cruises will include AIDA’s health and hygiene concept. This includes a mandatory PCR test before arrival regular health checks comprehensive AHA rules medical care including testing capacities on board and much more.

AIDA Slowly Restarting- Canceling More As Well

While competitors like MSC have been announcing multiple voyages around Europe AIDA is taking things slow even in and from Germany. As it stands only one other AIDA ship will be deployed. That vessel is AIDAperla which is in service in the Canary Islands.

The AIDAblu will be available to guests starting in May following the deployment of AIDAperla. Additional season extensions for AIDAperla and AIDAblu are not out of the question given the current shortage of options.

AIDA has been forced to cancel many other options that were scheduled to sail in the upcoming months. These voyages are not possible under the current situation according to the cruise line:

AIDAaura voyages from 28.04. To 23.05.2021

AIDAbella voyages from 29.04.To 16.05.2021

AIDAdiva voyages from 01. To 15.05.2021

AIDAluna voyages from 03. To 15.05.2021

AIDAmar voyages from 02. To 10.05.2021

AIDAnova voyages from 27.4. To 15.05.2021

AIDAprima voyages from 8. To 15.05.2021

AIDAsol voyages from 01. To 07.05.2021

AIDAstella voyages from 16. To 27.05.2021

AIDAvita voyages from 02. To 23.05.2021

All guests whose voyage cannot be carried out as initially planned will be informed immediately by AIDA or their travel agent via SMS or e-mail.

All cruises are operated according to AIDA Cruises’ comprehensive health and safety protocols and national and local infection control laws and regulations. With our testing strategy for guests and employees already proven in practice we enable safe travel.

Good news then for those guests that enjoy the AIDA ships. Although the vessels are marketed towards the German public the line has attracted more and more international clientele in recent years.

Not surprisingly AIDA has been consistently noted as a top cruise line amongst those who have sailed aboard one of its ships.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC9kcml2ZW4tdGhlLTIwMjIta2lhLWNhcm5pdmFsLWlzbnQteW91ci10eXBpY2FsLW1pbml2YW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Driven: The 2022 Kia Carnival Isn't Your Typical Minivan And That's A Good Thing,"Decades ago minivans were as American as apple pie. They dotted the landscape and countless owners loved them for their space and practicality.

However minivans have fallen out of favor with consumers who have embraced crossovers in growing numbers. As a result Ford and GM exited the segment and so did competitors such as Mazda Nissan and Volkswagen. Even Dodge whose best-selling product was the Grand Caravan waved goodbye last year.

Despite this the minivan segment has rarely been as interesting as it is right now. The Chrysler Pacifica and Honda Odyssey were recently given a facelift while the Toyota Sienna was redesigned for 2021. Not to be outdone Kia has retired the Sedona and replaced it with the all-new Carnival.

The Cool Minivan?

Since minivans are seen as uncool the Carnival features a crossover-inspired design and is billed as a multi-purpose vehicle that “confidently stakes the claim between proper SUV and family hauler.” Or at least that’s what Kia says.

We’ll let that slide since hatchbacks and wagons are also pretending to be crossovers. In any case it’s hard to argue with the Carnival’s looks. This is undoubtedly one of the best looking minivans as it has a stylish face sleek lines and upscale bodywork. On top of that there are blacked out A-pillars a sloping roof and a distinctive silver accent on the C-pillar.

It also features a number of crossover-inspired styling cues including plastic body cladding and satin chrome skid plates. These touches aren’t very convincing but they’re nicely incorporated into the overall design.

The Maybach Of Minivans

Kia’s interior design team is a force to be reckoned with and they’ve impressed us once again with the Carnival. While the cabin is reminiscent of the K5 it’s more luxurious as it features higher quality materials and slick climate controls. Drivers will also find acres of gloss black plastic as well as painted woodgrain or 3D satin chrome trim. The gloss black is a bit overdone but the cabin feels more premium than its sticker price would suggest.

Most versions of the Carnival have analog gauges which are separated by a small but informative 4.2-inch display. A 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster is also available but it’s limited to the range-topping SX Prestige.

Speaking of displays the minivan comes standard with an 8-inch infotainment system featuring wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. However most trims have a 12.3-inch infotainment system with Android Auto Apple CarPlay SiriusXM voice recognition technology and GPS navigation.

The larger display works well and there are dedicated ‘buttons’ to access commonly used screens such as maps radio and navigation. The infotainment system should be familiar to Kia owners but it has a handful of cool features including a cabin camera and an intercom.

The former shows a live video feed of the second and third row while the latter projects your voice through the rear speakers. This means when your kids are fighting you can see the guilty party and yell at them more effectively. When the little heathens finally fall asleep you can use Quiet Mode to turn off the rear speakers.

While those are interesting features the Carnival is more notable for the VIP lounge seats that come standard in the SX Prestige. They’re Maybach-style second-row seats which are power adjustable and feature leg extensions. They also boast heating and ventilation so passengers can sit back and relax while watching videos on the dual screen entertainment system.

Minivans are known for their spaciousness and the Carnival doesn’t disappoint as there’s plenty of room up front. The second row is impressive as well as there is 40.5 inches (1029 mm) of legroom. While the optional middle seat is a bit tight for adults it’s highly flexible as it slides and features a backrest with a tray as well as cup holders.

On the downside the middle seat comes slamming down when you yank on the pull tab. If you accidentally pull it from the wrong side and get your arm caught like this reviewer little Jimmy and Johnny might learn some new four letter words.

While I don’t envy anyone who has to remove the second-row seats on a regular basis the third-row ones easily rise from the load floor. You simply pull up on a handle pull back on a strap and push the seat forward.

With the rear seats in place there are roomy accommodations for two adults or three small children. They’ll find 35.6 inches (904 mm) of legroom and enough headroom to keep this 6’ 2” writer happy.

Regardless of which row you’re in you’ll find a USB charging port as the Carnival can be equipped with up to nine of them. The model can also be outfitted with two 110-volt outlets to power everything from refrigerated coolers to laptops.

If cargo hauling is more important than moving people you won’t be disappointed as there’s 40.2 cubic feet (1138 liters) of space behind the third row. Folding it down reveals 86.9 cubic feet (2461 liters) of room and that can be expanded to a best-in-class 145.1 cubic feet (4109 liters) by removing the second row. That’s a ridiculous amount of space and it even dwarfs the Chevy Suburban’s cargo capacity of 144.7 cubic feet (4098 liters).

Best-In-Class V6 Power

While the Carnival’s performance won’t blow you away it features a 3.5-liter V6 engine that produces 290 hp (216 kW / 294 PS) and 262 lb-ft (355 Nm) of torque. This narrowly edges out the Chrysler Pacifica which has a 3.6-liter V6 developing 287 hp (214 kW / 291 PS) and the same amount of torque. The Honda Odyssey isn’t far behind as its 3.5-liter V6 has 280 hp (209 kW / 284 PS) and 262 lb-ft (355 Nm) of torque just like the others.

The engine is connected to a smooth eight-speed automatic transmission which sends power to the front wheels. While a handful of minivans offer all-wheel drive Kia believes customers looking for all-weather traction will simply buy a crossover. However they left the door open for an all-wheel drive variant as the company is “always studying the marketplace” and “could respond accordingly” if there is enough demand.

While the Carnival isn’t a crossover it certainly drinks like one as the van has an EPA-estimated fuel economy rating of 19 mpg city 26 mpg highway and 22 mpg combined. That’s slightly worse than the Pacifica and Odyssey which are both rated at 19 mpg city 28 mpg highway and 22 mpg combined. All three are bested by the Toyota Sienna which uses a hybrid powertrain to return 36 mpg across the board.

The Carnival has a towing capacity of 3500 lbs (1588 kg) but that’s nothing to brag about as it’s matched by the Odyssey and Sienna. The Pacifica has a slight edge here as it can tow up to 3600 lbs (1633 kg).

A Minivan With A Sport Mode

Minivans aren’t known for their driving dynamics but the Carnival isn’t a torture for enthusiasts. This can be chalked up to a variety of things including the N3 platform which also underpins the Sorento and K5. The architecture uses hot-stamped parts and ultra-high-strength steel for increased torsional stiffness and the end result feels pretty solid. That being said there was a rattle coming from the rear passenger side every time I drove through my pothole-lined neighborhood.

The suspension features MacPherson struts and a multi-link rear and is unsurprisingly geared towards comfort. On smooth roads the ride is great but things are more mixed on less than perfect pavement. A few impacts seemed a bit harsh but the ride is reasonably comfortable without feeling floaty.

The same can be said about the steering which is light and isn’t particularly engaging. Sport mode livens things up a bit but you should keep your expectations in check.

When it comes time to dance the Carnival takes corners well but the experience isn’t very rewarding. On the bright side body roll is largely kept in check and a bit of personality shines through. The 12.8 inch (325 mm) discs at all four corners bring the van to a halt with ease. They’re stronger than they let on and the pedal has a natural feel.

Last but not least the cabin is fairly quiet as all Carnivals are equipped with an acoustic glass windshield. The SX and SX Prestige go even further as they add acoustic glass to the front doors. That being said wind noise makes itself known at speeds in excess of 55 mph (89 km/h).

Pricing Starts At $32100

Despite offering more cargo room than a Chevy Suburban the Carnival LX starts at $32100 before a $1175 destination charge. It comes nicely equipped with LED headlights power sliding doors and 17-inch alloy wheels.

Moving into the cabin drivers will find a 4.2-inch LCD display in the instrument cluster as well as an 8-inch infotainment system with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Other highlights include a six-speaker audio system front and rear air conditioning and seating for seven. Speaking of seats there are sliding and removable second-row captain chairs as well as a split-folding third-row.

Despite its entry-level status the Carnival LX comes equipped with an assortment of driver assistance systems including Forward Collision Avoidance Blind Spot Collision Avoidance and Rear Cross-Traffic Collision Avoidance. It also has Lane Keeping Assist Lane Following Assist Rear Parking Distance Warning Rear Occupant Alert and a rearview camera with dynamic guidelines.

Moving up the trim ladder is the Carnival EX which begins at $37600. It features a lightly revised exterior with 19-inch alloy wheels and a power liftgate with a hands-free function.

The eight-seat interior is trimmed in artificial leather and features an eight-way power driver’s seat with lumbar support. It also has heated front seats a leather-wrapped steering wheel a tri-zone automatic climate control system and a 12.3-inch infotainment system with GPS navigation. Drivers will also find woodgrain trim a wireless smartphone charger and an upgraded eight-speaker audio system. Rounding out the highlights are rear sunshades as well as the aforementioned cabin camera and intercom system.

On the safety front there are front and rear parking sensors as well as a more advanced Forward Collision Avoidance system with cyclist detection. The model also has Highway Driving Assist and navigation-based Smart Cruise Control with a Stop & Go function.

The $41100 Carnival SX has a more distinctive appearance as it wears a matte chrome grille satin chrome accents faux skid plates and roof rails. Other highlights include LED fog lights power folding side mirrors and 19-inch alloy wheels with a black finish.

Inside there are heated and ventilated front seats an eight-way power passenger seat and 115V outlets. Other niceties include a rear seat entertainment system a surround view monitor and rear parking collision avoidance.

Sitting at the top of the range is the $46100 SX Prestige. It boasts a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster a sunroof and genuine leather upholstery. This model also has a heated leather steering wheel an auto-dimming rearview mirror with HomeLink a blind-spot view monitor and a 12-speaker Bose audio system with a subwoofer.

Of course the stand out feature is the aforementioned VIP lounge seats. While they’re certainly cool they’re not removable and this limits the van’s usefulness.

A Minivan That Stands Out From The Crowd

The Carnival might be a minivan in denial but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad minivan. Quite the opposite as it’s spacious and comfortable while offering a number of unique features. On top of that it looks great and has an upscale interior with high-end amenities. Pricing is also competitive as it costs thousands less than the Pacifica and Sienna and is only $10 more than the Odyssey.

At the end of the day the Carnival is an interesting option and a big improvement over the Sedona. While it might not win over crossover fans the competition has been put on notice.

The formation which is on a ""cross-sea area"" training exercise involved J-15 fighter jets as well as several ship-borne helicopters. Photo: Navy.81.cn

The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy showed high confidence and combat preparedness by conducting fighter jet exercises with an aircraft carrier in the South China Sea despite the stalking attempt of a US warship which was shadowed by a group of the PLA carrier's escorts Chinese military observers said on Sunday after a video allegedly taken on board the US warship went viral on social media on Saturday.Allegedly taken by a US Navy sailor whose ship was allegedly ""tracking"" the PLA aircraft carrier task group in the South China Sea over the past few days the video shows a J-15 fighter jet landed steadily on the aircraft carrier Liaoning. The Type 052D destroyer Chengdu and the Type 055 large destroyer Nanchang were seen not far away from the carrier serving as escorts.Originally posted on Twitter the video has become protected and no longer accessible to the general public as of press time but went viral on Chinese social media on Saturday.Despite the presence of the US ship the Liaoning continued its fighter jet exercises as normal which showed confidence and the adept skills of both sailors and pilots indicating a high level of combat preparedness a Chinese military analyst told the Global Times on Sunday requesting anonymity.The carrier group allowed the US vessel to view it and this gave the US a transparent view of the Chinese carrier's capabilities the analyst opined noting that the situation was under complete control and the US ship was not a threat to the Chinese flotilla because while the US ship was observing the Chinese ships it was also being closely monitored the other way around.This is not the first time a US warship has recently approached the PLA aircraft carrier. The USS Mustin destroyer followed the Liaoning when it sailed in the Philippine Sea on April 4 a photo released by the US Navy at the time shows.It is normal for warships and warplanes of different countries to track and monitor each other outside of territorial waters and airspace as long as they abide by international regulations to prevent collisions keep safe distances and avoid other accidents Captain (retired) Tian Shichen president of the Global Governance Institution think tank and director of the Center for International Law of Military Operations told the Global Times at the time.At a time of escalating tensions in the Taiwan Straits the US military's repeated attempts of close-in tracking of the Liaoning showed its vigilance on the PLA carrier and sent wrong signals to Taiwan secessionist forces and other parties giving them an illusion that the US can militarily contain the PLA on China's doorsteps but many details in the video actually show otherwise analysts said.Senior Captain Gao Xiucheng a PLA Navy spokesperson announced on April 5 that the Liaoning carrier task group was conducting exercises near the island of Taiwan as a part of annually scheduled regular training. About a week later the carrier sailed south into the South China Sea for further exercises according to foreign media reports.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlybGluZXMvc21hcnRhdmlhLWJlY29tZXMtbGF0ZXN0LXJ1c3NpYW4tY2Fycmllci10by1icmluZy1pbi1hMzIwbmVvLzE0MzMzNS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Smartavia becomes latest Russian carrier to bring in A320neo,"Russian carrier Smartavia has introduced the first of three Airbus A320neo twinjets it is planning to receive this year.

The aircraft powered by CFM International Leap-1A engines arrived at Moscow Domodedovo airport bearing the Arkhangelsk-based airline’s colours.

“We have done a lot of preparatory work before the introduction of this new technology into our fleet” says chief executive Sergei Savostin.

He says the A320neo will be a “new milestone” in the airline’s transformation into a “highly efficient civil aviation enterprise”. Smartavia aims to be transporting 3 million passengers annually by the end of this year.

Originally delivered to Mexican operator Interjet in 2017 the A320neo has been re-registered as VP-BOS.

At a time when shipping like most of the global economy is suffering this continues to add additional pressure.

The 20 February 2022 P&I renewal was one of the more difficult in recent times with double digit General Increases requested by most clubs significant hikes in the cost of International Group reinsurance and many clubs also insisting on deductible increases or other term changes to increase members’ retention.

As a mutual insurance association P&I clubs provide risk pooling information and representation for members. P&I insurance covers risks that are not typically placed in the traditional insurance market. Typical P&I cover can include a carrier's third-party risks for damage caused to cargo during carriage war risks and risks of environmental damage such as oil spills and pollution.

Much has been said of applying a general increase as means of blanket raising premiums across all members regardless of individual account performance. With all the actuarial and modelling skills available P&I clubs should now be in a position to apply increases that relate to adverse loss records.

Clubs should adopt an analytical approach when seeking increases rather than a unilateral approach. When working with organizations a more detailed analysis of each member’s risk profile hand-in-hand with the context of club performance and the marketplace is encouraged.

In the past Mr. Al Baker was a vocal critic when it comes to the competition especially the U.S. and European carriers that were constantly lobbying against the ME3 in their home markets.

Now in a setting where he as asked to comment on the international aviation market and his competitors Al Baker didn’t have very high regard for British Airways a carrier (group) that Qatar owns 25% of.

Many airline bosses are smoothies — global diplomats with pocket squares silky language and effortless charm. Akbar Al Baker who runs Qatar Airways is not like many airline bosses. In the course of just 45 minutes from his boardroom in Doha he dismisses British Airways as a “two out of ten” carrier; accuses Dubai of becoming a Covid-19 superspreader and lambasts arch-rival Emirates as a gas-guzzling dinosaur; says any airline that offers premium economy is ripping off its customers;

He also warns that “the good times” for airline passengers are a thing of the past.

On the topic of British Airways Airways Al Baker appeared especially disappointed with former CEO Alex Cruz who had cut back on too many perks and transformed the airline into a quasi low cost carrier.

The reporter asked him how many marks out of ten he would give BA and his reply was prompt: “Two. They have lost their focus!”

“British Airways is the flag carrier of the UK. You remember the motto? ‘To fly to serve’. That was not any more the motto of the company. It was only on a billboard.”

He did express optimism about BA’s future under their new CEO Mr. Doyle saying “He’s a very good leader. He has my confidence!” Al Baker is however extremely critical of Doyle’s decision to push further into the Premium Economy market segment.

Al Baker has in the past talked about U.S. carriers as being “crap” and that they’d hire/keep grandmothers as flight attendants.

He did later apologize for framing it that way though.

Conclusion

Akbar al Baker commonly known as “His Excellency” is always very outspoken especially when it comes to issues he truly cares about. There are definitely no words minced but that makes him a straight shooter and is certainly right on the money here when it comes to British Airways performance. Especially while it was under the reign of Alex “Penny Pincher” Cruz.

I believe that despite all the flak he gets for his straight talk he’s one of the very few visionary CEO’s in the industry who isn’t just there for the money. He’s become an extension of the Qatar Airways brand and people associate his persona directly with the airline for better or for worse. How many carriers can say that?"
CTLT,Catalent,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvYnVzaW5lc3Mvb3V0c291cmNpbmcvQ2VsbC1hbmQtZ2VuZS10aGVyYXB5LVRoZS1uZXh0LWZyb250aWVyLWluLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2FsLXNlcnZpY2VzLzk5L2kxNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cell and gene therapy: The next frontier in pharmaceutical services,"ElevateBio a newly launched pharmaceutical services firm near Boston is not a traditional contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) that offers services for hire. It’s more like a biotech incubator. But different.

In brief The US Food and Drug Administration has approved only a handful of cell and gene therapies but over 1000 candidates are now in clinical trials creating a demand for pharmaceutical services that far outstrips supply. Several new ventures and a few of the largest traditional pharmaceutical services firms are rising to the challenge providing expertise in areas such as viral vector development gene editing and genetic engineering of chimeric antigen receptor T cells. While the opportunity is great these firms face a highly competitive market for trained scientists and a lack of standards in a new realm of science.

The Discovery Labs another new services company has some similarities to ElevateBio. The Philadelphia-area venture is perhaps more like BioCentriq a university-based services firm now opening in New Jersey. But there are differences.

These three companies and others like them are directing their services at the burgeoning cell and gene therapy industry. In the process they are helping create a completely new branch of the pharmaceutical CDMO world. They will be competing with one another and with a handful of giant services firms that are also investing in the cell and gene therapy sector.

The pharmaceutical services sector has existed since the 1970s—ever since as lore has it the drug company Smith Kline & French sought outside help making raw materials for the ulcer pill Tagamet. In the ensuing years the sector has grown beyond such pharmaceutical chemicals to encompass ingredients for biologic drugs as well as drugs in their finished-dose forms. But the cell and gene therapy services sector has the look and feel of a wholly separate services sector—one serving a market primed for rapid growth.

The US Food and Drug Administration has approved only 7 cell and gene therapy drugs but the new product pipeline is teeming with approximately 1200 experimental therapies more than half in Phase 2 clinical trials. Estimates of annual sales growth are about 15% for cell therapies and nearly 30% for gene therapies. And the number of cell and gene therapy developers is rising rapidly; the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine estimates 1100 such ventures in 2020 an increase of about 10% over 2019.

Services companies are challenged by the newness of the cell and gene therapy field. They find themselves in the paradoxical position of trying to establish standard processes for research and manufacturing—essential to fast efficient low-cost operations—at the same time that they have to bring innovation to a new field.

Moreover the demand for services currently outstrips supply—supply not only of research and manufacturing capacity but also of an educated fully trained workforce. Competition for talent by all accounts is cutthroat.

“Workforce development is definitely a problem” says Peter Bigelow president of xCell Strategic Consulting. “The field is growing so rapidly and is so new that experienced people either don’t exist or are difficult to source.”

The most likely pool for talent is the pharmaceutical industry Bigelow says. “For instance people with mammalian cell culture experience can bring important capabilities for cell line development downstream processing and analytical methods.” As such there are clusters of potential good hires in Boston San Francisco and Bethesda Maryland. But these locations are also emerging as hubs for services firms making competition fierce and staff retention a problem.

Bigelow also notes the challenge of working in an emerging area of science. “Processes are not optimized because they are being developed and installed for the first time” he says. “There is significant trial and error underway.” He expects regulators will eventually impose a greater sense of order in an industry where currently parameters are to some extent set by suppliers of technology and equipment such as single-use bioprocessors.

John Khoury executive vice president of Project Farma a consulting firm in the area of emerging medicines says that innovation hubs where services firms exist near universities and institutions developing cell and gene therapy science will expedite technology transfer and commercialization.

But he agrees with Bigelow that the lack of standardization currently hampers efforts. “The fundamental challenge in cell therapy” Khoury says “is that you’re building the plane as you fly it.”

Quick starts

The scramble to develop staff and standards reflects the challenge of getting a foothold in a specialized field far more complex than the basic cell line development that characterizes making traditional biologic drugs.

Gene therapy for example requires the engineering growth and purification of adeno-associated virus (AAV) and lentivirus viral vectors—vehicles used to deliver genetic material into cells. The genetic engineering of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells is a primary service in cell therapy. And then there’s the need for CRISPR technology–based gene editing.

Aspiring services companies are making aggressive moves to meet the growing demand.

Trial time



Announcing a $525 million series C financing round in March ElevateBio described a “disruptive business model” for fostering new cell and gene therapy ventures.

ElevateBio’s model puts what Chief Scientific Officer Mitchell Finer says are the capabilities of a “fully integrated pharmaceutical company” at the service of start-ups that work at ElevateBio’s facilities and use its assets and scientists. The firm also invests in these start-ups. One—AlloVir a developer of viral-specific T-cell therapies—closed an initial public offering of stock last year. ElevateBio has started other companies including HighPassBio an immunotherapy T-cell specialist focused on leukemia.

“There are a lot of smart people out there” Finer says “who are either academics or small biotech companies that have gotten started but can’t afford to make investments in process development manufacturing and analytics and don’t know how to carefully characterize their products. So we thought we could be an enabler.”

The firm headquartered in Cambridge Massachusetts has most of its production and analytical assets in nearby Waltham where it is starting up cell and gene therapy manufacturing at a 13000 m2 facility that it calls BaseCamp. Full-scale production is expected to begin by year’s end.

Finer arrives as a services sector entrepreneur with a solid resume in cell therapy. He’s the former chief scientific officer of Bluebird Bio a gene therapy developer and was head of research at Cell Genesys where he was involved in putting the first CAR T cells into clinical development in the 1990s.

“Cell and gene therapy is pretty last century. A bunch of people doing work at a lab bench” Finer says of how R&D and production are often done. “We are investing in manufacturing automation. We’re investing in deep analytics on these viral and cell products.” Standards will emerge for the new methods and technologies as the sector evolves he says introducing a level of commoditized service. “Maybe someday Elevate will add a traditional CDMO business.”

The Discovery Labs is embracing some parts of the traditional fee-for-services CDMO model from the start. The firm is starting up a 55000 m2 cell and gene therapy facility near Philadelphia called the Center for Breakthrough Medicines. It’s based at a former GlaxoSmithKline R&D center that the firm acquired in 2018.

The Discovery Labs’ first process development labs opened last month and manufacturing suites certified to the US Food and Drug Administration’s current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) standard are due to start by early next year says Audrey Greenberg the firm’s executive director.

Plans to open a business incubator called Unite IQ were put on hold last year with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic Greenberg says. “As the vaccine kicks in and people come back to work we are going to reimagine how we deploy that at our site” she says. The Discovery Labs also plans to launch an accelerator or manufacturing support service in conjunction with an academic partner.

The focus now is on CDMO services says Joerg Ahlgrimm the Discovery Labs’ chief operating officer. “It’s important to know that many biotech companies have one two or three assets and it’s prohibitive to build internal capacity.” Infrastructure is not only expensive but also technically complex says Ahlgrimm who formerly headed the pharmaceutical and biotech business at the big Swiss CDMO Lonza.

Like other firms the Discovery Labs is facing an uphill climb in a competitive market for staffing Greenberg admits but it’s also ideally situated. “Philadelphia is really the birthplace of cell and gene therapy” she says. “We have upward of 20 to 30 cell and gene therapy companies here now.” Greenberg notes that Carl June a pioneer in CAR T-cell therapy runs a lab at the University of Pennsylvania where James Wilson did early work on delivering gene therapies with AAVs.

“There are upwards of 70000 life science employees in Philadelphia” she says. “So this is really the perfect place to start a company like this.”

Haro Hartounian senior vice president and general manager at BioCentriq would argue that New Jersey is ground zero for cell and gene therapy given that Novartis’s US headquarters are in East Hanover New Jersey. The FDA approved the Swiss drugmaker’s spinal muscular atrophy gene therapy Zolgensma in 2019. Bristol Myers Squibb another New Jersey company won approval last month for Abecma a CAR T-cell therapy for multiple myeloma.

BioCentriq which opened on the campus of New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) in Newark is arguably in the same geographic market for talent as the Discovery Labs. The problem is that even in the New Jersey-Philadelphia corridor there is a shortage of adequately trained scientists Hartounian says. Last year NJIT launched a professional science master’s degree program in cell and gene therapy.

BioCentriq operates a clinical production site and training facility on the Newark campus and a pilot plant in South Brunswick New Jersey. The company is partly funded by the university but its staff members are all from industry Hartounian says.

While BioCentriq promotes itself on its website as a CDMO for cell and gene therapy Hartounian distinguishes between its approach and that of a traditional CDMO. “If you go to a traditional CDMO you give them a project and they work on it using their own resources” he says whereas customers work on-site at BioCentriq.

“It’s kind of a hotel type of approach” he says. “Companies can rent a clean room or even bring their own scientists and engineers and chemists and work with our scientists to develop their product. It’s very attractive for these companies because they have control.”

The company has 12 employees but expects to triple its staff in a matter of months Hartounian says. In March it announced that it will provide clinical manufacturing of Tevogen Bio’s investigational T-cell-based COVID-19 treatment. “We are conducting aggressive business development in discussions with many companies” Hartounian says. “That means we are going to reach capacity.”

Evolution

The Boston area not surprisingly is shaping up as another hub of research and manufacturing support for cell and gene therapy companies. One emerging player is the Center for Advanced Biological Innovation and Manufacturing (CABIM) a partnership between Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies Cytiva the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Harvard University and Alexandria Real Estate Equities.

Announced in November 2019 the center recently leased a 3700 m2 facility at the Arsenal on Charles research park in Watertown Massachusetts. CABIM will operate as an incubator but for cell and gene therapy process development researchers rather than for start-up companies according to Daniel DeVido director of business development at Fujifilm Diosynth.

CABIM teams Fujifilm Diosynth the biologics unit of Japan’s Fujifilm with Cytiva a supplier of single-use cell manufacturing equipment in facilitating research at the two universities. Other leading Boston-area institutions are also clients including Massachusetts General Hospital Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

DeVido describes Fujifilm’s move into cell and gene therapy as beginning with its 2011 acquisition of Diosynth a biologic-drug CDMO in North Carolina. “What better way to understand biologics than to acquire a CDMO and sort of see what the universe of biologics looks like?” says DeVido who joined the company in 2012.

The Diosynth acquisition led to the 2014 purchase of Kalon Biotherapeutics a manufacturer of vaccines made in mammalian cell culture from the State of Texas and Texas A&M University. “But it became obvious that gene therapy was going to be the big use for viral vector production whether as products or lentivirus vectors that are used to edit cells” DeVido says. “The business evolved.”

The Texas operation’s grounding in biologics and vaccines directed that evolution. “We had a couple of really top-notch virologists but from a process standpoint we are borrowing a lot from all our experience in biologics.” There are basic similarities between growing cells to produce and isolate proteins and growing cells to produce and isolate viruses as viral vectors. “It’s not apples and oranges” DeVido says. “We were able to bank on a lot of our experience.”

Pharmaceutical services for cell and gene therapy will likely remain mostly separate from the traditional CDMO market DeVido says. But that isn’t stopping other large pharmaceutical services firms from moving into the field.

Lonza one of the largest CDMOs and a pioneer in both small- and large-molecule services is an example.

“Typically Lonza is forward looking and through its history there have been unnoticed acquisitions of pioneering technologies or companies acquisitions of relatively small size that would not make it into the headlines” says Alberto Santagostino senior vice president of the firm’s cell and gene therapy business unit.

One such acquisition was the 2010 purchase of Vivante GMP Solutions in Pearland Texas. The biologics services operation grew organically into a dedicated cell and gene therapy facility that Lonza inaugurated in 2018. Today the company provides related services in Portsmouth New Hampshire; the Netherlands; and Singapore.

We had a couple of really top-notch virologists but from a process standpoint we are borrowing a lot from all our experience in biologics. Daniel DeVido director of business development Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies

Big spenders

Other big pharma services firms entered the arena more precipitously with headline-making acquisitions.

Catalent paid $1.2 billion for Paragon Bioservices in 2019 getting two Baltimore-area facilities making AAV and lentivirus vectors. The company has since added production of plasmid DNA (pDNA) a building block for cell and gene therapy-based vaccines. An $18 million deal in 2019 to acquire viral vector sites from Novavax in Gaithersburg and Rockville Maryland filled out the company’s regional presence.

In Europe Catalent paid $315 million to acquire the Belgian firm MaSTherCell a clinical-scale cell therapy manufacturing specialist in 2020 and an undisclosed amount earlier this year to buy Delphi Genetics a pDNA specialist also in Belgium. Catalent purchased the production assets of the cell therapy firm Bone Therapeutics which is on the same industrial campus as MaSTherCell last year. The purchase gives Catalent accesses to large-scale manufacturing pending the opening of a new facility at MaSTherCell next year.

New field



Catalent a diverse CDMO to start with has taken on something fundamentally new with cell therapy says Colleen Floreck a former Paragon employee who is now vice president of marketing and strategy for Catalent’s cell and gene therapy business.

“I think it was a decent-size pivot for Catalent when they purchased Paragon” Floreck says. “What made the marriage work is that Catalent is a very established player in biologics scale-up and manufacturing. There are quite a few similarities.” Cell growth and development for example are fundamental to both biologics and cell therapy.

“But then there are significant differences” she says. The cell therapy market is “100% emerging” whereas the biologics market is relatively mature. “Then you couple that with the level of innovation” Floreck says plus the relative lack of standards and the contrasts become formidable.

“In the biologics business there are only so many processes that are optimized for producing a protein. You are not going to make new ones when there are gold standards on the market” Floreck says. “For gene and cell therapy these magic bullets don’t exist or at least not yet. That’s what everybody is trying to develop.”

Catalent’s approach to such challenges has been to embed the cell and gene therapy unit in its biologics business where it has access to support in the areas of quality and regulatory control supply chain management and overall infrastructure.

Thermo Fisher Scientific on a track nearly parallel to Catalent’s plunged into cell and gene therapy in 2019 with the $1.7 billion purchase of Brammer Bio a contract manufacturer of viral vectors. The company subsequently acquired Novasep’s viral vector business in Belgium. Like Catalent it is growing its cell and gene therapy CDMO business unit as part of a larger biologics business.

Brammer’s headquarters in Gainesville Florida are the locus of viral vector development and analytics for Thermo Fisher. But two-thirds of the company’s US workforce for viral vectors is in Massachusetts where it operates several sites including a manufacturing facility in Cambridge that Brammer acquired from Biogen in 2017 and a viral vector production site that Brammer built in Lexington.

Thermo Fisher recently acquired a building in Plainville about a 45 min drive from Boston where it will bring more viral vector production on line next year.

Thermo Fisher continues to invest in the Florida operations where it focuses on developing processes and analytics says Christopher Murphy vice president and general manager of viral vector services. “We want to expand there to help smaller companies just starting with their molecules to get going in their clinical trials and then if their product matures move up to one of our commercial manufacturing sites.”

WuXi AppTec another large CDMO offers cell and gene therapy services in China and in the Philadelphia Navy Yard where it began cell therapy manufacturing in 2004 and gene therapy in 2014. Last month the Chinese firm announced the acquisition of Oxgene a UK-based specialist in cell and gene therapies for a reported $135 million.

David Chang CEO of WuXi Advanced Therapies a division of WuXi AppTec says the company’s expertise in cell and gene therapy has grown from an early emphasis on biologics testing which it began in Philadelphia 15 years ago. That emphasis is reflected in the firm’s addition of a T to what it describes as a CTDMO approach Chang says. The company began adding process development and manufacturing services 8 years ago.

Oxgene an innovator in AAV and lentiviral vector manufacturing adds a European site but it also adds capabilities Chang says. “Oxgene allows us to go into early-stage plasma design viral vector development and cell line development” he says. “We are striving to provide a comprehensive service to our clients but more importantly we want to ready ourselves to provide the next generation of revolutionary platforms.”

Pharmaron another China-based CDMO has invested internally and through acquisition to add cell and gene therapy to a business that began in small-molecule services.

In November Pharmaron acquired Absorption Systems a US firm offering cell and gene therapy services from sites in San Diego Philadelphia and Boston. This year Pharmaron agreed to acquire a multipurpose biologics facility featuring cell and gene therapy capabilities from AbbVie in Liverpool England for $119 million.

Fast-forward

The run of investment in cell and gene therapies is likely to continue sources agree. Some even predict another large CDMO acquisition in the months ahead.

Aldevron a company whose growth anticipates a booming market is investing heavily in expansion. Based in Fargo North Dakota the producer of pDNA messenger RNA protein and enzyme starting materials for cell and gene therapies and vaccines plans to more than triple capacity this year with the addition of an 18000 m2 facility to its current 6500 m2 operation according to Vijay Surapaneni executive vice president of global operations and supply chain.

And at least one manufacturing technology specialist has made a move into services. Univercells the developer of a single-use bioreactor technology called Scale-X launched a CDMO Exothera a year ago.

“We started by setting up a development team not a manufacturing team” says Thibault Jonckheere deputy CEO of Exothera. “We believe that through our ability to use the best technologies and do data-driven process optimization we can really improve the processes used in gene therapy.” And that includes technology beyond what its parent company offers.

This year Exothera is expanding into CGMP manufacturing building two sites near Brussels. The larger a 13000 m2 facility on the Univercells campus will be ready to go by the end of the year Jonckheere says. The firm employs 70 and plans to double that this year.

Jonckheere says Exothera is entering a services sector with a flexible business model unlike that of a traditional CDMO. “You are less likely to strike 10-year contracts” he says. And that flexibility extends to the lab and the plant where processes are manual and routines are in flux.

“As a manufacturer I don’t like that” Jonckheere says. “Because you want things to be reproducible and standardized. It shows you mastered what you are doing. But with cell and gene therapies there are a lot of complex mechanisms at play so we are not there yet.”

Other executives share Jonckheere’s unease about the wide-open scientifically challenging sector. But like him they also feel a sense of competitive exhilaration.",,,,,,,,,,,,
CAT,Caterpillar,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL2Fwci8xOC9jYXRlcnBpbGxhci13YXJzLXRpbWUtdG8tcGljay1zaWRlcy1pbi1iYXR0bGUtb2YtY29saW4tdi1jdXRoYmVydNIBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL2Fwci8xOC9jYXRlcnBpbGxhci13YXJzLXRpbWUtdG8tcGljay1zaWRlcy1pbi1iYXR0bGUtb2YtY29saW4tdi1jdXRoYmVydA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caterpillar wars: time to pick sides in battle of Colin v Cuthbert,"Colin the Caterpillar first darkened M&S’s shelves in the autumn of 1990 mere weeks before Margaret Thatcher stood down as prime minister. It’s too simple to put the timing down to coincidence. The symbolism was obvious. Here was an anthropomorphic chocolate sponge log ready to hold the nation’s hand through the coming decade. The lady wasn’t for turning; the new guy wasn’t for turning into a butterfly. In a confusing and fast-changing Britain Colin has been a continuity figure.

The stubbornly larval national icon has been at the centre of a row this week. On Thursday it was reported that M&S had lodged a legal complaint against its discount rival Aldi whose “Cuthbert the Caterpillar” it claims besmirches Colin’s good name. It’s sad to see Colin dragged through the mud like this but he has always been a quietly provocative figure.

As usual it boils down to class. Colin is the perfect example of that faux egalitarianism beloved of middle England. Supermarkets are one of the many ways in which we stratify ourselves and it follows that their familiar products are ambassadors of a certain way of life.

“Ah Colin the Caterpillar” you think popping him into the basket. “There’s something we can all get behind.” It’s misleading. You know what you’re getting with a Colin: chocolate casing “Smarties”-encrusted shell; soft safe sponge. But at £7 he is an exclusive cake quintessentially Tory.

All the same there’s no disputing that he represents a high point of British treat design from his slightly too thick white face down to his little white shoes. Wherever there is a colleague leaving a friend’s birthday forgotten until the last minute an ever-so-slightly awkward child – there you’ll find Colin as staunch a chocolate yeoman as you could hope to meet.

Even the name Colin is a shorthand for honest reliability. Firth Jackson Montgomerie. Nobody called Colin has ever made anyone truly angry except that dweeb in The Secret Garden and nobody’s been annoyed to see a Colin the Caterpillar. Especially not his owners. His peerless versatility has led to more than 15m sales amounting to £105m in today’s money. In the animal character foodstuff game he bows only to his shelfmate Percy the Pig.

Such profitable innovation was always going to attract copycaterpillars. The question we should be asking is not how M&S chanced on a caterpillar as the perfect shape for a cake but why cakes were ever made in other shapes.

Not only are caterpillars one of the few completely cylindrical animals but their furry exteriors give them a friendliness unmatched in the insect world. What’s more their segments lend themselves to knifework and their life of obsessive leaf-munching psychologically primes the recipient for gluttony.

In some ways it’s surprising M&S didn’t take action sooner. More mysterious is why it has gone for Aldi. Every major supermarket has its own caterpillar cake named to suit its brand. Tesco has Curly: simple effective a bit route one. Asda has Clyde which sounds like someone came up with it on a hangover. Waitrose has Cecil who you just know has strong views about Classic FM. Sainsbury’s deviates from the alliterative rule to offer Wiggles which violates a key principle and brings off-puttingly to mind the movement of the insect. (As an aside it’s curious that every chocolate caterpillar sounds like a war poet.) Why is M&S picking on Aldi rather than the others? I think we know: it’s German.

Ultimately the Colin row is not simply a supermarket looking after one of its key players. It goes to the heart of the kind of country we want to live in. If Britain is truly open for business our supermarkets ought to welcome these invigorating market forces which should lead to better cake for all. Cuthbert is an obvious expression of the early Facebook instruction to move fast and break things.The government talks a lot about encouraging this kind of entrepreneurship. If M&S has faith in its product it should have nothing to fear from these knock-offs. By aggressively litigating it is sending a message: get your Cuthbert tanks off Colin’s lawn. It’s protectionism pure and simple.

M&S claims that Cuthbert’s superficial similarities to Colin mislead customers into thinking they are getting a product of equal quality. At just £4.99 it says the Cuthberts can’t hope to match Colin’s sophistication but “ride on the coat-tails” of a more established rival. It reeks of insecurity as if there is a suspicion that perhaps when it comes to chocolate caterpillar cakes form is as important as substance.

Rather than cocooning itself behind lawyers and trademarks M&S ought to be capitalising on its decades of experience and superior brand reputation to stay ahead of the caterpillar field. If its product is so much better the customers will work that out for themselves. Let them eat cake.

We await the outcome of the dispute. Aldi’s social media team has been hard at work with a #freecuthbert campaign calling M&S “snitches” and saying they will be “Colin” their lawyers. There can be no neutrals in the coming war. On the one hand is snooty conservative Colin hiding behind an old brand resting on its ancient innovation. Then there’s Cuthbert the radical newcomer cheekily taking an existing idea and making it cheaper giving the customers what they want. Pick a side. No wriggling out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHkxMDAuY29tL3ZpcmFsL2FsZGktY3V0aGJlcnQtdHdpdHRlci1jb2xpbi1jYXRlcnBpbGxhci1iMTgzMzAyN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aldi steps up defence of Cuthbert cake with viral Twitter campaign – and the Internet is here for it,"Aldi has brought out the big guns in their cake war with Marks & Spencer.

The supermarket launched a #FreeCuthbert hashtag on Twitter on Friday and posted about the caterpillar cake row in a series of amusing tweets that mercilessly mocked its rival.

The campaign was very much in keeping with the rather tickled mood of the nation following the news of the legal battle which spawned a series of memes after it was announced earlier this week.

Unsurprisingly Twitter loved the PR stunt and the thread quickly went viral with most people tweeting in support of the apparent underdog. Here are some of the best tweets from Aldi:

It comes after Marks & Spencer begun legal action against Aldi arguing that Aldi is taking its intellectual property by making a similar cake.

Read more:

M&S wants Aldi to remove the product from sale and agree not to sell anything similar in the future and said the similarity between the cakes would lead consumers to believe they are of the same standard.

A spokesperson said they wanted “to protect Colin Connie and our reputation for freshness quality innovation and value”.

But Aldi have seen the funny side and seem undeterred by the legal issue:

Aldi even managed to reference another viral story from a day earlier when Dulux mocked Spurs with a series of tweets just moments after the football club had announced a new partnership with the paint company. The tweets were later deleted but not before literally everyone had seen them.

They also made reference to the other caterpillar-style cakes created by other supermarkets after many questioned why those chains hadn’t been taken to court:

And even Morrisons has waded into the debate appearing to side with Aldi:

M&S are yet to respond to the Twitter baiting; the supermarket hasn’t posted anything for a few days and only did so to promote a gin liqueur.

We look forward to seeing how they react.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm8uY28udWsvMjAyMS8wNC8xNy9hbGRpLW1vY2tzLW1zLW92ZXItY29saW4tdGhlLWNhdGVycGlsbGFyLXZzLWN1dGhiZXJ0LXRoZS1jYXRlcnBpbGxhci0xNDQyNTEzOC_SAXFodHRwczovL21ldHJvLmNvLnVrLzIwMjEvMDQvMTcvYWxkaS1tb2Nrcy1tcy1vdmVyLWNvbGluLXRoZS1jYXRlcnBpbGxhci12cy1jdXRoYmVydC10aGUtY2F0ZXJwaWxsYXItMTQ0MjUxMzgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aldi mocks M&S on Twitter over Colin vs Cuthbert the Caterpillar,"Aldi has been making the most of its rival’s High Court challenge (Picture: PA)

Aldi is at war with Marks and Spencer over chocolate caterpillar cakes but it doesn’t appear too worried about going to court.

This week it emerged that M&S is suing its rival supermarket claiming it has infringed the copyright of its Colin the Caterpillar cake with its Cuthbert the Caterpillar treat.

The upmarket retailer has accused Aldi of ‘riding on the coat-tails’ of its reputation and in a post on its Instagram page M&S wrote: ‘Colin won’t be commenting but says thanks for your support. #OGColin’

Aldi’s social media team then went to town with sassy responses including puns about the upcoming legal challenge and a sketch of Cuthbert in court.

Starting off by mocking M&S’s slogan the budget supermarket tweeted: ‘This is not just any court case this is… #FreeCuthbert.’

Also also said it was ‘just Colin our lawyers’ and when it asked Judge Rinder how his diary was looking the barrister and TV star replied: ‘I’m in.’

Aldi cracked out the puns and made fun of M&S’s slogan

Aldi also announced a ‘packaging update’ showing poor Cuthbert locked up in a prison cell and then tweeted: ‘Marks & Snitches more like.’

Pointing out that Waitrose Sainsbury’s Tesco and Asda all have chocolate caterpillars of their own Aldi said: ‘Cecil Wiggles Curly Clyde. We got you.’

The German-owned chain finished things off by declaring that Cuthbert ‘has been found GUILTY…of being delicious’.

M&S first created Colin the Caterpillar in 1990 and has gone on to sell more than 15million of the milk chocolate cakes.

Colin’s appearance has remained substantially unchanged since 2004 except for some adaptations for Christmas and Halloween.

The range has also been expanded to include an extra-large version a mini version and Colin’s girlfriend Connie the Caterpillar.

An M&S spokesperson said: ‘Because we know the M&S brand is special to our customers and they expect only the very best from us love and care goes into every M&S product on our shelves.

‘So we want to protect Colin Connie and our reputation for freshness quality innovation and value.’

An Aldi spokesperson told Metro.co.uk: ‘Cuthbert has lots of caterpillar friends at other supermarkets including Curly Clyde Cecil Morris and Wiggles.

‘He has always played by the rules and is grateful for all the support he’s received from Aldi customers #freecuthbert.’

Hint: It's Not Because Of The Winter Storm,"TPR's Jerry Clayton recently spoke with Texas A&M Agrilife Extension entomologist Molly Keck about the overabundance of caterpillars in the area this year.

If you've spent any amount of time outside recently you may have noticed what looks like an invasion of caterpillars. What's going on? Molly Keck is an entomologist with the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service.

Jerry Clayton: It seems like there's a lot of caterpillars around this year. What's going on?

Keck: Well we're seeing this year for whatever reason an overload of Canker Worms. And in some pockets I'm also seeing some Oak Leaf Rollers. But by and large the worm that is the most common is a Canker Worm. And they're real similar to Oak Leaf Rollers. They kind of repel out of the tree when the wind blows or they get disturbed by a silk strand and then use that as a lifeline to get back up. But they also have a tendency more than Oak Leaf rollers to falling off the tree and climb up the houses and crawl into little tiny cracks in the house that just get all over other things.

Clayton: What's the difference between an Oak Leaf Roller and a Canker Worm?

Keck: So the Oak Leaf Rollers are kind of a lime green real light colored green with a black dark hardened head capsule and the Canker Worms come in two different colors. There's a green color and then there's a grayish brown color. And that's what I'm seeing the most of. And they inch. So they're also called Inch Worms. In the past we've seen Oak Leaf Rollers in huge numbers. This year it's Canker Worms.

Clayton: Are the Oak Leaf Rollers detrimental to the oak trees?

Keck: Oak Leaf Rollers generally don't cause any damage to the trees. Canker Worms in super high numbers can defoliate trees. But these are going to be trees that are not mature really not established oak trees. And both of them prefer oaks by and large. The best thing to do for either one is just to wait them out. The trees that do get defoliated will leaf back out again.

Clayton: And these caterpillars they will attach themselves at some point and then they will undergo the process to become whatever they're going to be. Is that correct?

Keck: They will. And they neither one will turn into anything very attractive. So ... if you step on one ... you're not killing anything that's going to become a beautiful butterfly. They just become kind of gray camouflage looking moths and you know as many as many caterpillars as we're seeing. I doubt we're going to notice more moths in the later part of the spring or early summer. It's just [that you] notice them in that form for whatever reason. And then the laws just kind of do their own thing.

Clayton: You said you've been seeing a lot. Is there any particular reason you can think of why there seems to be so many of them?

Keck: A lot of people want to attribute their population increase to the cold weather and I think that's just a coincidence. I really don't think that there's a link there. It might be because there's just a lot of pollen and a lot of fresh new leaves. And so there's more food for them. And when there's a lot more food the babies all survive. So that could play a role. But I think we were going to see this happen this year no matter what the weather was like in the wintertime. I think this is just the year they decided to be numerous.

Clayton: And I guess this dispels any thoughts that the major freeze had an adverse effect on insects. They seem to be doing just fine.

Keck: They definitely are. That's definitely a question a lot of people have called and asked about. And unfortunately insects have so many different defense mechanisms to overcome cold weather. They either hunker down and hide somewhere where it doesn't freeze there in a life form over the winter time. That just doesn't get cold enough like a pupa where it's ... a little case and it's insulated. Or they also have things in their body chemicals in their body that act like antifreeze. So there's all these adaptations that they have unless it's a really tropical species. Entomologists as a group we've all actually talked about this quite a bit. We really don't think that that freeze that happened over February played any major impact on any insect populations.

Many of us regularly turn to Netflix for our documentary fix knowing we'll find a film or series on pretty much any topic we fancy. Want to find out about a bloke in South Africa becoming best mates with an octopus? That's all there. A guy who offers up sexual favours for bottles of Evian at a doomed festival? Er yep that too.



But there's one story that hasn't yet been covered and that's the ongoing saga of Cuthbert the Caterpillar versus Colin the Caterpillar - the two larval birthday cakes from two rival supermarkets.

Earlier this week M&S launched an intellectual property claim with the High Court arguing the similarity of Aldi's Cuthbert the Caterpillar cake leads consumers to believe they are of the same standard and 'rides on the coat-tails' of M&S' reputation with Colin who made his debut more than 30 years ago.

Aldi has refused to go quietly having dedicated its social media feeds to the #FreeCuthbert hashtag - having even mocked up new packaging for Cuthbert placing the friendly animal behind bars inside his box.

And the drama has not gone unmissed with many people calling for Netflix to make a documentary on the legal row.

One person tweeted: ""I would watch a seven part Netflix series about the M&S vs. Aldi Colin the Caterpillar lawsuit.""

Advert

Another agreed: ""Should be the next Netflix series this. Colin versus Cuthbert!""

A third said: ""Patiently waiting for Netflix to drop the 6 part documentary on the Colin the Caterpillar case.""

Some people have even gone as far as to create promotional material for the hypothetical docu-series.

Aldi's keen too having tweeted Netflix suggesting: ""Working title: Making a Caterpillar. Any other suggestions? #FreeCuthbert.""

Advert

Another suggested BBC's Panorama could get in on the action instead adding: ""Getting butterflies in anticipation.""

Very very good.

M&S has three trademarks relating to Colin and believes it/he has an enhanced distinctive character and reputation.

A spokesperson said: ""Because we know the M&S brand is special to our customers and they expect only the very best from us love and care goes into every M&S product on our shelves.

Advert

""We want to protect Colin Connie and our reputation for freshness quality innovation and value.""

So far there's been no such beef with Sainsbury's Wiggles Tesco's Curly Morris by Morrisons the Co-op's Charlie Cecil by Waitrose or Asda's Clyde - all of which are also caterpillar cakes.

The penthouse — plus a ground-floor courtyard several terraces and hospitality amenities — are part of a $350 million redevelopment by the building’s new owners Tribeca Investment Group (TIG) PGIM Real Estate and Meadow Partners. They bought a 99-year leasehold in 2019 for $375 million.

TIG is tapping its expertise as developer of hotels — Midtown’s Baccarat and the FiDi Moxy — to help create what TIG founding principal Elliott Ingerman calls a “talent playground for large corporations to draw and retain talent.”

The now mostly vacant full-blockfront building was home to textile industry firms as recently as two years ago. It will be open to new tenants in the third quarter of 2022.

The owners have 700000 square feet to fill in a depressed market. But they’re counting on a post-pandemic revival as well as a central Midtown South location within walking distance of both Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal to justify their total $725 million investment.

“We feel very good about our basis” a confident Ingerman said.

The 34000-square-foot penthouse designed by Studios Architecture will boast floor-to-ceiling windows shaped to echo the ground-floor Neoclassical-style archways. The greenery-filled lobby will have a café a library and direct access to a rear courtyard — among other new elements to provide fresh air — that was previously used as a loading area.

Floor plates of 44000 square feet on floors 1-16 and a smaller 17th floor with a wraparound terrace should appeal to “larger tenants who want larger blocks” Ingerman said. Floors feature slab-to-slab ceiling heights from 12 to 17 feet exposed steel columns with rivets and new windows.

“A lot of technology tenants are looking for this type of space and now so are the banks” he said.

Asking rents will run from $95 a square foot at the base to $135 psf in the penthouse. A CBRE team led by Peter Turchin is handling leasing. The property is “unlike anything else on the market today” Turchin said.

Empire State Realty Trust has signed two new office leases totaling more than 60000 square feet within a block of one another.

Burlington Stores is nearly doubling its space at 1400 Broadway adding 33125 square feet on the 11th floor to the 35182 sf it already has. The asking rent was $72 per square foot.

The publicly traded retailer’s executive vice president Gayle Aertker said “As Burlington continues to grow we appreciate ESRT’s partnership allowing us to invest further in our merchandising team.”

Meanwhile Zentalis Pharmaceuticals is a new tenant at 1359 Broadway. The clinical-stage biopharmaceutical firm is taking 31362 sf. The ask was $73 psf.

Zentalis CEO Dr. Anthony Sun said “We are committed to ensuring our employees’ safety and well-being and our new corporate office space will provide a healthy and productive work environment to help bring our innovative cancer treatment to patients.

Buddy’s Dog Den which calls itself “Brooklyn’s Urban Dog Retreat” at its eight-year Williamsburg location is expanding to Manhattan. The provider of “home-like” pooch pampering will open in May at 1105 First Ave. near East 61st Street.

Its 4000 square feet on two levels will include dog runs as well as extensive grooming services. The ground-floor asking rent was $110 per square foot.

The lease was arranged by Lee & Associates. The firm’s Richard Kave said “I’ve been helping Buddy’s owner Lynne-Marie Paquette find a Manhattan location for more than three years.”

Kave repped the tenant. Winick Realty Group’s Hal Shapiro represented the landlord. The brokers worked together 15 years ago when Kave brought Running Paws Athletic Club to the same First Avenue location. Running Paws was later acquired by AKC Canine Retreat the most recent tenant in the space.

“What makes this deal particularly sweet” Kave added “is that Lynne-Marie expects to be able to rehire two or three former employees who she had to furlough at the Brooklyn location due to COVID-19 and a downturn in her business.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxuZXdzYXNpYS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3Mvc2hvcGhvdXNlcy1kZW1hbmQtZm9yZWlnbi1idXllcnMtZmFtaWx5LW9mZmljZXMtMjA2ODQx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Foreign buyers family offices and funds prop up demand for shophouses,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/shophouses-demand-foreign-buyers-family-offices-206841 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxuZXdzYXNpYS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3Mvc2hvcGhvdXNlcy1kZW1hbmQtZm9yZWlnbi1idXllcnMtZmFtaWx5LW9mZmljZXMtMjA2ODQx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Eight people were killed and others were wounded at an Indianapolis FedEx plant near the city's airport. The suspected assailant 19-year-old Brandon Scott Hole killed himself. He had been an employee of FedEx.

It's been a few years but this region has also seen workplace tragedies.

The most recent was on June 25 2008 when a 25-year-old worker at Atlantis Plastics in Henderson named Wesley Neal Higdon killed his supervisor and four other employees before turning his weapon on himself.

At vigil: Survivors mourn those lost in FedEx shooting: 'I watched too many people die'

Crescent Plastics on Evansville's North Side was the scene of a deadly shooting on July 29 1981.

In that incident W. Bernard ""Buddy"" Peak 43 Crescent vice president of manufacturing and Glenn Stahl 53 the company's production foreman were killed by Daryl D. McReynolds then a 31-year-old former Crescent machinist.

McReynolds had threatened revenge after being fired. He was shot by police while leaving the plant but he survived and later went to prison.

For local businesses of all types who want training in active shooter situations or who want to freshen up some older plans area law enforcement officials said they are available to help.

Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding who was a young deputy when the Cresent Plastics incident occurred has conducted training for businesses churches and others and said he's available to do more.

He said the instruction includes things such as what doors to keep unlocked and locked and how someone with potential for violence might be recognized.

""Gun violence is not new to the United States"" Wedding said. ""It always has and will always continue to be a problem. We need tougher laws for illegal possession of weapons and certainly tough laws for people who use guns in commission of crimes.""

The Evansville Police Department also makes officers available for training about active shooter situations said Sgt. Nick Winsett a department spokesman.

Henderson County Sheriff Ed Brady said he's also conducted trainings from time to time on how to plan for a shooting scenario and churches often are those interested.

He said he's been asked by churches for instance if a congregation member should be armed and where that person should be seated in the event of an active shooter.

An armed church member ""needs training on when not to shoot as well as when to shoot"" Brady said. ""There are some situations where it could get worse by opening fire. The same thing with a business.""

Any law enforcement agency said Brady ""would be happy to go into a (business or church) and talk about it before the fact.""

Area businesses said active shooter preparedness is discussed at high levels and always taken very seriously.

“Health and safety of our employees is our top priority"" said a statement by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana Corporate Communications Director Stacy Carr. ""TMMI leadership and plant security work in partnership with local emergency personnel and law enforcement to establish protocols and processes to ensure the safety and security of our employees.”

""Everyone at Accuride is saddened by the most recent mass shooting this time in Indianapolis"" said Grant Hatton marketing director of the company which has a factory in Henderson and corporate offices in Evansville. ""Because of the increase of deadly workplace violence over the last decade Accuride has implemented threat awareness training covering workplace violence and active shooter situations. More recently we invited the Evansville Police Department to conduct active shooter training at our corporate headquarters here.""

CenterPoint Energy Director of Communications Natalie Hedde said in a statement: ""CenterPoint Energy extends its deepest condolences to all impacted by the fatal and tragic shooting which took place in Indianapolis. I can share that all of our employees complete required active shooter training each year as the safety and security of our employees is of highest importance and a core value to our organization.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

The news came in a recent press release and the new permissions allow the college to grow industrial hemp for educational purposes which it has already started doing.

“We’re the only state college at the moment actually having undergraduate students with hands-on experience producing or cultivating this particular crop which is exciting for our students” Agribusiness Program Manager Tavis Douglass said. “They’re excited to be a part of this emerging industry and very few folks in the state of Florida are able to get this experience without necessarily obtaining a license themselves.”

A variety of cannabis

Industrial hemp and the perhaps more well-known medical marijuana both fall under the species cannabis sativa but they are different varieties. Industrial hemp has many uses including in fibers papers sustainable plastics livestock and equine feed and the concrete alternative “hempcrete.”

“By federal law and state law these varieties have to have a THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) content of 0.3% or less” Douglass said noting that industrial hemp has been bred to remove much of this psychoactive component unlike medical marijuana which has THC levels greater than 0.3%.

Industrial hemp does have notable amounts of cannabinoid compounds CBD and CBG which may have therapeutic effects.

One of the requirements of growing hemp under the license granted by the Florida Department of Agriculture’s Division of Plant Industry is that the college sends parts of the plants for testing before harvesting to ensure the THC level is under 0.3%.

A smooth process

The division began offering hemp cultivation licenses in April 2020 and Douglass applied late last year.

“It wasn’t as complicated as one might think” he said comparing it to other certifications for food safety and organic standards.

Requirements included a background screening GPS coordinates of the site a plan for containing the crop (such as planting cover crops or putting up barriers) proper signage on the facilities and a property classified for agricultural or industrial land use.

For the college that property is the Vintage Farm Campus. The 103 acres on County Road 475 were donated by a Marion County resident in December 2016. Complete with a renovated farmhouse and barn the property offers important hands-on agricultural and equine experience.

After the license was granted in January the program didn’t waste any time purchasing certified seeds and planting them in February and March.

A new educational tool

Students are growing the crops both outdoors and in an indoor greenhouse hydroponics system. Various classes have worked on distinct parts of the process from germinating to irrigating to preparing beds to planting.

“We're actually instructing students (not only) on the cultivation of hemp but plants in general” Douglass said. “Everything from sunlight pests and disease soils irrigation health how all of that ties in and how that will help them better understand the hemp industry or any other agricultural industry that they choose to go into once they complete their degree at CF.”

The crop which will be destroyed after harvest per state guidelines is becoming a helpful learning tool in the school's courses. Between the agribusiness and equine programs as well as the Vintage Farm Campus Douglass considered hemp a natural fit for the school.

“Both of those programs are extremely unique to the state of Florida. Not many other institutions have that” he said. “We’re uniquely set up to be able to add this to our program this particular crop and teach this particular industry.”

Douglass also hopes to incorporate the plant into other agribusiness courses by considering the economics of crop yields fertilizer application and labor input.

In fall 2021 or spring 2022 the college is also planning a short-term noncredit course or lecture on industrial hemp for the community.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The residents couldn't afford to spend hundreds of dollars a month paying for internet access but they also couldn't easily work from home e-learn make telehealth appointments or talk to folks at the CMHA which closed in-person operations.

""After COVID hit it became very clear to me that our affordable housing portfolio didn’t have the access they needed to work with us"" CHMA chief operating officer Scott Scharlach said.

More:New initiative aims to broaden access to internet in Franklin County

So the housing authority began last year exploring how to accomplish this and partnered with Charter Communications better known as Spectrum to provide broadband to more than 4500 residents at 18 CMHA properties across Columbus free of charge.

The total cost of the project will not exceed $3.5 million over the next five years which CMHA's board of commissioners stipulated in its negotiations with Spectrum but the housing authority was unable to provide a monthly cost analysis due to a signed confidentiality agreement.

Installation will finally begin next week and service will available to all CMHA properties by the end of May.

""We felt very strongly that having access to high-speed internet is almost like a utility"" Scharlach said. ""All of our apartment communities have access — it’s hardwired for internet service but cost is a barrier for our residents so we decided to pay for internet.""

'You're really behind the 8-ball without it'

This partnership is designed to bridge the digital divide in Columbus specifically the financial barrier between low-wage earners and the service many advocates refer to as a ""21st century utility.""

More than half of CMHA's 4000-plus apartments are allocated for families earning 30% or less of Columbus' median income which is approximately $26500 annually for a family of four Scharlach said.

""You’re really behind the 8-ball without it"" he said of high-speed internet access.

A 2020 report released by The Columbus Foundation and conducted by AECOM an international civil infrastructure research and planning company which has operations in Columbus revealed that despite economic and technological barriers the infrastructure is there and at least one high-speed internet provider is available in the poorest neighborhoods and communities.

More:Lack of broadband hinders at-home schooling

Franklin County Board of Commissioners President Kevin Boyce said finding a way to build a connection between publicly funded institutions such as CMHA and private companies like Spectrum to expand access to underserved communities is imperative.

“I believe public policy and the actions that we take can be the catalyst to changing long-term situations such as the digital divide that negatively impacts the ability of students to learn and succeed in the classroom and in their community” Boyce said in a release.

Recognizing the basic infrastructure was already laid made the decision a no-brainer for the housing authority.

""Our goal is to close digital divide within our housing communities so we're putting our money where our mouth is"" Scharlach said.

Internet access builds equity

This broadband expansion effort is also an extension of Spectrum Community Solutions' goal to increase connectivity amid families in the communities the telecommunications giant serves that normally have significant financial roadblocks to access.

“This collaboration helps close the digital divide by providing high-quality high-speed broadband for families who need reliable connectivity” said Adam Ray executive vice president of Spectrum's community organization.

The housing authority hopes to offer older tenants (CHMA has 600-700 units serving senior citizens) educational opportunities to learn how to use a computer or navigate an iPad Scharlach explained.

""Right now we're working on how we're going to be providing equipment and technological literacy classes"" he said. ""If a resident needs education or equipment we're hoping to fulfill that for them for free or at least at a highly discounted rate.""

Scharlach said he hopes this initiative which reflects the mission of the housing authority will inspire other cities and even the federal government — the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development helps fund the CHMA — to prioritize broadband across the country.

""We feel it’s so important to do we’re willing to pay for it"" Scharlach said ""in hopes one day HUD will recognize it as a utility and help provide it to all of America's lowest income families.""

CVX,Chevron Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xOC9idXNpbmVzcy9mb3NzaWwtZnVlbC1hZHZlcnRpc2luZy1iYW4vaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBR2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMDQvMTgvYnVzaW5lc3MvZm9zc2lsLWZ1ZWwtYWR2ZXJ0aXNpbmctYmFu?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oil company ads should carry a climate health warning say activists,"London CNN Business —

A group of lawyers want oil companies banned from advertising on television and social media unless they include “tobacco-style health warnings” about the dangers fossil fuels pose to the future of the planet.

In new research published Monday environmental law non-profit ClientEarth accused some of the world’s biggest oil firms of misrepresenting the role their businesses play in the climate crisis and overstating the speed at which they are transitioning to clean energy sources.

“The companies most responsible for catastrophically heating the planet are spending millions on advertising campaigns about how their business plans are focused on sustainability” ClientEarth lawyer Johnny White said in a statement.

“Greenwashing is a problem because it can mislead the public about the true environmental cost of persisting with fossil fuels and twist wider public conversations on the climate emergency that stymy efforts to mitigate climate change” he added.

ExxonMobil Chevron (CVX) Shell Saudi Aramco Total (TOT) and Norwegian state oil company Equinor are among the biggest oil companies for which ClientEarth has compiled dossiers that compare their climate pledges to their business practices. It said it is considering options for legal action against these companies.

ClientEarth commissioned investigative media outlet DeSmog to research advertising by major oil companies. It then compared claims made in ads to information published in annual reports regulatory filings and on company websites.

The non-profit contends that firms make claims of “sustainability” while investing far more into fossil fuel exploration than into clean energy investments.

Companies claim to be addressing the climate crisis while in some cases increasing fossil fuel production or planning to rely on the large-scale use of carbon capture and “offsets” instead of reducing emissions in absolute terms ClientEarth added.

Chevron Shell and Equinor told CNN Business that their emissions reductions targets are in line with the goals of the Paris agreement.

Saudi Aramco said it has taken steps to reduce the carbon intensity of its oil exploration and extraction activities and it is investing in lower carbon solutions. “The technologies required to meet carbon emission goals are yet to reach the levels of maturity required to provide the world’s energy needs in an economically sustainable manner” it added.

ExxonMobil and Total did not respond to emailed requests for comment.

In 2019 ClientEarth submitted a complaint against BP (BP) in the United Kingdom on the basis of OECD guidelines which stipulate fair advertising practices for multinational enterprises. BP (BP) later pulled an advertising campaign called Possibilities Everywhere and re-directed the funds to support its net zero ambitions. In 2020 the company pledged to stop “corporate reputation advertising.”

Fossil fuel advertising should be regulated along the same lines as tobacco with “health warnings” about the dangers of climate change that identify fossil fuels as the main contributor to global warming said ClientEarth.

Companies should also be clear about how much they are spending on fossil fuels compared to low carbon businesses and they should be banned from directly promoting fossil fuel products it added.

Tobacco advertising has been progressively restricted since the 1970s with some countries banning it entirely. Warnings about the health risks associated with smoking most notably lung cancer have been mandatory on cigarette boxes in most countries for several decades. Brand-free packaging has also been introduced in some countries a move Big Tobacco resisted fiercely.

The Paris agreement aims to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To achieve that fossil fuel production needs to be cut by roughly 6% every year but current projections show an annual increase of 2% according to the Production Gap Report.

The International Energy Agency said in a report last year that if today’s power plants industrial plants buildings and vehicles continue to rely on burning fossil fuels that would lock in a temperature rise of 1.65 degrees Celsius.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change without a sharp decline in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 global warming will surpass 1.5 degrees Celsius leading to “irreversible loss” of the most fragile ecosystems and ongoing climate crises for the world’s most vulnerable people.

Leading stock indexes continued their winning streak with S&P 500 maintaining the uptrend for the fourth week in a row and hitting a new high.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 34000-mark for the first time adding around 150 points in the last session. The sentiment was buoyed by encouraging retail sales data and reports of jobless claims falling.

The first-quarter earnings season got off to a good start with banking giants JPMorgan Chase Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs unveiling their latest financial data mid-week. They were joined by software firm Infosys on Wednesday.

The spotlight stayed on financial services Thursday also when the closely followed reports of Citigroup and Bank of America came out. Delta Air Lines and soft-drink behemoth PepsiCo released earnings on the same day. The first phase of bank earnings concluded on Friday with Morgan Stanley’s blockbuster Q1 report.

It’s going to be mixed bag next week. For instance the companies scheduled to report on April 19 include United Airlines Holdings IBM and Coca-Cola. The important corporate houses preparing to report on April 20 comprise Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson as well as streaming giant Netflix which has been thriving on the COVID-driven boom. The earning reports of superbike company Harley-Davidson and Lockheed Martin are also slated for Tuesday.

The other major companies that can elicit investor interest include Halliburton Verizon Communications Chipotle Mexican Grill and Kinder Morgan – the companies will report earnings on April 21. The next day it is the turn of American Airlines and Southwest Airlines as well as tech firms AT&T and Intel. American Express is probably the only big player to report on April 23.

The market was abuzz with the news of Microsoft’s $20-billion buyout of cloud software company Nuance Communications. In another important deal in the cloud space Datadog completed the acquisition of the SaaS-based security platform Sqreen.

The otherwise quiet M&A market witnessed Dell Technologies becoming two standalone public companies by spinning off its 81% ownership in VMware. The other major deals include Amgen’s $2-billion purchase of Five Prime Therapeutics and the acquisition of Upchain by software firm Autodesk.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

Plans for a food village showcasing local produce and traders in the grounds of a church during the Isle of Man TT race festival have been thrown out.

The idea was put forward by the Manx Food Market Traders Association which organises food markets on North Quay.

It would have been held in the grounds of St Ninian’s Church in Douglas between 27 May and 8 June.

But the planning committee rejected the application amid concerns over increased traffic parking issues noise odour and the effect on the existing food offering at the grandstand during the period.

The association had put forward plans for one-sided marquees food trucks and street food vendors accompanied by musical entertainment with a pop-up fine dining restaurant in the eaves of the church in the evening.

Resident concerns

In its objection to the plans the Department for Enterprise said there was already due to be “significant food offerings” at the grandstand during the festival but would have supported the village had it been in the town centre.

The DfE also said traffic would be “directed along and away” from the area to alleviate the issues raised by residents previously but holding the food festival may exacerbate the problem.

Concerns were also expressed over the effects of the noise and smell of the festival and potential issues with parking and access to the area for residents of a nearby retirement complex.

But the planning committee heard there had been no concerns raised by environmental health about the smells and the highways authority had “bottomed out” its concerns over traffic with the organisers.

Organisers had also said they would provide parking at a separate site for up to 200 motorcycles and music would be acoustic rather than amplified.

Although the planning officer had recommended the application be approved the committee unanimously refused it citing concerns over the impact on amenity for local residents the existing offer at the grandstand and traffic in the area.

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- From Irwin to North Braddock to Ross Township multiple types of disruptions impacting church services have taken place throughout the Pittsburgh area within the last several weeks.

One of the incidents involved a gun pulled on a pastor during a sermon while another consisted of vandalism impacting an organ and sound equipment.

New federal funding has been approved to help increase security for places of worship and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says that all types of churches are welcome to apply.

Places of worship can apply for funding through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and can use the funds for whatever they would like as long as it helps add security. The deadline to apply for funding is May 21.

""I thank God because only God stopped and jammed this gun.""

A man was arrested in North Braddock on Sunday after pulling a gun on a pastor during his sermon at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church -- and it was all caught on camera.

Bernard Polite is facing attempted homicide and aggravated assault charges and is accused of trying to shoot and kill the pastor.

As the pastor ducked out of the way Polite was tackled by a deacon and held down on the ground until police arrived.

Police are also investigating after a man was found shot to death in Polite's home near the church. It's unclear if he is responsible for that shooting.

""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

A church in Westmoreland County fell victim to vandalism late last week and is looking for help identifying the teenagers responsible for the damage.

As a result of the vandalism the church was unable to use the organ for the first two Holy Communion masses the following morning.

The church is now asking for help identifying the two teenagers and say that information will be turned over to Irwin Police.

""It would be nice if people could just practice their religions in peace.""

Last month a man was reported to be walking into nearly a dozen area churches includes St. Sebastian Church in Ross Township and yelling at a priest that he was the devil.

Parishioners said that these type of incidents are especially disturbing because the man's intentions weren't clear.

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

“We love having our space open almost recklessly open for the neighborhood” the Rev. Kevin Deal St. John’s vicar told Episcopal News Service. Serving its community “has been part of the DNA of St. John’s almost since its inception 164 years ago.”

St. John’s provides space for more than just sleeping through its partnership with the Gubbio Project a nonprofit organization that serves unhoused people with “safe compassionate respite during the day” according to its website.

The project takes its name from an Italian town where according to legend St. Francis of Assisi brokered a truce between a hungry wolf and frightened townspeople. The nonprofit was founded in 2004 and moved into space at St. John’s in 2017.

Lydia Bransten Gubbio’s executive director since 2021 told ENS that the legend embodies what her organization is about. “When people come together with mutual need we find commonality and can work together” she said.

Their response shines a light not only on homelessness in general but on how communities across the country seek to address it. Homelessness has been on the rise across the United States since 2017 and cities have grappled with how where and even if to provide shelters or housing. A lawsuit against Grants Pass Oregon for its decision to fine homeless people for sleeping outside on public property made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court for oral arguments on April 22.

According to the Associated Press one-third of the country’s unhoused population live in western states like Oregon and California. The San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing’s 2022 Point-in-Time count found more than 7700 unhoused people in the city with more than 4000 of them unsheltered. The 2024 count is due out this summer.

While unhoused people have existed in America since the 17th century their needs have grown more acute than ever since the COVID-19 pandemic Bransten said. Homeless people in San Francisco who weren’t gravely disabled or seniors “were basically left out on the street” and with shelters closed encampments sprang up so people could find some safety in being together. There were few services available and many people watched others die of an overdose. “There was a lot of trauma in those years” she said.

“The result is a community of people who are distrusting who are more ill and fentanyl addiction collided with COVID in a way that has been debilitating for that community” she said.

A recent assessment of homeless people living in the Mission District found that before COVID 68% of them were employed and had housing she said. Immigrants make up a large portion of the area’s population and many lost their jobs as office building cleaners or restaurant workers during the pandemic. Loss of a job often meant loss of housing.

Now when St. John’s opens its doors each weekday about 35 people come to sleep and over 100 more arrive for the supportive services Gubbio offers. With no pews in the nave it’s easy to set up cots with blankets and people are welcome to bring their belongings and their dogs inside with them. Couples can arrange their cots to be near each other which usually isn’t permitted in shelters Bransten said. “The only rule is to just stay peaceful” she said.

In other parts of the building people can get a cup of coffee or see one of the nurses who provide foot and wound care. The city’s Department of Public Health’s street medicine team provides health screenings and follow-up appointments. Gubbio’s harm reduction specialist who also is a treatment counselor provides clean needles and other paraphernalia so those using drugs can do so safely.

“That provides an entrée to a conversation with a person who is struggling with drug use” Bransten said. Recovery from addiction always is the end goal but “we need to keep them alive long enough and love them enough until they are ready to love themselves into recovery.”

Bransten said that St. John’s offers a space for Gubbio’s clients that is both sacred and safe. “Not all sacred spaces feel safe” she added. “A lot of people have experienced a level of spiritual violence and St. John’s is an incredibly healing community.”

Deal and some of his parishioners provide pastoral care to those who come to the church for Gubbio’s services and many of them now attend worship services at St. John’s something Deal says he loves. “We don’t think of them as people from Gubbio” he said “they are just folks in the St. John’s community.” He said that because people are familiar with the church and think of it as their space they feel comfortable coming back on Sunday.

Bransten said St. John’s building itself helps the people Gubbio serves. “The beauty of the space is key to the way we’re able to create an environment where people feel welcomed where they feel like it’s peaceful it’s beautiful and it’s for them.”

“This is exactly who the beauty of God’s house is intended” Deal said. “It’s not for the people who have everything. The beauty of God’s house is for the people who are down and out.”

Ned Lamont April 13 expressing concerns with legislation expanding state-run healthcare and imposing a new tax on policyholders.

“The pandemic has demonstrated that employees can work virtually making it easier for companies to choose where they are domiciled and grow” the executives wrote in the letter.

“As a result it has never been more critical for the state to create a climate that retains and attracts businesses that will help stabilize the economy. All of us will have to decide where it will be best to deploy our resources long term.

“Private employers and taxpayers should not fund unsustainable public policy pursuits.”

Signed by the CEOs of Anthem Cigna CVS Health Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare and UnitedHealth Group the letter warned that passage of SB 842—which expands state-run healthcare—”will only further deteriorate the state’s fragile economy.”

Fiscal Health Questions

In February CBIA called for an independent audit to address the significant questions surrounding the fiscal health of the state’s municipal plan—known as the State Partnership Plan—which is the model for SB 842.

State Comptroller Kevin Lembo a leading advocate for expanding state-run healthcare manages the partnership plan. He has yet to respond to the audit request.

“The State Partnership Plan does not have the proven experience to run a health insurance program for its residents” the letter signed by the executives notes.

“The state comptroller administered the partnership program at a shortfall of $10 million in 2018 and $31 million in 2019.

“Taking from one pot of money to cover a deficit in another is not sound fiscal policy.” April 13 CEO letter

“The argument put forth attempts to argue the partnership program is solvent and successful; we would argue that taking from one pot of money to cover a deficit in another is not sound fiscal policy.

“Continuing on this path will only further deteriorate the state’s fragile economy.”

CBIA’s call for an audit cited the latest detailed and concerning analysis of the plan’s fiscal outlook produced by the insurance agency Brown & Brown.

The agency has a large number of clients enrolled in the municipal plan. Brown & Brown officials are concerned with the plan’s unregulated status and believe greater oversight is needed to ensure its fiscal health.

Tax Hike

In the letter to Lamont and legislative leaders the insurance company CEOs also addressed a proposed tax hike—modeled on a now repealed federal tax—that will drive up healthcare costs for employers and families.

The $50 million tax on healthcare polices included in SB 842 and HB 6447 is designed to fund additional premium subsidies for policies issued by the state-run healthcare exchange.

The executives argued that the federal American Rescue Plan Act signed into law March 11 provides the premium relief sought by both bills without raising taxes on small businesses and residents.

“The state should not attempt to lower the cost of insurance for some by imposing significant new taxes on others.” CEO letter

“While we believe your intent is one we share—to bolster the state’s health exchange Access Health CT—we firmly believe that state and newly passed federal funding can and should be used for this purpose—not a new tax on policyholders” the letter notes.

“Residents are already paying over $100 million in health insurance taxes to the state. The state should not attempt to lower the cost of insurance for some by imposing significant new taxes on others that will inevitably be passed along to policyholders in the form of higher premiums.”

Innovation

A recent independent report showed that the 2019 repeal of the federal tax on insurance policies will reduce premiums by more than $270 billion over the next 10 years.

The health insurance executives also referenced Lamont’s call for private sector innovation to address rising healthcare costs and to support small businesses.

“You rightly called upon the private market to continue innovating and providing more choices for some of our struggling small employers” the letter read. “We have done just that. There are now a number of offerings with new products in the market.

The 2019 repeal of the federal tax on insurance policies will reduce premiums by more than $270 billion over 10 years.

“To allow carriers to innovate and further compete the administration and the legislature should explore updating the current legal and regulatory framework to allow for maximum flexibility.

“We look to you to provide leadership and focus on proposals that will provide much-needed stability and support.

“As companies committed to the people and communities of Connecticut we look forward to working with you your administration and the legislature to find ways to build a sustainable affordable and more accessible health system for the people we are privileged to serve.”

Economic Impact

According to a 2019 study produced by the Connecticut Economic Resource Center the health insurance industry employs 25058 workers and supports another 23000-plus additional jobs in ancillary industries.

The study found that industry employers pay $5.2 billion in wages and benefits annually with an average salary of $123000.

Connecticut’s health insurance industry employs 25058 workers and supports another 23000-plus additional jobs.

The industry also generates $15.5 billion in annual economic activity pays over $209 million in state taxes and provides $101 million in funding for public health and welfare programs.

The CERC report estimated that even a 10% decline in the state’s health insurance industry would lead to a loss of some 5000 jobs and $1.6 billion in economic output.

A decline of 25% to 50% would lead to a loss of 12000 to 24000 jobs and $4 billion to $8 billion in economic output.

Di keluarganya ia merupakan anak ke 1 dari 6 bersaudara. Awal beliau merintis menjadi seniman berawal pada tahun 1982 dan sampai saat ini masih aktif dalam menjalani pekerjaan tersebut. Tujuan beliau yaitu untuk menunjang ekonomi di keluarganya.

Neil El Fuady merupakan nama yang cukup di kenal dalam lingkup dunia seni patung di Indonesia khususnya di Yogyakarta. Salah satunya yaitu karya patung cinta sejatie Ainun & Habibie berbahan perunggu yang di resmikan pada 12 Mei 2015.

Sejak kecil beliau bercita cita untuk menjadi pelukis dan Beliau telah menunjukan bakatnya sejak masih duduk di bangku sekolah dasar (SD) walaupun kini beliau malah menjadi seorang seniman patung.

""Saat SD dulu pernah guru merobek buku saya dan dimarahi karena di buku saya di setiap lembarnya penuh dengan gambar padahal saat itu bukan pelajaran menggambar."" ujar Neil tertawa mengingat masa kecilnya.

Dengan penuh niat pada saat lulus SMP ia memutuskan untuk mendaftar di SMSR (sekolah menegah seni rupa) di Padang. Dengan dukungan kedua orangtuanya ia lolos dengan pilihan kedua yaitu seni patung bukan seni lukis.

Pepatah ""Alam takambang manjadi guru"" selalu ia pegang teguh oleh beliau. Urang awak jika tidak belajar dari dunia luar dan kultur budaya lain maka akan terkubur dengan alam Minang yang kecil. Jika ia tidak merantau untuk mencari bkat yang lebih maka potensi dalam dirinya tidak ada perkembangan. Maka dari pemikiran itulah ia memutuskan beranjak utuk meninggalkan kampung halamannya yang berada di kudu gantiang Koto Timur Padang pariaman untuk melanjutkan studinya di ISI (institut seni indonesia) di Yogyakarta.

Saat masih kuliah Neil terbiasa dengan melukis di jalan Malioboro untuk menambah uang saku dan juga untuk mengusir kejenuhan di waktu luangnya.

""di malioboro saat itu merupakan rumah kedua bagi saya jika ada orang ingin bertemu saya kalau tidak di kos kosan ya di Malioboro. Dengan melakukannya setiap malam kerinduan pada kampung halamannya sedikit terobati"" ujarnya.

Ketika itu beliau juga sering diajak oleh donsennya yang juga merupakan orang Minang yaitu (alm) Kasman KS untuk diajak mengerjakan proyek dosennya. ""Saat itu saya kuliah sambil bekerja dan pak Kasman lah yang mendidik saya di dalam maupun diluar kampus dan di samping itu ia belajar praktik langsung di lapangan."" Ujar Neil.

Di samping beliau mengerjakan karya karya patungnya ia merupakan ayah dari 5 buah hatinya dengan Dyah Rullyati yang juga membangun industri patung home made di Yogyakarta.

Sudah banyak hasil karya yang telah diciptakan Neil di berbagai kota kota di Indonesia yang salah satunya patung yang dibuat di sudut lapangan Andi Makassar Parepare yaitu patung monumen cinta sejatie Habibie & Ainun.

Klik untuk follow WhatsApp Channel & Google News

Banyak orang tanpa sadar sangat mengutamakan urusan cintanya melebihi apapun sampai-sampai rela mengorbankan segalanya untuk pasangannya. Relationship memang hal yang patut diprioritaskan tapi kalau mau dipikirkan lebih jauh di dalam hidup ini justru ada banyak sekali hal lainnya yang juga tak kalah penting dan patut diprioritaskan selain urusan cinta.

Dan beberapa di antaranya pun akan dibahas lebih lanjut di bawah ini jadi simak baik-baik ya! Karena hidup ini gak berisi cinta-cintaan saja.

1. Keharmonisan hubungan dengan keluarga Pexels.com/Askar Abayev Hal pertama yang patut diprioritaskan dalam hidup selain cinta-cintaan ialah keharmonisan hubungan dengan keluarga. Jangan hanya hubungan sama pacar saja yang dijaga keharmonisannya akan tetapi hubungan dengan keluarga juga patut diprioritaskan. Apalagi pada dasarnya keluargalah yang akan selalu ada untukmu jadi hal ini sebenarnya memang wajar untuk diutamakan. Akur dengan adik dan kakak serta dekat dengan orangtua.

2. Persahabatan dan hubungan baik dengan orang-orang baik untuk hidupmu Pexels.com/Elly Fairytale Persahabatan dengan orang-orang yang baik untuk hidupmu juga hal yang penting dan patut diprioritaskan lho. Karena seperti yang kita tahu bahwa tidak semua teman itu baik untuk hidupmu sehingga sangat penting untuk menjaga persahabatan dengan orang-orang baik. Baik itu sahabat karibmu relasi bahkan koneksi dengan orang penting. Sebab kamu tidak hidup sendirian di dunia ini dan ada waktunya nanti kamu akan bersyukur telah menjaga hubungan baik dengan mereka.

4. Tatanan hidup yang sehat untuk dirimu sendiri Pexels.com/Andrea Piacquadio Kemudian hal keempat yang juga patut kamu prioritaskan dalam hidup ialah tatanan hidup yang sehat untuk dirimu sendiri. Mau mengakuinya atau tidak semakin dewasa dirimu maka semakin wajib pula untuk bisa menata hidup sendiri. Apalagi jika kamu merantau dan hidup sendiri kalau kamu tidak menatanya dengan baik maka akibatnya bisa fatal terhadap berbagai aspek hidupmu. Intinya kamu harus bisa mengurus diri sendiri dengan baik.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaWJ1bm5ld3MuY29tL3NlbGViLzIwMjEvMDQvMTcvY2hvcmQtZGFuLWxpcmlrLWxhZ3UtYWt1LWphdHVoLWNpbnRhLXJvdWxldHRlLWt1bmNpLWdpdGFyLWRpbXVsYWktZGFyaS1l0gF2aHR0cHM6Ly9tLnRyaWJ1bm5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9zZWxlYi8yMDIxLzA0LzE3L2Nob3JkLWRhbi1saXJpay1sYWd1LWFrdS1qYXR1aC1jaW50YS1yb3VsZXR0ZS1rdW5jaS1naXRhci1kaW11bGFpLWRhcmktZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chord dan Lirik Lagu Aku Jatuh Cinta - Roulette Kunci Gitar Dimulai dari E,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.tribunnews.com/seleb/2021/04/17/chord-dan-lirik-lagu-aku-jatuh-cinta-roulette-kunci-gitar-dimulai-dari-e on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaWJ1bm5ld3MuY29tL3NlbGViLzIwMjEvMDQvMTcvY2hvcmQtZGFuLWxpcmlrLWxhZ3UtYWt1LWphdHVoLWNpbnRhLXJvdWxldHRlLWt1bmNpLWdpdGFyLWRpbXVsYWktZGFyaS1l0gF2aHR0cHM6Ly9tLnRyaWJ1bm5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9zZWxlYi8yMDIxLzA0LzE3L2Nob3JkLWRhbi1saXJpay1sYWd1LWFrdS1qYXR1aC1jaW50YS1yb3VsZXR0ZS1rdW5jaS1naXRhci1kaW11bGFpLWRhcmktZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcmFtYWRhbi5rb21wYXNpYW5hLmNvbS9mYXRtYXNhcml0aXRpZW43MDM5LzYwN2JjNmI0ZDU0MWRmMDUxZjFiNmY2Mi9zdXJhdC1jaW50YS1kYXJpLXNhbmctbWFoYS1jaW50YdIBbGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvbXBhc2lhbmEuY29tL2FtcC9mYXRtYXNhcml0aXRpZW43MDM5LzYwN2JjNmI0ZDU0MWRmMDUxZjFiNmY2Mi9zdXJhdC1jaW50YS1kYXJpLXNhbmctbWFoYS1jaW50YQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Surat Cinta dari Sang Maha Cinta - Kompasiana.com,"Cinta kan membawamu... kembali di sini. Menuai rindu... membasuh perih...

Sepenggal lagu di atas tentu sudah sangat akrab di telinga kita. Melantunkannya bisa penuh penghayatan nih terasa sampai ke dalam relung jiwa. Apalagi bagi pasangan yang berjauhan. Duh....

Ngomong-ngomong soal cinta memang tak pernah ada habisnya. Selalu ada saja alasan untuk terus terhubung dengannya. Namun acapkali manusia lupa bahwa ada yang mencintai mereka jauh sebelum mereka ada di dunia ini. Cinta yang tulus dan tanpa syarat.

Dialah Sang Maha Cinta yang senantiasa memberikan segala apa yang dibutuhkan manusia yang beriman dan yang tidak yang meminta maupun yang tidak. Dialah Allah segala puji bagi-Nya yang telah menciptakan seluruh alam semesta untuk dikelola dan dimanfaatkan oleh manusia dan kehidupan di dalamnya.

Ketika seseorang mencintai seseorang  maka ingatannya akan selalu tertuju pada orang tersebut. Maka dia akan selalu mencari cara untuk berdekatan dan berinteraksi dengannya. Apapun yang didapatkan dari dia akan selalu dirawat dan dijaga. Apapun pesan yang dia kirim dan sampaikan akan selalu diingat dan berulang kali dibaca. Apapun yang tidak disukainya sedapat mungkin dihindari. Apapun yang disukainya akan selalu dilakukan dan diupayakan meski penuh perjuangan.

Kemudian Allah turunkan Alqur'an sebagai surat cinta untuk makhluk-Nya. Di dalamnya terdapat banyak pesan dan pemberitahuan serta kabar gembira. Di dalamnya ditunjukkan betapa luas dalam cinta-Nya. Juga petunjuk bagi manusia tentang bagaimana cara untuk membalas cinta-Nya. Tentang surga dan neraka. Tentang tempat di mana manusia pertama diciptakan dan tinggal di sana. Juga berbagai petunjuk dan peta jalan agar manusia bisa kembali ke kampung asal tersebut dia negri akhirat kelak.

Demikian pula ketika seseorang mengaku mencintai Allah swt maka dia perlu mengetahui banyak hal. Tentang apa yang Allah suka ketika manusia melakukannya. Juga tentang apa saja yang membuat Allah murka. Tentang pesan Allah kepada para utusan dan orang-orang yang Dia cintai.

Lalu bagaimana manusia bisa mengetahui kesemuanya itu? Tentu saja dari pesan yang dikirim Allah swt untuknya. Yang beliau turunkan melalui lisan utusan-Nya nan mulia. Muhammad Rasulullah saw. Melalui surat cinta-Nya yang penuh berkah. Melalui Alqur'anul karim. Padanya berkumpul segala kebaikan.

""Dan Kami turunkan kepadamu Al-Kitab (al-Qur'an) untuk menjelaskan segala sesuatu. (An-Nahl: 89)""

Ath Thabari menafsirkan ayat ini sebagai berikut:

""Al-Qur'an ini telah turun kepadamu wahai Muhammad sebagai penjelasan apa yang dibutuhkan manusia seperti mengetahui halal dan haram dan pahala dan siksa. Dan sebagai petunjuk dari kesesatan dan rahmat bagi yang membenarkannya dan mengamalkan apa yang ada di dalamnya berupa hukum Allah perintah-Nya dan larangan-Nya menghalalkan yang halal mengharamkan yang haram. Dan kabar gembira bagi orang-orang yang berserah diri."""

The issue is the fact that the older the equipment the more likely it is to be a bit old-fashioned about how it expects to speak RS-232. Vintage electronics may expect the serial data to be at bipolar voltage levels that are higher than what the typical microcontroller is used to slinging and that was the situation [g3gg0] faced with some vintage benchtop equipment. Rather than deal with cables and wired adapters [g3gg0] decided to design a wireless adapter with WiFi and Bluetooth on one end and true RS-232 on the other.

The adapter features an ESP32 and is attached to a DB-9 plug so it’s nice and small. It uses the ST3232 chip to communicate at 3 V logic levels on the microcontroller side supports bipolar logic up to +/-13 V on the vintage hardware side and a rudimentary web interface allows setting hardware parameters like baud rate. The nice thing about the ST3232 transceiver is that it is not only small but can work from a 3 V supply with only four 0.1 uF capacitors needed for the internal charge pumps.

As for actually using the adapter [g3gg0] says that the adapter’s serial port is exposed over TCP on port 23 (Telnet) which is supported by some programs and hardware. Alternately one can connect an ESP32 to one’s computer over USB and run firmware that bridges any serial data directly to the adapter on the other end.

Design files including schematic bill of materials and PCB design are shared online and you can see a brief tour of the adapter in the video embedded below.

RS-232 on serial interfaces was around for a long time so we’ve definitely not seen the end of projects like this. [g3gg0]’s board would sure have made it easier to IoT-ify this old LED signboard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93YWNvdHJpYi9uYW1lL3JveS1zdGVwaGVucy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD02NjY4MTg30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roy Stephens Obituary (1949 - 2021) - Waco TX - Waco Tribune-Herald,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/wacotrib/name/roy-stephens-obituary?id=6668187 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93YWNvdHJpYi9uYW1lL3JveS1zdGVwaGVucy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD02NjY4MTg30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzE4NDQ1MTEvYnVzaW5lc3MtZWNvbm9tedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Saudi Aramco part of $50 million funding for US software firm,"RIYADH: Saudi Aramco’s investment arm was among a group of investors who awarded SR187.5 million ($50 million) to a Seattle-based manufacturing and technology software company.

Seeq Corp. said it had raised the new funds as part of a Series C funding round as the group of investors backing the financing were Altira Group Chevron Technology Ventures Cisco Investments Second Avenue Partners and Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures (SAEV).

The extra $50 million brings Seeq’s total funding since its launch in 2013 to around $115 million. While the breakdown of figures was not given Seeq did say that SAEV was already an existing investor from previous funding rounds. Seeq enables engineers and scientists to rapidly analyze predict collaborate and share insights to improve production and business outcomes for its products. It operates across many sectors including oil and gas pharmaceutical chemical energy and mining.

The Seattle-based company aims to use the new funds to develop its sales and marketing resources and expand its presence into international markets.

“By leveraging big data machine learning and computer science innovations Seeq is enabling a new generation of software-led insights” Steve Sliwa the CEO and co-founder of Seeq said in a press statement.

An intense pricing war can be expected among potential suitors for Citibank India’s assets as virtually every bank would line up to acquire its retail business in part or full analysts say.

However the process to exit the business and find new buyers will not be hurried and will likely take more than a year to complete they say. As of now business continues as usual and one can still open accounts with Citibank and get credit cards if qualified.

Solomon.

He said Citi had provided only a vague statement on the fate of its employees in Malaysia while confirming it was moving its base of operations to Singapore.

Solomon said Citi was granted licences to operate in Malaysia on the pretext of providing equal access to consumer banking needs for both rural and urban Malaysians but had instead been allowed to operate exclusively in major urban centres.

“However having obtained the government’s approval to open shop in Malaysia banks like Citibank ‘quietly’ ignored their own pledges and international norms by choosing to operate almost exclusively in major urban centres thereby ignoring people in the rural areas.

“In the process the multinational banks reaped hefty profits that are shipped out of the country annually.

“This practice has continued unabated for many years as there was no intervention by the government nor Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) to ensure the multinational banks such as Citibank served the ordinary rakyat both in urban and rural Malaysia” Solomon said in a statement today.

On April 15 Citigroup announced it will exit 13 international consumer banking markets shifting its focus to wealth management and away from retail banking in places where it is small.

Citigroup will focus its global consumer banking business on four markets: Singapore Hong Kong London and the United Arab Emirates.

Its chief executive Jane Fraser said in a statement that Citigroup will depart China India and 11 other retail markets including Malaysia where “we don’t have the scale we need to compete” without going into detail about the staff's employment status.

In today’s statement Solomon said this was purely a move to focus on where the big bucks are namely corporate Malaysia and wealthy individuals adding there were two other banking institutions in Malaysia that practice the same approach.

“Sadly this practice of cherry picking and discriminating customers is not confined to Citibank alone. At least two other multinational banks have drastically reduced their over the counter services (OTC) forcing customers to go online or use ATMs despite many of them who are not savvy with such platforms whilst allowing only the wealthy access to its services including OTC.

“Despite being loyal and often hailed as important to the bank these traditional customers are denied their basic rights to use OTC services as well as other services such as safe deposit boxes by these multinationals banks.

“It is another example of multinationals banks not just neglecting their obligations to the society but display the most appalling discrimination against the have-nots.

“Such decisions are testimony that international banks are choosing to take a predatory path of pleasing investors with profitability and cutting costs which have led to workers being dumped through forced VSS (voluntary separation scheme) terminations and outsourcing” he said.

Adding to that Solomon urged the government to review the Financial Services Act to ensure banks' decisions are determined not only by commercial considerations.

He warned of future layoffs with the advent of digital banking and implored BNM to bear in mind that business decisions cannot be made solely on the bottom line.

“Regretfully BNM has kept quiet on Citibank’s latest move when it should have voiced its displeasure over the bank’s proposed exit from the consumer banking business. BNM’s silence may prod other multinational banks to do the same down the road leading to dire consequences for workers and the rakyat.

“If such banks cannot operate in Malaysia on a long haul and only see profits as the reason to do business in this country then Malaysia can do without them.

“Banks which have a history of exiting our country should not be offered opportunities to do business here in the future” he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZmJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9jaXRpZ3JvdXAtdG8tZXhpdC1yZXRhaWwtYmFua2luZy1pbi0xMy1tYXJrZXRzLWluY2x1ZGluZy1iYWhyYWluL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citigroup to exit retail banking in 13 markets including Bahrain,"Citigroup plans to exit retail banking in 13 markets across Asia and the Europe Middle East and Africa region.

The bank will instead operate its consumer-banking franchise in both regions from four wealth centers in Singapore Hong Kong the United Arab Emirates and London it said Thursday in a statement.

The move is part of an ongoing review of the company’s strategy by chief executive officer Jane Fraser who took over last month.

“This positions us to capture the strong growth and attractive returns the wealth-management business offers through these important hubs” Fraser said in the statement.

Citigroup will exit its consumer franchises in Australia Bahrain China India Indonesia South Korea Malaysia the Philippines Poland Russia Taiwan Thailand and Vietnam. The firm will continue to offer products in those markets to customers of its institutional clients group which houses the private bank cash-management arm and investment-banking and trading businesses.

The New York-based bank has already been building out a wealth-advisory hub in Singapore. The 30000-square-foot (2800-square-meter) space is the largest of its kind for the bank and has room for more than 300 relationship managers and product specialists.

The withdrawal came as Citigroup reported record quarterly profit boosted by the flurry of blank-check companies it helped take public in the first three months of the year.

“While the other 13 markets have excellent businesses we don’t have the scale we need to compete” Fraser said. “We believe our capital investment dollars and other resources are better deployed against higher returning opportunities in wealth management and our institutional businesses in Asia.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNC8xOC9jaXRpZ3JvdXAtZXhpdC1zaG93cy1mb3JlaWduLWJhbmtzLWNoZXJyeS1waWNrLXNheXMtbnViZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citigroup exit shows foreign banks 'cherry pick' says NUBE,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhZ2FuZ25ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY2l0aWJhbmstZXhpdC1zaG93cy1tdWx0aW5hdGlvbmFsLWJhbmtzLXJlYXAtY29sb3NzYWwtcHJvZml0cy1pZ25vcmUtd29ya2Vycy1udWJlLTU0MDbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citibank exit shows multinational banks reap colossal profits ignore workers - NUBE,"KUALA LUMPUR 18 April - National Union of Bank Employees (NUBE) said Citibank has left many questions unanswered more so on the fate of its workers who have served the 7 Citibank headquarters and branches diligently for over 60 years in Malaysia and the loyal customers.

On 15 April 2021 Citigroup Inc announced its intention to exit from its consumer operations in Malaysia and run its operations from other countries among them Singapore. The bank stated that its focus is essentially on strong growth and attractive returns from the wealth management business offers.

J Solomon General Secretary of NUBE said the CEO of Citi Malaysia has not commented on the longer-term job security of its staff arising from the bank’s exit from Malaysia.

Instead he merely offered a vague statement that there would be no immediate change to staffing requirements which is not comforting the workers as their future prospects with the bank in serious doubt.

""There was no prior engagement with NUBE before the announcement on the future of Citibank employees especially NUBE members.

""The dearth of information and the absence of any clear commitment from Citibank to ensure workers keep their jobs is deeply regretted. The CEO has invited us for a meeting the following week and we hope to obtain a clearer picture of this global decision undertaken by the bank'' he said in a statement today.

J Solomon

Citibank is among a host of multinational banks which were given a licenses to operate in Malaysia decades ago after they gave their commitment to respect international conventions and provide equal access to the consumer banking needs for both rural and urban Malaysia. Consumer banking was and remains an important financial need of Malaysians to this day.

However said Solomon having obtained the government’s approval to open shop in Malaysia banks like Citibank ‘quietly’ ignored their own pledges and international norms by choosing to operate almost exclusively in major urban centres thereby ignoring people in the rural areas. In the process the multinational banks reaped hefty profits that are shipped out of the country annually.

""This practice has continued unabated for many years as there was no intervention by the government nor Bank Negara to ensure the multinational banks such as Citibank served the ordinary rakyat both in urban and rural Malaysia"" he said.

According to Solomon Citibank Malaysia’s latest move to focus exclusively on institutional business is the height of cherry picking and discriminative business practices in the country.

""The least profitable side of banking including over the counter service and consumer banking is ignored despite being an essential service to the people. Instead the bank just wants to focus on where the big bucks are namely corporate Malaysia and wealthy individuals.

""Citibank’s move is a drastic step in that direction and may well see its branches closed or downsized with workers laid off and individual clients being left in a lurch"" he lamented.

Of late said Solomon several banks have closed its banks physical branches in order to increase profitability and move to online banking. Concerns have been raised about the effect of the closure of branches on those that need the physical infrastructure of a branch.

""Sadly this practice of cherry picking and discriminating customers is not confined to Citibank alone. At least two other multinational banks have drastically reduced their over the counter (OTC) services forcing customers to go online or use ATMs despite many of them who are not savvy with such platforms whilst allowing only the wealthy access to its services including OTC.*

""It is another example of multinationals banks not just neglecting their obligations to the society but display the most appalling discrimination against the have-nots"" said Solomon.

""Such decisions is testimony that international banks are choosing to take a predatory path of pleasing investors with profitability and cutting costs which have led to workers being dumped through forced VSS terminations and outsourcing.

""Such decisions will impact bank workers and customers. Workers with families and financial commitments will be hit particularly hard"" he said.

Regretfully said Solomon BNM has kept quiet on Citibank’s latest move when it should have voiced its displeasure over the bank’s proposed exit from the consumer banking business. BNM’s silence may prod other multinational banks to do the same down the road leading to dire consequences for workers and the rakyat.

""If such banks cannot operate in Malaysia on a long haul and only see profits as the reason to do business in this country then Malaysia can do without them.

""Banks which have a history of exiting our country should not be offered opportunities to do business here in the future"" he said. - DagangNews.com"

In early April the Beverly Hills-based bank holding company purchased MUFG Union Bank’s homeowners banking services unit for $250 million in cash — a disruptive deal in a below-the-radar-business.

That transaction has catapulted PacWest into the top ranks of the HOA field according to banking analysts and observers.



An HOA or homeowner’s association is an organization within a subdivision planned community or condominium building that makes and enforces rules for the properties and its residents. Those who purchase property with an HOA jurisdiction automatically become members and are required to pay fees.



An HOA banking practice provides lockbox electronic receivables processing and other financial services to HOA management companies.



Industry analysts expect the HOA banking niche to see a runup in profits as interest rates move higher when the economy emerges from the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic.



PacWest President and Chief Executive Matthew Wagner declined to discuss the acquisition when reached for comment.



The push by PacWest into the HOA market underscores the company’s recent strategy to diversify its lending portfolio and broaden its income streams. PacWest suffered a loss of $1.24 billion last year due to goodwill impairment charges and higher credit loss provisions as Covid-19 took a toll on the company’s loan portfolio.



PacWest had a string of 29 acquisitions between 2000 and 2019. It scrapped an agreement to buy El Dorado Savings Bank in Northern California back in January 2019. It picked up where it left off in February with a deal to buy Civic Financial Services from Redondo Beach-based real estate company Wedgewood a residential business purpose lender.



Some of PacWest’s strategic business push could become clearer when it releases its first quarter financial statement this week.



Nationally the HOA business is difficult to track with some analysts estimating the market encompasses tens of billions of dollars in deposits. No one is sure of the exact size though analysts point to a few big players in the field.



PacWest bought its ticket into this elite club of HOA players with the acquisition of the Union Bank unit. Analysts see the field as ripe for consolidation — with PacWest showing an appetite to become a major player.



“It’s an area that banks are looking to get more involved with. It’s a nice cheap source of deposits. This does put PacWest in a good position to go after this market” said David Chiaverini senior banking analyst with Wedbush Securities Inc. based downtown.



A major change



Wall Street sees the PacWest acquisition as catapulting $29 billion-in-asset Pacific Western Bank to a top competitive spot for HOA services — a major change considering the bank was virtually nowhere on the playing field only a few months ago.



Indeed the MUFG unit adds about $4 billion in HOA deposits to the roughly $1 billion PacWest in HOA funds the company already had on hand. With more than $5 billion in HOA deposits PacWest now ranks among the top banks in the sector according to analysts.



PacWest is betting the payoff will come from rising interest rates and several on Wall Street have already upped their estimates of the bank’s earnings outlook because of the deal.



“It doesn’t pay off in year one or two but give them $4 billion in deposits over the next two three five or 10 years” said Andrew Terrell a vice president and research analyst in charge of regional banks for Stephens Inc. in Little Rock Ark.



“I did the math and it’s a big accretion” he said. “I think PacWest is either the biggest or very near to becoming the biggest HOA banking business.”

Others agree.



“This will benefit PacWest for years. This business is sticky. It’s hard to move customers” said Chris Marinac co-founder and director of research at Atlanta-based FIG Partners an investment banking arm of Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “This is a no-brainer.”



The business also provides another benefit Marinac observed.



“There is a lending component to this” he said of HOAs. “There’s normal maintenance and wear and tear and renovation requires money. If there are enough deposits you can use them to back credit. There isn’t much risk. The chances are very low that they’ll default on the property and the land is worth a lot.”



Local rivals



The biggest rivals in the HOA market locally are Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorporation a $35 billion-in-assets institution that does HOA services business in California under its Alliance Association Bank subsidiary and Irvine-based Pacific Premier Bancorp Inc. parent of $20 billion-in-asset Pacific Premier Bank.



Pacific Premier became an even larger player last summer when it acquired Opus Bank.



In March Pacific Premier disclosed in a securities regulatory filing that it had roughly $1.8 billion in HOA deposits.



Alliance Association President Stephen Curley said his banking unit had roughly $3.9 billion at the end of 2020.



Another major player is Mutual of Omaha Bank which runs its corporate offices out of Phoenix and manages the HOA business.



The company had about $4.5 billion in HOA deposits following CIT Group Inc.’s purchase of Mutual of Omaha for $1 billion in early 2020. The bank changed hands again in October when Raleigh N.C.-based First Citizens BancShares Inc. agreed to merge with New York-based CIT Group in an all-stock deal valued at roughly $2.2 billion.



At the time of the sale CIT Group Chief Financial Officer John Fawcett said the bank’s HOA deposits reached a record high of $5.5 billion adding that the operation was on track to “double HOA deposits over the next five years.”



“I think we’re all about the same size” Curley said. “I think why people think we’re larger is because we’ve grown organically 100% and everybody else did it through acquisition.”



“PacWest wanted to be a player in this business and you know they decided it was easier to buy it than to build it” Curley added.

Is he or isn’t he an ace?

The answer is yes yes a thousand times yes.

Nola proved it again Sunday afternoon against the St. Louis Cardinals at Citizens Bank Park. With his team just a few days removed from a 1-5 road trip and coming off a lopsided loss in which starter Matt Moore did not make it through the third inning Nola did what an ace does by doing something he had never done before.

The 27-year-old right-hander pitched the first nine-inning complete game which also happened to be first nine-inning shutout of his career. He allowed just two singles no walks and had 10 strikeouts in giving the Phillies a 2-0 win as well as a series victory.

“If you look at Nola the past three or four years I don’t know how you can say he’s not an ace” catcher J.T. Realmuto said. “He’s a top-10 pitcher in baseball so I don’t know how you cannot consider that an ace. If that was me I think that would certainly fuel my fire.”

Let’s use Realmuto’s “past-three-or-four-years” criteria to assess Nola.

The ability to be an ace starts with durability and availability. Nola’s 110 starts are tied with Jacob deGrom and Rick Porcello for the fifth most in baseball since 2017 and his 678 2/3 innings pitched also rank fifth.

Among the 43 pitchers who have logged at least 500 innings since 2017 Nola has a 3.20 ERA since 2017 which ranks eighth. You might have heard of the seven guys ahead of him: deGrom (2.46) Clayton Kershaw (2.62) Max Scherzer (2.74) Justin Verlander (2.82) Chris Sale (3.08) Gerrit Cole (3.12) and Zack Greinke (3.19).

Aces one and all.

“People in the clubhouse and people on the field know that he is an ace and that’s on this team and on other teams” Realmuto said. “You just look at the guy’s resume and he gets outs and he shows up consistently. I’m not sure where [the doubts] come from but it’s not from people who know baseball.”

Maybe not but it’s something Nola has had to hear his entire career. After he was drafted he was described by one prominent draft guru as “a No. 2 or 3 starter.”

Phillies third-base coach Dusty Wathan who managed Nola at double-A Reading in 2015 had the perfect response to that label: “What’s wrong with being a No. 3 starter in the big leagues?”

Nothing is the answer but Nola has earned the right to be called a lot more. He made his fourth straight opening-day start this year the first Phillies pitcher to do that since Steve Carlton. Lefty of course is the Phillies’ all-time ace.

“He’s definitely more calm than a lot of people” Realmuto said. “He’s not Max Scherzer out there huffing and puffing around the mound and I could see where that might confuse some people. But as far as getting outs and winning baseball games he does a really good job at that.”

Nola has had some difficult times. It definitely bothers him that he has gone 4-9 with a 4.44 ERA the last three Septembers when the Phillies have been in contention but he’s not the first really good pitcher to experience turbulence at the worst of times. Kershaw for instance has a career 2.43 ERA in the regular season and a 4.19 ERA in 37 postseason games.

It also bothered Nola that he had consecutive short outings against the New York Mets after pitching a gem against the Atlanta Braves on opening day. But he insisted it does not bother him when some people start questioning his status as an ace.

“For sure I hear it and no it does not bother me” Nola said. “I’m going to go out and pitch my game and pitch for my team. I’m going to try to go as long as possible and try to get my pitch count as high as possible until they take me out.”

Nola’s pitch count stood at 102 after eight innings Sunday and he was prepared to argue his way back to the mound for the ninth inning if need be. Manager Joe Girardi had closer Héctor Neris warming in the bullpen but he wanted Nola back on the mound.

“He was going back out” the manager said. “I loved the way he was throwing the ball. I loved the way he attacked the top of the order all day and had done a really good job so it was his game. I know he had never had a nine-inning shutout and I knew it was important to him so that’s why I let him go.”

It took Nola just seven pitches to finish off the dangerous top of the Cardinals’ order in the ninth. He retired Tommy Edman on a grounder to first six-time All-Star Paul Goldschmidt on a lazy fly ball to right field and five-time All-Star Nolan Arenado on a grounder to shortstop to end the game.

The Cardinals never got a runner beyond first base and went down in order six times. It would have been seven but Nola’s one mistake was a dropped feed at first base on a throw from Rhys Hoskins in the third inning. He was so frazzled by his mistake that he struck out Goldschmidt on three pitches.

That’s the kind of thing aces do.

“With people throwing so hard and you see what deGrom is like and you see a Gerrit Cole I think people scream at that as being an ace” Girardi said. “But there are different types of aces and he’s one of them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxsaWVzbmF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0L2JyeWNlLWhhcnBlci1sZWZ0LW91dC1vZi1zYXR1cmRheXMtbGluZXVwLXdpdGgtYmFjay10aWdodG5lc3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bryce Harper left out of Saturday’s lineup with back tightness,"Bryce Harper is out of the lineup Saturday. (Kyle Ross/Icon Sportswire)

If the Philadelphia Phillies are to clinch their three-game weekend series with the St. Louis Cardinals on Saturday they’ll have to do so without Bryce Harper.

The Phillies said Harper “woke up this morning with a little bit of tightness in his lower back” per Matt Breen of The Philadelphia Inquirer. The announcement came shortly after Joe Girardi’s lineup was released for Saturday’s matchup which featured Matt Joyce batting seventh and playing right field.

It’s not the first time Harper has dealt with back issues in his career. The Phillies’ slugger said his back bothered him so much toward the end of last season that he had trouble throwing and the club accordingly eased him into action this spring training.

Harper is off to a mild start to the season hitting .238 with an .825 OPS and two home runs. He squared up several balls in Friday’s win for an RBI double and two flyouts that may have found themselves in the seats if it weren’t for the wind at Citizens Bank Park.

The Phillies left him out of Saturday’s lineup as a precaution and he’s considered day-to-day but given his history violent swing and the 10 years remaining on his contract after 2021 his back issues are certainly worth monitoring going forward.

""I know which house he bought the Lashingers' house. I read what he paid for it ($12.2 million) — I never know if that's true"" said Faxon at the Chubb Classic presented by SERVPRO at Tiburón Golf Club where Norman designed both courses.

Norman also is the tournament founder and host of the QBE Shootout the PGA Tour team event played at Tiburón since 2001. This is the first year the Black Course has hosted the PGA Tour Champions tournament. The Shootout and the CME Group Tour Championship on the LPGA Tour have both been played on the facility's Gold Course.

Old Palm's golf course was designed by Raymond Floyd and has had several tour pros call it home at some point. Ernie Els was the most recent to leave.

""When we moved down Ian Baker-Finch lived there Louis (Oosthuizen) Charl (Schwartzel) Braden Grace Shane Lowry's renting in there"" Faxon said. ""(Lee) Westwood lived there.""

Rory McIlroy also owned a home there but reportedly bought Els' home at The Bear's Club.

And Faxon said Els has sold his place and moved near Seminole Golf Club.

""Now it's like everything in Florida is sold out"" he said. ""There's no places left anywhere. It's crazy.""

Norman's new 11837-square-foot house sits on two acres and features six bedrooms seven full bathrooms and two half-baths. The property also has a tennis court guest house and a massive resort-style pool with a swim-up bar.

Tiger Woods' ex-wife Elin Nordegren paid $9.4 million for a home there in September.

Norman has reportedly wanted to return to Australia after battling COVID-19 late last year. Norman also sold his Seven Lakes ranch in Colorado for $52 million in March.

Golf to Paradise-First Tee Champions Challenge: Chicago's First Tee team captured the annual Golf To Paradise-First Tee Champions Challenge Sunday after the best-ball event at Quail Creek Country Club.

The event which is sponsored by the Collier County tourism bureau is considered part of the Chubb Classic the PGA Tour Champions event presented by SERVPRO.

Chicago finished the 12-team event of First Tee chapters with 99 points while North Florida was second with 113.7. The teams played a scramble on Friday alternate shot Saturday and best ball Sunday.

Carly Neal coordinated the event for tournament owner Eiger Marketing.

“Having a different format every day was fun for the kids and they started with a scramble before a more difficult alternate shot the second day and the emotions and pressure showed” Neal said. “At the conclusion it was evident everything worked the way it was intended.""

The Naples/Collier team of Willem Jaron and Maggie Platten finished seventh with 110.7 points after tying for sixth in best ball at even par.

Chicago captured the alternate shot division and tied for second in best ball.

In addition to the competition First Tee players received a teaching clinic Thursday that included Champions Tour player Peter Jacobsen of Bonita Springs. The players also watched some of the play at Tiburón Golf Club at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort during the first two rounds. And they had a cruise on the Naples Princess on Saturday.

Parlons Opelousas

Have you ever thought about ice? Today if you want to have a cold drink you simply go to your refrigerator put a glass under the dispenser and get all the ice you want. Something we take for granted right? Well it wasn’t always that way.

Let’s talk about that.

Centuries ago people did not have ice to use as we do now. Those who lived in cold areas probably thought ice was a nuisance especially in the winter. In a warmer climate there was hardly any ice at all. And even where ice was available it was certainly not used to cool off a liquid to drink. Well that all changed in the early part of the 19th century when the Tutor brothers of Boston figured out a way to cut and ship ice from their waterways to warmer areas of the U.S. They perfected the process and by the 1820s a small number of cities in the country including New Orleans had ice to sell.

By 1857 according to an ad in the Opelousas Courier William Ireland sold ice at his depot on the corner of Bellevue and Court streets. On April 25 of that year the ad read “ICE!! ICE!! ICE!!” For 3 cents per pound.

Parlons Opelousas:Snowfall of 1895 left St. Landry Parish blanketed in snow

Soon there were other businesses selling ice and even ice cream in Opelousas. In May of 1869 F. Munzesheimer advertised his Ice Cream and Soda Water Saloon serving both ladies and gentlemen. In 1878 he offered ice for sale in large and small quantities at reasonable prices at his grocery store located on Main Street. When electricity became available in town the first ice factory was opened in 1893 by Andrew Moresi and his partner C. A. Hoy.

Born in Jeanerette on July 27 1868 D. Andrew “Jack” Moresi was the son of Antoine M. Moresi (1828-1904) a native of Ticino Switzerland and Philomene Kobleur (1834-1920). His father was a successful businessman that was well known throughout south Louisiana. Jack was educated in the Jeanerette schools where he grew up. In 1892 Jack came to Opelousas where he joined with C.A. Hoy in 1893 to establish the first ice factory located on West Grolee Street.

Moresi was almost killed not long afterward when he was shot by Dr. D.A. Savant of Avoyelles Parish on Oct. 10 1893. This happened at the Lacombe Hotel where Moresi and Savant were guests at the time. Both the St. Landry Clarion and the Opelousas Courier of October 28 1893 reported Mr. Moresi was again “up and about” although not completely recovered. After almost three weeks he fully recovered. The local papers called the affair not only deplorable but also outrageous. Another article a few years ago focused on that shooting at the old Lacombe Hotel.

In 1894 the ice factory began bottling carbonated soft drinks and the name was changed to the Opelousas Ice and Bottling Works Co. By the early part of the 20th century Moresi was listed as the company’s sole owner.

The Ice and Bottling Co. continued to grow through the first decade of the 1900s. In 1914 Moresi secured the agency for the Gay-Ola Co. of Memphis Tennessee. Gay-Ola was the company that Coca-Cola sued saying they were wrongly claiming to have the secret Coca-Cola formula. That soft drink remained on the market until the 1920s and eventually faded away.

Moresi’s business continued to prosper. In August of 1923 he announced the Opelousas Ice and Bottling Company would distribute Blu Ribbon Ice Cream made by the Baton Rouge Ice Company. He was able to supply this ice cream to area wholesalers and also sell it to the general public.

In the late 1920s Moresi sold his plant to Gulf Public Service Company who also purchased the ice plant in Eunice at that time. After that sale Andrew’s brother Albert Moresi moved to the Opelousas area to manage both plants.

Andrew Moresi Sr. eventually obtained a franchise for Coca-Cola and the business became the Opelousas Coca-Cola Bottling Company with Andrew as the owner. In 1941 when Andrew Sr. was company president and his son Andrew Moresi Jr. was manager the company moved to a new $60000 plant on East Vine Street.

During World War II Opelousas was affected like other towns in the U.S. and around the world by the rationing of sugar. This had a great effect on the production of Coca-Cola.

Moresi announce in the Daily World on June 19 1945 about the shortage of Coke in the Opelousas area. He stated: “I am informed that this sugar shortage is worldwide and not just national and is directly attributed to the confusion in the production and distribution of sugar occasioned by the war.”

Sugar was absolutely necessary to manufacture Coca-Cola and Moresi said he would not use substitutes that he felt would compromise the integrity of it. He asked people to be patient as his company was committed and would keep the distribution up on a regular basis as long as the sugar was available. The company got through that crisis and the business continued to grow.

Besides keeping Opelousas merchants stocked with Coke the company also made a variety of other products. In the 1950s Moresi’s company distributed to stores in other area towns including Washington Grand Prairie Prairie Rhonde Whiteville and Waxia.

The company continued bottling operations in Opelousas until 1970. After that it became a distribution center for coke products. Opelousas Coca-Cola closed its doors in 1992 when Andrew Moresi Jr. sold the business to Coca-Cola of Baton Rouge.

Andrew Moresi Sr. was involved in a number of other Opelousas businesses. He was a charter member of the Board of Directors of the original Planter’s National Bank started with a capital stock of $50000 in 1910. His father-in-law Robert Chachere was the president of that bank. In 1919 Planter’s National Bank merged with Union Bank and Trust Company and the two became Planter’s Bank and Trust Company. It had to reorganize following the financial crash of 1929 and became the Planter’s Trust and Savings Bank with Chachere and Moresi as stockholders and charter board members. Both of them were elected as vice presidents serving that bank for many years.

Moresi owned stock in A.C. Skiles Lumber Company chartered in 1912 located on the corner of Railroad Avenue and Bellevue Street. He was a member of Skiles Board of Directors and served as president of that company for some time.

Moresi was involved in the community. He loved to use a camera and was responsible for many of the photographs of the Opelousas area during that time. He also loved automobiles and claimed to be the second person in town to own one. In 1912 he was a member of the Opelousas Elks’ Club and participated in a gala automobile carnival and race held that year driving his 1912 high powered Overland.

He was a charter member of the Opelousas Progressive League in 1898 as well as the reorganized Progressive League that eventually became the Chamber of Commerce in 1919. In 1905 he was a member of the Knights of Pythians Opelousas Lodge #158. He was a member of the Opelousas Musical Association Limited chartered in 1907. For many years he was an active member of the Opelousas Masonic Lodge. He was also involved in the local fire department often times serving on committees for events sponsored by the firemen.

D. Andrew “Jack” Moresi Sr. who brought ice production and bottling to Opelousas died on Wednesday Oct. 8 1952 at his home on South Market Street. Burial services were conducted by Rev. R. E. Walton pastor of the First Methodist Church the following day with burial in Myrtle Grove cemetery where Masonic rites were conducted.

There was only one umpire and fewer than three outs were recorded in multiple innings.

But it beat the alternative.

The Yankees’ 4-3 victory over the Phillies in Saturday’s taxi squad game was the first professional game with fans at Coca-Cola Park since Aug. 25 2019 when the Lehigh Valley IronPigs beat the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders in the final home game of that season.

The 2020 minor league schedule was wiped out due to the pandemic.

Adonis Medina allowed two runs (one earned) on three hits Saturday for the Phillies taxi squad team at Coca-Cola Park. He retired nine of 13 hitters he faced.

Medina’s day

Adonis Medina retired nine of 13 batters he faced for the Phillies taxi squad. The organization’s 11th-rated prospect allowed two runs (one earned) on three hits one of which was a solo home run to center field by Estevan Florial the Yankees’ 10th-rated prospect.

Medina struck out four in a row at one point three on off-speed pitches.

“He threw the ball well” IronPigs manager Gary Jones said. “He had a tough break in the first inning that cost him another 12 pitches or so. As a result his pitch count got up a little bit and we had to limit what he could do his last couple innings.

“But he did what he normally does which is throw strikes and induce weak contact. He’s gotten better and better each outing. I look for him to get stronger as he finishes up and we get going into regular season.”

German was good

Domingo German was better Saturday than he was during his two starts this season in New York.

The 28-year-old right-hander allowed an unearned run on two hits in five innings. He struck out two and hit two batters.

German missed the 2020 season as part of his 81-game MLB suspension following a reported domestic abuse incident involving his girlfriend at a CC Sabathia charity event and later that same day in 2019 at his home. He was never charged but MLB investigated after the Yankees were informed of the incidents.

German was 18-4 with a 4.03 ERA in 27 outings with the Yankees in 2019 before his suspension. He was 0-2 with a 9.00 ERA in two starts this season with New York.

Game notes

Luke Williams reached base three times and stole two bases for the Phillies. … Scott Kingery was 0-for-4 and played shortstop. … Mauricio Llovera allowed two runs on four hits and one walk in two innings of relief of Medina. … Bryan Mitchell followed Llovera with two scoreless innings. He allowed three hits and struck out two. Tyler Carr worked a scoreless ninth. … Luis Garcia who spent parts of six seasons (2013-18) with the Phillies came on in relief in the eighth for the Yankees. He spent 2019 with the Angels and 2020 with the Rangers. Garcia worked an inning allowing two hits.

Third baseman Austin Listi boots a grounder in the first inning of Saturday’s game at Coca-Cola Park. A run scored on the play.

How they scored

Top 1: Tyler Wade singled and stole second. He took third one out later on Mike Ford’s grounder and scored on Austin Listi’s fielding error at third base. Yankees 1-0.

Top 3: Estevan Florial homered to center field with one out. Yankees 2-0.

Bottom 3: Daniel Brito singled with one out stole second took third on Scott Kingery’s grounder and scored when Luke Williams’ third strike was a wild pitch. Yankees 2-1.

Top 5: Derek Dietrich doubled to left-center and scored on Rob Brantly’s bloop broken-bat single to left. Chris Gittens doubled Brantly to third and Socrates Brito scored him on a sacrifice fly to deep left. Williams made a nice running catch on Brito’s ball. Brantly played in 82 games with the IronPigs and had a ninth-inning at-bat in one game with the Phillies in 2019. Yankees 4-1.

Bottom 8: Matt Vierling walked took second on Travis Jankowski’s infield single off Yankees reliever Mike Montgomery moved to third on Listi’s fielder’s choice and scored on Brito’s single off Luis Garcia. One out later Williams singled in Jankowski. Yankees 4-3.

First of three

There will be two other Phillies taxi squad games with fans: 1:05 p.m. on Sunday April 25; and 4:05 on Saturday May 1.

There were a few hundred fans at Saturday’s game which started with the temperature at 52 degrees.

The Lehigh Valley IronPigs’ 2021 regular-season opener is Tuesday May 4 at 7:05 p.m. vs. the Rochester Red Wings.

Coca-Cola Park will operate at about 50% (between 4000 and 5000 fans) to start the 2021 season.

Looking ahead

The Yankees and Phillies play at 4:05 p.m. Sunday at PNC Field in Moosic.

Francisco Morales the Phillies’ fourth-ranked prospect will start Monday’s game at 3:05 at Coca-Cola Park.

It started with Twitter user Katherine Champagne who wrote in a tweet on April 5: “I’m still in awe that Oatly created super sugar grain juice cut it with canola oil and then successfully used (amazing) marketing to convince everyone that no this is Good.” Attached was a screenshot from “Oatly: The New Coke” an August 2020 story written by Nat Eliason that ran in the Almanack business newsletter. A business writer and digital entrepreneur Eliason sought to expose Oatly a wildly popular milk substitute made primarily from oats for what he claims it really is: junk food.

Predictably nutrition Twitter went nuts. Plenty of the responses were along the lines of: How dare they market this glorified sugar syrup as healthy! Others were more critical pointing out that oat milk is far from a “super sugar grain juice” and that most consumers aren’t guzzling the stuff in the quantities (a cup and a half at a time) that Eliason—who has no nutritional education or credentials—suggested in his article. To be honest after writing about nutrition for a decade the only thing that surprises me about the controversy is that anyone finds the fact that Oatly is mostly marketing surprising at all.

Eliason’s newsletter story starts by chronicling the long history of brands using misleading health claims to posit that products are better for you than they actually are. He uses the sugar industry the tobacco industry and Coca-Cola as examples of this kind of marketing. Then he argues that Oatly is doing the same thing. The article suggests that like Coke Oatly is nothing more than a sugar-laden processed drink that has tricked consumers into believing it should be a staple in their diet. He’s right in some ways (more on that later) but there’s a pretty glaring flaw in his argument.

Oatly Is Not Coke

Before we talk about Oatly’s (admittedly sneaky) marketing strategy let’s get something straight: Oatly oat milk is not nutritionally equivalent to Coke. An eight-ounce serving of Oatly contains 120 calories 5 grams of fat 16 grams of carbohydrates (including 7 grams of added sugar) and 3 grams of protein. A 12-ounce can of Coke has a similar number of calories (140) but they come entirely from 38 grams of sugar. Those numbers aren’t even close to equal. Even 12 ounces of Oatly—which Eliason assumes is the amount people put in their morning coffee—contains 24 grams of carbs and 11 grams of sugar. That’s still less than one-third of the sugar in Coke. Saying that the two are equivalent is absurd.

Compare Oatly with 2 percent dairy milk which has 122 calories 5 grams of fat 12 grams of carbs (all from naturally occurring sugar) and 8 grams of protein in an eight-ounce serving. Oatly has less than half the protein of regular milk about 30 percent more carbs and a similar amount of fat and calories. And although dairy milk has almost twice as much sugar as Oatly Eliason claims that the sugar in Oatly—maltose—is significantly worse for you than the sugar in dairy—lactose—because it has a higher glycemic load. “You’re spiking your blood sugar every time you add it to your coffee” he says.

Just like the marketing tactics that Eliason calls out the glycemic-load argument falls into the category of true but misleading statements. First if you’re putting a couple ounces of Oatly in your coffee you’re only consuming a few grams of sugar and won’t experience any drastic effects. Second any protein- fat- or fiber-containing food will slow the absorption of this sugar. So if you put some oat milk in the coffee that you drink alongside your breakfast the whole “spiking your blood sugar” thing is a moot point. And to reiterate even drinking a whole glass of Oatly on an empty stomach wouldn’t have nearly as big an effect on your blood sugar as drinking a can of Coke.

Misleading Marketing Is Nothing New

Oatly may not be Coca-Cola but it is true that its marketing makes suspect health claims. In 2020 the company tried (and failed) to trademark the phrase “It’s like milk but made for humans” from a campaign designed to convince people that cow’s milk is made for baby calves and therefore not meant for human consumption. Mothers of many species produce milk specifically to feed their infants. But that doesn’t mean it can’t provide nutrition for other species too. There is a huge body of evidence supporting cow’s milk for human health and most important unless you’re lactose intolerant it’s certainly not going to hurt you.

The brand also goes hard on the fact that its product contains fiber calling it “the most amazing fiber in the drinkable world.” But Oatly only contains two grams of fiber per serving about 8 percent of what’s recommended daily for women and 5 percent of what’s recommended for men. That’s nothing to get excited over. Oatly also emphasizes the whole “No GMO” thing although both the World Health Organization and the Food and Drug Administration have repeatedly confirmed the safety of the GMOs available for consumption.

Oatly isn’t the first health-food company or trade organization to cherry-pick facts in its marketing. Marketers for milk have been doing the same thing for decades; the “Got Milk?” campaign implies that dairy consumption is essential for healthy human growth. In reality there’s nothing magic about dairy milk; it’s a good source of calcium and vitamin D (which is added during processing) but a person can get these nutrients in other ways: Oatly and other plant-based milks are fortified with both nutrients for example. Plus many large studies on dairy consumption are funded at least in part by the dairy industry.

Even fruits and vegetables are marketed with vague and misleading claims. The California Avocado Commission runs ads with slogans like “No wonder it’s good for pregnancy” (because avocados contain folate) and “No wonder it’s good for the eyes” (because avocados contain lutein a carotenoid that’s linked to improved eye health). Yes these important nutrients are present in avocados but they’re also found in similar levels in many other foods.

“Superfoods are often designated as such because of high levels of micronutrients antioxidants or other arbitrary characteristics” says Cara Harbstreet a registered dietitian and owner of Street Smart Nutrition. That’s what the avocado folks are trying to do. But there’s no clearly defined criteria—like nutrient density or bioavailability—that determines which foods qualify for that label Harbstreet explains. It’s just good marketing.

So yes Oatly markets itself as a super nutritious and game-changing beverage when actually it’s just another drink. But it’s patently unfair to proclaim that Oatly is the same as Coke. “A statement like this carries similar energy as the statement ‘Sugar is as addicting as cocaine’” Harbstreet says. Yes the two substances light up the same pleasure centers in your brain but so do sex music and cute baby animals. And sugar doesn’t meet other addiction criteria like obsessive substance seeking and increased tolerance. “Both statements sound sensational elicit fear or mistrust of a product and make you question what you knew or believed to be true” says Harbstreet. They’re also both based on half-truths.

It’s All Just Food

Oatly has taken a page out of the age-old food-marketing book by making its product sound more nutritious than it really is. This is a little devious for sure but it’s nothing new or unique. It’s how marketers trick us into thinking that certain processed foods should be central to a healthy diet or that some whole foods are superfoods and thus much better for us than other whole foods. Oatly is no superfood but it’s also not horribly unhealthy. Nutritionally it’s fairly similar to dairy milk and actually has more calcium and vitamin D per cup than the real stuff. For people who choose plant-based diets that’s pretty great.

At the end of the day there’s truth on every side of the Oatly argument but there’s also a whole lot of spin. Your best bet as always is to eat a variety of nutritious foods (and some of the not so nutritious ones that you love too!) and pay as little attention as possible to the way they’re marketed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vamFwYW5uZXdzLnlvbWl1cmkuY28uanAvc2NpZW5jZS1uYXR1cmUvc2NpZW5jZS8yMDIxMDQxNy03MDI3OC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coke can returned to maker after 50 years at Antarctica base,"Courtesy of the National Institute of Polar Research

A can of Coca-Cola left and packets of Lotte Co.’s Cool Mint chewing gum that were discovered near Showa Station in Antarctica.

A retro Coca-Cola can and sticks of Cool Mint chewing gum uncovered in Antarctica after more than half a century on the continent were presented to their manufacturers in a ceremony held at the National Institute of Polar Research in Tachikawa Tokyo on Thursday.

The artifacts were discovered in September last year by members of the 61st Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition wintering party frozen in time in a cardboard box half-buried in snow about 5 kilometers east of Showa Station.

Judging from the assortment of canned foods also found inside the box the unopened items are presumed to have been emergency rations carried by a former expedition when conducting experiments in the unforgiving terrain.

Although covered in decades of rust the Coca-Cola can was recognizable by its iconic white lettering on a red background. The design dates to 1965 when the first Coke cans were sold in Japan. Instead of a modern pull-tab the drink came with a small device resembling a can opener making it a rare specimen from yesteryear that had been a gap in the collection kept at the Coca-Cola (Japan) Co.

The Cool Mint packets similarly featured the original product design as when the gum was first introduced by Lotte Co. in 1960 the institute said.

The gifting ceremony was attended by expedition leader Yuichi Aoyama Akino Sasaki from Coca-Cola’s marketing department and Shota Mori from Lotte’s brand strategy department.

“It makes me proud to think that Coca-Cola even provided refreshment to the Antarctic team more than half a century ago” Sasaki said. She added that the company would consider sending the can to its U.S. headquarters for display in the beverage-maker’s museum.

Mori shared that when developing Cool Mint Lotte had looked to the Antarctic for inspiration and said that he hopes to analyze the gum for possible clues that could lead to future product development.

“It’s a wonderful story and we’re thrilled by this homecoming over 50 years in the making” he said.

After the ceremony Aoyama looked back on the items’ long journey home with satisfaction: “I was very surprised and my team members were also very excited [to discover the items]. I was relieved to be able to safely return them to both companies.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd2R3bnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvcGhvdG9zLWJsYXN0LW9mLXJlZnJlc2htZW50LW9uLWNvY2EtY29sYS1jb29sLXNoaXAtY29udGludWVzLWF0LW1hZ2ljLWtpbmdkb20v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PHOTOS: Blast of Refreshment on Coca-Cola Cool Ship Continues at Magic Kingdom,"The Coca-Cola Cool Ship in Tomorrowland is receiving a blast of refreshment as its refurbishment continues. Most of its temporary black legs have now returned to silver and some elements of the spaceship have received a little updating as well.

Some details are still being updated but most of the work had been focused on the Cool Scanner.

The previously white trim of the Cool Ship has been painted blue but we have yet to see the wording lining the stand return.

Three of the once-primed black legs are now back to silver. Painting started on the Coca-Cola Cool Ship in early April.

One leg of the Cool Ship is remains painted black and will most likely receive its new coating in the coming days.

The adjacent Cool Scanner was also given a fresh coat of silver paint on its legs. The Cool Ship will most likely look the same as before but just refreshed.

The Coca-Cola Cool Ship is a fan favorite as it provides refreshing beverages while the Cool Scanner gives guests a misting experience which is a treat in itself on a hot day.

Jay Inslee already has agreed to sign.

Washington has been one of only a handful of states restricting municipal broadband and the legislation will eliminate that state prohibition. “The governor’s office assured me he is going to sign it” said Rep. Drew Hansen a Kitsap County Democrat who is the primary author of HB1336.

“The truth is a majority of states already allow what this bill does” Hansen added.

Specifically two bills — HB1336 and companion SB5383 — grant legal authority to public utility districts counties towns and port districts to offer retail broadband service to subscribers in the same manner that a private company such as Comcast does.

Hansen’s bill gives municipalities broad legal authority to become internet service providers while the companion bill SB5383 appears to give competitive preference to existing internet service providers. Hansen a Bainbridge Island attorney said the bills were tweaked to be compatible and that together they will expand choice and service for consumers. He said he expects the governor to sign both — though some questions have been raised about SB5383.

Additionally municipalities will be allowed to provide service both inside and outside districts’ boundaries. The legislation will become law on July 1.

The push for municipal broadband ramped up during the pandemic as millions of school kids and adults had to switch to remote learning and working from home. The shift revealed how many communities are not served or are underserved by existing commercial broadband networks which carry the bulk of internet traffic.

The pandemic Hansen said unexpectedly added momentum and weight to an idea that previously didn’t sustain traction: that internet service should be managed like a utility which provides for a basic human need similar to municipal water garbage and electricity. He said lawmakers watched hours of troubling testimony in Olympia in which parents said they didn’t have adequate internet service for their kids to attend classes.

Municipal broadband advocates have long said the connectivity issues for people in both rural and urban communities are two-fold: Do they have internet service available? If they do does it provide adequate bandwidth for streaming?

“We had rural health centers that lacked sufficient broadband to help patients” Hansen noted.

Commercial broadband and cable industry representatives opposed the legislation citing concerns about the government competing with the private sector. As a result some lawmakers pushed to have the legislation limited to areas without existing internet service. That stipulation however didn’t end up in the final guiding language.

And in fact neither did Rep. Alex Ybarra a Republican from Quincy who dropped his sponsorship of the legislation before it passed the legislature.

Originally a backer of HB1336 he walked away from it after business leaders in his district likened municipal broadband to socialism. But Ybarra added he supports the idea of universal broadband and agrees that some private internet providers ignored rural communities in Washington.

“I just didn’t like the way the bill was written” Ybarra said in an interview Friday to explain his reversal on the bill. “But I agree that something has to be done.”

The Biden administration likely will play a significant role in what will be done. The administration’s infrastructure plan earmarks $100 billion to expand broadband to all Americans. According to a statement from the White House the plan “prioritizes support for broadband networks owned operated by or affiliated with local governments non-profits and co-operatives — providers with less pressure to turn profits and with a commitment to serving entire communities.”

Hansen said he wrote his bill with federal government aid in mind. The state legislation he said needed to be broad enough to not conflict with the federal plan’s equity and affordability targets.

In accordance with government guidelines only California residents may visit Universal Studios Hollywood at this time. Safety guidelines and procedures are still in place for guests including face covering temperature check and social distancing.

LOS ANGELES April 16 (Xinhua) -- Universal Studios Hollywood one of the most visited tourist attractions in Los Angeles County in the U.S. state California officially reopened with limited capacity on Friday after being closed for more than a year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The theme park which reportedly drew more than 9.15 million visitors in 2019 welcomed guests back with two all-new attractions ""Jurassic World-The Ride"" and ""The Secret Life of Pets: Off the Leash.""

""Today is the start of a new beginning new dinos and new pets"" tweeted the theme park owned by Comcast Corp Friday morning.

Park officials said while most rides will be operational some rides and attractions will reopen at a later date as the theme park complies with the government restrictions.

In accordance with government guidelines only California residents may visit the theme park at this time. Safety guidelines and procedures are still in place for guests including face covering temperature check and social distancing.

Park officials reminded guests should evaluate their own risk before they visit. They noted public health agencies advise that older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and ""any interaction with the general public poses an elevated risk of being exposed to COVID-19.""



Annual and season pass members were allowed to get a preview in Universal Studios Hollywood on Thursday. The tickets for opening weekend had been reportedly sold out.

Universal Studios Hollywood as well as Disneyland Park and other theme parks in California was closed in March last year amid coronavirus scares. The closure of the theme parks came after California authorities called for the cancellation of gatherings of 250 or more people amid the pandemic.

According to Comcast's annual report Universal theme park revenue declined 68.9 percent from 5.9 billion U.S. dollars in 2019 to 1.8 billion dollars in 2020.

Disney also announced last month that the company's flagship theme parks in Orange County California are slated to reopen with limited capacity on April 30.

According to the state's Blueprint to a Safer Economy theme parks in the counties in the purple tier the most restrictive tier of California's four-tier color-coded system for reopening are not allowed to reopen. But theme parks in the less-restrictive red tier will be eligible to reopen at 15 percent capacity. Maximum capacity will be increased to 25 percent for theme parks in the counties in the orange tier and to 35 percent in the yellow tier.

Both Los Angeles County and Orange County are currently in the orange tier. The most populous state in the United States aims to fully reopen by June 15 if COVID-19 vaccinations remain widely available and hospitalizations associated with the virus stay low. ■"

Tastemaker

By Lynda Wheatley | April 17 2021

Despite what the few flurries last week might suggest baseball season is here. Who cares that Comerica Park is only letting 8000 or so fans inside the stadium for games? Twenty percent capacity is better than none and in these wild (Mid)West days of Michigan’s resurging pandemic we’ll root for any effort to keep people safe while allowing a taste of good old-fashioned normalcy (even if our state is batting well below .200 on preventing spread.)



Underdogs or not we felt like big winners during a recent dash into Rocket Fizz Soda Pop & Candy Shop when we caught sight of something that made the return of baseball season even sweeter: Big League Chew.

Forgive us if we missed the memo but we had assumed these tobacco-styled pouches of shredded bubble gum we loved as kids had left the field when the real tobacco industry took a big hit in the Master Settlement Agreement of the ’90s. In fact this “chew” has only gotten better. We splurged on a packet of Wild Pitch Watermelon.

The gum was just as stringy as we remember but in its modern melon form so much sweeter. It hit our aged and now-arrogant tastebuds with a shock of pure sugar wholly adulterated with corn syrup aspartame fake colorants and a couple of chemical additives we still can’t pronounce. In an ever-spinning world that seems primed to pitch right off its axis for the last year we can’t help but feel reassured that even in this season of change some things — for better or worse — remain the same.

Story Highlights Dogecoin price swings high with a huge influx of trading volume the second consecutive day

The DOGE price rally is expected to get a strong bullish momentum to smash the levels close to $1

Dogecoin has witnessed a brilliant organic price rally in the last couple of days the meme token has risen to an all-time high from just being less than a cent at a time. This time there was no strong hype factor behind the rally which hints that traders are taking interest in the token beyond its meme status.

Some of the key Catalysts driving the price of Dogecoin now and to propel further are as follows

The Domino Effect of Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the largest and leading cryptocurrency in the ecosystem its price trajectory has a direct impact on the performance of all the other altcoins in the market. Bitcoin has been highly bullish amidst positive developments such as Coinbase IPO. and following the suit is Dogecoin.

Another fueling factor could be the Altcoin season many altcoins like Tron(TRX) BitTorrent(BTT) XRP have surged massively in the market and now is the time for Dogecoin to shine.

The Mogul advocates of Doge

The most popular association of Dogecoin is Elon Musk who has raised the status of the token from just being a joke to a serious investment. Musk’s support to Doge goes beyond just trendy phases. He has been making constant tweets showcasing his support for Doge too.

It has been anticipated Elon Musk might have been associated with Dogecoin developers to bring in upgrades or offshoot of the coin. It is also no secret that he follows Dogecoin developers on Twitter and is quite serious about the token.

Adding to these is the mogul shark Mark Cuban. This industry giant has also been pretty advocating for Doge by his actions. Be it accepting payments in Doge for Mavericks merch and tickets or making highly bullish predictions for the token.

It is being expected of him to bring in a fundamental difference to Dogecoin to increase its relevance and use cases. Hence these giants could tentatively be the propellers to send “ Doge to the Moon” as the community says.

In a recent turn of events Doge has received a shoutout from Slim Jim the smoked meat sticks seller. It is the first one to have an actual official Dogecoin strategy and it seems to be functioning extremely well.

The news of this partnership which was first reported by Coindesk on Thursday sent the Doge price to a new high.

DOGE Gets a Shoutout From Slim Jim!

According to the CEO of parent company Conagra Brands the social media savvy snack food saw its Twitter follower count rise 160% and tweet impressions skyrocketed after it started indulging in Shiba Inu meme coin content last quarter.

This makes it the first time for Dogecoin to be ever mentioned in an earnings call and the first time a public company making a legit Doge strategy.

This move demonstrates how Dogecoin has evolved into a serious token while being true to its origin of an absurd meme coin.

Dogecoin a natural fit for Slim Jim

The CEO of Conagra Sean Connolly has spoken about how Doge is a natural fit for their Slim Jim brand.

According to the executive joining the “Online conversation about the Do Good Everyday sentiment of Dogecoin” has helped it to connect with the community in a new way.

He even credited the Dogecoin group for having a huge role in Slim Jim’s victory in Adweek’s March Madness-themed brand face-off.

On Conagra’s April 8 earnings call Connolly even said

“We’ve seen a marked uptick in audience interaction including direct engagement and advocacy from the person who created dogecoin.”

This news triggered Doge to rise nearly double to a new level of 25 cents from 13.6 cents before the news. Doge had recently settled at 24.4 cents up 83.4% in 24 hrs and 4300% for the year to date.",,,,,,,,,

The state’s cannabis market has been valued at $4.6 billion between demand from residents and tourists over 21. That’s projected to grow in the next few years now that marijuana is legal here—although analysts note that above-ground businesses will have to work hard to take over sales from the black market. All that green is enough to make those hoping to get rich (or richer) off marijuana salivate. “Imagine when Times Square has a weed store” says Ben Kovler founder and CEO of Green Thumb Industries a Chicago-based company that has medical or adult-use cannabis licenses in 12 states and has already gone public in Canada. That’s a common move for U.S. companies since federal prohibition here means they are barred from trading on the NASDAQ or New York Stock Exchange. Green Thumb paid $60 million in cash and stock to acquire one of New York’s 10 licensed medical marijuana companies Fiorello Pharmaceuticals in 2019. Sales in the state’s medical market are still slow more than five years after the first dispensaries opened and members of the newly created Cannabis Control Board who will be responsible for hammering out the details around licensing and other industry regulations for the adult-use market haven’t yet been appointed. But Kovler says the early investment may now provide an edge in the Big Apple. “We think New York is the city” Kovler said. “This is where it’s at. You can’t underestimate how important it is.” Several well-funded national and international cannabis companies already have operations in New York state and big names like the DIY-maven Martha Stewart the Rockefeller family and Constellation Brands (the liquor giant that owns Corona and Svedka) will likely have a stake. Wealthy investors and companies took two main avenues to position their entry into the adult-use market in New York: Hemp and medical marijuana.

Constellation Brands the makers of Corona beer and Svedka vodka has invested billions in the Ontario-based cannabis company Canopy Growth. Newscast/Shutterstock

The state’s limited medical marijuana industry was structured to favor applicants who could raise a lot of capital without worrying about immediate losses. While the 2021 Marijuana Taxation and Regulation Act (MRTA) setting up the adult-use market prohibits most businesses from being vertically integrated—that is handling every aspect of the supply chain themselves—that was a requirement for companies licensed under the 2014 Compassionate Care Act that set up the medical marijuana program. It gives the 10 companies selling medical marijuana in New York an edge in the adult-use market since they already grow the plant produce their own branded products and operate dispensaries around the state. All but two are now publicly traded. Most of the original license holders have either been acquired by large multi-state cannabis companies or expanded to create a national brand themselves—generally one that’s less clinical sounding and has broader appeal. New York’s Vireo Health for instance is known as Green Goods in other states—and will soon rebrand here as well. The hemp industry has a much lower barrier to entry but still attracts big-bill companies. Around 700 farmers grow the crop in New York. Hemp which is a cannabis plant with a very low percentage of the high-inducing THC can be used for industrial purposes such as weaving or to produce the extract CBD a popular ingredient in wellness products. Many New York hemp growers now say they are planning to grow marijuana as well—a transition farmers say is easy to make.

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.

Space Exploration Technologies Corp.'s (SpaceX) director of satellite policy Mr. David Goldman has agreed to accept DISH Corporation's conditions for operating his company's Starlink satellite-based internet constellation. His concessions come following a letter sent by DISH to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in which it asked the agency to modify SpaceX's license authorization to enforce operating parameters.

In his latest submission to the FCC Mr. Goldman has accepted DISH's demand and provided a consolidated response to Starlink's competitors' concerns for the service's pending third-modification application.

Starlink License Modification Demand By DISH Accepted - Satellites Under Modification Will Not Operate Above 580 Kilometers As Demanded By Amazon

The saga of DISH's demand that SpaceX's Starlink license be modified began when the company submitted a third-part analysis to the FCC. This analysis used data that SpaceX had submitted to DISH to demonstrate that if a specific Starlink satellite parameter were violated the company's user terminals would face significant interference from the internet service.

The parameter referred to as Nco is about the frequency beams that the satellites use to communicate with the user terminals. SpaceX had shared data with the FCC before DISH's analysis showing that it intended to use only one beam per frequency per satellite for similar areas but DISH following the analysis disputed SpaceX's intention of doing so.

As a result the company demanded that SpaceX's Starlink license be modified to limit the company from using more than one beam explicitly. In response Mr. Goldman has agreed to the modification with the updated license's relevant portion to now read as follows:

Operations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz (space-to-Earth) frequency band are authorized up to the power flux-density limits in 47 CFR § 25.208(o) and Article 21 of the ITU Radio Regulations and up to the equivalent power flux-density requirements of Article 22 of the ITU Radio Regulations as well as Resolution 76 (Rev. WRC-15) of the ITU Radio Regulations subject to the condition that SpaceX not use more than one satellite beam from any of its satellites in the same frequency in the same or overlapping areas at a time.

By agreeing to the concession the SpaceX executive has also asked the FCC to reject any further demands made by DISH. Additionally he has also dismissed DISH's demand that Starlink is subject to future FCC findings for determining equivalent power flux density (EPFD) limits by arguing that Starlink will be required to adhere to them by default.

Additionally Goldman has also rendered DISH's third-party analysis moot by stating that the Commission does not require EPFD data to be validated by external parties before a system is deployed. He has also rejected the requirement that SpaceX stops Starlink operations if any of pending FCC proceedings.

2 of 9

Aiming his guns at Amazon next the SpaceX executive accepts the company's demand that Starlink satellite subject to the third modification restrict their operating altitude to 580 kilometers even if Amazon does not launch any satellites for its Kuiper constellation. Furthermore he also accepted Amazon's requirement that Starlink protects Kuiper from interference despite the latter being filed in a later FCC round. SpaceX's condition for this is that it be granted a similar level of protection from Kuiper for Starlink satellites operating at lower altitudes.

The SpaceX executive's criticism of Viasat is the strongest in his latest FCC filing. While he conceded to another demand this time to provide success rates for Starlink satellites by agreeing to provide a bi-annual report detailing satellite efficiency rates and he states that Viasat's demand that SpaceX shares confidential Starlink data publically goes against Viasat's previous statements made to the commission.

Goldman believes that Viasat is seeking access to this information so that it can design its own satellite system and that the demands are ""blatantly anti-competitive and concerning.""",,,,,,,,,

This used to be a gorgeous 2020 McLaren 720S Spider but as you can see it’s currently in a quite sorry state.

The British supercar is currently listed for auction through Copart after being involved in a pretty serious accident. While it is entertaining to poke fun at supercar drivers and owners that can’t control their cars there’s no way of actually knowing whether the driver of this 720S is to blame for its damage or if it was hit by another vehicle.

Either way the damage sustained to the mid-engined supercar is quite substantial but that doesn’t mean it’s a completely lost cause. Most of the visible damage is on the passenger side of the car where the front wheel has been mangled part of the front bumper has been torn off and the hood has been bent out of shape.

A closer look at the passenger side of the McLaren reveals that the rear wheel has also taken a big hit and is now angled into the car. Damage can also be spotted on the rear bumper. Evidently the crash the car was involved in was quite severe as the driver’s-side side skirt has also been damaged. The Copart listing adds that the undercarriage has also been damaged although it is unclear to what extent.

In all likelihood the McLaren’s powertrain remains operational and could be removed and sold. Alternatively a brave soul may decide to try and repair the car and return it to its former glory.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It opened last year. Amazon now has more than 50 warehouses in the Philly region. This warehouse has 283500 square feet. It is the largest of six Amazon facilities in the city but small by Amazon standards. Read more

When Connor Lord first arrived at the Amazon Fulfillment Center in West Deptford Township he was staggered by the sheer size of the place. After driving through the traffic light to the north of the warehouse its massive bulk dwarfed everything else in this stretch of suburban South Jersey.

“It’s intimidating at first seeing this big building it looked twice the size of the Linc” said Lord who worked as an apprentice carpenter at the Eagles stadium.

By square footage none of Amazon’s facilities in the Philadelphia area can match Lincoln Financial Field. But the company has infrastructure under construction in the region that comes close to the stadium’s size like a forthcoming mega-warehouse in New Castle Del. or the new fulfillment center in Carneys Point New Jersey down the river from the West Deptford facility.

Both of these warehouses will be well more than a million square feet once completed and are among nine new Amazon facilities that the company has announced for the region in the next year with more in the works. That’s in addition to 14 sites added in 2020 across the Lehigh Valley South Jersey northern Delaware Philadelphia and its collar counties.

According to the CoStar Group Amazon now has 57 buildings online or underway across this greater Philadelphia region. Real estate and industry analysts say they have never seen anything like the company’s explosive expansion.

“They’ve been gobbling up distribution space for more than five years in a big way but the pandemic really accelerated that growth” said Adrian Ponsen director of analytics with CoStar Group in Philadelphia. “There’s no single company that’s anywhere near on the scale of what they’re doing.”

Amazon’s expansion in Philadelphia is part of a worldwide hiring spree sparked by the pandemic. The company added roughly 500000 employees in 2020 according to company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including 400000 in the United States. Amazon hired nearly 175000 people from October through December alone far more than in any prior fourth quarter. The e-commerce giant employed 950000 Americans as of last year a company spokesperson said.

Meanwhile the company has grown its real estate footprint by 50% year-over-year in 2020 company executives told investors in February. Amazon now has more than 800 warehouses across the United States.

It’s not hard to see why the company is expanding. Amazon has done phenomenally well during 2020. Its already strong share price grew steadily throughout the early months of the pandemic reaching its highest-ever level in September as its fleets of trucks and legions of workers kept stay-at-home Americans well-supplied. In addition to delivering items Amazon is the nation’s largest cloud computing company and has a leading video streaming service. Already the world’s wealthiest man the company’s CEO Jeff Bezos saw his net worth grow by more than $60 billion in the last year to $190 billion Forbes estimated this month.

Amazon’s warehouse jobs start at $15 an hour while the company’s coveted high-paying positions are massing in other locations on the Northeast corridor. The second headquarters is being opened near Washington and 7000 highly paid white-collar Amazon jobs are now located in Boston. In New York City the company purchased the former Lord & Taylor flagship on Fifth Avenue as a hub for tech workers.

In the Philadelphia region during the pandemic Amazon began hiring for tens of thousands of jobs in its vast network of warehouses. The ecommerce giant posted more than 35000 job openings in 2020 by far the most of any employer in the metropolitan area according to the nonprofit University City District. The next closest were Lowe’s and Penn Medicine which posted about 5000 jobs each last year.

Amazon’s presence in the local labor market has grown exponentially. The 35000 job postings were a roughly 1600% increase from 2019. The University City District used data from Burning Glass Technologies a Boston software firm that scrapes the internet for public job postings. Amazon does not make regional-wide breakdowns available but said that it now has 25000 full- and part-time workers in Pennsylvania. Most of its infrastructure is concentrated in the southeast corner of the state.

The company’s regional strategy is partly focused on I-95 with the great majority of warehouses laced around the Northeast corridor highway. Many of Amazon’s earliest locations in the greater region were million-square-foot fulfillment centers in farther-flung locations like Easton Pa. and Robbinsville.

These enormous warehouses are where workers pick products for particular orders from vast subsections like toys or books and pack them for shipment to “sortation centers.” There they are arranged (“sorted”) by final destination and consolidated onto geographically targeted trucks.

From there packages go to the final-mile delivery centers like the warehouses in King of Prussia and South Philadelphia which are smaller and send out fleets of small vans to make direct deliveries.

Siting the warehouses along I-95 also allows the Philadelphia-area infrastructure especially the hulking fulfillment centers to help serve even larger markets to the north and south.

“From these centers they can serve not just Philadelphia but it’s pretty easy for them to hit either New York or Baltimore-Washington” says Ponsen. “It makes sense for them because it’s much cheaper to locate out there in Lehigh Bucks or South Jersey and those areas have big blue-collar population bases for them to hire.”

Amazon relied on shipping companies to deliver many items until about 2019 said Subodha Kumar a marketing and supply-chain professor at Temple’s Fox School of Business. Now the e-commerce giant is building the nation’s largest logistics firm to ship its own packages a sign of how much business it was giving its former partners FedEx and UPS. Amazon which also fulfills orders for third-party sellers using its platform will eventually ship more packages than its former partners Kumar said.

“This is where Amazon has really cracked the game or at least done an outstanding job compared to other companies” he said. “Initially they had some hiccups but now they have almost perfected the system.”

Amazon expects a surge in sales to continue this year and wants to move more shipments to two-hour delivery Kumar said. That combination of growing sales while slashing delivery times requires many more fulfillment and distribution centers close to customers.

”They have a grand agenda of going to 30-minute delivery as well” he said. “So that’s where we are going to see some big growth and this whole Northeast region is a big market for them.”

Philadelphia and Amazon have much to offer each other.

Amazon’s rapid growth in the region is not just a reflection of the increased demand for deliveries said economist Joel Naroff president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Bucks County. The Philadelphia area had been underserved by Amazon and was not a major distribution center.

“I think Amazon needed some catch-up in this area and that need was just accelerated by the pandemic” said Naroff.

The region also needs a fair share of the growing distribution sector calling warehousing “the new manufacturing job” he said. These jobs could be a good fit for Philadelphia which has a significantly underskilled workforce he added. Philadelphia trails other big East Coast cities like Boston and Washington in educational attainment according to Census estimates.

“Is $15 an hour with benefits a good job for an unskilled worker? I think the answer is ‘It’s a real good start’” Naroff said.

But many others want more despite the fact that Amazon this month handily defeated a concerted campaign to unionize workers at its Bessemer Ala. warehouse.

Some Amazon workers here have criticized their compensation and working conditions including one Philadelphia woman who claims she was fired for speaking up. Courtney Bowden 31 has a pending case against Amazon through the National Labor Relations Board.

Bowden was a package sorter at Amazon’s King of Prussia facility and an advocate for better working conditions. To campaign for paid time off she’d hand out red buttons reading “Amazonians United for PTO.” She’d also point out problems to management such as when Amazon was behind on paying workers for time spent on shuttle buses she said.

The King of Prussia facility did not have parking available for employees so the company picked up workers from a parking lot about five miles away she said and they were not paid for that travel time.

Amazon fired her in March 2020 just as the coronavirus started to sweep the country.

“They fired me because they knew that I was getting ready to start a coronavirus [safety] campaign” Bowden said. “I think they said ‘Courtney is definitely going to give us a problem.’” Amazon did not respond to questions about the case.

Some workers report the warehouse work to be dull with four 10-hour shifts a week that require near constant exertion. Nicholas Raymond Cicerone worked at the King of Prussia facility from May to November of 2020 but quit despite being upgraded from part-time worker to full-time.

“Honestly it was one of the worst jobs I ever had” said Cicerone who worked at Walmart on the weekends making $11 an hour while going to the Amazon site on weekdays for $15 an hour.

“At Amazon everything was nonstop but also the exact same every day” said Cicerone. “I liked working at Walmart a lot better. They were more accommodating and tried to make their employees happy.”

Amazon maintains that its attrition rate is on par with the industry average but did not provide numbers for the region.

Amazon’s technology

Other warehouse workers say that Amazon compares favorably with other jobs they’ve had in the sector citing its technology.

Since October Doun Yang has been working at the new Amazon last-mile delivery warehouse on 2400 Weccacoe Ave. behind the South Philadelphia Ikea. Yang says that the warehouse -- the largest of Amazon’s six facilities in Philadelphia but still small by the company’s standards -- is clean well-ordered and features up-to-date technology that makes the work less difficult and safer than a similar job he held at a UPS warehouse.

“I left UPS because the technology wasn’t up-to-date and I didn’t enjoy doing it as much because it’s not as organized” says Yang. “Amazon has their own system they follow and better equipment which makes the job a little easier.”

The warehouse where Yang works used to house a Hyundai-Rotem factory that manufactured train cars for public transit agencies in cities such as Philadelphia and Boston. Many of Amazon’s new facilities are similarly sited on old industrial sites like the former Fairless steel mill in Bucks County or the company’s forthcoming project in Wilmington where General Motors closed a factory in 2009.

CoStar’s Ponsen says these sites are useful both for their scale and because they virtually guarantee vast reserves of labor nearby which the company’s business model demands.

“One of the reasons that Harrisburg Lehigh Valley Bucks County have attracted so many of these distributors is because there needs to be some density of blue-collar labor where they’re going” says Ponsen.

With pay beginning at $15 an hour and health and retirement benefits included for full-time workers Amazon’s jobs can easily compete with most nonunion jobs though they don’t pay as much as traditional manufacturing jobs.

“It’s been decades since anyone was trying to rapidly expand in places like Lehigh Valley and lower Bucks County hiring thousands of non-college-educated workers” said Ponsen. “These are not as family-sustaining jobs as a lot of manufacturing sites that they’re filling in but it’s still a significant difference from companies leaving and nothing coming in.”

Amazon’s future growth in the region will depend on the extent to which brick-and-mortar retail can bounce back from the pandemic. It will also depend on the profitability of last-mile distribution centers.

“Amazon is a dynamic business and we are constantly exploring new locations” said Andre Woodson a Amazon spokesperson via email. “We weigh a variety of factors when deciding where to develop future sites to best serve customers. However Amazon has a policy of not commenting on our future roadmap.”

Amazon’s big rival is Walmart

During the pandemic Amazon has been competing with Walmart for the home-delivery market. The two companies are the largest private employers in the nation and Walmart is one of the few that operates at similar scale to Amazon.

“Amazon is grabbing all this customer base and they are at war with Walmart” says Richard Gorodesky senior managing director with Colliers International. “They have two different models Amazon doesn’t have stores for pickup -- at least not yet -- while Walmart has stores and has started home delivery. Assuming the consumer pie remains the same it’s a question of how the pie will be divided.”

In Amazon’s hunger for growth Gorodesky says it has been paying above-average industrial rents as it consumes ever more space.

“The question is ‘Do the last-mile delivery centers make money for them?’ If the answer is yes [long term] then they’ll continue to grow” says Gorodesky.

At the West Deptford Fulfillment Center Connor Lord said he liked working for Amazon at first. While physically exhausting it was relatively easy and he enjoyed getting to know his coworkers in the brief moments he had time to talk with them.

After the holiday crush however Lord grew increasingly disillusioned and compared Amazon’s culture unfavorably with his time in the National Guard.

“Coming from the Army officers always talk down on soldiers but they try to get acquainted with them too” says Lord. “But the bosses at Amazon they wouldn’t really care. They would think of you as more of a number or a robot.”

Lord ended up quitting in mid-March after four months confident that he can find a better-paying and less alienating job.

Where is Amazon headed?

Reflecting on his time at Amazon Lord feels something needs to change. He’d been following the Amazon unionization drive in Alabama where 6000 warehouse workers opted not to organize in the face of intense opposition from the company.

In an interview before the election results were known Lord said that unionization might actually make Amazon’s jobs sustainable as a longer-term career. His relatives have jobs as electricians carpenters or nurses. Many belong to unions.

“My family members their jobs the time they put in it definitely pays” said Lord. “Whereas with Amazon it’s more of a short-term job for someone who needs a few months’ wages to get by.”

Labor leaders in the Philadelphia region would not comment on whether they have plans to organize any Amazon facilities. But they do note that warehouse work has been unionized historically and that many jobs in the area still are especially in companies like UPS.

“There are talks about it” said Richard Hooker president of Teamsters Local 623 which counts many warehouse workers among its members. “We have to talk about how to stop this antilabor company from dominating all aspects of work. They are a grocery a delivery warehouses they are in everything. It’s not over. This is just the beginning.”

Labor sympathizers note that it took unionization campaigns to turn the manufacturing jobs of earlier decades into the family-sustaining positions that are eulogized today.

President Joe Biden at least seems to like the idea. In a precedent-breaking move he issued a video reminding workers in Bessemer that it was their right not the company’s to decide if they want to unionize. Although labor supporters cheered the statement it did not sway the outcome of the vote which Amazon won by more than a 2-1 ratio.

Bezos famous for keeping a ‘day-one’ start-up mentality at Amazon isn’t satisfied with the victory. “It’s clear to me that we need a better vision for how we create value for employees — a vision for their success” he wrote to shareholders last week.

For his part Lord said Amazon “might turn into a better place. But we got to see how Amazon plays it. They’re a powerful monopoly and they’re very intimidating. Time will tell with that.”

The brand will launch its Brioche Burger Buns and Brioche Hot Dog Rolls into 57 Costco warehouses in Northern California from early May. As part of its partnership with the retailer both products will for the first time be twin-packed creating a specific club pack for Costco.

California has the highest number of Costco locations across America accounting for 23 percent of the portfolio. St Pierre will now sell through more than 10 percent of the chain’s stores driving a significant increase in distribution for the European brand.

After launching into America in 2014 St Pierre has secured brioche a regular spot in shoppers’ baskets and as the category leader it continues to deliver growth opportunities for retailers.

In 2018 the total brioche category was worth $152mn but by the end of 2020 the brioche sector had more than doubled with category value standing at $394mn. Nielsen data (February 2021) shows that St Pierre is key to driving value for retailers and is responsible for a third of the market.

Paul Baker founder of St Pierre Groupe which owns the St Pierre Bakery brand comments “The launch into Costco represents a step change for our business. The team has worked incredibly hard and with the support of our distribution partner Lipari Foods we have become the number one brioche brand in America—but there is still huge opportunity. That’s why we are investing in our in-house capabilities in terms of sales and marketing with professionals who bring with them years of experience in the US retail market working with big name brands.""

“We have been busy working on a proposition that will appeal to the Warehouse and Club store market and the launch into Costco is the first example of that work coming to fruition. We have a unique and exciting opportunity to create a household name brand and we’re planning to make lots of noise this year.""

St Pierre has driven the Brioche category with 63 percent brand growth year-on-year whilst the rest of the category has grown at 61 percent. Research from the brand shows that 34 percent of consumers are buying brioche every time they go grocery shopping. Nielsen U.S. Foods data (March 2021) demonstrates that the brand has consistently outpaced private label brioche in value sales for the past 12 months.

Previously available only as a four-pack it is the first-time the larger format six pack Brioche Burger Buns will retail in the U.S. market. The 6 pack Brioche Burger Buns and 6 pack Brioche Hot Dog Rolls will retail as larger twin-packs at Costco in bold shelf-ready cases from early May.

In my old career I worked in close contact with the public during Ontario's SARS outbreak in the early 2000s. Later that same decade I was charged with creating a business continuity plan for a large private security company as the threat of Swine Flu loomed large. When I first read about the viral outbreak in China in late 2019 dancing with paranoia and anxiety as I do I calmly headed to Home Depot in search of N95 masks and a number of pharmacies to buy up the supplies I'd need to keep myself an my extended family well-stocked with homemade hand sanitizer and cleansing wipes for months to come. On the way home I thought to myself that without knowing it I'd been preparing for a long time to deal what might be to come. My wife and I then fucked off to Africa on a working vacation for a month. As we backpacked across Morocco I kept up on the case count in Asia.

We left Morocco a day before the kingdom closed its doors to air travel.

We were only home for a few days when Calgary where we staying with family at the time was ordered into lock down. I made hand sanitizer and wipes. We'd just done a Costco run. We were worried but calm.

Most days I spent time talking my sister-in-law down after she watched our Prime Minister's daily COVID-19 briefing. I did my job. I prepared an isolation room for my wife when while on her way home from a week's rotation at her job she called to tell me that she had a number of symptoms that suggested that she might have contracted the virus. I brought food to her and monitored her condition over the next week. I prayed to Santa Muerte (we'll talk about that some other time) and brought my wife food and cold medication. She was tested. She was fine.

We lasted until the fall in Alberta before making for Vancouver Island to winter in the RV.

Setting up camp in relative isolation helped with the stress of living in a time of plague. We were fortunate enough to be surrounded by wooded walking trails. The ocean was a few minutes of driving away. We could do nothing in so many beautiful places. We're still doing well as the number of third-wave cases and an inept vaccine rollout fills hospitals and soon morgues across my county. We've laid in supplies again hoping for the best expecting the worse.

At any time during any of this I could have fallen into a deep depression. The isolation or the fear of simply breathing the air could have paralyzed me despite the drugs I take daily to help me hold my shit together. It didn't happen.

And then it did.

Two weeks ago all of the shit I had managed to hold on to for over a year got lost.

I was surprised to find that it had nothing to do with sickness worry over my family and few friends or how unbalanced I feel staying in the same places for so long. I realized that I was fed the fuck up with technology. It's digging a hole and asking me to lay down and fill it.

My days are spent in front of laptop desktop and tablet displays. On the evenings that I write for this site my screen time runs hours longer. I left Facebook and Instagram in a white hot rage. My interactions on Twitter with friends I have not seen for years feel hollow. Cruising CounterSocial for content reminds me of what Twitter used to be but I'm not able to engage and know no one on the network. The news angers and numbs me in turns. I have a smartwatch that tracks the meaningless moments of my life and a smartphone which of late only tells me things I do not want to know. It's all I can do to sit down and write. I started this post and deleted it five times before surrendering. My first successful draft was crafted in longhand.

I hope to find a way out of my digital despair. But working in online service journalism for a living and currently having no other window on the world—due to the state of the world—I have no idea yet of what changes I can practically make.

I'm looking at it as an experiment in mental health. I'll let you know how its going as things proceed.

The widowed British monarch setting an example amid the coronavirus pandemic sat alone at the ceremony dressed in black and with her head bowed in prayer.

Philip who died April 9 two months shy of his 100th birthday was honored at Windsor Castle in a service that was steeped in military and royal tradition but also pared down and infused with his own personality. The entire royal procession and funeral took place out of public view within the grounds of the castle a 950-year-old royal residence 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of London but was shown live on television.

Coronavirus restrictions meant that instead of the 800 mourners expected in the longstanding plans for Philip's funeral only 30 people were allowed inside the castle's St. George’s Chapel including the queen her four children and her eight grandchildren.

Following strict social distancing rules during the pandemic the queen set an example even in grief sitting apart from family members who were arrayed around the church.

Prince Charles the heir to the throne sat opposite the monarch alongside his wife Camilla. Prince Andrew was two seats to the queen's left. Prince William and his wife Kate sat directly opposite from his brother Prince Harry who had traveled back from California without his pregnant wife Meghan.

People across Britain observed one minute of silence in honor of Philip just before the funeral got underway. Under soft spring sunshine some locals earlier stopped outside the castle to leave flowers but people largely heeded requests by police and the palace not to gather because of the pandemic.

Philip's coffin traveled to the chapel on a specially adapted Land Rover designed by the prince himself. The coffin was draped in his personal standard and topped with his Royal Navy cap sword and a wreath of flowers.

For the procession senior military commanders lined up in front of the vehicle. The children of Philip and the queen — Charles Princess Anne Andrew and Prince Edward — walked behind the hearse while the 94-year-old queen traveled to the chapel in a Bentley car.

Grandsons Prince William and Prince Harry also walked behind the coffin although not side by side. The brothers whose relationship has been strained amid Harry’s decision to quit royal duties and move to California flanked their cousin Peter Phillips the son of Anne.

For many viewers the moment stirred memories of William and Harry at 15 and 12 walking behind the coffin of their mother Princess Diana in 1997 accompanied by their grandfather Philip in a London ceremony televised around the world.

Later Saturday the two brothers were seen walking together and chatting as the mourners left the chapel after the service.

The funeral reflected Philip's military ties both as a ceremonial commander of many units and as a veteran of war. More than 700 military personnel took part including army bands Royal Marine buglers and an honor guard drawn from across the armed forces.

Inside the Gothic chapel the setting for centuries of royal weddings and funerals the service was simple and somber.



The ceremony began with Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby entering the chapel ahead of the coffin followed by Philip’s children and three of his eight grandchildren as a four-member socially distanced choir sang “I am the resurrection and the life.”

There was no sermon at Philip’s request and no family eulogies or readings in keeping with royal tradition. But Dean of Windsor David Conner said the country had been enriched by Philip’s “unwavering loyalty to our queen by his service to the nation and the Commonwealth by his courage fortitude and faith.”

Philip spent almost 14 years in the Royal Navy and saw action in the Mediterranean Sea the Indian Ocean and the Pacific during World War II. Several elements of his funeral had a maritime theme including the hymn “Eternal Father Strong to Save” which is associated with seafarers and asks God: “O hear us when we cry to thee/For those in peril on the sea.”

Leading a prayer Conner said: “Grant unto him the assurance of thine ancient promise that thou wilt ever be with those who go down to the sea in ships and occupy their business in great waters.”

As Philip’s coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault Royal Marine buglers sounded “Action Stations” an alarm that alerts sailors to prepare for battle. Its inclusion after the traditional bugle call of “The Last Post” was a personal request from Philip.

Philip was placed in the vault alongside the remains of 24 other royals including three kings of England. But it will likely not be his permanent resting place. After the queen's death she and Philip are expected to be buried in the Royal Burial Ground on the Frogmore Estate close to Windsor Castle.

Along with Philip’s children and grandchildren the 30 funeral guests included other senior royals and several of his German relatives. Philip was born a prince of Greece and Denmark and like the queen is related to a thicket of European royal families.

Ahead of the funeral Buckingham Palace released a photo of the queen and Philip smiling and relaxing on blankets in the grass in the Scottish Highlands in 2003. The palace said the casual photo was a favorite of the queen.

For decades Philip was a fixture of British life renowned for his founding of the Duke of Edinburgh’s Awards program that encouraged youths to challenge themselves and for a blunt-spoken manner that at times included downright offensive remarks. He lived in his wife’s shadow but his death has sparked a reflection about his role and new appreciation from many in Britain.

“He was a character an absolute character” said Jenny Jeeves as she looked at the floral tributes in Windsor. “He was fun he was funny. Yes he made quite a few gaffes but it depends which way you took it really. Just a wonderful husband father and grandfather and a good example to all of us.”

Netflix's The Crown has been a huge hit with users of the streaming platform since it launched in 2016. The series explores the Royal Family covering real and fictional plots and showcasing some of the most scandalous events within Buckingham Palace. But the palace didn't allow the show to use its real location to shoot which production designer Martin Childs told Express.co.uk and other publications he was glad about.

Speaking about filming the hit series Martin said: ""I did a little exercise recently to work out how many locations we've used to play the parts of Buckingham Palace and it was 50 including the five places that we built at Elstree. ""So part of the exercise really is looking at all those rooms in all of those houses connecting them to look like one house. ""So the invisible thread between all of them needs to establish itself so that all of the bits that you have to necessarily invent like private apartments must feel real must feel like they belong to all of the bits that we're more familiar with."" He said he did an ""undercover tour"" of the palace ahead of series one to get a feel for how things should look. READ MORE: Princess Diana scene left The Crown director with 'hands in my mouth'

Talking about detailing how he brought the unique nature of the palace alive he explained that the upstairs apartments were built in an enfilade meaning there were four rooms in a row connected by doors rather than by a corridor. He said: ""As soon as I knew that about the private apartments and the Queen's bedroom and dressing room and Philip's bedroom then I had a kind of like an architectural metaphor for an extraordinary marriage because it meant they can close doors on one another the distance between them is physical.

Following Prince Philip's death Netflix has been told to apologise for a ""shockingly malicious"" scene in The Crown involving the Duke. Since the Duke of Edinburgh's death last week the storyline has been criticised after it was reported to have upset Prince Philip. The season two episode shows flashbacks to the death of Prince Philip's sister who died in a plane crash at 26 and royal experts said the portrayal of the incident upset the Duke at the time. He was 16 years old at the time of the tragedy and the incident portrayed in the series indicated that he had been blamed for the death.

‘And also I kind of sided with him which is controversial. I felt “Yeah I wouldn’t really want to kneel to my wife.”’

Tobias Menzies

Tobias Menzies took over the role of the Duke for seasons three and four.

In a recent interview with The Guardian the actor said he believes ‘there’s a lot of different forces at play within him.’

He explained: ‘He was someone who was very wary to show his feelings and yet atmospherically he’s not a cool presence he’s quite hot…

‘He’s abrasive. He’s challenging. He’s funny. But there’s an energy about it: it’s not calm it’s not gentle. And those things seem to be kind of warring inside him.

‘And so actually for someone who doesn’t want to give much away he often feels like he is giving quite a lot of way.’

Despite the controversies that Prince Philip faced throughout his lifetime Tobias had nothing but praise for him.

Tobias quoted Shakespeare for his tribute to the Duke (Picture: Rex)

He added: “For someone who clearly was not comfortable with [the role] he managed to do it with quite a high degree of dignity and patience.

“The idea of this alpha male spending his life walking two or three steps behind his wife … to be in an almost entirely ceremonial position it’s fascinating.

“It’s the stuff of Greek drama. [It] is to his credit the effect he’s had on that institution on that family.

“He took that completely non-role incredibly seriously applied a huge amount of energy and inventiveness and created a life for himself with great ingenuity and great energy.

“I think the institution itself benefited from that … he was partly involved in the transition from an aristocratic family to one that was marked by largely middle-class values.

“He helped to open it up and to a certain degree demystify a lot of the stuff that was going on and modernise it.”

The Crown is perhaps one of the best-known modern depictions of the Duke and in first two seasons we saw Prince Philip played by Matt Smith as a confident if sometimes cranky man chafing at the restrictions placed upon him by being married to the Queen. But as we learn more about Prince Philip's family tree we also learn that he was also a man dealing with trauma; the trauma left after a turbulent childhood that involved the mental ill health of his mother the cruelty of his father the death of a beloved sister the fleeing of Greece after the royal family were toppled and the misery of World War Two (three of Philip’s sisters married prominent Nazis).

But by the time we got to The Crown season three we meet an older Philip (played by Tobias Menzies); and in episode four of season three – an episode called “Bubbikins” based on the nickname Philip’s mother gave him – his family tree once again comes to the fore mainly through a renewed relationship with his mother Princess Alice of Battenberg (played by Jane Lapotaire). But how much of that portrayal of Prince Philip and his mother actually based on reality?

Who was Prince Philip's mother?

The mother of Prince Philip was Princess Alice of Battenberg was born Victoria Alice Elizabeth Julia Marie in Windsor Castle and was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. She married Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark when she was still a teenager and went on to have five children; Philip her only son and four daughters. In the early 1920s the Greek royal family were toppled and Princess Alice and her family had to flee to Paris; Prince Philip was only a baby.

Over the next decades Princess Alice’s family were dispersed: Philip went to school in England and Scotland; the four girls married German nobility (with Nazi connections); and Prince Andrew settled in Monte Carlo having little to do with his family.

Later in the 1920s Princess Alice suffered mental ill health: having been born deaf she had found herself isolated and she began to experience ‘religious delusions’ believing that she had been intimate with Christ. She was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and treated by Sigmund Freud in Germany. Freud believed there was a problem with Princess Alice’s hormone levels and ordered X-rays of her ovaries a treatment that is believed to have prompted an early menopause. Later she was sent to a sanitorium in Switzerland where she remained for several years.

An elderly chain-smoking nun she was an embarrassment to Philip who says at one point in the episode that she was only ever ‘technically’ his mother.

Having escaped the sanitorium she returned to Athens and throughout World War Two she sheltered Jews (even as several other members of her family were involved with the Nazi party). She stayed in Greece after the war and founded an Orthodox order of nuns staying at the convent for decades.

The Crown season three picks up at this point; when military rule was imposed in Greece in 1967 she was thought to be unsafe and brought to England to live with Prince Philip and the Queen. An elderly chain-smoking nun she was an embarrassment to Philip who says at one point in the episode that she was only ever ‘technically’ his mother: ‘It means she gave birth to me.’

At that point in the late 1960s the royal family was enduring a spell of unpopularity and making efforts to prove their worth and authenticity. In season three episode four of The Crown they invite a documentary crew into the palace to film them but as they watch the show Gogglebox-style it becomes apparent that they are stilted ridiculous. Only when a Guardian journalist gets access to Princess Alice and is able to tell the story of her extraordinary life does the family enjoy a boost in popularity. The theme of this episode is authenticy: who has it and who doesn’t; can it be faked and how it is earned. After it becomes clear that Princess Alice is the truly authentic royal she lives out her last years in the peaceful and grand surroundings of the Palace just as she did in real life.

Did Prince Philip Speak Greek?

As the country reflects on Philip's life people are wondering about the man behind the titles - and lots of are googling whether Prince Philip's upbringing meant he spoke Greek. So did Philip speak Greek? While Philip was born in Greece he left when he was a baby and so never learnt the language. His family spoke English and he grew up speaking French and German too - quite the linguist."

The “Transforming Rail in Virginia” initiative which Virginia governor Mr Ralph Northam unveiled in December 2019 will “expand Amtrak and VRE [Virginia Railway Express] rail services create a pathway for the separation of freight and passenger rail in Virginia and preserve future rail corridors.” The state Amtrak CSX and VRE finalised agreements last month.

CSX said it will sell certain interests in three CSX-owned line segments for a total of $US 525m. According to the initiative Virginia will acquire 618km of CSX right-of-way and 358.8km of track in rail corridors paralleling the I-95 I-64 and I-85 highways.

“This first phase of the agreement is for the conveyance of a permanent land easement to enable the separation of passenger and freight rail operations in the Washington DC to Petersburg Virginia corridor” CSX reported. “The remaining phases of the deal relate to line segments from Petersburg Virginia to Ridgeway North Carolina and from Doswell Virginia to Clifton Forge Virginia. CSX anticipates closing on the remaining conveyances over the next two years.”

“This transaction highlights our ability to find creative ways to generate meaningful value from our assets while enhancing the safety and efficiency of passenger and freight rail service in a vital transportation corridor” says CSX president and CEO Mr James Foote. “CSX looks forward to our continued partnership with the [state] which will benefit commuters as well as our valued freight customers in the future.”

""It was unreal"" smiled quarterback Evan Cummins ""it just felt so good to be back out there and just playing again with all the fans here it felt like a real home game.""

Cummins started for the gold team in Saturday's spring game and thew two touchdown passes both to freshman wide receiver Cam Underwood.

""Man I was so psyched I woke up at 5 AM just feeling so ready for today"" Underwood added ""I was just playing music and then coming out here and seeing the fans got me more excited.""

The quarterback competition is still ongoing for the Bulldogs but Cummins was one of the top performers on Saturday.

Head coach Tony Annese says he is extremely impressed with his junior quarterback but says he won't name a starter until the season opener.

Evan Cummins has always shown his ability to scramble but during today’s @FerrisFootball spring game it has been his passing ability on display.

""People will find out who our quarterback will be when we take our first snap against Findlay"" said Annese ""we've got a lot of decisions to make but Evan played well today he's got an unbelievable skill set I love his growth absolutely.""

And Cummins is aware of the situation he's in with five or six quarterbacks being in the mix for the starting job.

""We have five or six guys that are really competitive"" Cummins added ""we know the best man is going to win the job we just have to make sure the next man is just as good and just as ready.""

In 2019 Cummins finished third on the team in rushing with 454 yards but was 28-of-56 passing on the season playing behind Jayru Campbell and Travis Russell who have both graduated.

""It just felt good to throw the ball again I didn't get a lot of chances last season to throw"" said Cummins ""when I get the opportunities I try to make the best of them.""

It combines bits and pieces from so many different corners of the automotive culture we’re still trying to recover our jaws off the floor after finding out that everything was done in the owner's backyard with no help from fancy tooling garage professionals or a beefed-up bank account.Instead all it took was a lot of love for the COE some friends a neighbor with a great mechanical skill set and (probably) a lot of Corona beer—you’ll understand this reference once you see the tribute in the cabin. By the way everything we see on this salvaged C600 has the “homemade” mark.And it’s a lot to take in since the truck started off initially as just the cab and frame then was married to a 1991 Ram 3500 chassis and its modern 5.9-liter turbo diesel from Cummins along with the stick shift gearbox. Now this truck is clearly still a work in progress  as evidenced by the make-shift shifter seen towering inside the cabin but the level of detailing is frankly astonishing.It’s best to enjoy the footage (video embedded below) but here are the highlights. The cabin was entirely done by hand (including the “dog cage”) the left and right fuel tanks will eventually become a cooler and barbeque while the back bumper taillights have been created out of old propane torches!Given the Cummins swap you’d think the main draw here would be under the cabin—we get a peek in there at the 3-minute mark before moving on to the 4:35 mark when the ride and drone footage action start. Frankly the one thing that shocked us the most is the rear bumper which is basically a chained piece of paper that seems to be taken directly off a light/utility pole!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoaXMteW91dHViZXItY3VtbWlucy1zd2FwcGVkLWhpcy13cmVja2VkLW11c3Rhbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This YouTuber Cummins-Swapped His Wrecked Mustang,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoaXMteW91dHViZXItY3VtbWlucy1zd2FwcGVkLWhpcy13cmVja2VkLW11c3Rhbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NieXRlc2FwcC5jb20vbmV3cy9zcG9ydHMvcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtaXBsLW51bWJlcnMtYWdhaW5zdC10aGUtcmNiL3N0b3J50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IPL 2021: Decoding the performance of Pat Cummins against RCB,"Next Article

CVS is bringing healthy foods and meat-alternatives to communities across America.

The pharmacy chain and Beyond Meat just announced a partnership that would bring meat-alternative burgers and meatballs to 7000 stores nationwide. CVS will also add 60 new ""better for you"" snacks and 50 new frozen foods that are vegan organic gluten-free plant based and zero-sugar-added.

Now valued at $8.7 billion Beyond Meat became the first plant-based meat-substitute company to go public just two years ago. The company has continued to expand by partnering with McDonald's and Taco Bell as traditional meat seller Tyson rushes to catch up with its own plant-based line.

The deal may suggest Beyond Meat decreasing its reliance on foodservice. Foodservice sales through restaurants that sell Beyond Meat including Carl's Jr. and BurgerFi dropped 31% year-over-year in 2020 CEO Ethan Brown said on a recent earnings call.

Revenue from retail however increased by 108% between 2019 and 2020 but Brown said the trend will drop in 2021 as the pandemic subsides. ""We've got a lot of room still to grow in retail"" Brown said.

The CVS partnership which represented the first pharmacy Beyond Meat sold at could be its first step into retail growth.

""CVS is ubiquitous in neighborhoods and communities across America and Beyond Meat is proud to partner with them as our first pharmacy partner to bring increased choice and access to nutritious food options to their consumers"" a Beyond Meat spokesperson told Insider. ""The addition of the Beyond Burger and Beyond Meatballs at CVS aligns with CVS' larger effort to help its millions of customers make healthier choices.""

How bringing Beyond Meat to CVS could bring meat-alternatives to food deserts.

CVS sells more groceries than Trader Joe's and Whole Foods the Guardian reported due to the store's prevalence in low-income areas that don't have access to high-end grocery stores.

CVS has nearly 10000 locations in the US D.C. and Puerto Rico. Kroger the company's largest supermarket has just 2750 locations. Walmart the country's largest retailer has 5342 stores as of January 2021 — meaning CVS has more stores than Kroger and Walmart combined.

The lack of quality grocery stores in disproportionately low-income areas result in ""food deserts"" or areas more than a mile from fresh produce-sellers that rely more on processed and pre-packaged food.

Diets that limit processed foods and sugary beverages are associated with higher life expectancy. But there's twice as many supermarkets carrying fresh produce in higher-income areas than lower-income ones per non-profit World of Vegan and just 2% of meat alternatives are available in low-income areas.

Independent nutritionists told Insider's Aria Bendix and other outlets Beyond Meat burgers are processed and have roughly similar calories to beef patties. Beyond Meat maintains its products are less caloric.

But nutritionists said Beyond Meat burgers are high in fiber and protein and can provide a better alternative to red meat. Beyond Meat can also lead to fewer instances of food poisoning than when consuming beef.

Bringing Beyond Meat and other ""better for you"" snack options to CVS locations might lessen the reliance on junk food in ""food deserts."" Better access to nutritional food would be most beneficial to Black and Latino Americans whose communities have fewer supermarkets than their white counterparts per Johns Hopkins.

""The expanded assortment of food items is the latest way we serve as a premier health and wellness destination making it easier for millions of customers to access healthier choices and meal solutions without having to make extra trips to specialty and grocery stores"" a CVS spokesperson said in a statement.

Ned Lamont April 13 expressing concerns with legislation expanding state-run healthcare and imposing a new tax on policyholders.

“The pandemic has demonstrated that employees can work virtually making it easier for companies to choose where they are domiciled and grow” the executives wrote in the letter.

“As a result it has never been more critical for the state to create a climate that retains and attracts businesses that will help stabilize the economy. All of us will have to decide where it will be best to deploy our resources long term.

“Private employers and taxpayers should not fund unsustainable public policy pursuits.”

Signed by the CEOs of Anthem Cigna CVS Health Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare and UnitedHealth Group the letter warned that passage of SB 842—which expands state-run healthcare—”will only further deteriorate the state’s fragile economy.”

Fiscal Health Questions

In February CBIA called for an independent audit to address the significant questions surrounding the fiscal health of the state’s municipal plan—known as the State Partnership Plan—which is the model for SB 842.

State Comptroller Kevin Lembo a leading advocate for expanding state-run healthcare manages the partnership plan. He has yet to respond to the audit request.

“The State Partnership Plan does not have the proven experience to run a health insurance program for its residents” the letter signed by the executives notes.

“The state comptroller administered the partnership program at a shortfall of $10 million in 2018 and $31 million in 2019.

“Taking from one pot of money to cover a deficit in another is not sound fiscal policy.” April 13 CEO letter

“The argument put forth attempts to argue the partnership program is solvent and successful; we would argue that taking from one pot of money to cover a deficit in another is not sound fiscal policy.

“Continuing on this path will only further deteriorate the state’s fragile economy.”

CBIA’s call for an audit cited the latest detailed and concerning analysis of the plan’s fiscal outlook produced by the insurance agency Brown & Brown.

The agency has a large number of clients enrolled in the municipal plan. Brown & Brown officials are concerned with the plan’s unregulated status and believe greater oversight is needed to ensure its fiscal health.

Tax Hike

In the letter to Lamont and legislative leaders the insurance company CEOs also addressed a proposed tax hike—modeled on a now repealed federal tax—that will drive up healthcare costs for employers and families.

The $50 million tax on healthcare polices included in SB 842 and HB 6447 is designed to fund additional premium subsidies for policies issued by the state-run healthcare exchange.

The executives argued that the federal American Rescue Plan Act signed into law March 11 provides the premium relief sought by both bills without raising taxes on small businesses and residents.

“The state should not attempt to lower the cost of insurance for some by imposing significant new taxes on others.” CEO letter

“While we believe your intent is one we share—to bolster the state’s health exchange Access Health CT—we firmly believe that state and newly passed federal funding can and should be used for this purpose—not a new tax on policyholders” the letter notes.

“Residents are already paying over $100 million in health insurance taxes to the state. The state should not attempt to lower the cost of insurance for some by imposing significant new taxes on others that will inevitably be passed along to policyholders in the form of higher premiums.”

Innovation

A recent independent report showed that the 2019 repeal of the federal tax on insurance policies will reduce premiums by more than $270 billion over the next 10 years.

The health insurance executives also referenced Lamont’s call for private sector innovation to address rising healthcare costs and to support small businesses.

“You rightly called upon the private market to continue innovating and providing more choices for some of our struggling small employers” the letter read. “We have done just that. There are now a number of offerings with new products in the market.

The 2019 repeal of the federal tax on insurance policies will reduce premiums by more than $270 billion over 10 years.

“To allow carriers to innovate and further compete the administration and the legislature should explore updating the current legal and regulatory framework to allow for maximum flexibility.

“We look to you to provide leadership and focus on proposals that will provide much-needed stability and support.

“As companies committed to the people and communities of Connecticut we look forward to working with you your administration and the legislature to find ways to build a sustainable affordable and more accessible health system for the people we are privileged to serve.”

Economic Impact

According to a 2019 study produced by the Connecticut Economic Resource Center the health insurance industry employs 25058 workers and supports another 23000-plus additional jobs in ancillary industries.

The study found that industry employers pay $5.2 billion in wages and benefits annually with an average salary of $123000.

Connecticut’s health insurance industry employs 25058 workers and supports another 23000-plus additional jobs.

The industry also generates $15.5 billion in annual economic activity pays over $209 million in state taxes and provides $101 million in funding for public health and welfare programs.

The CERC report estimated that even a 10% decline in the state’s health insurance industry would lead to a loss of some 5000 jobs and $1.6 billion in economic output.

A decline of 25% to 50% would lead to a loss of 12000 to 24000 jobs and $4 billion to $8 billion in economic output.

He explained that while flu season generally peaks around February and is considered a winter disease cases of flu can already be diagnosed in the summer. Likewise the four most common coronaviruses known to infect humans are highly seasonal with most cases peaking in winter months.“We thought at first that COVID would be seasonal. It is very difficult to determine seasonality in the first year” Grotto said.He noted that if the COVID-19 virus would return each winter then the country would have to take some pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures ranging from a booster shot of the vaccine to wearing masks.Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla told CVS Health last week that it is a “likely scenario” that people will require an annual booster shot of the vaccine.Grotto explained that the need for a booster shot is based on whether or not the virus mutates meaning it changes in some way that would enable it to break through the immunity provided by the vaccine in its current form.He reiterated that the current vaccine is effective against the British variant and likely even effective enough against the South African and Brazilian mutations. But “could there be a new variant that will be able to overcome the vaccine? For sure that is a possibility and we have to take this into account” he said.ON FRIDAY the Health Ministry announced that seven cases of an Indian variant had been identified in the country. They were discovered through the ministry’s genetic sequencing protocol that screens all viral samples of people who test positive on their return from abroad.The people who caught the variant were unvaccinated. As such the ministry used the opportunity to reiterate the importance of all unvaccinated returnees to enter isolation.Speaking about the variant during an interview with N12 over the weekend coronavirus commissioner Prof. Nachman Ash said that “we do not know much about this mutation but there are some bad signs. We are comparing the findings in the genetic sequencing to what we know and it has a number of indications that it may be resistant to the vaccine.”He said that health officials believe the variant has the capacity to infect widely after seeing how hundreds of thousands of people were quickly infected in southern India where cases have surged to a record of more than 200000 a day for several days.The variant was classified last week as B.1.617.Additionally Grotto said it could be that the efficacy of the vaccine will wane and there will therefore be a need for a new vaccination campaign.If neither of these things happen – “if there is no significant variant and if lab tests will show the vaccine still offers protection against the virus – there will be no need for a third dose” he said.Will Israel have vaccines if necessary given the government’s delay in signing contracts to secure another more than 30 million doses from Pfizer?Grotto said he is not sure that Israel needs so many doses. He cautioned that while the argument over the vaccines has been played as a solely political one between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Alternate Prime Minister Benny Gantz “there is also some professional discussion. We are not sure we need to buy another two doses of the vaccine for the entire Israeli population. There are some who estimate that this amount is too high.”He added that if the US Food and Drug Administration offers approval for children between 12 and 15 to vaccinate then Israel should do the same. But he said that unlike the “paternalistic approach with adults – which was good – for children this is not necessary.“The vaccine should be available for children” Grotto continued “but maybe we should not even make the green passport something mandatory for children and certainly their returning to school should not be contingent on vaccination. The physician and the parents should decide.”The country’s infection rate has continued to decline in the past month with less than 100 people being diagnosed with coronavirus on Thursday the Health Ministry reported Friday. As such on Sunday classrooms will open in full and the public will no longer be required to wear masks when outdoors.Nonetheless Ash stressed in his interview with N12 that Israel has still not achieved herd immunity.“We are about five million vaccinated and another million recovering: It is not enough. We need to reach about 75% vaccinated or recovered” he said.“There is still a lot of work and a ways to go” Ash warned. “We have a lot of things to plan; to think ahead.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZnhydHYuY29tL25ld3MvcmVnaW9uYWwtbmV3cy92aXJnaW5pYS1uZXdzL3Zpcmdpbmlhcy11bmVtcGxveW1lbnQtcmF0ZS1jb250aW51ZXMtZGVjbGluZS1pbi1tYXJjaC1zdGF5cy1iZWxvdy1uYXRpb25hbC1hdmVyYWdlL9IBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZnhydHYuY29tL25ld3MvcmVnaW9uYWwtbmV3cy92aXJnaW5pYS1uZXdzL3Zpcmdpbmlhcy11bmVtcGxveW1lbnQtcmF0ZS1jb250aW51ZXMtZGVjbGluZS1pbi1tYXJjaC1zdGF5cy1iZWxvdy1uYXRpb25hbC1hdmVyYWdlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Virginia’s unemployment rate continues decline in March stays below national average,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wfxrtv.com/news/regional-news/virginia-news/virginias-unemployment-rate-continues-decline-in-march-stays-below-national-average/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZnhydHYuY29tL25ld3MvcmVnaW9uYWwtbmV3cy92aXJnaW5pYS1uZXdzL3Zpcmdpbmlhcy11bmVtcGxveW1lbnQtcmF0ZS1jb250aW51ZXMtZGVjbGluZS1pbi1tYXJjaC1zdGF5cy1iZWxvdy1uYXRpb25hbC1hdmVyYWdlL9IBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZnhydHYuY29tL25ld3MvcmVnaW9uYWwtbmV3cy92aXJnaW5pYS1uZXdzL3Zpcmdpbmlhcy11bmVtcGxveW1lbnQtcmF0ZS1jb250aW51ZXMtZGVjbGluZS1pbi1tYXJjaC1zdGF5cy1iZWxvdy1uYXRpb25hbC1hdmVyYWdlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The partnership provides New Holland customers with the opportunity to finance their new tractor in the same transaction as their Bush Hog Rhino or Schulte-branded attachment the company says.

“This partnership allows us to offer competitive packages to meet the demands of any farm ranch or property maintenance application” says Brett Davis vice president of New Holland Agriculture North America. “We’re pleased to provide this opportunity through our dealer locations throughout North America.”

Through this partnership New Holland says its dealers can expand their implement lineup and offer solutions for a variety of applications with complimentary New Holland tractors in one packaged deal.

(Port City Daily/Courtesy of Discovery Channel)

CAROLINA BEACH — Lisa Lowery was 45 when she decided to ditch her corporate job and follow a career of passion: distilling. Turns out it was a good call.

Last summer Lowery received a message from Discovery Channel’s “Moonshiners: Master Distiller” which wanted her to audition for the show.

“I’m not sure how they found me” Lowery wrote to Port City Daily Thursday “but it was probably via social media.”

Fast forward to 2021 — and getting cast ahead of 10000 other auditioners — and the episode “Gin Craze” is now streaming and pits Lowery against a chef from Utah and a water worker out of West Virginia. Lowery was able to meet her competitors ahead of the show and found out the spirit they would be creating over three rounds would be gin.

“Fortunately I have been making gin for a few years so I knew what I had to do” she explained.

Lowery said upon being cast she purchased a pot still from Portugal to begin running through recipes with various combinations of herbs spices fruits and other fragrant ingredients.

In the episode the distillers are tasked with three challenges: making dry London gin a modern gin and a signature recipe with competitors bringing their own ingredients in the last challenge.

The competition was filmed at Sugarlands Distilling in Gatlinburg Tennessee in the dog days of August last year. Lowery said they were competing in an un-air-conditioned metal facility in the middle of Covid-19.

“That alone was quite a challenge” she wrote. “But talk about instant family! Our filming days were long (and hot) but very satisfying.”

(It’s not lost on viewers that competitors in a modern-day pandemic are making a juice most well-known for an ingredient juniper that was put in plague doctor’s masks in the 1600s.)

The competitors start with a neutral base most kin to vodka to churn out gin in a 20-gallon still. Lowery explained she chose high juniper flavors and simple spices like coriander peppercorns orris root and ginger for the first challenge of making dry London gin.

The second a modern gin challenge had her mixing jalapeño muscadine grapes marigolds honey and botanicals.

One of the judges commented that Lowery’s gin “spread out like a damn bouquet.” They all praised her “floral work” in the distilling process which in round three consisted of lavender lemon balm ginger elderberry ginseng and botanicals.

In the show viewers see Lowery working through her Mason jars of herbs spices and seeds like an apothecarist. She tinkers with the distilling equipment and at one point in challenge number two decides mid-still she isn’t satisfied with the flavor. So Lowery pulls out the botanical bag to adjust its profile in effect flooring the competitors and judges alike.

The end result received high-praise for its complexity.

“It’s about tasting the product for the right cuts the smell of quality distillate the sound the still makes as it goes through each phase the sight of the proper distillate flow. It’s like working from the heart to bring a quality product to the table” Lowery described.

Home is where the ‘grappa’ is

It was in Lowery’s aunt and uncle’s home in Michigan when she was in her teens and 20s that her fondness for distilling began. She said the family loved making grappa — a grape-based Italian brandy.

“They were producing wine distilling grappa and brandies made from grapes they purchased from a little Italian man out of downtown Detroit” she remembered. “We spent many nights in that basement talking about and sampling their spirits.”

Lowery purchased her own 1-gallon pot still and practiced a few runs of brandy made of wine and fermented fruits. “I can’t say my first batches were good but I never gave up” she explained. “Typically you’d put it in a used barrel and let it age and mellow but I didn’t have barrels back then.”

She continued studying her hobby sponging up information from Michigan State University professor Kris Berglund as well as getting real-life experience. She worked at a brewery and experimental distillery in Michigan in the ‘90s.

Though Lowery’s passion for the craft was blossoming early in life she was sidetracked by a different career path when she accepted work for John Deere Sportswear in international sales. The move also brought her to the East Coast — specifically to her home in Carolina Beach.

She worked at John Deer for a decade before she decided to “retire” from the corporate world and take the leap into the distillate profession. “I decided to make a list of all the distilleries in NC to contact knowing one of them would hire me as an apprentice” Lowery explained.

She reached out to Michael Sinclair and Jonathan Blitz at Mystic Farm & Distillery in Durham who were accepting volunteers for their bottling crew. “So I signed up” Lowery noted. “[I] told them my goals and they told me to come back on Tuesday to work with them and see if I liked it. I did and stayed.”

For the last three years at Mystic Lowery finessed her knowledge and crafting experience for bourbon gin rum vodka and brandy. “This art is not something you can pull out of a box and start making quality spirits with” she said. She got first-hand lessons in distillery operations overall from the ins and outs of legalities to inventory control down to understanding how to maintain equipment.

“I also managed the front of the house and made it a viable retail operation” she said.

Her favorite spirits to make are bourbon and gin. She adores the versatility of gin — which Lowery called “high-proof (180-190) vodka” with added botanicals: “There are so many botanical combinations that you can use with gin all producing unique flavor profiles. It’s not the piney liquor from your grandpa’s liquor cabinet as gin is so much more refined these days.”

Yet bourbon also fascinates her to no end.

“You can make bourbon anywhere in the United States not just Kentucky” she informed “and I think our North Carolina terroir produces some of the finest tasting bourbon around. Currently I have about 300 bourbon barrels resting in the barrel house at Mystic in Durham.”

Yet over the last few months Lowery hasn’t been so active on the distillery floor. She has been doing administrative work for Mystic from her home on Carolina Beach since she found out she had breast cancer over the last year. After undergoing a double mastectomy in December Lowery said she is in the final stretch of healing from February’s reconstructive surgery

“So this is the last piece of recovery and kicking cancer’s ass” she said. “The unfortunate part is we’ve brought on new staff to do my distillery job so I’m a free agent so-to-say.”

As one of the few female distillers in the nation Lowery said she has used her recovery time to finalize a new business plan. She aims to open her own distillery and is eyeing a spot west of Charlotte — “unless an investor comes along and wants me to open a distillery here” she said.

“I hope to explore all the fruits and botanicals that North Carolina and the Appalachian area has to offer in the form of brandies and gins” Lowery said. “I believe there are so many untapped flavors that are to come out of native and heirloom plants and fruits . . . the best way to learn is to just jump in and do it.”

This summer American Airlines plans to use the 285-seat plane on several much shorter routes like Chicago to Orlando.

With many trips abroad still grounded in the pandemic American and Delta Air Lines are opting to put the some of their large jetliners to work on domestic routes or for shorter international trips.

It's one of the ways airlines are rethinking their service in the pandemic. The planes are meant to fly long range filling up with higher-paying passengers traveling abroad. If demand for international travel comes back as American expects this fall the airline would wind down the practice.

""It's like buying a Porsche to drive it to church on Sundays"" said Brian Znotins American's vice president of network planning.

Znotins said there is usually at least some domestic service using widebody jets on high-demand routes or to position aircraft in cities for long-haul flights but the carrier is ramping up domestic service with them.

Domestic leisure travel has largely recovered from a year ago airline executives say but international bookings and service are still depressed because of quarantine requirements closed attractions and outright entry bans such as the one on most non-citizens from much of Europe entering the U.S. and vice versa.

Fort Worth-based American this summer plans to fly some Boeing 777s its largest plane from its Miami hub to both Los Angeles and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. It will use 787s between on some flights between Philadelphia and Orlando and to Las Vegas from Philadelphia Chicago and Miami.

Delta is using Boeing 767s it would usually use for long-haul international flights on routes from Atlanta to Denver Las Vegas San Diego and its hub at Minneapolis-St. Paul. These planes and its Airbus A330 will serve Hawaii from Seattle Salt Lake City and Minneapolis-St. Paul but also shorter flights like the Twin Cities to Phoenix.

The idea is to ""fill up the biggest boat you can find with very low cost seats and hope that the fares come in"" said Robert Mann an industry analyst and former airline executive.

American is optimistic.

""Over Easter and spring break widebodies that we were operating did well on those days but then if you got a random Tuesday in the middle of April you're not really going to run very full anywhere in the system let alone on a widebody"" said Znotins. ""But as we move into Memorial Day and the summer just like a typical year all days of the week start to fill up and that's where we start to see the higher load factors.""

American's schedule so far shows it will operate a combined 3104 flights using twin-aisle planes on domestic routes in July and August up from 563 a year ago and 2846 during the same months of 2019 according to data from Ascend by Cirium an aviation consulting firm.

The airline has been among the most aggressive of the large carriers in capitalizing on the rebound in domestic leisure travel the bright spot in the travel as coronavirus cases have declined from their peak and vaccination rates rise and attractions like Disneyland reopen. American said Tuesday it expects to restore capacity to more than 90% of its domestic 2019 schedule this summer.

""American's current strategy seems to be to fly as much as they can and worry about yields later"" said Brett Snyder a former airline manager who runs an air travel assistance company Cranky Concierge and writes the Cranky Flier blog.

Single-aisle planes like those in the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families still account for the vast majority of flying in the U.S. including that of American. Its departures using single-aisle mainline jets will rise to a combined 189862 in July and August up from 92391 last year and 155084 in summer 2019 Cirium data show. At American Delta and United Airlines  these types of planes account for more than 70% of the scheduled domestic capacity this July and August similar to before the pandemic.

United normally flies more domestic trips using wide-body planes than other U.S. carriers but this year that flying has been hampered by the effective grounding of its Boeing 777 fleet with Pratt and Whitney 4000 engines pending inspections after a failure shortly after a Hawaii-bound flight took off from Denver in February.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZHMvYWlybGluZXMvdW5pdGVkLXF1ZXN0LXZzLWRlbHRhLXNreW1pbGVzLXBsYXRpbnVtLWFtZXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comparing the United Quest Card to the Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here.

For a long time there were primarily two classes of rewards credit cards: Those that cost $100 or less per year in annual fees and then ones that were $500 or more per year. Naturally the $500-plus per year premium cards came with many more perks than those that cost under $100. But there's a whole lot of runway between those two annual fee amounts.

Luckily for those looking for a different option in the sweet spot between the entry-level and premium tiers in recent years the space for credit cards with annual fees costing between $200 and $300 per year has started to fill out a bit. This included splashes such as the big American Express® Gold Card revamp in 2018 ($250 per year; see rates and fees) and the trend continues now with the very recent introduction of the New United Quest Card which comes with an annual fee of $250.

In the world of airline credit cards the most head-to-head competitor to the United Quest Card at this mid-tier level is likely the Delta SkyMiles® Platinum American Express Card which also comes with a $250-per-year price tag (see rates and fees). These two cards are issued by different banks and provide miles and perks valid at different airlines but they also share many similarities.

Let's see how these two cards stack up in a head-to-head competition.

Welcome bonus

Both of these mid-tier airline cards come with impressive welcome bonuses right now.

The new United Quest Card offers up to 100000 bonus miles with its introductory offer. This bonus is awarded in two parts: 80000 bonus United miles after $5000 in spending in the first three months and another 20000 miles after a total of $10000 in spending in the first six months. TPG values the full 100000-mile bonus at $1300.

The Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex is currently offering 90000 bonus miles after you spend $3000 on purchases in the first three months of account opening for a limited time (offer ends May 5 2021). TPG values these 90000 miles at $990.

Which is better?

While TPG values the full United Quest bonus at over $300 more than the Delta Platinum Amex bonus making it the winner in this category your particular valuations may vary based on how you usually use your miles. Here are some of our favorite ways to redeem 100000 United miles.

It's also worth highlighting that earning the full 100000-mile bonus with the United Quest card requires a total of $10000 in spending while the Delta Platinum Amex requires just $3000 in spending to earn the full bonus which may be an easier assignment for some. Here are some ideas on big-ticket everyday expenses you could shift to your card if you need help reaching that $10000 total within six months.

Winner: United Quest Card

Main benefits and features

The United Quest Card offers some interesting perks that aren't replicated by many other cards.

There's a $125 annual statement credit against United purchases each year which is pretty easy to value at $125 for United travelers. It also awards two 5000-mile bonuses — one for each time you redeem miles per cardmember anniversary year up to 10000 total miles in a year. Based on TPG valuations that's a potential $130 in value each year.

On top of those unique offerings the card also provides a free first and second checked bag for the cardholder and one other on the reservation along with priority boarding and a 25% statement credit toward inflight purchases on United. Having this card also makes the cardmember eligible for upgrades on award flights if they have United elite status.

The Delta Platinum Amex's marquee ongoing benefit is the anniversary companion ticket awarded each year you renew the card. This ticket is only valid in Main Cabin (economy) and the first ticket must be charged to your Delta card. There are also some fare class restrictions which make the benefit unavailable on certain dates and routes. On the positive side the benefit can be used even if the cardholder is not on the flight making it shareable with friends or family.

Both cards offer elite-like benefits such as a certain amount of included checked bags when flying that airline (and using the card to purchase the tickets) priority boarding and a 20%-25% rebate on eligible inflight spending on snacks drinks etc.

Which is better?

While there is the potential for greater value out of the annual Delta companion ticket than the United $125 statement credit and two 5000-mile award bonuses more strings are attached to its use. There is also a reasonable chance the companion ticket benefit could go wholly unused in a given year if there isn't a trip that lines up with availability or the need to bring along a traveling companion.

Given all that we're calling this one a draw as both cards have similar base-level perks and either set of unique perks could be more valuable in different scenarios.

Tie: United Quest and Delta Platinum Amex

Earning miles

The United Quest Card provides 3x miles on United purchases (immediately after earning $125 United purchase credit) 2x on other travel charges (including other airlines hotels car rentals etc.) 2x on dining and select streaming and 1x miles on other purchases.

The Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex has a similar 3-2-1 earning structure to the United Quest Card. In the case of the Delta mid-tier card you'll earn 3x miles on eligible purchases with Delta and hotels (made directly with the hotels) 2x miles at restaurants and U.S. supermarkets and 1x on other purchases.

Which is better?

While getting 3x miles for charges with their respective airlines isn't bad the truth is neither of these mid-tier airline cards is truly great when it comes to spending bonus categories.

That said keep in mind the different TPG valuations for the miles. For example earning 2x United miles per dollar is a 2.6% return on spending if you use TPG valuations while 2x Delta miles is just a 2.2% return given the lower valuation per mile.

However if you want to earn United miles you're really better served with the Chase Sapphire Reserve's 3x points awarded on dining and travel since you can transfer those Chase Ultimate Rewards points to United at a 1:1 ratio.

If it is Delta SkyMiles you seek you can earn 5x Membership Rewards points on airfare booked directly with the airlines via The Platinum Card® from American Express (up to $500000 on these purchases per calendar year) and/or 4x points per dollar spent at restaurants and U.S. supermarkets with the American Express Gold Card. You could then transfer those Amex Membership Rewards points at a 1:1 ratio to Delta SkyMiles.

In short neither is great when it comes to spending bonuses but both are respectable.

Tie: United Quest and Delta Platinum Amex

Elite benefits

The United Quest and Delta SkyMiles Platinum cards both make it easier to inch to the next elite status level with spending put on the cards. However both require a lot of spending to move the needle up the status chain very far.

The United Quest Card awards 500 Premier qualifying points for every $12000 charged to the card with a max of 3000 points with $72000 in annual spending.

For context in 2021 United will require 3000 PQPs and eight flight segments or 3500 PQPs and four flight credits for the entry-level Silver status tier. The next tier Gold would require 6000 PQPs and 16 flight segments or 7000 PQPs with four required flight segments on United or United Express. In other words assuming you had at least four segments on United-operated flights in the year you could charge your way to United Silver status with $72000 in spending on the card.

With the Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex you earn 10000 Medallion Qualification Miles after spending $25000 in a calendar year on the card. You can then unlock an additional 10000 MQMs after spending a total of $50000 in a calendar year.

Delta requires 25000 MQMs and $3000 Medallion Qualification Dollars (essentially dollars spent with the airline) for entry-level Silver status and 50000 MQMs and $6000 MQDs for Gold status. This means you normally could not spend your way to Silver status with Delta the way you could with United assuming you met the flight segment requirement.

With Delta if you don't meet the Medallion Qualification Dollar thresholds in a calendar year you can still qualify for Platinum Gold and Silver Medallion status if you have earned the required Medallion Qualification Miles or Medallion Qualification Segments and make at least $25000 in eligible purchases on your card that year. If you want top-tier Diamond status and didn't meet the MQD threshold you must make at least $250000 in eligible purchases on your card that year to unlock that status level.

Which is better?

The reality is these benefits are very similar though each program works a bit differently. Frankly I don't like how the benefit works on either card very much as I'd rather see it possible to make incremental progress with everyday spending than have to hit a five-figure amount of annual spending before you make any progress at all.

However I'm giving the edge to United because you can charge your way to enough PQDs for Silver status assuming you hit the flight segment requirements.

With Delta you can actually also do that this year with a 2021-only opportunity for an additional 2500 MQMs each time you spend $25000 in purchases on your Platinum Card up to two times but it's not a normal offering. If that becomes a permanent addition it could likely sway me to ranking Delta as the victor in this category.

Delta Platinum Amex

Which card should you get?

If you fly a couple of times per year with either of these airlines both are cards worth considering.

Personally I have the Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex primarily for the annual companion certificate but also so that I have some elite-like perks when it comes to waived bag fees and priority boarding. When combined with other limited-time offerings that come and go (such as the current $15 monthly statement credit at U.S. restaurants) I easily cover the $250 fee per year in value.

I also very much want the United Quest Card. The $125 annual statement credit on United purchases and two 5000-mile credits when you redeem miles each anniversary year are enticing to me as a regular United flyer. Trying the card out while it has a bonus of up to 100000 miles is likely going to be enough to get me to apply before that bonus ends.

Between the two cards which is best for you likely comes down to which airline you reliably fly at least a few times per year.

In the case of the Delta SkyMiles Platinum Card its best ongoing perk (the companion certificate) requires that you fly at least once a year with a companion on a paid ticket. If you don't fall into that category I'd skip this card in favor of one of the other Delta options such as the Delta SkyMiles® Gold American Express Card that comes with an introductory annual fee of $0 for the first year then $99 (see rates and fees).

With the United Quest Card while it may be worth trying out during the introductory 100000-mile bonus period regardless of your exact travel patterns on an ongoing basis this card will be best for those who fly on a mix of paid and United award flights every year. Otherwise the $95-per-year (waived the first year) United Explorer Card may be a better match for less frequent United flyers.

It's entirely possible that both the United Quest and Delta SkyMiles Platinum cards deserve a spot in your wallet — I hope to end up with both of them in mine.

Bottom line

It's fun to rank two similar competitors against each other and see where one shines the brightest.

The United Quest card currently has the stronger introductory welcome bonus better built-in travel protections and a slight edge when it comes to elite status earnings.

However the Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex is the heavyweight champion if you travel on paid domestic flights with a companion if you want ongoing cellphone protection or if you want to check bags for more than two people on your reservation. Personally speaking I'm about to move my own cellphone bill over there to help offset the cost of future unfortunate drops.

These mid-tier cards both make compelling cases to join your credit card lineup. If you only want to choose one the best one for you will likely be the one that aligns with the airline you fly most consistently.

The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 gave U.S. air carriers almost total freedom to decide which domestic markets they would serve and how much they would charge for that service.

To ensure that small towns and rural areas that had received air service before deregulation would continue to receive service Congress added section 419 to the Federal Aviation Act which created the EAS program. The program provides subsidies to airlines to continue service to these areas.

The EAS program is administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation which determines:

The minimum level of service required by each community

The hub airport(s) to which flights will come and go

The minimum number of round trip flights per day

The size of the aircraft and the number of available seats.

Currently 60 communities in Alaska and 115 communities in the lower 48 contiguous states are being served by the EAS program. The program is financed by fees paid by foreign aircraft that fly over the U.S. but don’t land and through excise taxes on passengers fuel and cargo.

In 2000 the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act prohibited DOT from providing essential air service subsidies to communities in the lower 48 states that are fewer than 70 miles (112 km) from the nearest large or medium hub airport or that require a rate of subsidy per passenger in excess of $200 unless those communities are located more than 210 miles (338 km) from the nearest medium or large-sized hub airport. Communities can however petition for a waiver of the $200 cap.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRocmlsbGlzdC5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb24vY2hlYXAtZmxpZ2h0cy1pY2VsYW5kLWFwcmlsLTIwMjHSAU5odHRwczovL3d3dy50aHJpbGxpc3QuY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvbmV3cy9uYXRpb24vY2hlYXAtZmxpZ2h0cy1pY2VsYW5kLWFwcmlsLTIwMjE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Round-Trip Flights to Iceland for the Fall Can Be Found as Cheap as $333,"We know COVID-19 is continuing to impact your travel plans. As of April 2021 official guidance from the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention states that fully vaccinated people can travel at low risk though safety precautions are still required. Should you need to travel be sure to familiarize yourself with the CDC's latest guidance as well as local requirements/protocols/restrictions for both your destination and home city upon your return. Be safe out there.

The CDC has stated that fully vaccinated individuals can travel safely inside the US even if it has stopped short of recommending that you travel. But maybe you're looking ahead and thinking about a fall trip. Iceland might be on your mind because it's one of the few countries that has already opened its borders to fully vaccinated tourists from the US.

If that's your situation there are reasonable prices on flights to Reykjavik for the fall out of the few US cities that are ready to fly to Iceland. Between Delta and United you'll find round-trip flights to the Icelandic capital for as little as $333. Delta announced in March that it will resume service to Iceland from New York City Boston and Minneapolis/St. Paul in May."

Leading stock indexes continued their winning streak with S&P 500 maintaining the uptrend for the fourth week in a row and hitting a new high.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 34000-mark for the first time adding around 150 points in the last session. The sentiment was buoyed by encouraging retail sales data and reports of jobless claims falling.

The first-quarter earnings season got off to a good start with banking giants JPMorgan Chase Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs unveiling their latest financial data mid-week. They were joined by software firm Infosys on Wednesday.

The spotlight stayed on financial services Thursday also when the closely followed reports of Citigroup and Bank of America came out. Delta Air Lines and soft-drink behemoth PepsiCo released earnings on the same day. The first phase of bank earnings concluded on Friday with Morgan Stanley’s blockbuster Q1 report.

It’s going to be mixed bag next week. For instance the companies scheduled to report on April 19 include United Airlines Holdings IBM and Coca-Cola. The important corporate houses preparing to report on April 20 comprise Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson as well as streaming giant Netflix which has been thriving on the COVID-driven boom. The earning reports of superbike company Harley-Davidson and Lockheed Martin are also slated for Tuesday.

The other major companies that can elicit investor interest include Halliburton Verizon Communications Chipotle Mexican Grill and Kinder Morgan – the companies will report earnings on April 21. The next day it is the turn of American Airlines and Southwest Airlines as well as tech firms AT&T and Intel. American Express is probably the only big player to report on April 23.

The market was abuzz with the news of Microsoft’s $20-billion buyout of cloud software company Nuance Communications. In another important deal in the cloud space Datadog completed the acquisition of the SaaS-based security platform Sqreen.

The otherwise quiet M&A market witnessed Dell Technologies becoming two standalone public companies by spinning off its 81% ownership in VMware. The other major deals include Amgen’s $2-billion purchase of Five Prime Therapeutics and the acquisition of Upchain by software firm Autodesk.

But it wasn’t a party they were attending. The legendary club in the heart of the city had been chosen by Bottega Veneta creative director Daniel Lee as the locale for their new runway show titled Salon 02. It was the second iteration of a new concept that had begun in London in October an attempt to inject some mystery into fashion via secret super-exclusive shows that show off collections that aren’t unveiled publicly until months later.

In theory it was a perfect pairing: a nightclub renowned for its secrecy exclusivity and hedonism hosting a fashion show for one of the world’s biggest brands three months after Lee made headlines for deleting the label’s social media accounts. The only proof that anything had happened — at least at first — were the paparazzi photos of the guests invited to the event walking outside of the venue. While the actual show took place in the Halle am Berghain a massive hall that can be rented out to brands the secrecy of the entire production cloaked this detail in the clout of staging a show at one of the world’s most famous nightclubs.

In attendance were Berlin-based artists — including DJ Honey Dijon Random Identities designer Stefano Pilati and 032c’s Marc Goehring Maria Koch and Joerg Koch — but also an international crowd. Rappers Skepta Slowthai Burna Boy and Tricky joined designer Virgil Abloh and Italian dancer Roberto Bolle. Insulated by the thick concrete walls the guests filed into the Halle am Berghain and were filmed for a new video that Bottega will use to officially unveil the collection in June. As with any good fashion event it also included an after-party that evening at Soho House Berlin the exclusive members-only club in the neighboring Mitte district.

In normal times it would’ve become a legendary anecdote in Berlin’s history of inspiring the fashion world; but these are not normal times. For over a year Berlin’s nightlife scene has been ravaged by the pandemic and since November the city has been under some form of lockdown. While the show involved a corona-compliant hygiene concept that included PCR and rapid tests sources who worked on the production spoke of worrying behavior by Lee in the lead-up to the event. According to sources I spoke with as well as an account by a freelancer shared by Disruptive Berlin founder Brenda Weischer on her Instagram not only did Lee not wear a mask from the start Veneta’s head of heritage Daisy Butler also went without a mask while on set. According to a source on set after the owner of Berghain refused to open the dancefloor to Lee the photographer for the event Tyrone Lebon was reportedly forced to stage a fake rave scene of models without masks on. While this reportedly happened at the upper level of the production all freelancers including craftsmen and cleaners wore masks and were tested every day which is a stark reminder of the power divide between those in power and those on the payroll.

The instances of flouting Covid regulations weren’t just happening at Berghain either. According to anonymous reports from Soho House staff members shared by Weischer on Instagram hygiene concepts were entirely disregarded for guests as staff feared for their health. For weeks prior to the event staff weren't offered Covid tests and it was “only on the last Friday [two] days before everyone was leaving” that tests were administered. While the staff was forced to work for minimum wage and not given bonuses or tips there were “no rules whatsoever” for guests and according to an estimate from a staff member Soho House was paid over €700000 to rent out the venue. On Friday as the Berghain show finished a sound system was set up at Soho House and as the sun went down a party began that inevitably leaked to social media.

As all Covid regulations were left at the door the models and guests from the show partied through the night to DJ sets by Virgil Abloh Burna Boy and others. By the end of the weekend the scandal had spread from @berlinclubmemes all the way to fashion watchdog @dietprada helped by a steady stream of anonymous reports from sources at both the Berghain and Soho House events. By Monday a dedicated account @bottegno had appeared to chronicle it police had begun an investigation and the Soho House manager had explained he was in Mykonos and had no idea what happened. Publications have jumped on the story but in the absence of a detailed statement explaining what happened from those in power the blame has begun to shift with one newspaper alluding that it was the invitees at fault.

This lack of clarity from the upper management of Soho House Bottega Veneta and Berghain has created a vacuum of responsibility. It reduces the entire incident as a case of wealthy elites playing by a different set of rules than normal people. Simplifying the situation down to this narrative isn’t just a grave disservice to those who have been thrown under the bus it also removes what happened from a critique that is long overdue: Elitist institutions like Berghain have been commodifying the city’s culture into clout for years.

The nightclub helped to literally set the stage for Bottega Veneta’s show because they have cultural capital and international acclaim. They are the Amazon warehouse of Berlin nightclubs; an elite institution profiting off of a culture that their existence perpetually threatens. It was only seven months ago on September 9 that Berghain reopened its doors for a massive art exhibition called ""Studio Berlin."" The sprawling show featured work from 118 artists and came about via a group text with Christian Boros the millionaire art collector and owner of the Boros Collection art gallery and Klaus Lederer Berlin’s culture senator. The exhibition was given €250000 by the government charged between €18 and €20 per ticket and gave each artist a one-time payment of €150 and the “platform to present their work.” The outrageously low sum prompted a spokesperson from the city’s professional association of visual artists the bbk berlin to speak out: “It is extremely problematic to pay artists such low fees in an exhibition with so much funding and of such large scale.”

It was especially egregious given Berghain’s historically close ties with the Berlin government and financial stability. The owners of the club Michael Teufele and Norbert Thormann have owned the building outright for years and in 2016 successfully argued in court to have their tax rate lowered from 19 percent to 7 percent on the basis that Berghain is a “high art” institution. During the pandemic their employees were put on Kurzarbeit (short-term work leave) further lowering their overhead costs. As Berghain hosted a massive art exhibition while paying artists peanuts a constellation of smaller party collectives around Berlin struggled to raise money to stay alive as the clubs that hosted them shut their doors. The result was Berlin Collective Action a nightlife emergency fund designed to provide nightlife workers impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic with financial aid.

The narrative of smaller clubs and nightlife spaces struggling to survive in the shadow of Berghain isn’t just a pandemic-era problem. In conversations with over a half dozen party organizers DJs and club owners the consensus was that Berghain has long ceased being supportive of the clubs promoters and parties that exist in its shadow. Instead the club has become infamous for its exclusionary policies financial dominance and the steady stream of racist misogynistic homophobic and transphobic incidents that have happened there. “They've made it clear particularly in the past five or so years that they have little to no interest in the queer community queer politics or Berlin's club scene at large because they have been an exception for so long” explains former nightlife promoter and DJ Eliot Gardepe. “In a way it's become a brutalist Ibiza for the jet-setting class of rich white gays celebrities and clout chasers.” In the past five years several clubs have either shut down or been threatened with closure including about blank and Salon zur Wilden Renate two venues that regularly hosted queer nightlife parties and may close because of an expansion of a highway.

While Berghain has marketed itself as a queer space and profited off of this false reputation the venue has a history of brutal physical assaults and intimidation carried out by both their security team and staff. For Nico Limo a nonbinary nightlife organizer whose Berghain assault prompted a New York Times report the club’s ability to use queerness to make bank while also causing trauma to members of the queer nightlife community: “We queer nightlife organizers want to create a safe and healthy party ecosystem and I see Berghain as this thorn preying on our nightlife.”

With nightlife now shut down for over a year and lockdown measures restricting daily life seeing Berghain willingly open their doors to a fashion label that has no ties to Berlin nightlife has stung especially hard. “We have no idea what the scene will look like or how many clubs will even survive” says a DJ who wishes to remain anonymous. “There’s no excuse for them to be the ones doing crazy things to try and make some money when they’re getting substantial government funding. Berghain had to some extent contributed before the pandemic to clubs closing and clubs not being able to succeed. Whatever is happening right now for me is parallel to this practice of centralizing and commercializing a feeling of rave and liberation into something that you can consume and buy.”

Strip away all of the branding and reputation they’ve amassed and Berghain is simply a business and this past weekend their customer was Bottega Veneta. As Instagram meme account @berlinclubmemes explains over DM: “People who usually relate to nightlife as a safe space and also a space to generate income outside of the usual societal norms are hit the hardest by all this while fashion brands use parties and nightlife as cheap gimmicks and cater to a select rich few creating the illusion of inclusiveness by tokenizing and selling out LGBTQ culture.” While some venue bookers in the city vow to continue “calling out people who forget that techno and rave are political and try to turn it into McDonald’s for the soul” there’s only so much to be done when the city’s largest club shows no signs of supporting small clubs that can’t get €250000 from a group chat with the government. For Gardepe the situation we’re witnessing with Bottega Veneta this week “exemplifies the exclusionary anti-queer commodification of nightlife in service of luxury capitalism and the wealthy.” When (or if) the pandemic ends what will Berlin’s famed club scene look like if the only way to survive is through attracting art collectors and fashion brands? It certainly won’t be the queer haven it once was.

As the news cycle on what happened when Bottega Veneta came to town shifts to Soho House Berlin it’s worth remembering that this incident isn’t isolated. It’s the direct result of the commodification of a cultural scene on the brink of collapse — assuming it hasn’t been buried by the pandemic already. What happened this past weekend will continue to happen when we continue to allow our city’s cultural capital to be poured into a club as elitist as the brand it allowed through its doors.",,,,,,

LaToya Renee Carpenter 39 was killed in Saturday's shooting according to 50-year-old Perez Williams who identified himself to The Dispatch at the scene as the victim's fiancé.

Carpenter was fatally struck by a stray bullet while driving a vehicle in the parking lot outside the Dollar General in the Refugee Center shopping plaza on Chatterton Road near Noe-Bixby Road in Truro Township.

""I don't know what to do. I can't believe it. It's just unbelievable"" Williams told The Dispatch after talking with investigators.

Columbus police Lt. Dan Hargus confirmed one person was pronounced dead at 7:50 p.m. and five others were injured in the shooting. One of the wounded was taken to Nationwide Children's Hospital two to Mount Carmel East hospital and one to OhioHealth Pickerington.

All five injured were in stable condition Hargus said.

What we know about the shooting at Dollar General on Chatterton Road

No information on the deceased or the other five was immediately available Saturday night from the Franklin County Sheriff's investigators at the scene. Police from Columbus Groveport and Madison Township responded to assist along with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation.

Investigators have also not released any information about a suspect.

Jacqueline Bailey 67 who resides in the Cross Key Apartments across Chatterton Road from the shopping plaza told The Dispatch that she was looking out her kitchen window as a group of people were holding a memorial vigil around 8 p.m. in the shopping plaza parking lot close to Chatterton Road.

The gathering was apparently held to mark the one-year anniversary of the April 17 2020 shooting death of 28-year-old Jarrin Hickman of the Southeast Side in what authorities said was a drug deal gone bad.

A large bunch of red white and silver balloons were attached to a utility pole outside the Refugee Center shopping plaza along the side of Chatterton Road.

Bailey said someone in an SUV traveling westbound on Chatterton Road suddenly opened fire on the group gathered for the memorial vigil and drove off.

Carpenter had a short time earlier left the Cross Key Apartments where she and Williams resided and drove across the road to pick up some candy and potato chips at Dollar General Williams told The Dispatch. She was then going to drive and pick up her 11-year-old daughter from Carpenter's sister's home down the road he said.

Carpenter was in the parking lot when she was apparently struck by a stray bullet and killed Williams said.

The vehicle was in drive and crashed into another vehicle in the parking lot after the driver was shot Bailey and another witness at a nearby restaurant said.

One of the wounded people went into the Dollar General store at 5001 Chatterton Road which is where police were originally called to respond to the shooting.

A worker at My Big Fat Gyros restaurant located next door to the Dollar General store told The Dispatch that they heard gunfire and ducked behind the counter. When they looked out afterwards he said there was one person down in the parking lot outside the Dollar General and another person who appeared to have sustained a wound to the foot.

The worker who did not wish to be identified did not see any of the other people injured but said he saw a vehicle in the parking lot crash into another vehicle.

Cones marking bullet casings were placed in the westbound lanes of Chatterton Road across the parking lot from the Dollar General and the neighboring Abe's Banquet Hall.

Deputies closed Chatterton Road between Noe-Bixby Road and Falcon Bridge Drive for several hours during the investigation.

A shooting death occurred at the same shopping plaza one year earlier

On April 17 2020 Franklin County deputy sheriffs responded at about 6:30 p.m. to a report of a shooting in the Refugee Center shopping plaza parking lot. According to court records the shootings occurred after a drug deal involving marijuana went bad.

Court records and Franklin County Chief Deputy Rick Minerd said 20-year-old Varmunyah Dunor of the Near East Side and his friend Quincy Yelder 19 were involved in a marijuana transaction with 28-year-old Jarrin Hickman of the Southeast Side in Dunor’s vehicle.

Yelder who was negotiating to purchase marijuana from Hickman and Dunor shot Hickman. Hickman then shot Yelder in the head court records state.

“Hickman got out of (Dunor’s car) and tried to run away” court records state. ”(Dunor) grabbed (Yelder’s) gun and exited his vehicle and went towards Hickman.”

Court records said that Dunor fired at Hickman several times and struck him. Hickman was pronounced dead at the scene Minerd said.

Dunor later admitted to his actions court records said and surveillance video captured the incident.

Dunor fled in his vehicle with Yelder inside critically wounded.

Witnesses provided deputies with a vehicle description and a partial license-plate number that was aired over police radio for law enforcement Minerd said.

Columbus police spotted the vehicle and when it did not stop followed it to Mount Carmel East hospital where Yelder was rushed into surgery.

Dunor was arrested on a charge of murder according to court records.

The sheriff's office said a small group of people gathered outside the Dollar General located at 5001 Chatterton Road Saturday evening to commemorate the death of Jarrin Hickman.

Authorities say Hickman was murdered at that location one year ago.

According to the press release a dark-colored SUV possibly a Dodge Durango was driven by the location and an unknown person began firing gunshots into the crowd from the vehicle.

Five people were hit including a 12-year-old. The victims were taken to a nearby hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

The sheriff's office said a small group of people gathered at a Dollar General located at 5001 Chatterton Road to commemorate the death of Jarrin Hickman who had been killed there one year earlier.

At 7:30 p.m. a dark-colored SUV possibly a Dodge Durango drove by the location and someone inside the vehicle began firing gunshots into the crowd according to the press release.

Five people including a 12-year-old child were taken to area hospitals to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries.

Authorities say LaToya Carpenter was traveling eastbound on Chatterton Road passing the Dollar General store as the shooting started. She was struck in the head and her vehicle hit a parked car. LaToya was pronounced dead at the scene.

The sheriff's office is still searching for a suspect.

The seven week long program “Girl Power—Intro to Green Energy” was put together by a nonprofit group called Pink Space Theory with the support of a $7500 grant from Dominion Energy.

“What I love about this program is that it gives students an opportunity to do real hands-on engineering learning” said Monica Nichols founder and President of Pink Space Theory a nonprofit created to help close the STEM gender and race equality gap.



The school identified students from underserved and minority communities that had not previously expressed interest in Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) subjects or careers for the program.

For many West Virginians it was welcome news. As the COVID-19 pandemic raged tens of thousands of residents had lost their jobs. And even before the expensive winter months arrived so many people were financially struggling that more than 130000 West Virginians were eligible for pandemic-related state assistance because they had missed a utility payment.

But the price drop Lane promised turned out to be brief. In fact by January a majority of customers’ bills in the state had gone up. While gas prices had declined as Lane predicted a utility surcharge on every monthly bill had increased wiping out the savings.

The fee was the direct result of legislation that Lane had pressed for five years earlier as a lobbyist for the natural gas industry — something she did not mention in her column.

In 2015 Lane — working on behalf of the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas Association an industry trade group — pitched the surcharge as necessary to pay for the repair of thousands of miles of decaying and damaged pipelines which represented a growing threat to the environment and nearby residents. Since then the law known as Senate Bill 390 has enabled an infrastructure bonanza for utility companies with few consumer protections.

The new measure allowed industry to charge customers up front for planned work and overwhelmed regulators tasked with keeping utility spending in check. Through that authorization the industry has spent at least $240 million on pipeline projects since 2016. Total capital spending by the state’s two largest natural gas utilities Mountaineer and Dominion Energy more than doubled in the first three years of the program’s existence.

And Lane’s predictions notwithstanding consumers are paying more and more for companies’ infrastructure efforts. Dominion customers for instance have seen the costs from the infrastructure fee nearly double in the last two years alone even as their overall average bill has dropped. The surcharge now amounts to nearly $100 a year for a typical customer according to an analysis by Mountain State Spotlight and ProPublica. (The calculation was confirmed by the PSC.) And the fee is poised to rise even higher. According to the two companies’ projections they will spend at least an additional $500 million by 2025 — which will be passed on to ratepayers.

Regulators however say they can’t keep up with the proposals they’re being asked to vet and in some instances they have approved costly expansion projects that some other states have barred. In one case the Public Service Commission greenlighted a surcharge for a new pipeline to provide gas to an insulation plant in West Virginia’s eastern panhandle — something the private company would typically pay for.

That leaves consumers on the hook a particular hardship in this pandemic year. Ellen Allen executive director of Covenant House which helps vulnerable families in Charleston said the economic downturn has greatly increased the number of people coming to her organization for help paying for utilities as well as the amount of money those individuals needed.

“We’re seeing people ask for help who never had to ask for help before” Allen said. “Certainly it would have been preferable to have lower rates.”

In an interview Lane said she had neglected to consider the surcharge when she penned her column. “I apologize for that” she said. “That was my mistake.” Nevertheless she called the program a “fabulous success” citing the construction spending it has spurred.

In response to a list of questions from Mountain State Spotlight and ProPublica Dominion said in a statement that its investment would “enhance pipeline safety and reliability” reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately provide “beneficial impacts to local economies.”

But critics say the system that Lane lobbied for in 2015 lacks important consumer protections leaving ratepayers vulnerable to escalating fees. “We’ll live with it” said Tom White a lawyer at the PSC’s consumer advocate division whose job it is to keep rates low. “But we hate it.”

A New Way of Doing Business

When it comes to the utility rate that consumers pay the price is typically split between covering the wholesale cost of gas and the cost of getting that gas to homes.

It’s that latter portion that regulators and utility executives argue over for good reason. If it’s too low utilities are forced to cut back on maintenance or go out of business entirely. But if it’s too high utilities which are natural monopolies earn excessive profit on the backs of customers. It is the job of regulators like the Public Service Commission to find a balance that protects consumers while making sure utilities stay afloat.

These battles can take around a year and traditionally they don’t happen often. In the decade before SB 390 passed Mountaineer had come to the commission three times asking to adjust its rates in West Virginia; Dominion had done the same twice.

This process frustrated the utilities who prefer to recoup the money they spend on investments — and get the increased return they are guaranteed for additional capital outlays — as quickly as possible. Utilities were required to hand over reams of documents detailing their businesses to the Public Service Commission where teams of lawyers engineers economists and accountants would comb through the data and together with the utility agree on how much of the burden should be borne by customers.

So when federal regulators warned that new infrastructure investment was necessary to fix failing pipelines the companies saw an opportunity to push for a system that would get them more cash faster.

The new law would also help with the utilities’ paperwork problem: Under SB 390 the utilities would hand over a list of projects and some documentation but the PSC would only have a matter of months to review them. Once the projects were approved the utilities could add a surcharge immediately and get paid before work even begins.

The whole process encourages utilities to spend on projects and the preapproval by the commission relieves the companies of risk and puts it squarely on ratepayers.

Across the country states have adopted “accelerated replacement programs” that have allowed utilities to pass their costs on to customers faster often through annual surcharges and without some of the protections built into the regulatory negotiation process. By 2015 these programs had been implemented using various techniques in 38 states.

Although necessary to encourage utilities to replace their decaying infrastructure these programs are “ripe for abuse” explained David Springe who was a utility consumer advocate in Kansas for over a decade and now leads the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates.

Typically utilities are guaranteed a rate of return on all capital investments meaning the more they build the more they make. Without the careful oversight of regulators Springe said companies are encouraged to spend as much money on capital expenses as possible to increase that return. The practice is known as “gold plating.”

“If you create that incentive and if it’s not specific and direct and well-managed then it just becomes the business plan” Springe said.

This was the challenge facing West Virginia policymakers and utility executives in 2015 as they worked out the details of the law that would become SB 390.

The utilities had a powerful ally in Charlotte Lane. At the time she was a registered lobbyist for the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas Association and her connections to state government ran deep. During the 1980s and 1990s she served two terms as a delegate in the state legislature and two stints as a commissioner on the PSC including four years as head of the commission. In 2003 then-President George W. Bush appointed Lane to the United States International Trade Commission where she served until 2011 before returning to Charleston and becoming a lobbyist. (Lane later served a third term as a delegate from 2017 to 2018.)

In emails reviewed by Mountain State Spotlight and ProPublica Lane was the go-between for Dominion executive Jo Carol Farmer and David Ellis a top official at the Public Service Commission as the parties drafted the legislation. Although significantly smaller in West Virginia than Mountaineer at the time Dominion had a much larger national footprint and continues to play a bigger role in state politics.

Ellis’ suggestions including adding a month to the amount of time regulators had for reviewing project proposals were largely incorporated into the final bill. He appeared to sign off on the idea on behalf of the commission. The goal and intent of the legislation — “expedited cost recovery” — “appears to be reasonable” he wrote to Lane.

Lane then took her case to lawmakers. She wrote a summary of the legislation which was named the “Infrastructure Expansion Development Improvement and Job Creation Act” and extolled its benefits. The bill “will create jobs” she explained by motivating utilities to spend more not only on replacing their aging pipelines but also on extending service to underserved areas.

But her summary glossed over a key consequence of the legislation. The last of nine bullet points simply said that if the bill was passed customers would experience “gradual rate adjustments.” In other words West Virginians would start paying more for their gas.

The legislation passed easily unanimously in the Senate and with an overwhelming majority in the House. Then-Delegate Don Perdue a Democrat from Wayne County was one of only five House members who voted against the bill. He recalled that he was concerned by efforts to streamline the regulatory process for utilities. “If you have an industry that has this much influence and this much impact they should be scrutinized at a higher level” Perdue said.

Then-Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin signed it into law.

A “Blank Check” for Infrastructure Spending

Almost immediately after the legislation went into effect each of the state’s largest gas utilities began filing requests with the Public Service Commission to hike customers’ rates by adding new infrastructure surcharges to bills.

Tom White the consumer advocate pushed back. Unlike some of the similar laws passed across the country SB 390 gave utilities wide latitude to include almost any new infrastructure project and provided regulators with little guidance on how to police the program. In Kansas a law prevented utilities from using that state’s program to build pipelines to new customers. Massachusetts capped spending in its program at a percentage of the utility’s revenues.

West Virginia did neither. Its law simply said that projects should be “just reasonable not contrary to the public interest.” Over the years since it passed regulators have struggled with making those determinations. In one case they rejected millions of dollars in spending on new lines to expand service which are typically paid for by new customers not built into rates paid by everyone. But in another they approved such a proposal.

In the latter case Mountaineer included in its infrastructure plans the construction of a pipeline to provide gas to a new Jefferson County insulation plant. Local residents opposed to the facility packed a PSC public hearing. Commissioners approved the project though citing the Legislature’s intent to help the state economy by “improving the availability of natural gas services.” It was the type of situation that states like Kansas had banned.

From the outset of West Virginia’s program White petitioned commissioners to formalize its rules cautioning that more details were needed to “head off confusion in applying this new law.”

The commissioners rejected White’s petition on advice of their regulatory staff who felt that taking the time to draw up clearer rules would undercut the legislation’s underlying goal: getting new pipe in the ground as fast as possible.

Tensions simmered. Each year utilities came forward with a request for the next year’s spending and the commission approved an associated rate hike after some negotiation. Regulators however complained they simply didn’t have the time or personnel to delve deeply into the plans. By 2018 commission staff had had enough. After approving that year’s request from Mountaineer regulators faced a similar request from Dominion for 145 separate projects — and a projected 22% increase in customer rates. This time staffers objected.

During a hearing before the three voting commissioners lawyers for the PSC and its consumer advocate division grilled Dominion executives on their spending of the prior year’s surcharge revenues and the necessity of newly proposed projects.

When the state’s chief consumer advocate asked for evidence that the three-year-old program was actually reducing pipeline leaks Dominion said that it was not keeping track.

Moreover the company was proposing new projects before it had finished ones that had previously been approved leaving PSC staff attorney Linda Bouvette to wonder if the work was really as urgent as the company had argued.

She cited two pipeline replacement projects together just over a half-mile long that Dominion had included in its most recent proposal. Despite the company having put them in a separate request three years earlier they remained unfinished she noted.

Bouvette also flagged other aspects of Dominion’s request. In the previous year the company then known as Dominion Hope had spent more than $7 million on projects that had never been preapproved by the commission — and passed on the costs to current and future ratepayers anyway.

“There is no rhyme or reason to Hope’s PREP program” Bouvette wrote in a brief outlining her concerns referring to the Pipeline Replacement and Expansion Program that the company established under SB 390.

In response Dominion denied any wrongdoing saying that in some cases unforeseen events might require the company to reprioritize PREP projects.

But Bouvette wasn't just frustrated with Dominion. She was frustrated with the law and said the three-month time frame provided to review utility projects resulted in “very little oversight” of these proposals.

“There is simply not enough staff at the Commission to look at every single project being proposed in the very short time period provided by statute” she added.

The commission chair Mike Albert echoed Bouvette’s concerns during the hearing. “I don’t want to call it a blank check but it’s a lot of spending on capital projects that may or may not be necessary” he said.

In response Dominion’s Jo Carol Farmer argued that it was the commission’s responsibility not Dominion’s to determine whether the proposed projects were reasonable. When pressed by Albert on whether all the new projects were truly necessary Farmer responded: “I think Senate Bill 390 said that it is necessary.”

The commission eventually approved Dominion’s rate hike for 2019 after the company promised to open its books the next year to a full regulatory review giving regulators transparency into how all of the money was being spent. It will finish later this year and will be the commission’s first full review of Dominion’s books in over a decade — and over five years after the surcharge was first introduced. Mountaineer agreed to do the same.

Rising Costs for Consumers

All of this has taken place mostly behind the scenes in legal filings before the PSC or in rarely noticed commission hearings. When gas customers get their monthly bills they don’t see a line item for the surcharge set up by SB 390.

But in January 2019 with just about six months left in his term as PSC chair Albert cautioned lawmakers that the law was handcuffing the commission’s ability to review projects.

“We’re now getting requests almost to include a line item under which they can include any construction they want” Albert told members of the Senate Finance Committee. Albert also warned lawmakers that water and electric companies would seek similar legislation.

At the same hearing Albert a former utility company lawyer himself did acknowledge that the PSC served not only the public but industry as well. “Most people don’t understand but the statute charges us with responsibility for the care and feeding if you will of the utilities” he told the group.

Still staff at the commission continued to press for “some measure of protection” for ratepayers. The utilities wanted to keep the current system largely unchanged. The two sides came to a compromise in 2019. The commission instituted a cap on the program: Each year a utility could spend up to 9% of the total value of its existing infrastructure.

Because any new investment is added back to the total the cap rises growing bigger and bigger each year.

The commission wrote that the compromise balanced the need to provide utilities with more capital against the regulator's responsibility to ensure customer rates were reasonable.

But over the years the infrastructure surcharge exploded. It now makes up nearly 14% of a typical Dominion customer’s pretax gas bill according to the analysis by Mountain State Spotlight and ProPublica.

Meanwhile rates are almost certain to increase further in part because Dominion has found a way around the spending cap. Under the terms of the compromise hammered out with regulators expenditures over the 9% limit are allowable if justified by an external study. So Dominion contracted Black & Veatch an engineering consultancy to write a report. The firm recommended accelerating the company’s plans by replacing pipelines within 24 years twice as fast as Dominion had previously projected. Dominion has not yet exceeded the cap but has told regulators it may in the future.

Mountaineer is now following suit by promising to accelerate its own replacement timeline.

Regulators Are “Completely Outgunned”

In June 2019 with Albert’s term atop the Public Service Commission expiring Gov. Jim Justice filled the vacancy by appointing Lane the lobbyist who had helped write the infrastructure legislation.

In an interview Lane defended her role as chief regulator of an industry with which she has close ties. “I have a really good understanding of the issues both from the utility standpoint and from the public standpoint” she said. “I can be fair and balance all of the interests.”

But the small group of a half-dozen or so lawyers analysts and administrators in the commission’s Consumer Advocate Division tasked with fighting the steady drumbeat of rate hikes have limited resources. Until 2019 they made do with barely over $1 million a year.

The state formed CAD in the early 1980s to look out for the interests of residential customers who don’t have the time or money to hire lawyers to lobby the commission as do the utility companies and their large industrial customers.

But CAD like the customers it represents remains an underdog at the commission. CAD’s chief in 2019 Jackie Roberts told legislators at the time that her section was “very challenged” and noted that her budget hadn’t changed in recent memory. When she transferred to another department at the PSC in late 2020 she called the consumer office “completely outgunned” in an interview published in the Charleston Gazette-Mail.

“The CAD is concerned with the level of new rate increases and the affordability of rates” Roberts wrote in her final annual report for the office released earlier this year.

Roberts’ replacement Robert Williams echoed the sentiment of his predecessor in a statement for this story. Despite a recent budget increase up to $1.3 million per year Williams called the task of reviewing the proposed projects under the surcharge program “a large challenge for a small CAD staff with limited resources.”

ProPublica Read More Ten Years After the Flint Water Crisis Distrust and Anger Linger

He urged the state legislature to fund “additional technical staff and in-house expertise” for the tiny division. Instead a key state delegate introduced a bill in March similar to ones lawmakers tried to pass unsuccessfully in prior years to eliminate one of the program’s few safeguards: the 9% cap. It never received a hearing.

As West Virginia struggles to rebound from the pandemic Lane continues to write her monthly “Chairman’s Column” for local newspapers touting the commission’s own efforts to ease ratepayers’ economic pain.

At age 93 The Byrd Theatre’s Wurlitzer organ seems to possess a mind of its own. “It’s entitled to be temperamental” says Bob Gulledge who has operated the organ’s console for 25 years. “It’s complicated and the idea that they could make something like that work in 1928 is incredible.”

Gulledge is the 13th in a succession of organists who have summoned music celebratory commemorative and memorial from the Mighty Wurlitzer. He ascended to the bench in 1996 following Lin Lunde.

Gulledge’s connection to the Wurlitzer dates to 1965 when with a youth group from Bon Air Baptist Church he came to see “The Greatest Story Ever Told.” He was fascinated by the theater’s baroque opulence but the organ played by the well-known Eddie Weaver — then four years into his 20-year Byrd tenure — made a lasting impression.

“The first thing I heard was the roar of those big bass notes rolling across the floor” he recalls pausing as though hearing them still. “And Eddie brought that console over the rail and he had my attention. By the time it was over I was like ‘I gotta do that.’ ”

Weaver played in Richmond for 50 years first in 1937 at the Loew’s theater (now the Dominion Energy Center) and also accompanying on a small Hammond the fashion shows and events at the Miller & Rhoads Tearoom. That’s where after persistent queries he took Gulledge in as a student until one morning when Weaver told his pupil to meet him at The Byrd. Thus began Gulledge’s relationship with the theater’s Wurlitzer.

This past year during the pandemic shutdown Gulledge has played the organ for small groups for anniversaries and friends. He’s performed for two people and for 20 and he hopes in the weeks ahead to play for 50 to 75 in a theater that can hold 1500.

The Byrd’s Mighty Wurlitzer is one of fewer than 40 surviving instruments in their original installation from the more than 2000 made by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company from 1914-42. The organ was intended to operate as a “one-man orchestra” for accompanying silent movies.

Gulledge explains that the organ is more than its four keyboards. Behind the wicker basket-like decoration above the theater’s proscenium are four chambers that house the organ’s music-making machinery. “Nothing’s coming out of a speaker” he says. “It’s a mechanical gizmo that shakes that tambourine” and also operates the trumpet saxophone drums xylophone mandolin bells car horn bird whistle tuned sleigh bells and other instruments found in rooms above the movie screen.

They’re all real instruments including a rare Browne & Buckwell harp that sits in the right balcony above the organ. That instrument doesn’t play however and may never have — even when delivered from Grace Street by the Corley Music Co. Richmond’s Wurlitzer dealer.

From the console instructions are transmitted to the relay room and various valves and magnets. Circuits that open and close translate the commands to the pipes and the instruments. “Maybe eight things have to happen for the signal to travel and it’s instantaneous” Gulledge says. “There’s never a delay.”

Not original is the spinning disco ball attached to the top of the console. “I inherited it” he says. “People expect to see it now as part of their experience.”

The organ is a sensitive antique instrument requiring near-constant care. About a dozen years ago the organ died mid-performance. Gulledge switched off the instrument and turned to the audience announcing “We’re done. There’s no money. I can’t fix this without leather glue gussets felt.” He took up a collection in the lobby after the show netting $600 in a popcorn bucket.

“Kids put in their change one fellow put in $60” Gulledge recalls. Within two weeks the organ received repairs and has played ever since.

This began a dedicated revenue stream the Mighty Wurlitzer Organ Fund to keep the instrument in showtime condition. “Every key now plays” Gulledge says. “Only two years ago it was every third note. … Now it’s totally restored to the condition that the factory delivered it.”

Today The Byrd’s organ is one of the component parts of the city that makes Richmond Richmond.

Children run down before a matinee to peer over the rail to see that the console is there. Actor Ethan Hawke when in town filming “The Good Lord Bird” held several events at The Byrd and insisted the organ play for all of them. When Victoria Price daughter of actor Vincent visited The Byrd during a Poe Museum series of screenings she too was enthralled by the Wurlitzer. “She took pictures of the works and posted them on Facebook like a kid” Gulledge says.

Another admirer of the Mighty Wurlitzer is Richmond-based muralist and artist Nils Westergard who moved to Richmond in 2010 from Falls Church to attend Virginia Commonwealth University. He soon learned about The Byrd’s organ and witnessed the rise of the console from the orchestra pit with surprise and delight.

“I distinctly remember just how intense and apparent the admiration and pride was from the audience as he went back down” Westergard says. “What a wild and lovely contraption. I have had friends visit from overseas and I always take them to The Byrd on a night Bob is playing. They are always confused and then delighted!”

Gulledge is likewise a fan of Westergard’s work. Last year after seeing the artist on a lift working on a mural behind The Byrd Theatre he emailed him about creating an artistic interpretation of The Byrd and the organ. Within minutes Westergard emailed a reply: “I’ve been waiting for you. What took you so long?”

Westergard recently completed a set of 40-by-60-inch paintings of Gulledge and the organ created from a complicated set of hand-cut stencils. His process is documented in a YouTube video.

“There are 202 tabs [on the organ console]” Westergard explains “and every letter on every tab needs to be cut out of paper on every layer so four times — which is 808 tabs.” The full-color paintings are also a departure for the artist who usually works in greyscale. “[It] was just an all-around doozy especially at this scale.”

Gulledge marvels at the finished artwork which depicts him from above in silhouetted profile against the dazzling space shuttle arrangement of the keys.

The paintings are being sold for $5000 each with all proceeds to benefit the Mighty Wurlitzer Organ Fund. If interested contact info@byrdtheatre.org.

The hackers claim to have got all customer details and 18 crore order details which include customer's names phone numbers email IDs delivery address payment details including more than 10 lakh credit card details used to purchase on Domino’s India app.

Further the hackers are aiming to sell the entire data to a single buyer. According to Alon Gal the hackers are looking for $550000 (around Rs 4 crores) for the entire database. The hackers also have plans to build a search portal to enable querying the data.

The sale is apparently happening in the dark web and likely on a website frequented by cyber scammers. For now Domino's India has neither confirmed nor denied that data of its consumers has been stolen or leaked from its servers.

If accurate the data of Domino's India customers in public puts anyone who has ordered pizza at Domino's and has supplied details like credit card emails ID or phone numbers at a risk of identity theft and cyber fraud.

It is especially worrying as India has been a victim of several large-scale cyber breaches lately. According to Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) data during the Covid-19 pandemic cyber attacks on India grew by nearly 300% last year growing to 1158208 in 2020 compared to 394499 in 2019.

Last month the Union transport ministry received an alert from the CERT-IN regarding “targeted intrusion activities” directed towards the country’s transport sector with “possible malicious intentions”. This came after a slew of cybersecurity attacks on the Indian government and private sector portals over the past few months.

According to a survey conducted by Sophos Survey titled The Future of Cybersecurity in the Asia Pacific and Japan about 52 per cent of domestic Indian companies said they fell victim to a cyber attack in the last 12 months. Of these successful breaches 71 percent of organisations admitted it was a serious or very serious attack and 65 percent said it took longer than a week to remediate

Smith who joined last April receives a base salary of £430000 – almost a third on top of that received by David Bauernfeind who died in 2019 while snorkelling in Mauritius.

ISS said the fees were 'exceptionally high' for a FTSE 250 firm. Glass Lewis said it viewed high fixed pay rises with 'scepticism' as the remuneration 'may serve as a crutch when performance has fallen below expectations'.

Domino's said it needed to pay more to attract 'higher calibre talent'. Paul was paid 73.4 per cent of his maximum bonus last year taking his total pay to £1.08million.

The fee for new chairman Matt Shattock is 109 per cent higher than previously at £480000.

Jones Jr.

StarNews Correspondent

Kure Beach N. C. July 25 1943 at around 3 a.m. Germany attacked the United States when a surfaced submarine fired five rounds at the local Ethyl-Dow chemical plant intending its damage.

The rounds landed in the Cape Fear River near Brunswick County.

I believe this happened and thus was the only German military attack on America during World War II.

Officials blanked the media never providing facts. Public rumors persisted. It took post-war chance and persistence to divulge this remarkable story.

Reaction gathered believers and skeptics from “sure” to “mythology” enlivening speculative interpretations: It did or did not.

Following our interviews and site tours John Hanc writing for the New York Times (2016) and Smithsonianmag.com (2017) offered mediation. Weighing the yeas nays could-bes and maybe-nots he skewed probable.

Otherwise internet references and media re-writes appear primarily sourcing analysis in my 2003 book A Sentimental Journey. Anything new out there?

Presuming not let’s settle the issue.

Why Ethyl-Dow? The plant produced bromine from seawater a valued additive to aviation and high-performance gasolines – a natural target. Located one half mile north of now central Kure Beach it stretched one half mile across Federal Point from an ocean intake to river docks.

What was witnessed?

Ralph Horton on plant duty that night said “We were blacked out on the ocean side. Their aim wasn’t that good We heard the whistling sound. We were on the fourth floor and could see the shells exploding at the water’s edge.”

Horton later operated a metals business here and served as county commissioners chairman.

“It’s a tradition among Kure Beach old-timers that this happened” said John Gregory III at his family’s 1930s Atlantic Avenue cottage.

That night while his grandparents rocked a spotlight on the surface blinded their porch scanning the beach. They heard “artillery fire.” The light extinguished.

Gregory's grandmother told him “‘The whole thing happened in a minute or two.’ They sat petrified. Nothing they could do. They had no telephone.”

The next morning neighbors spoke of seeing the light or hearing the firing. Gregory's grandfather told an Army officer their experience. The response: “‘Nothing happened. You didn’t see anything.’ But they knew what they and their neighbors saw – a German submarine.”

Having 'reasonable proof' of the attack

Army Lt. Carlton Sprague 558th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion training at nearby Fort Fisher that night remembered the attack.

A. B. Love Jr. - The StarNews reported in March 1946 “That a German submarine tried to shell the Ethyl-Dow plant at Kure’s Beach was given ‘reasonable proof’ yesterday by a letter” from Love to his father. The attempt took place on the morning of July 25 1943 at 3 o’clock.”

Love worked for Ethyl-Dow later moved to Michigan and saw a German U-boat painting hanging in a barber shop. The owner a former Army pilot who spotted the submarine while patrolling that day knew of Love’s Wilmington connection. The pilot said it fired five rounds but “was sunk the following day.”

Location/verification of that particular sinking is difficult.

Plant official Robert Cantwell said this information was probably correct. An Army guard told him the alert was “the real thing.”

Lt. Cmdr. Louis Hanson Coast Guard Auxiliary sighted a submarine silhouette while patrolling around Masonboro Inlet that night and substantiated Love. Hanson lived across the street from me.

Noted local historian Lewis T. Moore accepted and reported Love’s and Hanson’s accounts.

Something was “not right”

Catherine and Margaret Crowe. That night an air raid siren awakened these First Presbyterian Church pastor’s daughters. Shipyard lights went out “which they never did in a practice raid”

Catherine Crowe said the next Sunday their dinner guests two British submarine-chaser officers operating here said that night while patrolling off Wrightsville Beach they almost hit a German submarine.

Luther Jordan. As volunteer head of Carolina Beach civilian defense an emergency call that night summoned him to the office. “After the war he told us about the submarine firing” said daughter Frances Jordan.

George Burrell Byers. That night he noticed shipyard lights extinguished with “dead silence.” A fighter plane roared south. “Something was not right.” Later he heard.

Shipyard lights stayed off until about 5:30 a.m. a drastic move at an around-the-clock facility and probably its only shut-down.

Some doubts still remain

Twenty years ago David Carnell studying the plant’s history found no relevant U-boat after-action reports and vociferously disputed claims. But he cited manager Monroe Shigley’s assertion a submarine was sighted that night but dived quickly. The plant shut down. Patrol craft made no contacts.

Okay so wasn’t that our sub?

Shigley however in a Federal Point Historical Society interview about just technical subjects never mentioned this. If the U-boat later sank its logs went down.

Historians uncovering no recorded East Coast submarine deployments that night should consider this. A lone long-range Type-IX boat on a specific assignment fired this last “Auf Wiedersehen” shot before departing for open ocean. Mission failed.

And now. Expect only a historic marker along U.S. 421. Apartments cover the plant’s Atlantic facing. Because of impassable thickets avoid exploring any skeletal remains along Dow Road.

But visit the Gregory cottage Kreigsmarine sign and ponder. Germany attacked the United States.

Wilmington native author military historian and retired Navy captain Wilbur Jones grew up here during WWII. He conceived and led the recent national project which designated Wilmington as America’s first WWII Heritage City.

During the pandemic cities such as Tulsa Oklahoma and Natchez Mississippi have offered remote workers cash to relocate there while exotic destinations like Aruba have promoted their islands for stay-at-home jobs.

Now West Virginia wants to pay remote workers $12000 to move to its country roads.

On April 12 Gov. Jim Justice announced a program Ascend WV that “will allow adventurers to enjoy world-class recreation uncrowded spaces and a low cost of living while staying fully connected to their jobs.”

West Virginia’s new program comes as many major companies including Uber and Microsoft bring their employees back to the office or have at least started thinking about it as Covid-19 vaccinations ramp up. But that doesn’t mean it’s too late for the Mountain State’s offer. Some companies – including Twitter and Slack – are letting at least some employees work remotely permanently.

The $12000 West Virginia is offering is paid over two years with $10000 divided in monthly payments for the first year and $2000 paid at the end of the second year according to the program’s website. If you move early you keep the money that you’ve earned so far.

The incentive package also includes a year’s worth of free outdoor recreation bringing the total value to $20000 the website said. That includes a year of access to activities such as whitewater rafting and downhill skiing as well as two years of free outdoor gear rentals such as camping gear or paddleboarding equipment.

Applicants must be 18 or older with a full-time remote job at a company located outside of West Virginia.

The first three host cities are Shepherdstown Lewisburg and Morgantown. More than 2000 people have applied for the 50 spots in Morgantown the first to open applications according to CNN affiliate WCHS.

Applications are open until the end of May in Morgantown and open in early 2022 in Shepherdstown and Lewisburg.

The program is supported in part by former Intuit CEO and West Virginia native Brad Smith and his wife Alys the governor’s office said. The couple donated $25 million to West Virginia University to get the program off the ground according to the school.

“Alys and I are committed to the success of this program and its ability to leverage West Virginia’s outdoor assets to attract fresh talent cultivate dynamic communities and continue to fuel the entrepreneurial and innovative thinking that are hallmarks of the state” Smith said. The Smiths hope the program will eventually include all of the states’ 55 counties.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGF3YWl0cy5jb20vMjU2MzQxOS9iZXN0LWdhcmRlbnMtbWljaGlnYW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Gorgeous Gardens To Visit In Michigan,"As summer approaches you’ll want to dust off the winter doldrums and get outside. Michigan summers reveal beautiful public gardens overflowing with colorful blooms. Each of these gardens features something more than gorgeous flowers; you’ll find everything from windmills to railroads in these Michigan gardens. Here are seven Michigan gardens you won’t want to miss.

1. Dow Gardens

Midland

Located in Midland Dow Gardens is a year-round venue with over 1700 plants. While this 110-acre garden requires extensive walking you can take a self-guided tour using an interactive GIS map. I enjoyed a guided tour via a golf cart but you need to call ahead to reserve the golf cart tour for which they charge a small fee. The excursion provides a good overview of the garden and its history. Plan to spend about two hours at Dow Gardens. Be sure to take a minute and get your picture taken in front of the pond feed waterfall.

The Conservatory is a glass-walled building that is home to orchids bonsai and begonias. In winter they add a 13-foot poinsettia tree and in spring it becomes a butterfly house and houses up to 3000 butterflies.

Within Dow Gardens you’ll find Herbert H. Dow’s home The Pines built in 1899. Today The Pines is a National Historic Landmark where historical interpreters lead tours of the house. It’s still furnished with the Dow family’s furniture and decor and provides a look into their life.

Dow Garden’s Whiting Forest showcases 54 acres of woodlands that include the longest canopy walk in the United States at 1400 feet long; it rockets up to 40 feet off the ground.

Pro Tip: You’ll find one and a half miles of ADA-accessible hard-surface paths within the Whiting forest area of Dow Gardens.

2. Windmill Island Garden

Holland

Located on the edge of downtown Holland Windmill Island Gardens features over 100000 tulips that bloom in late April or early May annually. In summer the tulips give way to a variety of annual flowers and verdant plants.

The 250-year-old working Dutch windmill named De Zwaan meaning graceful bird or swan was brought to Windmill Island Garden from the Netherlands in 1964. It’s believed to be the last windmill allowed out of the Netherlands.

West Michigan farmers grow the soft white winter wheat that the windmill grinds into flour and they sell to tourists and the community from the Molenwinkel Shop in the windmill. The windmill is 125 feet tall from the ground to the top of the blades and you can take a self-guided tour while it is open.

The garden is a seasonal park opening in April of every year and closing in October. With more than 30 acres and many attractions to explore you’ll want to allow a minimum of two hours for your visit. You should plan three hours during Tulip Time due to the increased number of people.

Pro Tip: Visit during Tulip Time which begins the first Saturday in May and runs through the week finishing on Sunday. Typically this is when the most tulips bloom and the festival offers dozens of Dutch-themed activities to add to the fun.

4. Fernwood Botanical Garden

Niles

Along the scenic St. Joseph River Valley in southwest Michigan you’ll find Fernwood Botanical Garden between Niles and Buchanan. The 105-acre Fernwood sits at the intersection of nature people and plants. It was a pleasant surprise to see young deer and other wildlife casually wandering through the gardens during my visit.

Bird watchers will enjoy the over 177 bird species spotted throughout the garden’s diverse habitats. While you’re likely to spot common birds like wild turkeys and blue herons you also may catch a glimpse of rarer birds such as the bald eagle and the threatened common loon. Check their website as they offer a variety of classes at their Education Center.

Fernwood Botanical Garden features the four-level Outdoor Railway Garden with detailed miniature gardens. Each level features a train for a total of 510 feet of track making its way through and around mountain tunnels a 6-foot-tall mountain range and a stream flowing into a 10-foot-wide lake. The Railway Garden also features a 7-foot waterfall.

Pro Tip: Stop by the Nature Center to see the bird feeding stations. Starting in early May they’re a magnet for various species including ruby-throated hummingbirds indigo buntings rose-breasted grosbeaks and Baltimore orioles.

5. W. J. Beal Botanical Garden

East Lansing

East Lansing’s Michigan State University is home to the W.J. Beal Botanical Garden the oldest continuously operating university botanical garden in the United States. The five-acre garden features more than 5000 plant species that you can explore for free.

6. University Of Michigan Matthaei Botanical Garden

Ann Arbor

Located on Ann Arbor’s east side you’ll find Matthaei Botanical Gardens and Nichols Arboretum on the University of Michigan’s Central Campus. Open sunrise to sunset through all four seasons the garden offers five hiking trails all under a mile long. The 11 different gardens here will take you from the orient in the Bonsai and Penjing Garden back home to the Great Lakes Garden any day of the week. Another attractive garden is the medicinal garden where you’ll learn about the hidden power of plants.

While no dogs are allowed at Matthaei Botanical Garden they are welcome on a leash at the Arb.

Pro Tip: Enter at the Washington Heights gate to access the two suggested wheelchair routes. Although neither of these paths is paved they are mostly smooth.

7. Frederik Meijer Garden And Sculpture Park

Grand Rapids

Positioned on the northeast side of Grand Rapids Frederik Meijer Garden and Sculpture Park sits on a 158-acre campus with indoor and outdoor areas that are all barrier-free and accessible.

Since I love art I was impressed by the Children’s Tram a docent-led tour that transitions the kiddos from the Lena Meijer Children’s Garden to the sculpture park and gardens. The docents engage the children with the sculptures by leading sing-alongs that relate to the statues. For example they sing the song “Are You Sleeping?” atthe Lying Man by Sean Henry.

The Lena Meijer Tropical Conservatory is a five-story 15000-square-foot facility that features a world of tropical plants. You’ll find exotic orchids from South America fig trees from India and banana plants and bamboo from Asia. The Conservatory is particularly fun in March and April during The Fred and Dorothy Fichter Butterflies Are Blooming exhibit the largest of its kind in the nation which features over 6000 tropical butterflies flying free within the Conservatory.

Pro Tip: A full schedule of Guided Tram Tours run through the sculpture park May 1 through September 30. No trams run in January or February although the garden remains open year-round.

Many of these gardens have reciprocal agreements when you purchase a money-saving membership. If you have the grandkids along know that all these gardens have children’s gardens within them except the W. J. Beal Botanical Garden at Michigan State University which has the Michigan 4-H Children’s Garden nearby.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wNC9sb2NhbC1lYXRzLXBlbmR1bHVtLWxvdW5nZS1vZmZlcnMtY3JhZnQtY29ja3RhaWxzLXNtYWxsLXBsYXRlcy1hbmQtbWlkLWNlbnR1cnktbW9kZXJuLXZpYmUuaHRtbNIBlQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wNC9sb2NhbC1lYXRzLXBlbmR1bHVtLWxvdW5nZS1vZmZlcnMtY3JhZnQtY29ja3RhaWxzLXNtYWxsLXBsYXRlcy1hbmQtbWlkLWNlbnR1cnktbW9kZXJuLXZpYmUuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local Eats: Pendulum Lounge offers craft cocktails small plates and mid-century modern vibe,"MIDLAND MI — Pendulum Lounge a new bar located inside the Midland Center for the Arts offers mid-century modern-inspired craft cocktails small plates and atmosphere.

DHI,DR Horton,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvcm1hbnNjaGFycGYuY29tL29iaXR1YXJ5L2phbml0aC1ob3J0b27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for Jan Knauer Horton at Gorman-Scharpf Funeral Home Inc.,"Jan Knauer Horton

Apparently Lincoln and Marcella Knauer were enthused by the birth of their first child a daughter on Nov. 15 1933 in Chicago: She was christened Janith Johanna Lynne Francis Knauer. In the 87-plus years that followed she enjoyed a life as crowded energetic and productive as her prodigious moniker promised.



Jan’s family moved to the Ozarks later in the 1930s first to Joplin then Springfield where she attended Rountree Elementary Elfindale Academy and St. Agnes High School. In 1951 she matriculated at the University of Oklahoma becoming the first person in her extended family to attend college. After graduating she moved with two college friends to Fort Lauderdale Fla. where she worked in a real-estate agency for a spell and may have visited the beach once or twice.

When Jan returned to Springfield she joined her father’s wide-ranging business pursuits acquiring a knowledge of business and human nature that would serve her well. She shared her father’s overflowing joie de vivre and when she later turned that upbeat spirit to philanthropy she would convince generations of donors not only to contribute their hard-earned money to the many worthy causes she supported but also to thank her for the opportunity.



In her 30s Jan joined up with five other singletons two women and three gentlemen to form The Single Six Marching and Martini Society an outfit whose “meetings” aligned with its title. Around this time she began dating Hank Horton a member of an old Springfield family who was a contractor large-machinery aficionado classic-car collector and architecture buff.

Horton persuaded noted architect E. Faye Jones to design a home on family property overlooking the James River east of Springfield and after the couple married in 1966 they moved into the new stone and glass house. These were the glory years for Jan a born nature-lover. She floated the James on the River Rat a square flat makeshift raft powered by a trolling motor. On land she traversed the countryside in a stripped-down VW beetle equipped with a cubby for her bird-watching binoculars and a gimbal-mounted receptacle to hold the essential elixir that fueled her endless activities a fresh Dr Pepper.

In 1969 Jan gave birth to her daughter Claire bringing new focus to her life. When Jan’s marriage ended some years later the two enjoyed a close bond that flourished as Claire graduated from Duke University became a physician married Doug Shoemaker settled in San Francisco and made Jan a proud grandmother to Sophie 17 and son Benjamin 13—the two great joys of her later years. Many trips back and forth from San Francisco ensued: Jan was an indelible part of her grandchildren’s lives and the most loving “Nana” in the world. The many late nights they spent hearing the stories of her life will remain with them forever.

Jan’s early life was undeniably blessed by prosperity but she never embraced the so-called “virtue of selfishness.” Instead she turned her energies to bringing people together and lifting up her city. As her interest in philanthropy grew she often worked with her younger sister Roseann Knauer Bentley forming a powerful team that for decades contributed to Springfield civic life. The sisters were among the founders of the Junior League of Springfield in 1959 and they supported the work of the Community Foundation of the Ozarks an organization focused on developing charitable resources grantmaking and public leadership after it was established in 1973.

If you seek Jan’s legacy look around you. A lover of the arts she served as the development director for KOZK in the 1980s spent many years on the Springfield Little Theatre Board of Directors and worked with Barb Baker Randy Russell and Nancy Dornan to create the city’s annual ArtsFest celebration. She also served on the Springfield Regional Arts Council board and on the Jordan Valley Advisory Committee helping bring Jordan Valley Park into existence. She was a longtime advocate for Ozark Greenways and as an early director for Friends of the Garden worked to realize the vision of a botanical garden at Nathanael Greene/Close Memorial Park.

Throughout her life Jan was an avid bird-watcher. She always took part in the Greater Ozarks Audubon Society’s annual Christmas bird count served as president of the group took aviary vacations to Belize and other destinations with daughter Claire and joined Dickerson Park Zoo groups on trips to Africa and China. Her “life list” of bird species sighted ran into the hundreds and she always was eager to tutor others to imitate the haunting call of the barred owl: “Who cooks for you?”

In 1988 as the previously all-volunteer Community Foundation of the Ozarks grew Jan was named its Executive Director and became its first salaried employee; as it flourished she became the CFO’s first President in 1993 and remained in office until her retirement in 2003. When she took the reins the organization held $1.7 million in assets. When she retired as president it held $52.5 million. Today its assets exceed $375 million.

In her long career Jan served on the boards and committees of some 40 local organizations helping support other women by opening doors previously closed. In 1988 the year Rotary International began admitting female members she was among the first to join the Rotary Club of Downtown Springfield where she belonged for 32 years. Since her death many women active in the local community have shared with her daughter what a powerful inspirational role Jan’s career played in their lives.



Honors came Jan’s way. She was given an Ozzie Award from the Springfield Regional Arts Council in 1995. She received the coveted designation of Springfieldian of the Year from the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce in 1998. And in 2009 she was awarded Missouri State University’s honorary Doctorate in Public Affairs which celebrated Jan as an “innovator businesswoman collaborator and visionary leader.”

Jan leaves behind her daughter Dr. Claire Horton and family (Doug Sophie and Benji); her sister Roseann (Dr. John Bentley); three brothers: Lincoln (Nancy); Kenny (Marti); and Kelly (Louise); as well as a cadre of admiring nieces and nephews and their children all of whom regarded her as an honorary grandmother and family matriarch and in whose lives she was deeply and actively interested. Her ashes were interred in Maple Park Cemetery on Thursday April 22 in a small family service.

The Community Foundation of the Ozarks is making a lead gift for the Jan Horton Memorial Fund which will honor Jan’s love of nature with a living memorial at the Springfield Botanical Gardens at Nathanael Greene/Close Memorial Park where a public celebration of her life will be held at the Peace Through People Pavilion at 10:00 a.m. on Saturday May 22.

For others who would like to honor Jan memorial contributions can be directed to the CFO P.O. Box 8960 Springfield MO 65801 or online at cfozarks.org/hortonfund; or to the Greater Ozarks Audubon Society.

Summing up Jan’s life in a 2018 biography The Moon Sees Me niece Gwyn Knauer described her as “a sister a mother a grandmother a feminist a nature lover a bird watcher a canoeist a dweller of the cliffside and a steward of farmland a world traveler a businesswoman a community activist a supporter of theater and the arts a philanthropist a spokesperson a holder of an honorary Ph.D. and a loyal and supportive friend.”

Perhaps her parents should have given her a longer name.

For Pensacola resident and teacher Terri Herrington those rewarding fulfilling feelings were magnified by millions in March 2020 when she successfully donated a kidney to the same man — and friend — who her late husband had donated a kidney to in 2004 after his death in a tragic fall.

Tallahassee resident Jeff Granger was among the four people whose life was saved 16 years ago thanks to Bryan Herrington's status as an organ donor. Since the time when Granger received the transplant he and Terri Herrington have remained close friends.

So when Granger mentioned to her that her late husband's kidney had started to fail him in 2019 Hetherington took it as a sign that this was her time to step up.

""I was already looking into being a living donor but I'm a teacher so I would always push it off"" explained Herrington who is a fifth-grade teacher at Longleaf Elementary. ""I'd say 'Well I'd have to wait 'til summer.' And then Jeff called and I said 'Oh. Maybe you're the person I'm supposed to donate to.' So I said 'Well may as well.""

►Herrington's husband honored at Rose Bowl:Pensacola Organ Donor to be honored during Rose Parade

►Blue Angels license plates to be produced in early 2021 after 3000 voucher goal is met

Granger thought she was joking but on March 3 2020 the transplant surgery took place.

""I'd wanted to donate it and was going to do it altruistically but it just so happened Jeff needed it"" she said. ""God's been telling me I'm supposed to do this so maybe it's you I'm supposed to deliver it to.""

The decision was easy for Hetherington who along with her sons Drake and Payton grew close to Granger and his wife for the past 15 years.

""He's been there for my boys since they were so little then"" she said of her sons who are now 21 and 16 respectively.

""He's a Gator fan but we'll forgive that one"" joked Hetherington a Florida State Seminoles fan. ""But we'd all go to a game or we'd go over there for a weekend and we've gone on vacations together. So we all just hit it off.""

Donate Life specialty license plates support the cause

On Friday at the Escambia County Tax Collector's Office on Palafox Street surrounded by green and blue decorations to denote National Donate Life Month in April Herrington purchased two vouchers for the new Donate Life license plate.

If 3000 vouchers are purchased by October 2023 those who prepaid will receive a Donate Life specialty license plate. Herrington bought one of her vouchers for her youngest son Payton who just received his driver's license this year.

Like so many aspects of Herrington's life over the past 15 years her son's first driving chapter is even tied into organ donation and the friendships she's built with her husband's organ recipients.

""My kid got his car from my husband's liver recipient he donated his car to us"" Herrington said. ""We got it two years ago. So the voucher for this plate will be for that car.""

Beyond just her lifelong bond with Granger Herrington said she feels a renewed connection to her late husband one that's as much physical as it is spiritual.

""The only place that my kidney would fit is right below my husband's kidney in Jeff"" she explained. ""So he still has my husband's kidney and pancreas but the only place mine would fit is right there so it seems like the connection is even greater.""

Given all she's been through Herrington is obviously a staunch supporter of organ donation and she implores everyone to register if their health allows it. She said you never know just how big of an impact you could have on someone else's life and even the world at large.

""You never know who you're saving you could save someone who ends up creating the cure for COVID. You could save a kid"" Herrington said. ""You have solid organs but you also have skin and ligaments you name it. So it's just never ending when it comes to who you can save and what they're going to do in their life.""

This story is part of Covering Climate Now a global journalism collaboration strengthening coverage of the climate story.

Author’s note: Following the initial publication of this article Reuters reported that a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed on April 21 between the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians (EBCI) and the American Chestnut Foundation. The MOU described by EBCI members as highly controversial would allow the planting of GE American chestnuts on Cherokee land.

On August 18 2020 the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) published a petition by researchers at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) seeking federal approval to release their genetically engineered (GE) Darling 58 (D58) American chestnut tree into U.S. forests. Researchers claim the transgenic D58 tree will resist the fungal blight that coupled with rampant overlogging decimated the American chestnut population in the early 20th century. In fact the GE American chestnut is a Trojan horse meant to open the doors to commercial GE trees designed for industrial plantations.

The D58 would be the first GE forest tree approved in the U.S. and the first GMO intended to spread in the wild. (GE canola plants were discovered in the wild in 2010 but that was unplanned.) “This is a project to rapidly domesticate a wild species through genetic engineering and accelerated breeding and then to put it back into ecosystems to form self-perpetuating populations — an intentional evolutionary intervention that has never been attempted before with any species” explain scientists at the Center for Food Safety (CFS) and International Center for Technology Assessment (ICTA) which are nonprofits based in Washington D.C.

“The southern U.S. is global ground zero for the forest products industry and we see genetically engineered chestnut trees as this industry’s sneaky way of opening the floodgates for ‘frankentrees’ that will harm forests biodiversity and local communities across the region” explains Scot Quaranda of Dogwood Alliance a nonprofit based in North Carolina that works to protect southern U.S. forests. “Our natural forests that support wildlife and the economic sovereignty of rural communities will rapidly be replaced with tree plantations for wood pellets paper and more leaving environmental and climate injustice in their wake.”

The GE American chestnut faces an uphill battle due to decades of opposition to GE trees by Indigenous peoples scientists students activists foresters and others including a GE tree ban by the Forest Stewardship Council and a United Nations decision that warns countries of the dangers of GE trees and urges use of the precautionary principle while addressing the issue.

By October 19 2020 the close of the public comment period on the petition 109 organizations representing millions of members plus an additional 123426 individuals had registered their opposition to the D58. The next step is the creation of a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) by the USDA recommending action on the petition. The American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) estimates this could take up to a year to complete. Following this another public comment period will be undertaken to review the draft EIS after which the agency will develop a final EIS with a decision on the petition.

D58 Safety Studies “Invalid” Warn Scientists

While American chestnut trees are known to live hundreds of years D58 trees have only been growing since 2017 calling into question the ESF petition assertion that “Darling 58 has been studied in detail and no plant pest or environmental risks have been observed.”

In a report on the GE American chestnut she co-wrote Rachel Smolker from Biofuelwatch explains “Given the long lifespan of trees and varying environmental conditions they face we cannot extrapolate from tests done on very young trees under controlled lab and field conditions. How GE trees might behave in the diverse and changing context of natural forests over long periods of time is unknown and likely to remain unknown even after they are released.”

The future impacts of even a well-meaning action can become catastrophic especially in combination with the unpredictable effects of climate change and extreme weather.

Scientists at CFS and ICTA warn of problems with the D58 safety studies writing “Given the young age of Darling 58 trees and corresponding dearth of tissue samples conclusions from most of the animal experiments described in the Petition are too preliminary to depend upon.”

In studying ESF’s assessment of the impacts of inserting the blight-resistant oxalate oxidase (OxO) transgene into the chestnut genome both CFS and ICTA further point out that some D58 studies did not in fact use material from transgenic D58 trees rendering them invalid. “Petitioners did experiments to study how bumblebees might be affected by Darling 58 but did not have enough Darling 58 pollen for the experiments so used non-transgenic pollen instead to which they added purified OxO from barley seeds.… Other important initial studies on animals reported in the Petition are of limited use because they involved feeding leaves from the Darling 4 instead of Darling 58 … even though Darling 4 has much lower levels of OxO in leaves … again invalidating the conclusions for risk assessments.” The Darling 4 was an earlier version of the American chestnut genetically engineered with the OxO transgene.

While researchers have argued that a strict regulatory process will ensure the safety of the D58 GE tree a 2019 report by the National Academies of Sciences Engineering Medicine titled “Forest Health and Biotechnology: Possibilities and Considerations” raises flags: “Forest health is not accounted for in the regulations for the use of biotechnology or for other approaches to mitigating forest tree insect pests or pathogens.… There are no specific regulations or policies that those agencies apply to biotech trees.”

Profit Motive Trumping Morality?

Proponents argue that there can be no downside to releasing a tree engineered to resist an introduced blight. But like fire suppression which has led to devastating wildfires due to an unnatural build-up of flammable materials in the forest the future impacts of even a well-meaning action can become catastrophic especially in combination with the unpredictable effects of climate change and extreme weather. Yet researchers are engineering trees with the conviction that because they can they should.

In her book Can Science Make Sense of Life? Sheila Jasanoff Pforzheimer Professor of Science and Technology Studies at the Harvard Kennedy School explains the implications of this arrogance. “For life scientists and their enthusiastic promoters the arc of the technologically possible often coincident with the promise of financial gain increasingly … defines the boundaries of the morally permissible.”

Researcher William Powell whose GE American chestnut research has received both financial and technical support from companies with a vested interest in the approval of the GE American chestnut — including Monsanto ArborGen and Duke Energy — defends his approach. In an article in The Conversation Powell says “One of the key advantages of genetic engineering is that it’s far less disruptive to the original chestnut genome — and thus to its ecologically important characteristics. The trees remain more true to form with less chance of unforeseen and unwanted side effects. Once these genes are inserted they become a normal part of the tree’s genome and are inherited just like any other gene.”

However in a briefing paper published by the Federation of German Scientists Ricarda Steinbrecher a molecular geneticist and Antje Lorch a biologist counter that the genetic engineering process is inherently risky. The paper states “It is well documented that the processes of plant transformation give rise to many mutations throughout the plant genome as well as at the insertion site of the transgene.… Any robust risk assessment study needs to take several generations into account for example to assess the stability and heritability of the transgene unintended side effects and changes due to transformation impact.”

Why the American Chestnut?

The D58 American chestnut is the culmination of decades of effort to open the doors to GE trees in the U.S. by biotechnology and timber companies. In 1999 Monsanto joined with timber companies from the U.S. and New Zealand to form a “forestry biotechnology joint venture” which later became ArborGen one of the world’s leaders in GE tree research and development. GE tree research was originally focused on trees and traits valued by the forest products industry; trees like poplar pine and eucalyptus and traits like insect resistance herbicide tolerance faster growth or altered wood composition.

Other early associations — including the Tree Genetic Engineering Research Cooperative at Oregon State University launched in 1994 — brought together university researchers with timber and biotechnology giants as well as the U.S. Forest Service to develop genetically engineered trees for industrial timber plantations.

These efforts were met with widespread opposition and sabotage leading the industry to conclude that they needed a charismatic “test tree” to try to win over the public opinion relating to GE trees.

The potential deregulation of the D58 is not about restoring a “mighty giant” to eastern U.S. forests. Its approval is about paving the way for the deregulation of all GE trees.

A 2007 published paper explains “There is opposition to commercial application of trees engineered specifically for fast growth and increased yields by those whose stance is that the value accrues only to ‘big companies.’ It will remain for traits that have broad societal benefits such as conservation… for acceptance to be gained.”

The D58 is seen as a positive example for the beleaguered biotechnology industry of the benefits of “biotechnology for conservation.” Duke Energy also sees the American chestnut for its value as a greenwashing tool. Duke Energy invested millions into the GE American chestnut through the Forest Health Initiative. Its hope was to use the American chestnut to help “green” its devastated mountaintop removal mining lands.

Once dominant in eastern U.S. forests the American chestnut was highly valued for its beautiful and rot-resistant wood and abundant nuts. While few actually remember the tree which largely disappeared from the landscape by the 1920s a public relations effort was launched in the early 2010s with articles appearing in numerous major publications heralding the return of this “mighty giant” through the wonders of genetic engineering. Millions of American chestnut stumps meanwhile continue to send up shoots that occasionally grow into trees large enough to produce nuts and in some locations wild American chestnuts are spreading on their own showing at least some evolving blight tolerance.

Naturalist and author Bernd Heinrich has one such grove growing on his land in Maine. In a New York Times op-ed in 2013 he wrote

I have been enjoying American chestnuts for several years now harvested from some trees that are now part of my forest of 600 acres in western Maine. I planted four seedlings in the spring of 1982. Beyond all my expectations the trees thrived and some are now 35 feet tall.… In my small corner of western Maine the American chestnut is now promising to again become a significant component of the ecosystem.

Another decades-long program by the American Chestnut Cooperators’ Foundation is successfully breeding pure wild American chestnuts that are naturally blight-resistant.

In spite of examples like this GE chestnut proponents have declared the American chestnut functionally extinct and insist that its survival hinges on the release of unproven and risky genetic engineered American chestnut trees into forests. But Lois Breault-Melican a former board member of the American Chestnut Foundation who publicly resigned from the TACF over the organization’s support for the GE American chestnut points out that this argument ignores the risks posed to organic and other chestnut growers: “These growers are concerned about the potential GMO contamination of their orchards caused by the unregulated and unmonitored planting of genetically engineered American chestnut trees. If the USDA approves these GE American chestnuts the integrity of chestnut orchards would be forever compromised.”

Indigenous Sovereignty Concerns

Indigenous peoples in the regions of proposed D58 releases have expressed concern that unregulated distribution of a GE tree would violate their sovereign right to keep their territories free from GMOs. They insist that Indigenous peoples be consulted in the process of reviewing the D58 American chestnut.

“Today there remain large areas of traditional and treaty lands on which much is forested and managed as sovereign territory of many different Native American Peoples” explains BJ McManama of the Indigenous Environmental Network. “These forests are not only a source of economic self-determination but hold great cultural significance to include sacred sites where trees are an element of sustenance knowledge and familial identity. Every living being within the forests is related in some form and nothing within these lands lives in isolation therefore changing or altering the original instructions of any one or any part of these elements threatens the natural order established over millennia.”

The Eastern Band of Cherokee members of the Lumbee Tribe of central North Carolina and Seminole Peoples from unceded Florida territory joined the Campaign to STOP GE Trees for an October gathering in the mountains of North Carolina to protest GE trees as a form of colonization. Their concerns were focused on the GE American chestnut trees.

Lisa Montelongo a member of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee explained “I’m very concerned that GE trees would impact our future generations and their traditional uses of trees. Our basket makers people that use wood for the natural colors of our clay work — there would be no natural life no cycle of life in GE tree plantations.”

Following the camp the Band’s Tribal Council passed a unanimous resolution prohibiting GE trees from their lands: EBCI Tribal Council Resolution No. 31 (2015): “We commit to rejecting biomass genetically engineering the natural world carbon trading carbon offsets and carbon sequestration schemes as they are false solutions to the climate change.” Concerns were focused on the inability of the tribe to keep the GE American chestnut tree off of their lands if it were released into surrounding forests which they describe as a violation of the Free Prior and Informed Consent mandate under the UN’s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Global Impact of the Genetically Engineered D58 American Chestnut Tree

In the end the potential deregulation of the D58 is not about restoring a “mighty giant” to eastern U.S. forests. Its approval is about paving the way for the deregulation of all GE trees toward the creation of an oxymoronic future “bioeconomy” where biodiverse forests are replaced with specially engineered trees for the manufacture of fuels chemicals textiles plastics and other goods in a “green” version of “business as usual.” Implicit in this scheme is a massive increase in consumption of wood. This in turn will drive accelerated conversion of carbon-rich native forests critical for climate regulation and other ecosystems for conversion to fast-growing plantations that include GE trees with traits to expedite their use as feedstocks. Existing non-native plantations of eucalyptus the most common plantation tree are already notorious for their devastating social ecological and climate change impacts. But new research out of Oregon State University is attempting to “green” these plantations with claims that eucalyptus trees can be genetically engineered to be infertile through a process to “knock out LEAFY” the gene believed to control flower formation. The research claims this would prevent eucalyptus trees from invading native ecosystems though it does nothing to address the ability of eucalyptus to spread asexually through vegetative propagation.

This new technology also does nothing to address the serious problems caused by industrial plantations of eucalyptus. These impacts outlined in detail by the World Rainforest Movement include depletion of fresh water; forced displacement of Indigenous groups rural communities and subsistence farmers; and catastrophic wildfires. In fact the addition of GE trees to these plantations could exacerbate known impacts and/or lead to new unknown and potentially irreversible problems.

Another attempt to “green” GE trees for the bioeconomy involves the development of trees specially engineered to store extra carbon as a supposed climate change mitigation tool. But a new article in Yale 360 challenges schemes like this that focus on tree planting for climate mitigation. Echoing the findings of the World Rainforest Movement and others the article reports “a growing number of scientists are challenging this tree-planting narrative. They say that these programs especially those based on huge numerical targets can wreck natural ecosystems dry up water supplies damage agriculture push people off their land — and even make global warming worse.” In addition they say tree planting can “distract from the greater priorities of protecting existing forests and reducing fossil fuel use.”

The attempts to greenwash genetically engineered trees with their unpredictable and irreversible impacts are being opposed globally by a broad coalition of scientists Indigenous peoples agronomists peasant farmers foresters teachers and others as well as organizations focused on protecting forests human rights and climate justice. GE trees have no place in an ecologically and socially just future.

The Outlander actor played Philip in two series of the lavish Netflix drama opposite Olivia Colman as the Queen.

Menzies who took over the role from Doctor Who star Matt Smith for the third and fourth series of the show watched hours of interview footage to prepare for the part.

Being Philip: The Crown’s Tobias Menzies on the ‘forces warring within the duke’ https://t.co/kaEPk5BqPI — The Guardian (@guardian) April 17 2021

Speaking to the Guardian’s Today In Focus podcast he said: “There’s a lot of different forces at play within him.

“He was someone who was very wary to show his feelings and yet atmospherically he’s not a cool presence he’s quite hot … He’s abrasive.

“He’s challenging. He’s funny. But there’s an energy about it: it’s not calm it’s not gentle. And those things seem to be kind of warring inside him.

“So actually for someone who doesn’t want to give much away he often feels like he is giving quite a lot of way.”

Tobias Menzies as Philip with Olivia Colman as the Queen (Netflix)

He added: “For someone who clearly was not comfortable with [the role] he managed to do it with quite a high degree of dignity and patience.

“The idea of this alpha male spending his life walking two or three steps behind his wife … to be in an almost entirely ceremonial position it’s fascinating.

“It’s the stuff of Greek drama. [It] is to his credit the effect he’s had on that institution on that family.

“He took that completely non-role incredibly seriously applied a huge amount of energy and inventiveness and created a life for himself with great ingenuity and great energy.

“I think the institution itself benefited from that … he was partly involved in the transition from an aristocratic family to one that was marked by largely middle-class values.

“He helped to open it up and to a certain degree demystify a lot of the stuff that was going on and modernise it.”

After Philip’s death at 99 on April 9 Menzies quoted Orlando from Shakespeare’s As You Like It.

.If I know anything about the Duke of Edinburgh I'm fairly sure he wouldn't want an actor who portrayed him on TV giving their opinion on his life so I'll leave it to Shakespeare. ""O good old man! how well in thee appearsThe constant service of the antique world…"" RIP — Tobias Menzies (@TobiasMenzies) April 9 2021

He wrote on Twitter: “If I know anything about the Duke of Edinburgh I’m fairly sure he wouldn’t want an actor who portrayed him on TV giving their opinion on his life so I’ll leave it to Shakespeare. ‘O good old man! how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world…’ RIP.”

Smith who played the part for series one and two also offered his own tribute saying: “Prince Philip was the man. And he knew it. 99 and out but what an innings. And what style.

Someone has worked out one of the key reasons why Antoine Dupont is so dominant at scrum half in rugby

A rugby genius known as GDD coaching & Analysis has quite possibly worked out one of the key reasons why Antoine Dupont is one of the best rugby players in his position in the world.

Antoine Dupont is considered by many to be one of if not the best rugby player on the planet.

His playstyle has helped him be one of the most prolific 9’s in modern rugby scoring far more tries than you would normally expect from someone in his position.

A brilliant video has been made recently showing why he is just so good in his position.

Geraint Davies coaching & analysis has made an analysis video focusing on the way in which Antoine Dupont uses the inside line of many different players to his advantage.

If you always hear people raving about the little Frenchman but you’re not sure what all the fuss is about then this is the video for you!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNvdXRoYWZyaWNhbi5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2FtYW5kYS1kdS1wb250LWxhdW5jaGVzLWFmcmljYW4tYW5kLXZlZ2FuLXNraW5jYXJlLXJhbmdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amanda du-Pont launches African and vegan skincare range,"Amanda du-Pont Skeem Saam actress and business woman has added her name to the list of South African celebrities who have beauty/skincare ranges.

With the introduction of the third-generation Corvette in 1968 Chevy was unknowingly beginning a stretch of now-classic ‘Vettes that would carry on seemingly forever or at least until 1982.

While power levels would gradually decline during that long run that wasn’t a problem in ‘68 at least.

With several engine options available the original owner of this Rally Red coupe was one of just 1932 people (out of a total sales figure of 28566) who opted for the 427 Tri-Power V8 that cranked out 400 horsepower and was capable of running the quarter in 13.7 seconds with an eventual top speed of 150 mph.



That original L68 powerplant – which cost just $305.50 more back in the day – remains in place though it doesn’t currently run after sitting in a garage for 40 years according to its owner who has the car listed on eBay out of Hicksville New York.

Interest has already been intense with 29 bids climbing to $19300 and already surpassing the reserve with four days to go.



While the engine isn’t running the seller notes that it was “oiled up” though he doesn’t offer much information on when that was done. Hopefully it can be rebuilt back easily to its former glory.

The four-speed manual transmission is said to “shift” though again we aren’t offered any further information.

The only other important data offered is that the dash is in “perfect” condition.



Obviously after such a long period of non-use the exterior paint is in need of some tender loving care. It would likely also be wise to check this 53-year-old Stingray for rust damage to the frame and birdcage.

It’s clear that this Stingray was the apple of its owner’s eye back in the day since he also chose power steering power brakes black leather interior and AM/FM radio.

Will it also become the apple of your eye soon?

The market is full of fast chargers but picking the right one that can power up all your various gadgets is no simple task. Between older protocols Qualcomm Quick Charge USB Power Delivery and the newer USB PD PPS standards it’s a real headache. The Elecjet X21 GaN Pro Fast Charger wants to remove the hassle as a one-stop-shop for all your charging needs.

Android Authority previously reviewed Elecjet’s 45W USB-C Super Fast Charger and rated it very highly as one of the few affordable chargers on the market to fast charge Samsung’s Galaxy S21 series. Can the brand’s 65W charging hub meet the same high bar? Let’s find out in this Elecjet X21 GaN Pro Fast Charger review.

What you need to know about the Elecjet X21 GaN Pro Fast Charger

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

Elecjet X21 GaN Pro Fast Charger: £44.99/€44.99 Based on the increasingly popular GaN technology the Elecjet X21 Pro offers high power charging in a very compact form factor. It’s much smaller than your typical desktop hub or high-power wall charger and works as both a desktop and portable power plug. See also: What is GaN and what does it mean for your tech?

The Elecjet X21 Pro sports two USB-C ports with USB Power Delivery and USB PD PPS compatibility. These ports are accompanied by a single USB-A port sporting a wide range of other charging standards to power up pretty much any other gadgets you may have lying around. With up to 65W of power output even via the USB-A port Elecjet’s X21 Pro is sufficient not just for smartphones but high-end laptops too.

Elecjet bundles a selection of interchangeable regional power adapters in the box. These can be swapped using a proprietary connector on the back of the plug. The X21 GaN Pro Fast Charger is available exclusively in black.

What’s good?

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

The Elecjet X21 Pro supports the modern USB Power Delivery PPS standard with up to 63W of power. That’s everything you need to charge cutting-edge laptops and smartphones including the latest Samsung Galaxy phones. There’s also a huge range of legacy fast charging standards at up to 60W as well. Fast charging protocols from Apple HUAWEI MediaTek Samsung and Qualcomm are all onboard via the USB-A port.

The Elecjet X21 GaN Pro will fast charge basically anything.

I recorded very fast charging speeds and good power efficiency in my tests. The only finicky device was the Microsoft Surface X Pro which wouldn’t quite charge at full speed. But the Elecjet isn’t the only charger to have that problem with this device.

This plug will fast charge basically anything. 65W is also enough power to charge up a laptop and smartphone at once with reasonably fast speeds although you do sacrifice peak speed when charging multiple devices. If you’re looking for a charger for all your gadgets this is it.

Elecjet has also implemented a very smart patent pending connector on the back of the X21 Pro. It allows for quickly twisting in a different regional adapter — three of which are included in the box — or an extension plug into the back of the charging brick. This makes the adapter an ideal travel companion and desk hub for your gadgets. It’s a very well-thought-out design that definitely adds extra value over other chargers on the market.

What’s not so good?

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

The only fault with the Elecjet X21 Pro and pretty much all multi-port hubs is that it’s much harder to know how much power you’ll receive and on which ports when plugging in multiple gadgets at once. The table below breaks down how Elecjet says its ports work.

I’m yet to see a multi-port plug that’s smart enough to ideally balance charging loads. You’ll receive up to 45W and 18W when plugging in either two USB-C or a USB-C and USB-A gadget. Sadly this means you can’t fully fast charge two Samsung Galaxy S21s at once. That said Elecjet’s solution here is better than most. When plugging in three devices at once the top USB-C port is handed 45W fast charging priority while the other two fight it out for the remaining 15W.

Elecjet X21 Pro USB port configuration USB port power capabilities 1 USB-C port:

USB-C - PD PPS 63W

USB-A port:

QC and other standards up to 60W

2 USB-C ports:

USB-C 1 - PD PPS 45W; USB-C 2 - PD PPS 18W

USB-C port 1 + USB-A port:

USB-C 1 - PD PPS 45W; USB-A - QC 18W

USB-C port 2 + USB-A port:

24W shared

2 USB-C ports + USB-A port:

USB-C 1 - PD PPS 45W; USB-C 2 + USB-A - 15W shared



The only issue to be aware of is that using the second USB-C port and USB-A at the same time shares are a rather paltry 24W. It’s an odd caveat that’s likely down to the chip inside the charger rather than a design oversight by Elecjet. Either way just make sure to always use the top port to maximize charging speeds.

The end result is a hub that’s good at charging two devices but can’t fast charge three at once. It’s down to personal preference whether you like Elecjet’s priority port approach or the more common even-split power approach used in other hubs. Personally I’m leaning towards Elecjet’s idea as it keeps it usable as a laptop charger even when slowly topping up other gadgets.

The soft plastic body is also a bit of a dust magnet and marks easily. But otherwise seems very sturdy and shouldn’t damage easily. The plug also gets a bit warmer than other GaN chargers I’ve tested but it’s nowhere near too hot to touch.

Elecjet X21 GaN Pro Fast Charger review: Should I buy it?

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

Fast charges laptops: check. Charges the finicky Galaxy S series: check. Fast charges older USB-A gadgets: check. The Elecjet X21 GaN Pro Fast Charger meets all the criteria most consumers will want from a compact GaN adapter. The only caveat is the somewhat finicky nature of multi-device charging.

Priced at £44.99 (~$62) the Elecjet X21 Pro is competitive for a hub charger but definitely not the same value proposition as the inexpensive 45W Fast Charge model. Although the ingenious interchange plug system definitely earns extra premium points against rival products like the four-port RavPower PD Pioneer 65W desktop charger.

At the time of writing UK customers can pick the charger up with a 20% discount coupon from Amazon making it quite the steal. Sadly availability of the Elecjet X21 GaN Pro is limited to just some European countries. Customers in the US can grab a version without the interchangeable adapter connector for $29.49 which also isn’t a bad deal.

It all happened one bedtime at the family home near Gwersyllt Wrexham when Mr Robins who is originally from Knutsford in Cheshire was scrolling through items for sale on the internet auction site.

The listing for the 72 foot-long naval harbour defence launch ML1392 caught his eye.

He thought his wife would dismiss the idea but she saw the history of the ship that served as a navigation marker during the D-Day Landings and even played a part in capturing a German submarine she was very much onboard.

MORE NEWS:

Mr Robins 41 said: ""I've always had a passion for boats and have bought lots of boats on eBay. I saw her and thought 'I'll never get away with this'. I said 'check this out Gem it's only round the corner'.""

Mrs Robins 34 added: ""We saw it advertised and did a bit of research. It was more of a heart over the head thing where we thought we have got to save this boat.

""At first I said I don't want a boat that big but the more I looked at her the more I thought there's not many left in the world we've got to try and save her. It was more a case of wanting to preserve our history than wanting to buy a big boat just for the fun of it. If she was a Spitfire she would be in a museum by now but boats just seem to get left and ruined. But she has such a brilliant history.""

She added: ""It was something that was never planned for or budgeted for. When we bought her as we both work full-time and have two children we thought it's going to be a very long-term project.""

The couple have experience in restoration through their business Creation Campers in Cefyn-y-bedd that sees them create bespoke camper vans.

And now they travel to the Dee Estuary twice a week to work on the ship. It has become a real family project especially for nine-year-old Emilia who ""loves to get her hands dirty"".

It won't be returned exactly to its 1943 condition because as Gemma says: ""What would we want a warship for?""

Although as Mrs Robins said it was originally thought to be a long-term project the family's YouTube channel has become so popular that they are hoping to move things forward more quickly.

The channel now has more than 20000 subscribers and the couple's videos charting the progress of the project have had more than two million views. They have even launched ""Ship Happens"" merchandise.

Mrs Robins who originally hails from Huyton in Liverpool added: ""We expected 20 people to watch the videos but all of a sudden its skyrocketed on YouTube.

""It's hard to put an end date on it but it would be nice in two years to have it done. It will be so nice to get it out of the mud.

""Right now the problem is trying to find somewhere to put her because no posh marina wants a 'project boat'. Right now just getting to the boat is really hard for us because we have to walk across lots of mud and stuff like that. I've spoken to marinas in North Wales but none of them will entertain it.""

But the couple want to keep the original ML1392 on her hull and keep the name ""Sarinda"" from her days as a a charter vessel on the Crinan Canal in Scotland and later as a luxury motor yacht based on the Mersey.

Can it continue?

Electronic Arts (EA -0.24%) saw its share price climb 34% last year as the pandemic led to higher engagement levels across its core titles. Still the company's guidance for fiscal 2021 (ending March 31 2021) calls for revenue to increase only slightly over the previous year. Can EA deliver enough growth over the long term to justify buying the stock today?

I think so -- here's why.

Industry tailwinds

All signs continue to point to growth in the video game industry over the long term which is a tailwind for leading game producers like Electronic Arts. Following the engagement trends seen during the pandemic market researcher Newzoo expects the industry to grow again this year reaching $189 billion in total game revenue in 2021 up from an estimated $175 billion last year.

A few trends support this estimate including the increasing penetration of the Sony PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X/S consoles which launched in the fall. Plus mobile gaming has become the biggest driver of industry revenue growth. The adoption of 5G wireless connection speeds is a catalyst for greater adoption on mobile platforms. And earlier this year EA announced a deal to acquire Glu Mobile (GLUU) for $2.1 billion.

Moreover content creators and game streamers are driving higher demand for computing peripherals which reflects growing interest in gaming. The leading graphics chip producer NVIDIA recently reported that it sees a long runway of growth in its gaming segment as sales of gaming laptops continue to outpace the consumer laptop market.

As new players pick up gaming Electronic Arts has the resources to continue investing in new content to grow revenue and generate market-beating returns as it has over the last few decades.

EA generates tons of cash

EA generated $1.93 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters. As a show of confidence in the future management initiated the company's first dividend during the fiscal third quarter. The dividend amounts to a quarterly payout of $0.17 per share or $0.68 annually.

Making video games is a very profitable business especially for the companies that have the most players. EA has a large player base to monetize since it owns some of the most popular titles on the market including FIFA Madden Battlefield The Sims and the free-to-play shooter Apex Legends. During the fiscal second-quarter earnings report EA reported it had 330 million unique accounts across all of its games.

Management believes it can grow the viewership and player base of its EA Sports titles alone to 500 million. And it's got a pipeline of new sports releases and experiences in development. The pending acquisition of Glu Mobile will bring over Tap Sports Baseball on mobile devices and EA is also bolstering its racing portfolio with the recent acquisition of Codemasters.

The company certainly has its chess pieces positioned to go on the offensive in the video game industry.

Growth expectations

That leaves one issue on investors' minds: If EA sees so much opportunity in the space why is it guiding for just 1.1% revenue growth in fiscal 2021?

A key factor that gets overlooked is the multi-year shift happening in the industry from brick-and-mortar purchases to digital spending on games. During the nine-month period ended in December sales of packaged games -- which make up nearly 15% of EA's total revenue -- fell 32% year over year. Excluding sales of packaged goods EA's total revenue would have increased over 13% instead of the reported 3%.

It's quite possible that EA could see its revenue growth accelerate over the next five years as packaged sales continually shrink as a portion of its sales while digital revenue continues to grow.

Investors should do well with EA

The advances in technology over the last 40 years have propelled the top video game stocks to massive outperformance relative to the S&P 500. More immersive gaming experiences and easier access to games enabled by cloud gaming platforms and mobile devices are powerful forces that should push EA's stock price to new highs over the long term.

What's more shares are not that expensive right now trading at a price-to-free cash flow multiple of 21. At this level it looks like a good time to buy into one of the gaming industry's leading names.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2dhbWluZy9iZXN0LW5pbnRlbmRvLXN3aXRjaC1vbmxpbmUtbmVzLWdhbWVzLXRoZS1pbW1vcnRhbC1kYXJrLXNvdWxz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You need to play this ridiculously tough retro game on Nintendo Switch ASAP,"When he was 16 years old in 1983 Will Harvey sold Electronic Arts a program called Music Construction Set. The first sheet music editor for personal computers Harvey had built the program to integrate music into the video games he was making. The program was a hit and Harvey moved on to college where he continued to make video games. He wanted to revolutionize gaming with a relatively new medium—the internet which he saw as a natural place for multiplayer gaming.

That didn’t happen but what he ended up creating was a fascinating infuriating and addictive game. It’s unfair and made more so by the limitations of the Nintendo Switch. The Immortal is one of the most merciless games on the NES. Even so I kept coming back for more.

If you’re a paid Nintendo Switch online subscriber you can play The Immortal right now by downloading the Nintendo Entertainment System app.

The Immortal starts the player off in a small room in a dungeon lit by a lone candle. Next to the candle is a skull. Approaching the candle reveals to the players a lovely text box in old-world font:

An image of the old wizard Mordamir leaps from the candle and begins to speak: “Dunric you have come to save me. I am in the dungeons far below. I know I can count on you.” This explains your old teacher's mysterious disappearance but there is one thing strange about the message... YOUR NAME IS NOT DUNRIC.

Vivid descriptions hints of mystery and a wonderful twist at the end. Your wizard looks cool too a vivid sprite of grey robes and black shadow topped off by a red hat and holding a sick golden staff.

There are a few sunken tiles in the dungeon. Approach one of them and the game suddenly drops the mystic tone. A new text screen appears: “It might be a good idea to move.” And indeed it is because if you don’t move away instantly giant Dune-like worms will emerge from the dungeon and swallow you whole. Game over.

Electronic Arts

The game did offer a warning to be fair but it’s the first and last time that happens. What will happen again and again is dying through one of The Immortal’s seemingly endless traps.

Oh the things that can kill you in The Immortal. There are fireballs coming out of the walls fireballs coming from the floor various arrows impaling pikes bad-smelling spores (if you plant them they grow into a deadly fungus that make you explode) trap doors bats goblins trolls reading runes invisible enemies and bait which will call forth the aforementioned Dune-like worms.

The goblins and trolls offer special one-on-one fighting in a new screen with gorgeous 8-bit characters. These are duck-and-stab fights with a couple options for attack. At time the controls felt a little it feels particularly ridiculous to have them while fighting invisible characters but that’s what happens.

They will all kill you over and over to the extent that it’s easy to become curious about how you are going to die next on your quest to figure out who Dunric is. An old review of The Immortal in Computer Gaming World mentions that the game’s original manual actually included a guide for taking the player step-by-step through the first level and it’s a shame Nintendo was not able to upload a version of that guide. The Immortal is hard enough but having to figure out the gameplay from scratch made for an added hurdle. Looking up a walkthrough (like this one) is highly recommended.

Electronic Arts

In a retrospective interview Harvey notes that in the early 1980s “a single person could write a video game. A single person could do the music write code and do the artwork. As the video game industry grew it was no longer possible for one person to write an entire video game.”

While The Immortal was built with a small team there are signs of this tension all the game weak spots that could have been filled out with more eyes. While the terrain is hectic the levels are relatively simple moving from one door to another. At the time Computer Gaming World described The Immortal as an “intensely graphic action-adventure masquerading as a CRPG” noting how the game didn’t allow players any room for error when it came to solving their problems. There’s also a frustrating lack of save points a problem somewhat mitigated by the Switch’s ability to create Suspend Points.

Harvey eventually nixed the idea for an online Immortal in favor of the game’s plot which is filled with ancient lore betrayal Goblin Kings dragons and more. It’s very well-written and compelling on its own terms something that could stand alongside classic retro game plots like A Link To The Past and Super Metroid.

While it’s a game that could use some polish before being ported The Immortal is a classic example of how cruel those old games could be while being fun at the same time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8va3V3YWl0dGltZXMuY29tL3BhcmFkaXNlLWZvdW5kLWhhZGVzLW1ha2VyLXRha2VzLW9uLWdhbWluZy1nb2xpYXRoc9IBT2h0dHBzOi8va3V3YWl0dGltZXMuY29tL3BhcmFkaXNlLWZvdW5kLWhhZGVzLW1ha2VyLXRha2VzLW9uLWdhbWluZy1nb2xpYXRocy9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paradise found: Hades maker takes on gaming goliaths,"Paradise found: 'Hades' maker takes on gaming goliaths

This handout image courtesy of Supergiant Games shows artwork by art director Jen Zee from Hades video game. - AFP

SAN FRANCISCO: No work email after 5:00 pm on Fridays mandatory vacations: The outfit behind role-playing video game sensation ""Hades"" doesn't believe you have to go through hell to reach the top. Yet the tiny independent Supergiant's own-way approach seems to be working as it gains on the goliaths of the multibillion-dollar gaming industry.

""Hades"" snagged five honors this year at Britain's prestigious BAFTA Games Awards and is short-listed for a major Hugo science fiction prize. ""If what makes our games special is the particular people who work on them and how they work together then the whole studio culture needs to be about supporting that over the long term"" Supergiant co-founder Amir Rao told AFP.

In an industry slammed for punishing workloads and playing it safe with sequels to blockbusters Supergiant has focused on a love of old-school games. Unlike massive role-playing experiences with film-like graphics ""Hades"" is a ""dungeon crawler"" that challenges players to fight their way through chambers rife with demonic adversaries to escape the underworld. Graphics are akin to an animated cartoon starring a rebellious son of the Greek god Hades intent on escaping his disapproving father's domain. Characters in the game are based on Greek mythology with Rao's dog providing vocals for multi-headed hound Cerberus.

'Office' in parents' living room

That kind of DIY ethic arcs back to Rao and co-founder Gavin Simon leaving their jobs at video game giant Electronic Arts in 2009 and moving from Los Angeles to San Jose California to start Supergiant in the living room of Rao's childhood home. ""My dad said we should start a company when we were young just so if we failed we could find jobs two years later and it would all be okay"" Rao quipped at a 2019 game conference.

Supergiant launched with four Ikea desks pressed together in mid-2009. Within nine months seven friends were working on its first game ""Bastion"" a hit that gave the startup traction. The original cadre is at the heart of what is now a 23-person team with policies crafted to keep the team's mojo humming. ""We try to do things to save us from ourselves because we are the type of people who really like working with each other and the things we are working on"" Rao said.

Supergiant bans workers from sending emails after 5:00 pm on Fridays to prevent a domino effect of messages getting people involved in work on weekends. Employees have to take off at least 20 days a year to make sure they get breaks. The studio encourages accepting one's limits and understanding life comes with unexpected challenges according to Rao.

""For a lot of the people on the team it was actually harder when they weren't working"" he said of the pandemic's impact. ""Because that was when they were confronting more of what was going on in the wider world."" Remote work was already a norm at Supergiant when the coronavirus caused it to stop using its San Francisco office last year.

'Adapts to your skill'

Members of the team finished ""Hades"" from home leaving their city workplace to be hit by burglars in their absence. The team is now enjoying a post-""Hades"" respite its next project yet to be determined. In the meantime gamers are still burrowing in to the intricacies of the game. While immersive big-budget offerings present stories in rich detail the ""Hades"" narrative leaves much to the imagination.

And in ""Hades"" dying is part of the fun. ""If it's working really well when you die you are only very briefly disappointed because there's a whole bunch of other stuff that's about to happen"" said Rao. The game enables players to progress in their own ways and battles vary with each engagement. ""It adapts to your skill"" Lucas Garcia a California college student studying computing said of ""Hades"". ""It kept me feeling good at the game regardless of whether I sucked. It's definitely a big up-and-comer."" - AFP",,,,,,

The company does not disclose the names of specific customers but the company's CEO said West is ""involved with basically all the vaccines that are in the market.""

West Pharmaceutical Services Inc. is a Philadelphia-area company that most people have never heard of but more often than not one of its products is involved whenever someone gets a COVID-19 vaccine shot.

That’s because West’s leading products are rubber stoppers for vials that hold injectable medicines and rubber tips for syringe plungers. Even before the pandemic the Exton company one of many in the region that serve the pharmaceutical industry manufactured more than 40 billion of those and other components each year.

But now demand has skyrocketed along with the push to vaccinate billions of people around the world against COVID-19 — to the point that the firm expects to generate $260 million in revenue this year just from COVID-19-related products. Last year’s overall revenue was $2.1 billion.

“We’re involved with basically all the vaccines that are in the market” said Eric Green West’s chief executive.

West is among the Philadelphia-area companies playing a background role in the massive rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. PCI Pharma Services in Northeast Philadelphia labels and repackages vials of vaccine that are likely sealed with West stoppers. In Montgomery County Merck & Co. Inc. announced in March that it would help manufacture Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine which has suffered manufacturing issues elsewhere and has been put on hold while the government sorts out blood-clot concerns.

Because of the increased demand West is adding enough new equipment at factories in upstate Pennsylvania and North Carolina to double the company’s capacity for products used with vaccines. The first of the new machines — presses imported from central Europe that trim the molded plugs — were installed last year.

Additional machines are still being installed in Jersey Shore Pa. and are expected to reach full-scale production in the next few months. Green who wouldn’t say how many machines are being added told Wall Street that the additions were already planned over the next five years but moved up in response to the pandemic.

What’s the big deal about West’s rubber stoppers?

It’s the rubber’s coating which prevents interaction between the vaccine or other medication and the man-made rubber. Without the coating the drug might not work as designed.

“These are not just drop-in-the-box” items said David Bergerstock a West vice president. “These are manufactured in a clean-room environment. They are placed in ultraclean sterilizable bags and in some cases they are steam sterilized.”

Wall Street has rewarded West handsomely for that expertise. The company is worth about $10 billion more than it was at the beginning of the pandemic early last year. Its shares closed Thursday at $310.95 up from about $130 in March 2020.

Even before the pandemic West was doing well financially thanks to its leading position in the manufacturing of devices used to inject biological medicines. These require special care because they are often derived from living materials and are more sensitive to damage than traditional medications that are chemically synthesized.

West has a part in 7 of 10 injections anywhere in the world the company said. “We’re involved with basically all the vaccines that are in the market” Green said.

Green said one customer allows him to identify it and a specific product for which West makes an injector: Amgen’s Repatha which is a treatment for heart disease.

Aptar Stelmi and Datwyler a Swiss company that has a plants in Pennsauken and Middletown Del. are West’s two main competitors. Datwyler recently told a Swiss newspaper that it is the second-biggest producer behind West of stoppers and other components needed for injections.

West which got half of its $2.1 billion in revenue last year from overseas employed 9200 on Dec. 31. Of those employees 1200 are in Pennsylvania including 600 at the Jersey Shore factory where production is exploding. A second factory in Williamsport employs 130. Many of the remaining Pennsylvania employees work at the Exton headquarters or in research and development there.

Most of the new jobs in Jersey Shore are for technicians and operators in the molding trimming and packing areas. Starting pay with no experience is more than $17 an hour West said. The R&D division in Chester County looks for people with professional backgrounds in mechanical or biomedical engineering plastics engineering chemical engineering and material science.

Investment analysts such as John Kreger at William Blair are wrestling with whether to expect a drop in business for West and similar companies after the first big push on COVID-19 vaccines is over. “We suspect there will be a need for ongoing boosters to cover future variants but probably with a lower level of compliance” Kreger wrote in a recent note to clients.

West has deep roots in Philadelphia’s manufacturing past.

An accountant named Herman O. West cofounded it at 1117 Shackamaxon St. in Fishtown in 1923 as a manufacturer of rubber grinding wheels used in the dental trade.

West got the idea to go into manufacturing according to a company history while handling the books for S.S. White Co. a Center City dental instrument manufacturer whose building still stands at 12th and Chestnut Streets. Early on West and his partners manufactured droppers plungers and stoppers for the pharmaceutical industry. Insulin maker Eli Lilly & Co. was a major early customer.

West’s factories have moved away from the company’s Philadelphia roots but it retains an important tie to its manufacturing past. West has been making many of the molds for its stoppers and plungers and the sharp tools that trim them into their final shape in the same company-owned shop on West Chester Pike in Upper Darby since the 1940s.

“It’s fantastic that they are able to maintain that in-house tooling capability” said Bill Stockwell chief executive of Stockwell Elastomerics a Northeast Philadelphia company that works with similar materials as West but serves different sectors.

The 18 employees in West’s Upper Darby shop use high-tech machines to supply tooling for 16 of West’s 25 manufacturing sites said Bergerstock the West official who is the company’s global process engineer. A second shop in England supplies other factories.

From the DHHL:

The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) offered Hawaiʻi Island beneficiaries a Rent-With-Option-To-Purchase opportunity on Saturday April 17 2021.

Sixty homes initiated the project within the Villages of Laʻi ʻŌpua in Kealakehe Hawaiʻi Island.

DHHL hosted the lot selection meeting for pre-qualified beneficiaries at the Laʻi ʻŌpua Community Center as a walk-through event following social distancing and gathering guidelines including the use of a virtual portion of the meeting. A virtual orientation was held in January.

The first 60 homes a portion of the greater 118-unit Laʻi ʻŌpua Village 4 – ʻĀkau broke ground for vertical construction in 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. An additional 103 lots will be built subsequently to complete Laʻi ʻŌpua Village 4 – ʻĀkau and the current Laʻi ʻŌpua Village 5.

Laʻi ʻŌpua UI lessees who met the household income requirements and other selection criteria were given the first selection opportunity since they currently hold a lease for the Village of Laʻi ʻŌpua subdivision. Any rental units available after the UI’s selection were offered to applicants on DHHL’s Hawaiʻi Island Residential Waiting List based on their application date. Other requirements including household income and selection criteria set by the property management company also had to be met.

The Department’s Rent-With-Option-To-Purchase product targets qualifying families who earn up to 30 percent 40 percent and 60 percent of the area median income. This program differs from a rent-to-own product where rent will not contribute to the purchase of the home. Instead the tenant’s Area Median Income (AMI) level at the initial qualification to occupy the units will be the same AMI level used in determining the sale price at the end of the 15 years.

Producing a Rent-With-Option-To-Purchase program requires public and private partnerships to successfully deploy financing tools and tax credits. Laʻi ʻŌpua will use in part federal and state low-income housing tax credit equity secured by Hunt Capital Partners in collaboration with Ikaika ʻOhana and Urban Housing Communities. Coastal Construction Co. is acting as the project’s general contractor with architectural firm Design Partner Inc. ThirtyOne50 Management will function as the rental property manager.

“As we close in on the 100th centennial of the signing of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act our kuleana to provide an affordable entry point for native Hawaiians to return to their ancestral lands has never been more critical” said Deputy to the Chair Tyler Iokepa Gomes. “These types of public and private partnerships are a part of this administration’s push to create more diversified and affordable options for our beneficiaries.”

The project will provide affordable single-family rental homes for DHHL undivided interest lessees and waiting list applicants who may convert their rental into a 99-year homestead lease after 15 years.

In addition to the development in Kealakehe DHHL is in the process of developing several other Hawaiʻi Island projects including the upcoming offering of Vacant Lots in Discovery Harbor and the groundbreaking of its Subsistence Agricultural pilot projects in Honomū and Panaewa.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vcmVhbHR5LmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvcmV0YWlsLWFzc2V0cy1nZXQtNDg0LW1pbGxpb24tcGUtaW52ZXN0bWVudHMtaW4tcTEtcmVwb3J0LzgyMTI3MDEz0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly9yZWFsdHkuZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvcmV0YWlsLWFzc2V0cy1nZXQtNDg0LW1pbGxpb24tcGUtaW52ZXN0bWVudHMtaW4tcTEtcmVwb3J0LzgyMTI3MDEz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Retail assets get $484 million PE investments in Q1: Report,"Advt

MUMBAI: Retail assets recorded private equity investments of 484 million dollars during January to March (Q1 2021) up 120 per cent from 220 million dollars in Q1 2020 according to Knight Frank India However the jump can be attributed to a single large deal (equity) in Bengaluru between Blackstone and Prestige that involved multiple retail office and hospitality assets as a part of the larger transaction.Since 2011 the retail space has attracted 3.2 billion equity investments with 26 deals. The retail sector has been worst-affected segment in Covid-19 crisis said Knight Frank in its latest research report.The pandemic induced lockdown had forced several malls to shut down affecting their business adversely temporarily.""From 2011 to date around 34.4 million square feet of the retail space have been transacted in India and global investors are seen to be bullish on investing in ready and new development projects.""On the other hand residential sector witnessed seven deals worth 234 million dollars in Q1 2021 which was 64 per cent of the total investments that was witnessed during the entire 2020 and 38 per cent of that in 2019.In volume terms (number of deals) the investment activity touched 100 per cent of 2020 levels and 39 per cent of 2019 levels.With government interventions and other measures post the lockdown was lifted between Q2 and Q3 2020 all-India residential sales grew by 5 per cent year-on-year in Q4 2020 and by 44 per cent in Q1 2021.Mumbai took the largest quantum of residential investment (equity plus debt) worth 44 million dollars followed by the NCR with 55 million dollars and Chennai by 24 million dollars.Knight Frank said the investors' preference which had moved from equity to debt in the last decade has again tilted strongly in favour of equity in 2020 and Q1 2021 indicating a resurgence in risk appetite while participating in the next residential business cycle.However the trajectory of infection rate and severity of the current spate of lockdowns will determine the direction going forward.",,,,,,,,,

Giorgio Armani unveils Sì Eau De Parfum Intense an ever more intense and sophisticated interpretation of the classic feminine scent which encapsulates confidence and energy. Empowered and free the Sì woman dares to say Sì to the most intense part of herself.

Introduced in 2013 Sì is Giorgio Armani’s iconic women’s fragrance at once chic sensual and voluptuous. Fusing independence of spirit sophistication and serenity Sì celebrates the courage of women to write their own rules and embrace a life lived intensely.

Sì Eau De Parfum Intense is embodied by Academy Award-winning actress Cate Blanchett. In a new print campaign by photographer Tom Munro she conveys both timelessness and modernity.

Sì Eau De Parfum Intense is a chypre oriental fruity which inspires the Giorgio Armani woman with the confidence to explore her most intense side.

Created by perfumer Julie Massé of MANE who composed each of the Sì scents Sì Eau De Parfum Intense takes the Sì signature in an entrancing new direction. The fragrance’s top note is blackcurrant nectar a signature of the Sì fragrance family with this alluring note extracted from the core of the fruit. At the fragrance’s heart is Isparta rose harvested in Isparta a region of Turkey known as “the city of roses” and the velvety and liquorous davana. Together these two notes create a fiercely intense effect. At its base are patchouli and benzoin resin which both lend an enveloping sensation.

The vanilla blended in Sì Eau De Parfum Intense is sourced in the protected area of Loky Manambato in Madagascar in collaboration with a local NGO one of Giorgio Armani’s initiatives contributing to its social responsibility program ‘Solidarity Sourcing’. Aiming at ensuring the ethical sourcing of key ingredients and contributing to economically support farming communities it is in line with Giorgio Armani’s attention to detail preference for natural materials and respect for nature.

AN ICONIC DESIGN A NEW INTENSITY

Sì Eau De Parfum Intense is presented in the iconic distinctive Sì flacon structured yet simple as it effortlessly draws the eye to its tapered curves and organic cap.

The bottle is dressed in an outer lacquer resulting in a transparent deep nude tint. Meanwhile a black outer lacquer at the bottle’s base infuses the nude glass with a gently smoldering effect nodding to the fragrance’s elegant intensity. The glossy black stone-shaped cap is a signature of the Sì fragrances as are the sleek gold rings around the bottle’s neck and at its base which lend a glamorous touch.

THE Sì COLLECTION

Following the introduction of Sì Eau De Parfum Intense the Sì fragrance collection now encompasses five distinguished fragrances conveying different facets of the Sì vision of femininity: Sì Eau De Parfum Sì Passione Eau De Parfum Sì Eau De Parfum Fiori Sì Eau De Parfum Intense.

Everest,"Amid a second wave of COVID-19 infections hundreds of climbers are set to scale the world’s tallest mountain.

Amid fears of a second wave of COVID-19 hundreds of climbers from many countries are all set to ascend Mt. Everest and other mountains in this spring season.

With its lockdown lifted and vaccine program underway – although it has yet to reach the general public – Nepal decided to reopen Mt. Everest and other mountains for this year’s climbing season. Icefall doctors are currently working to open the Everest route.

This year will mark the first ascents after a re-measurement and the announcement of Mt. Everest’s new confirmed height: 8848.86 meters. It will also see the first climbs made during the coronavirus pandemic.

Like other sectors mountaineering was badly hit in 2020 with zero climbing records on Mt. Everest last year. For comparison 2019 was a crowded year with 300 climbers and 15 deaths.

As of April 13 the number of people who have received permission to climb Mt. Everest this spring has reached 321 according to Mira Acharya director at Nepal’s Department of Tourism a government body mandated to regulate and issue permits for climbers. The number is likely to go up as the department is still examining the applications submitted by aspirants.

There are also some high profile climbers for this season. For example Prince of Bahrain Sheikh Mohamed Hamad Mohamed al-Khalifa has received permits for climbing Mt. Everest. According to the Department of Tourism the prince was the first person to receive permission this year.

In order to attract tourists Nepal government has taken numerous measures including relaxing its visa application process. Even amid fear of COVID-19 there were some climbers in the winter season which sent out a positive message to the international arena.

But there are still fears of a second wave of COVID-19 transmission as the number of cases has jumped in India in recent weeks. The soaring case count in India is a matter of grave concern to Nepal due to their shared open border. Similarly the number of infected people is going up in Nepal as well although with daily cases in the 400-500 range it is still at roughly one-tenth of the country’s peak last fall. The upward trend however is likely to affect the climbing season.

Authorities say they are making efforts to ensure the safety of climbers. Unlike previous years there are various rules related to health safety that climbers must obey.

The government is also preparing to deploy more medical teams in base camp and some places in between base camp and Namche Bazar the town that serves as a departure point for Everest expeditions. “This is first time that we are deploying doctors in the field” Acharya said.

Climbers must provide a negative COVID-19 test before landing in Nepal and should stay in quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. Climbers must also make a self-declaration stating that their health condition is fit for climbing.

This season climbers will have to bear some additional costs because COVID-19 insurance is mandatory. Every climber and all their team members must purchase insurance for $5000 before coming to Nepal.

Similarly after videos and photos of the crowded final ascent sparked media coverage in 2019 there are some new provisions about photos and videos taken while climbing. Expedition teams can take photos and videos for their own private use but are not allowed to use those images for other purposes unless given prior approval from the ministry.

The reopening of climbing season is expected to boost Nepal’s tourism industry which was badly hit by COVID-19.",,,,,,,,,,,,

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. electricity companies wrote to President Joe Biden this week saying it will work with his administration and Congress to design a broad set of policies to reach a near-term goal of slashing the sector's carbon emissions by 2030.

Washington should implement policies including a clean energy standard or CES to ensure the electricity industry cuts carbon emissions 80% below 2005 levels by 2030 the group of 13 power interests including generators Exelon Corp PSEG and Talen Energy Corp said in a letter to Biden.

The letter a copy of which was seen by Reuters did not mention Biden's goal to fully decarbonize the power sector by 2035 as part of his strategy to fight climate change. But it said the 2030 timeline is consistent with Biden's wider goal of decarbonizing the entire economy by 2050.

""A federal policy framework can be designed to support the power sector’s deployment of strategies that are technically feasible ensure reliability and maintain affordability for customers"" said the letter sent to Biden on Friday.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The 2030 goal was consistent with Evergreen Action an advocacy group that proposed a CES in February. Sam Ricketts a co-founder said utilities should worry less about the 2035 goal and focus on early wins as the last portion of emissions cuts is the hardest to achieve.

Several lawmakers including Democrats U.S. Representative Frank Pallone and Senator Tina Smith have introduced legislation that includes a CES.

The standard would set gradually rising targets for the power industry to cut emissions until they hit net-zero with a range of methods from adopting wind and solar power using existing and advanced nuclear energy or sucking up carbon from coal and natural gas plants before they reach the atmosphere.

The White House this month included a CES in its $2.3 trillion infrastructure package without detailing how it would work.

Some plans for a CES include flexibilities such as allowing utilities to earn bankable credits for over-achieving in early years that could be used for compliance in later years when progress on cutting emissions becomes more difficult.

This apartment by interior designer Joey Khu is one example. A married couple in their thirties live in this 990 sq ft two-bedroom apartment in the west of Singapore. It is smaller than their former three-bedroom condominium unit.

Opposition Leader Joseph Harmon has asked the President of ExxonMobil Guyana Alistair Routledge for a meeting to discuss a timetable to fix malfunctioning equipment aboard the Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel  Liza Destiny.

In a letter dispatched to Mr. Routledge the Guyanese Opposition Leader wants the American oil major to also explain what the problem with the discharge silencer and what impact that would have on earnings and the environment.

“I therefore seek an urgent meeting with you and your executive team at the earliest mutually convenient opportunity to be briefed on matters to include this recent development the root cause(s) of equipment failures resulting in excessive flaring and reduced production your plan with schedule for permanently addressing these root cause(s) and the short and long term economic and environmental implications for all of Guyana” he said in the letter that his secretariat released to the media.

ExxonMobil last week informed government that it had cut production from 120000 barrels per day to 30000 barrels per day after the gas silencer developed problems after the installation and testing of the already troublesome flash gas compressor aboard the Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel (FPSO) Liza Destiny.

Since ExxonMobil began commercial oil production in December 2019 the FPSO has been dogged by problems leading to a reduction in production twice and an increase in gas flaring.

The Opposition Leader told the ExxonMobil Guyana President that his request for a meeting stems from concerns by supporters of A Partnership for National Unity+Alliance For Change (APNU+AFC) civil society and the wider Guyanese public about the prolonged problems facing the company in getting its oil production systems up to the required standards. “I am in receipt of numerous queries from our constituents civil society and concerned citizens expressing their worry that EEPGL’s (Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited’s) performance since inception appear to be far below expectations and is eroding their confidence in a safe and environmentally sound operation. Similar queries have been received by my colleague Members of Parliament and my office” said Mr. Harmon. EEPGL is the locally-registered ExxonMobil-controlled company with the other partners being Hess Corporation and China National Overseas Oil Company (CNOOC).

The Ministry of Natural Resources has said cautioned that it would take steps to protect Guyana’s national interests even as it joined ExxonMobil in raising concerns about the failure so far to properly remedy the technical issues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc21vZy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xOC90aGUtZ3JlZW53YXNoaW5nLWZpbGVzLWZvc3NpbC1mdWVsLWNvbXBhbmllcy1hZHZlcnRpc2luZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Greenwashing Files: Fossil Fuel Giants Accused of 'Deceptive' Advertising,"Fossil fuel companies could face legal challenges over their misleading advertising after a DeSmog investigation uncovered the extent of their “greenwashing”.

Environmental lawyers ClientEarth have put companies on notice with the publication of the Greenwashing Files. The analyses which use DeSmog’s research show how adverts of major fossil fuel companies and energy producers continue to over-emphasise their green credentials giving the public a misleading impression of their businesses.

DeSmog analysed the advertising output of Aramco Chevron Drax Equinor ExxonMobil Ineos RWE Shell and Total and compared this with the reality of the companies’ current and future business activities.

ClientEarth submitted a complaint against BP’s advertising in 2019 before the company decided to withdraw its “Possibilities Everywhere” campaign. The lawyers say other fossil fuel companies could face similar challenges if they mislead the public through their advertising. The group is calling for tobacco-style advertising bans and health warnings to counter fossil fuel companies’ “deceptive” marketing.

DeSmog’s investigation found messaging that touts companies’ climate pledges without being transparent about their large emissions contributions is widespread across advertising campaigns and social media promotions.

The adverts regularly highlight the companies’ preferred solutions to climate change — from carbon capture and storage to experimental algae biofuels and investment in renewable energy sources — without being open about the small percentage of overall investment allocated to these technologies nor their various limitations.

The Greenwashing Files lay bare the contrast between the public image these adverts create and the reality of the fossil fuel companies’ activities.

All companies featured in this article were contacted for comment.

ExxonMobil – “Powering Progress”

“We’re working on ways to provide energy while addressing the risks of climate change producing clean-burning natural gas to reduce emissions from power plants capturing CO2 before it reaches the atmosphere and exploring unexpected energy sources like biofuels made from algae” a reassuring voice tells us in Exxon’s “Powering Progress” advert – one of several released in recent years that present the US oil giant as a leader in green technologies.

But while the ad shows Exxon scientists hard at work developing “algae farms” and technology designed to suck carbon dioxide from the air its business activities tell a different story.

Exxon is increasingly an outlier among fossil fuel companies and other major emitters having refused to set an absolute emissions reduction target opting instead for gradual “carbon intensity” reductions which still allow for overall emissions to increase. It has no plans to cut oil and gas production which energy analysts say is urgently needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.

While Exxon remains responsible for a significant portion of global emissions – with documents in 2019 revealing a total annual output roughly equivalent to that of Canada – its spending on clean energies has been a tiny fraction of its investments with just 0.2 percent of its investment in new projects going to low carbon sources between 2010 and 2018.

And while “Powering Progress” and other ads put Exxon’s investments in algae biofuels at the fore it has spent just $300 million on the technology in a decade compared with yearly capital investment of around $20 billion. Experts doubt whether the technology will ever be commercially viable or usable at scale.

RWE – “We are the new RWE”

A video by German energy giant RWE takes the viewer through landmark inventions that have spurred on human civilisation since the industrial revolution – the light bulb the radio mass transport – before arriving at the present day. “Every time has its energy” the ad tells us adding that “times are changing. Society is changing. Companies are changing and we are changing too.”

The images cut to wind turbines and the forces of nature that are powering what we are told is today’s “renewable age.” The company positions itself at the heart of this transition telling the viewer it is “focussing on renewable energies and storage for a sustainable world” and that it is providing “clean reliable and affordable” energy as part of its transition to “the new RWE.”

The campaign accompanies pledges to become “carbon neutral” by 2040 and oversee a significant expansion into wind and solar energy.

But the growth of RWE’s low-carbon activities has not been matched by an exit from fossil fuels. RWE remains the largest emitter in Europe according to a recent study by Greenpeace and its three major lignite coal-fired power stations all feature in the EU’s top five highest-emitting plants. Under current plans it will continue to generate coal-fired electricity until the end of 2038 almost a decade after the deadline recommended for OECD countries by climate experts at the same time as expanding its already significant fossil gas business.

Despite its claims to focus on clean energy 80 percent of the company’s energy still comes from non-renewable sources mostly highly-polluting brown coal hard coal and gas. The company also counts controversial and carbon-intensive biomass amongst its “renewable” energy sources despite warnings from scientists over its use.

Drax – “Beyond Coal”

Drax another energy company that now relies heavily on biomass and operates the UK’s largest power station in North Yorkshire has worked hard to bolster its green credentials in recent years positioning itself as an ally in the fight against climate change.

Last year it released an advert celebrating the company’s shift away from coal-fired energy production which it completed in March. Set to an uplifting soundtrack the video calls the move a “major step towards Drax’s ambition to become carbon negative by 2030” while touting a new “Zero Carbon Skills Taskforce” to ensure the surrounding area “isn’t defined by its past but by its future”.

A 2020 year-in-review video meanwhile describes Drax as “among Europe’s lowest carbon intensity power generators” producing “77 percent renewable electricity”.

But the company’s claims about the climate-friendliness of biomass which has now taken over from coal as the principal source of energy at its power station thanks to generous government subsidies have been widely disputed. Burning wood pellets has been found to be more carbon-intensive than fossil fuels in most circumstances while experts doubt that trees planted in their place can re-absorb the carbon dioxide emitted on a meaningful timescale.

Carbon capture and storage – another key plank of Drax’s low-carbon strategy – remains uneconomical at scale with the company’s own use of the technology still in the pilot phase.

In response to questions from DeSmog Drax said emissions from biomass energy are “already accounted for in the land-use sector and therefore considered carbon neutral at the point of combustion” in line with “established global best practice” set out by the UN IPCC.

It also said biomass should be considered renewable “because the forests we source from are growing and storing more carbon” and pointed to its plans for a bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) unit by 2027 “creating tens of thousands of jobs” and “permanently removing millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year”.

Aramco – “The Moment is Now”

The Saudi Arabian state-owned oil and gas giant Aramco became the most valuable listed company in history when it floated on the stock market at the end of 2019. But the fossil fuel behemoth is at pains to assure viewers it is concerned about more than just its bottom line.

In an advert entitled “The Moment is Now” an Aramco employee tells a lecture theatre full of colleagues that “as we open up to the world we know more than ever before that we must continue towards a sustainable future”.

“We value the natural resources we discover but never forget it is our human energy that drives us to create a better world” she says to the audience who reward her presentation with a standing ovation.

Elsewhere the company insists it is driven by a “commitment to preserving the environment because protecting our planet is one of our most important values.”

That’s despite the company being the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitter responsible for an estimated four percent of all global emissions since 1965.

Aramco’s oil and gas reserves total more than those of ExxonMobil Chevron Shell BP and Total combined while the company refuses to disclose its full emissions. Its majority shareholder the Saudi Arabian government has been at the forefront of efforts to stall international action on climate change for decades. At the last UN climate talks in Madrid over a third of Saudi Arabia’s representatives were associated with the oil and gas industry many with Aramco.

Equinor – “This is what changed us”

Previously trading under the name Statoil the Norwegian state-owned oil and gas company Equinor rebranded in 2018 with the hope of highlighting its transformation into a “broad energy company” and its growing low-carbon energy division.

Equinor explained its reasons for the name change in an advert called “Equinor. This is what changed us.” Scenes of raging storms and melting ice caps are displayed while the narrator says: “Some changes are so profound that they transcend everything. Changes that require us to find a new balance.”

In a more recent ad the company insists that “emissions must come down and it must happen fast”.

Equinor is certainly taking steps to increase its investments in low-carbon technologies with plans to up its renewable energy capacity to 4-6 gigawatts by 2026 and has set a “net zero” emissions target for 2050.

But this shift is largely in addition to rather than in place of its core oil and gas business. The company is still exploring for more oil and gas reserves and does not intend to start reducing its fossil fuel production before 2030. Last year it opened the largest oil field in Western Europe and is heavily involved in ventures in the Arctic.

Equinor promotes natural gas as the “perfect fuel to balance renewable energy” and was given a warning two years ago by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority for claiming the fuel was a “low-carbon” energy source.

Another technology the company touts is carbon capture and storage (CCS) but all of the projects it is involved in currently amount to less than three percent of its overall emissions.

Greenwashing Files

ClientEarth lawyer Johnny White said the collection of adverts showed the fossil fuel companies were involved in a “great deception”.

“We need to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. But instead of leading a low-carbon transition these companies are putting out advertising which distracts the public and launders their image” he said.

“These adverts are misrepresenting the true nature of companies’ businesses of their contribution to climate change and of their transition plans” he added saying that “we cannot underestimate the real world impact this advertising has on the pace of change.”

8 killed in mass shooting at Indianapolis FedEx facility; suspect 19 was former employee

Eight people were shot dead and several others were injured in a mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis Thursday night according to authorities.

The suspect 19-year-old Brandon Hole -- who FedEx says was an employee at the facility from August to October 2020 -- was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound Craig McCartt deputy chief of Criminal Investigations at Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said at a Friday news conference. He was armed with a rifle McCartt said.

When officers arrived at the FedEx facility near the Indianapolis airport just after 11 p.m. they found a ""chaotic and active crime scene"" McCartt said.

""This suspect came to the facility ... he got out of his car and pretty quickly started some random shooting outside the facility. There was no confrontation with anyone"" McCartt said. ""That began in the parking lot and then he did go into the building.""

Four victims were found outside and four were inside police said. They ranged in age from 19 to 74.

Those killed were identified Friday night by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department as Matthew R Alexander 32; Samaria Blackwell 19; Amarjeet Johal 66; Jaswinder Kaur 64; Jaswinder Singh 68; Amarjit Sekhon 48; Karli Smith 19; and John Weisert 74.

Five surviving victims suffered injuries consistent with gunshot wounds and two others had minor injuries McCartt said.

Hole last worked at FedEx in 2020 McCartt said.

""We can confirm that the perpetrator was a former employee at the facility"" FedEx said. The company deferred further information to the police.

Police said they do not have a motive.

There is no indication that the shooting is connected to terrorism two law enforcement officials told ABC News.

In March 2020 Hole's mother ""contacted law enforcement to report he might try to commit 'suicide by cop'"" Paul Keenan special agent in charge of the FBI's Indianapolis field office said in a statement. ""The suspect was placed on an immediate detention mental health temporary hold by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department.""

A shotgun was taken from Hole's home and ""based on items observed in the suspect’s bedroom at that time he was interviewed by the FBI in April 2020"" Keenan said.

""No Racially Motivated Violent Extremism (RMVE) ideology was identified during the course of the assessment and no criminal violation was found"" Keenan said. ""The shotgun was not returned to the suspect.""

The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department on Monday night issued an updated press release regarding the shooting and an incident report from the search they performed of suspect Hole’s home in March of 2020. The report includes a testimony from an officer who said he saw what seemed like white suprematist websites on Hole's computer. Police haven’t commented further on what was in the report and have not yet discussed a motive in the killings.

About 100 employees were in the vicinity of the FedEx facility at the time of the shooting according to the company. Many employees were changing shifts or on their dinner break at the time McCartt said.

""Our most heartfelt sympathies are with all those affected by this senseless act of violence"" FedEx said. ""The safety of our team members is our top priority and we are fully cooperating with investigating authorities.""

FedEx told ABC News that no COVID-19 vaccine shipments were impacted by the shooting.

Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said in a statement Friday ""This morning Indianapolis residents are confronted with the horrific news of yet another mass shooting an act of violence that senselessly claimed the lives of eight of our neighbors.""

""As law enforcement works to learn more about this tragedy our prayers are with the families of those whose lives were cut short"" Hogsett said.

The mayor said at the Friday news conference ""We must guard against resignation or even despair. The assumption that this is simply how it must be and we might as well get used to it -- we need the courage that compels courageous acts that push past weariness.""

In a statement President Joe Biden called the shooting ""just the latest in a string of tragedies following closely after gunmen firing bullets in broad day light at spas in and around Atlanta Georgia a grocery store in Boulder Colorado a home in Rock Hill South Carolina and so many other shootings.""

""It’s a mass shooting just a week after we met in the Rose Garden with families who lost children and dear friends as bullets pierced their bodies and souls in schools a night club in a car at a gas station and a town meeting at a grocery store. And it came just the night before 14th anniversary of the shooting at Virginia Tech in which a gunman murdered 32 people"" Biden said.

""Last night and into the morning in Indianapolis yet again families had to wait to hear word about the fate of their loved ones. What a cruel wait and fate that has become too normal and happens every day somewhere in our nation"" Biden said.

He went on ""Last week I called on the Justice Department to better protect Americans from gun violence. I also urged Congress to hear the call of the American people -- including the vast majority of gun owners -- to enact commonsense gun violence prevention legislation like universal background checks and a ban of weapons of war and high-capacity magazines. Too many Americans are dying every single day from gun violence. It stains our character and pierces the very soul of our nation. We can and must do more to act and to save lives.""

Biden once again ordered White House flags to be lowered to half-staff as he has done following other mass shootings.

Vice President Kamala Harris said Friday ""Yet again we have families in our country that are grieving the loss of their family members because of gun violence.""

Here's why.,"Despite complaints from some employees and their families after a mass shooting Thursday night at a FedEx center in Indianapolis the company has no plans to change its policy banning cell phones in its sorting and packaging plants which some shipping consultants said is the right approach.

""Our cell phone policy is based on workplace safety considerations and we believe continues to be in the best interests of our team members while they are on duty” FedEx spokesman Chris Allen said in a written statement Saturday to IndyStar declining to elaborate or say whether other security precautions are being reviewed.

The company doesn't allow workers except for ""authorized team members"" Allen said to bring phones in the FedEx ground facility near the Indianapolis International Airport where eight people were killed by a former employee.

After the shooting employees were bused to a nearby hotel while police sealed off their workspace which was considered a crime scene. The workers weren't allowed to retrieve their phones from their cars in the parking lot before they left.

City in mourning:FedEx shooting 'a devastating blow' to an already grieving Indianapolis

That meant their loved ones who saw news of the mass shooting couldn’t reach them to learn if they were safe.

Prohibiting cell phones inside busy operation centers helps to prevent workplace accidents Satish Jindel president of SJ Consulting Group and ShipMatrix said.

“Cell phones can be a distraction that harms employees or hurts others” Jindel said. “You establish your procedures for day-to-day operations. You don’t plan them for mass shootings.”

The FedEx Indianapolis hub has 4000 workers at several facilities who work with heavy assembly line equipment. An inattentive worker in one part of the chain could cause problems in another Jindel said.

Even if cell phones were allowed as long as they are turned off and the great majority of the workers followed the rules a few scofflaws could cause large problems he said.

“A supervisor then has to spend time running around to tell someone to put the cell phone away” Jindel said. “It could shut down a whole assembly line.”

Dean Maciuba a managing partner with shipping consultant Half Mile Experts said he understands the employees' frustrations.

But he said he agrees with the company's stance.

“Those are dangerous places” said Maciuba who worked at FedEx for 35 years. “There are all sorts of belts and chains and lifts and packages flying around. If you are not alert someone could get hurt.”

“I think it is entirely a safety issue and not one about refusing to sacrifice productivity. The liability is too great.”

The airport Ground Operation was closed Saturday and has been temporarily suspended Allen said.

The company issued a statement Friday that said grief counselors were available to Indianapolis employees and that company representatives were “in close contact with the families of all those affected.”

There were about 100 employees at the facility when the shooting occurred according to law enforcement officials.

Police arrived “to a very chaotic scene with victims and witnesses running everywhere” at a FedEx Ground facility near Indianapolis’ main airport late Thursday night where a former employee shot and killed eight people and wounded several others an Indianapolis police official told CNN.

Deputy Chief Craig McCartt on Friday afternoon identified the gunman as 19-year-old Brandon Hole who was last employed by FedEx in 2020.

Hole was found dead of a gunshot wound that appeared to be self-inflicted McCartt said.

In March 2020 Hole’s mother told law enforcement that he might attempt “suicide by cop” the FBI’s Indianapolis office said in a statement.

Special Agent in Charge Paul Keenan said Hole was placed on an immediate mental health temporary hold by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. He also said a shotgun was seized at Hole’s residence.

“Based on items observed in the suspect’s bedroom at that time he was interviewed by the FBI in April 2020” the statement said. “No Racially Motivated Violent Extremism (RMVE) ideology was identified during the course of the assessment and no criminal violation was found. The shotgun was not returned to the suspect.”

McCartt told reporters that Indianapolis police found Hole’s name in two past incident reports. The deputy chief didn’t have information about the first report. The details he described from a 2020 report align with the FBI statement.

Investigators are trying to determine motive and were searching what they believe is the suspected gunman’s home Keenan told reporters late Friday morning.

When asked what brought the suspected gunman to the FedEx facility Thursday around 11 p.m. McCartt said: “I wish we could answer that.”

On Friday evening Indianapolis police released the names of the eight deceased victims. They are: Matthew R. Alexander 32; Samaria Blackwell 19; Amarjeet Johal 66; Jaswinder Kaur 64; Jaswinder Singh 68; Amarjit Sekhon 48; Karli Smith 19; and John Weisert 74.

A statement by IMPD said the next of kin has been notified by the Marion County Coroner’s Office. The cause of death will be determined after autopsies are complete according to the statement.

IMPD said the names of those injured are not being released.

The mass shooting is the country’s deadliest since 10 people were killed March 22 at a grocery store in Boulder Colorado.

Thursday night’s killings began when a gunman “got out of his car and pretty quickly started some random shooting outside the facility” McCartt said.

The gunman then “went inside and did not get very far into the facility at all” while shooting others there McCartt told CNN earlier Friday.

Laveda Chester told CNN’s “OutFront with Erin Burnett” that she was arriving for her overnight shift when she heard one pop and thought it might be a car accident. She said she looked around and didn’t see one. But then she saw the gunman running toward the building with a rifle in his hand.

She waited until he went in so she could drive away without drawing the gunman’s attention. She went to another parking lot and called police. She said she then tried to warn other arriving workers that there was a shooting going on. Some stopped and some drove past her.

Two employees inside the building at the time heard as many as 10 gunshots they told CNN affiliate WISH. The men left the building and watched as about 30 police cars responded they said.

“Thank God for being here because I thought I was going to get shot” one of them Jeremiah Miller told WISH.

Investigators have heard the shooting lasted “just a couple minutes – that it did not last very long” McCartt said.

“My understanding is by the time that officers entered … the situation was over – that the suspect took his life very shortly before officers entered the facility” McCartt told reporters.

There were at least 100 people in the facility when the shooting began he said. Many were on their dinner break or changing shifts.

Four people were found dead outside and four others not counting the shooter were dead inside McCartt said.

The incident marks at least the 45th mass shooting in the United States since the Atlanta-area spa shootings on March 16. CNN considers an incident to be a mass shooting if four or more people excluding the gunman are wounded or killed by gunfire.

President Joe Biden ordered flags at federal facilities to be lowered to half-staff and urged Congress to act on firearm legislation calling gun violence an “epidemic.”

Several people wounded

McCartt said four survivors were taken to a hospital with gunshot wounds and a fifth person sought treatment in another county for a gunshot wound. Two people were treated at the scene he said.

The gunman had at least one weapon which investigators believe was a rifle McCartt told reporters.

Police early Friday were trying to make sense of the crime scene while relatives of FedEx employees gathered at a nearby hotel which officials offered as a place where they could await news reunite with the workers and meet with police chaplains.

“Many of the employees did not have cell phones on them in the facility” and so many survivors were not immediately able to contact their families McCartt told CNN.

Several people tearfully embraced as they reunited Friday morning at the hotel video from CNN affiliate WISH showed.

When asked Friday morning whether witnesses indicated that FedEx or security personnel had any indication that something like Friday’s shooting would happen McCartt said no.

“We’re still working with FedEx security for anything that might have been an indication this was going to happen right now” McCartt said at the Friday morning news conference.

‘They didn’t sound like gunshots at first’

FedEx worker Timothy Boillat and his coworker heard what they thought initially were “two loud metal clangs” when the shooting started he told CNN affiliate WRTV.

“They didn’t sound like gunshots at first … Then we heard three more shots and then my buddy … saw someone running out of the building.” Boillat said.

“And then more shots went off. Somebody went behind their car to the trunk and got another gun” Boillat said without saying whether that person was the shooter.

“And then I saw one body on the floor” Boillat told WRTV.

Police are asking anyone who was at the scene and may have left for safety or for medical treatment to contact them to provide information on the shooting.

Governor and other officials offer condolences

Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said the process of healing will be impacted in part by what conversations the nation has about cycles of violence “driven by readily accessible guns.”

“We must guard against resignation or even despair – the assumption that this is simply how it must be and that we might as well get used to it. We need the courage that compels courageous acts that push past weariness” Hogsett said.

FedEx released a statement saying it was “deeply shocked and saddened by the loss of our team members.”

“Our most heartfelt sympathies are with all those affected by this senseless act of violence. The safety of our team members is our top priority and we are fully cooperating with investigating authorities” FedEx said.

Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb said Friday is “another heartbreaking day and I’m shaken by the mass shooting at the FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis.”

“In times like this words like justice and sorrow fall short in response for those senselessly taken. Our thoughts are with the families friends coworkers and all those affected by this terrible situation” Holcomb said.

Flags will be lowered to half-staff from Friday until sunset Tuesday “in remembrance of those we’ve lost” Holcomb said.

“Nothing we learn can heal the wounds of those who escaped with their lives but who will now … endure the memories of this horrific crime” Hogsett said.

US Rep. Andre Carson whose district includes Indianapolis tweeted that he was heartbroken by the mass shooting.

“I am communicating with local authorities to get all details of the attack and my office stands ready to help everyone affected any way we can” he said.

Correction: A previous version of this article misstated the names of Amarjit Sekhon and Karli Smith based on information provided by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2dlbmVyYWwtbmV3cy1yZWxpZ2lvbi1zaG9vdGluZ3MtaW5kaWFuYS1pbmRpYW5hcG9saXMtM2U0ZDVmMTg4NWRlNmUzZTY2NjYyMDBkMGExMWQxMzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four Sikhs among victims of Indianapolis mass shooting,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Amarjit Sekhon a 48-year-old mother of two sons was the breadwinner of her family and one of many members of Indianapolis’ tight knit Sikh community employed at a FedEx warehouse on the city’s southwest side.

Her death Thursday night in a mass shooting that claimed the lives of seven other FedEx employees — four of them Sikhs — has left that community stunned and in mourning her brother-in-law Kuldip Sekhon said Saturday.

He said his sister-in-law began working at the FedEx facility in November - after previously working at a bakery - and was a dedicated worker whose husband was disabled.

“She was a workaholic she always was working working” he said. “She would never sit still ... the other day she had the (COVID-19) shot and she was really sick but she still went to work.”

In addition to Sekhon the Marion County Coroner’s office identified the dead late Friday as: Matthew R. Alexander 32; Samaria Blackwell 19; Amarjeet Johal 66; Jasvinder Kaur 50; Jaswinder Singh 68; Karli Smith 19; and John Weisert 74.

Police said Brandon Scott Hole 19 apparently began firing randomly at people in the parking lot of the FedEx facility killing four before entering the building fatally shooting four more people and then turning the gun on himself. Authorities have not publicly speculated on a motive.

The killings marked the latest in a string of recent mass shootings across the country and the third mass shooting this year in Indianapolis.

Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt said Hole was a former employee of FedEx and last worked for the company in 2020. He said he did not know why Hole left the job or if he had ties to the workers in the facility.

About 90% of the workers at the FedEx warehouse near the Indianapolis International Airport are members of the local Sikh community Indianapolis Police Chief Randal Taylor said Friday.

Kuldip Sekhon said his family lost another relative in the shooting — Kaur who was his son’s mother-in-law. He said both Kaur and Amarjit Sekhon began working at the FedEx facility at the same time last November.

Komal Chohan who said Amarjeet Johal was her grandmother said in a statement issued by the Sikh Coalition that her family members including several who work at the FedEx warehouse are “traumatized” by the killings.

“My nani my family and our families should not feel unsafe at work at their place of worship or anywhere. Enough is enough — our community has been through enough trauma” she said in the statement.

There are between 8000 and 10000 Sikh Americans in Indiana according to the coalition. Members of the religion which began in India in the 15th century began settling in Indiana more than 50 years ago and opened their first house of worship known as a gurdwara in 1999.

The attack was another blow to the Asian American community a month after six people of Asian descent were killed in a mass shooting in the Atlanta area and amid ongoing attacks against Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic.

The shooting comes the week Sikhs are celebrating Vaisakhi a major holiday festival that among other things marks the date Sikhism was born as a collective faith.

Tejpaul Singh Bainiwal of Stockton California - who participated in a martial arts tournament in Indiana where the local gurdwara was host - said this year’s holiday celebrations would be intensely somber.

“How do you celebrate after something like this?” he said.

Satjeet Kaur the Sikh Coalition’s executive director said the entire community was traumatized by the “senseless” violence.

“While we don’t yet know the motive of the shooter he targeted a facility known to be heavily populated by Sikh employees” Kaur said.

The coalition says about 500000 Sikhs live in the U.S. Many practicing Sikhs are visually distinguishable by their articles of faith which include the unshorn hair and turban.

The shooting is the deadliest incident of violence collectively in the Sikh community in the U.S. since 2012 when a white supremacist burst into a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and shot 10 people with seven dying. That gunman killed himself during a firefight with police.

Paul Keenan special agent in charge of the FBI’s Indianapolis field office said Friday that agents questioned Hole last year after his mother called police to say that her son might commit “suicide by cop.” He said the FBI was called after items were found in Hole’s bedroom but he did not elaborate on what they were. He said agents found no evidence of a crime and that they did not identify Hole as espousing a racially motivated ideology.

A police report obtained by The Associated Press shows that officers seized a pump-action shotgun from Hole’s home after responding to the mother’s call. Keenan said the gun was never returned.

Indianapolis police said Friday that Hole opened fire with a rifle.

Samaria Blackwell of Indianapolis was a soccer and basketball player who last year graduated from Indy Genesis a Christian competitive sports organization for homeschooled students. Her parents said Saturday in a statement that she was an outgoing “people person” — the youngest of four children who will be missed “immensely” by them and her dog Jasper.

“As an intelligent straight A student Samaria could have done anything she chose to put her mind to and because she loved helping people she dreamed of becoming a police officer. Although that dream has been cut short we believe that right now she is rejoicing in heaven with her Savior” they said.

Family friends have organized a fundraiser for the Blackwell family to assist with funeral expenses.

Several dozen people gathered at the Olivet Missionary Baptist Church on the city’s west side Saturday afternoon to mourn and to call for action.

“The system failed our state the other night” said Cathy Weinmann a volunteer with Moms Demand Action. “That young man should have never had access to a gun … we will not accept this and we demand better than this for our community.”

Updated April 17 at 8:58 p.m.

Indianapolis police and the FBI continue to investigate why a 19-year-old man opened fire at a FedEx facility on the city's southwest side killing eight people and injuring several others.

IMPD identified the gunman Friday afternoon as Brandon Scott Hole of Indiana. He was a former employee at the FedEx facility.

On Saturday Hole's family declined interview requests but issued a statement apologizing:

“We are devastated at the loss of life caused as a result of Brandon’s actions; through the love of his family we tried to get him the help he needed. Our sincerest and most heartfelt apologies go out to the victims of this senseless tragedy. We are so sorry for the pain and hurt being felt by their families and the entire Indianapolis community.""

Friday night Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department and the Marion County Coroner’s Office released the names of those killed in Thursday's shooting. Police said those who died were:

Matthew R Alexander 32

Samaria Blackwell 19

Amarjeet Johal 66

Jasvinder Kaur 50

Jaswinder Singh 68

Amarjit Sekhon 48

Karli Smith 19

John Weisert 74

In a news release IMPD said Marion County’s Coroner’s Office will release cause of death once autopsies are completed.

IMPD said names of other victims will not be released.

IMPD was called to 8951 Mirabel Road just after 11 p.m. Thursday on reports of shots fired. Indianapolis Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt said the officers arrived to find a “chaotic and active” crime scene. Eye witnesses told police the suspect later identified as Hole came to the facility and quickly started randomly shooting as he exited his vehicle. There was no argument or confrontation beforehand according to police.

It is believed the incident only lasted a few minutes and the shooting was over shortly before the officers entered the building.

""Our IMPD officers went towards danger as they typically do"" IMPD Chief Randall Taylor said Friday. ""And when they arrived on the scene they found what really no one should see.""

Eight victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Four were outside of the FedEx building and four were found inside. Investigators believe the suspect died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Five people were transported to area hospitals with apparent gunshot wounds.

Winesses told investigators they saw Hole with two assault rifles. IMPD said Saturday evening that the ATF conducted a trace on the two weapons and learned that he purchased the rifles legally in July and September of 2020.

The FBI and local law enforcement searched Hole's residence Friday looking for a motive.

The scale of the crime scene slowed the identification of the victims. The Marion Coroner’s office was not able to access the scene until investigators completed processing evidence and documentating the scene. Some families were still waiting for information about missing loved ones late Friday morning. By 1 p.m. the coroner's office was able to begin its work to identify the victims and notify families.

Several people also expressed frustration that a FedEx policy barring employees from having cell phones with them as they work prevented them from finding out if their family members were OK.

Thursday night’s mass shooting was the third in Indianapolis so far this year. Five people including a pregnant woman were shot and killed in January and a man was accused of killing three adults and a child before abducting his daughter during an argument last month.

Our oringinal post from Thursday April 15 into Friday April 16 follows below:

Indianapolis police continued investigating a shooting at a FedEx facility on the city's southwest side that left eight people dead.

Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officers were called to 8951 Mirabel Road just after 11 p.m. Thursday on reports of shots fired. Department spokesperson Genae Cook said when officers arrived they ""came in contact with an active shooter incident"" and enetred the building.

""It is very heartbreaking. And you know Indianapolis Metro Police Department the officers responded"" Cook said. ""They came in they went in and they did their job. And a lot of them are trying to face this because this is a site that no one should ever have to see.""

Cook said officers located eight deceased victims inside the building plus the alleged gunman who is believed to have died by suicide.

Four people were transported to area hospitals by ambulance including one person in critical condition. Two people were treated at the scene and released and there were reports of several walk-ins at area hospitals. No law enforcement officers were injured.

Investigators from IMPD and Indiana State Police have not identified the shooter and are still seeking a motive. They're asking anyone who may have left the scene either for safety or to seek medical care to call IMPD at 317-327-3457 or 317-262-TIPS.

Live video from local television news outlets Thursday night showed crime scene tape stretched across a parking lot and people being escorted to IndyGo buses. FedEx employees were taken to a nearby hotel to be interviewed by detectives.

Police ask anyone with family members who work at the facility that they weren't able to get in contact with to go to the Holiday Inn Express at 8555 Stansted Drive.

Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett released a statement Friday morning offering condolences to the families of the mass shooting victims and thanks to first responders on the scene:

“This morning Indianapolis residents are confronted with the horrific news of yet another mass shooting an act of violence that senselessly claimed the lives of eight of our neighbors. As law enforcement works to learn more about this tragedy our prayers are with the families of those whose lives were cut short"" Hogsett said.

Thank you to all of our city’s first responders for their tireless work overnight. Their quick response provided critical aid to those injured in the shooting and brought a measure of calm to an otherwise chaotic scene.”

The mayor will join law enforcement for an update on the investigation at 10:30 a.m. Friday morning.

The FedEx facility involved is near Indianapolis International Airport but it is not part of the FedEx hub at the airport.

FedEx released a statement early Friday morning. The company said it is cooperating with authorities and working to get more information.

“We are aware of the tragic shooting at our FedEx Ground facility near the Indianapolis airport. Safety is our top priority and our thoughts are with all those who are affected” the statement said.

This is a developing story that will be updated as new information becomes available.

In previous versions of this story IMPD misspelled the names of Jasvinder Kaur Amarjit Sekhon and Karli Smith. The agency later issued corrections."

The dust ring stretches diagonally from the lower left to the upper right of the image. The bright objects are planets: from left to right Earth Venus and Mercury. Part of the Milky Way galaxy is visible on the left side. The four frames of this composite image were captured on Aug. 25 2019.

NASA's Parker Solar Probe mission has given scientists the first complete look at Venus' orbital dust ring a collection of microscopic dust particles that circulates around the Sun along Venus' orbit. Though earlier missions have made some observations of Venus' orbital dust ring Parker Solar Probe's images are the first to show the planet's dust ring for nearly its entire 360-degree span around the Sun.

Parker Solar Probe's WISPR instrument—short for Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe—is designed to study the solar wind the Sun's constantly outflowing material. Space is teeming with dust which reflects so much light that it typically shines at least a hundred times brighter than the solar wind. (The light reflected from space dust is what creates the zodiacal light sometimes visible from Earth as a faint column of light rising upward from the horizon.)

In order to see the solar wind with WISPR scientists use image processing to remove the dust background and stars from the images. This process worked so well that Venus' orbital dust ring—which appears as a bright band stretching across the images—was subtracted as well. It wasn't until Parker Solar Probe performed rolling maneuvers to manage its momentum on its way to its next solar flyby which changed the orientation of its cameras that the static dust ring was noticed by scientists. Based on the relative brightness scientists estimate that the dust along Venus' orbit is about 10% more dense than in neighboring regions. The results were published on April 7 2021 in The Astrophysical Journal. This animation shows the geometry of the dust rings along the orbits of Mercury Venus and Earth along with Parker Solar Probe’s trajectory. Only the dust along these planets’ orbital paths is shown — the dust near the Sun and between the planets’ orbits is omitted for clarity. Credit: NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Ben Smith

The German-American Helios spacecraft and NASA's STEREO mission—short for Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory—have both made earlier observations of the dust ring along Venus' orbit. Those measurements have allowed scientists to develop new models of the origins of dust along Venus' orbit. Parker Solar Probe's sensitive imagers and unique orbit have given scientists an unprecedented peek at Venus' dust ring—something the science team aimed for since the mission's early days.

As Parker Solar Probe flies ever-closer to the Sun over the course of its mission the science team also expects to make the first observations of a long-hypothesized dust-free zone a region close to the Sun where dust has been heated and vaporized by the intense sunlight. If there is a dust-free zone near the Sun—an idea supported by regions of thinning dust that Parker Solar Probe has already observed from afar—this would not only confirm theories about the interaction between our star and its nearby dust but could also help astrophysicists who study more distant objects: Just as space dust can interfere with seeing the solar wind it can also muddle measurements of stars and galaxies.

However for many scientists the dust itself is what's interesting. For example the exact origins of the dust that fills the solar system isn't settled science. For decades scientists have largely thought the dust is debris from comets and asteroids—but new research using data from NASA's Juno mission to Jupiter suggests that dust storms on Mars could be the source of much of the solar system's dust.

Space dust may also form the building blocks of stars and planets carry gases between star systems and provide a nurturing environment for young planets. These were some of the questions in mind for scientists on the DUST sounding rocket mission—short for Determining Unknown yet Significant Traits—which launched in 2019 to investigate how dust grains coagulate in the microgravity of space.

Since I had both the skill and position to try and provide power to them it made me act"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzE5OTUzNTUvdGhlLWVyYS1vZi1zdWJzaWRpZXMtZm9yLXdpbmQtYW5kLXNvbGFyLWlzLWNvbWluZy10by1hLWNsb3Nl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The era of subsidies for wind and solar may be ending far too soon,"Last August solar developers entered an auction to sell power into the Portuguese electricity grid. And many planned to lose money on every megawatt. One of the winning bidders Spanish solar firm Enerland offered to sell electricity for €11.14 (US$13.12) per megawatt-hour (MWh) one of the lowest auctioned electricity prices in history. One megawatt hour is slightly more than the average home in the US consumes per month.

Enerland and other bidders are selling Portugal energy at prices as much as five-times lower (pdf) than the cost to generate it estimates Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). But they are not throwing their money away. They’re betting the superior economics of solar power and a coveted connection to the country’s crowded electricity grid will cover any losses over the first 15 years (solar facilities are expected to last about 40 years). After that period they can sell their power at prevailing market rates (now more than $50/Mwh) and pocket any difference as profits. Their grid connection never expires.

This “quite remarkable” result as João Galamba Portugal’s secretary of state for energy put it hints at a new future of renewables. Developers are willing to pay big money to sell cheap power into the grid. As renewable energy prices drop even further says Jenny Chase who leads solar analysis for BNEF developers will find innovative ways to bring wholesale electricity prices even lower and return those savings to the grid.

“The Portuguese government expected to pay developers” says Chase “and instead developers are paying the grid.” That’s nothing less than a reversal of the economics of energy for the last half-century.

It happened again this February when Crown Estate Scotland the monarchy’s property manager in the UK held its first auction for offshore wind leases in a decade. Bids for offshore wind plots in the Irish sea came in far higher than expected promising a windfall of as much as £9 billion ($12.5 billion) over 10 years. Among the highest bidders? Oil giant BP and its partner EnBW a Germany utility a sign that oil majors are now rushing into the sector. In response British authorities have raised the maximum bid for offshore leases ten-fold to £100000 per sq km and called for a green sovereign wealth fund to reinvest its clean energy wealth an investment vehicle similar to Norway’s oil-based fund.

Of course not every auction will end up like those in Portugal or Scotland. But for the first time renewables are the cheapest source of new electricity in much of the world. At least 80% of new electricity capacity is expected to come from renewables by 2030 with unsubsidized wind and solar starting to compete directly with fossil fuels. Governments can now imagine a world without subsidies for wind and solar power—and some are already slashing support. But if the world intends to reach net-zero emission by 2050 the target set by scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) the retreat is premature.

The world doles out $634 billion per year in direct energy subsidies estimates International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). That is expected to decline as renewables bring down the costs of generating electricity over the next few decades. But the most likely scenario will not be the elimination of subsidies but redirecting where the money goes. And no energy source receives more help today fossil fuels which collect about 70% of direct global energy subsidies according to IRENA.

The true number may be far higher says Daniel Kammen a professor in the energy and resources group at the University of California Berkeley. When accounting for indirect subsidies fossil fuels enjoy $1.5 trillion to $5 trillion in support each year argues Kammen. Most of it comes in the form of ignored health and environmental damage including an estimated 8.7 million deaths each year from cardiovascular disease cancer asthma and other disease worsened by air pollution. “Free market people will say we don’t need subsidies anymore” says Kammen. “But those are fossil fuel apologists…we’re not at the point where we eliminate subsidies for renewables. We just need to wake up to the massive cost of fossil fuels.”

Renewables pay back the grid

In the 1990s most electricity generation was still bought and sold by regulated utilities. Prices weren’t subject to competition; they were set by regulators. That changed when some state and national governments began requiring utilities to sell off generation transmission and distribution assets. Suddenly competition transformed the energy market. Formerly publicly-owned power plants became rivals in a race to sell the cheapest most reliable electricity.

Government-sponsored auctions revealed just how cheap renewables were becoming. Reverse auctions in which developers bid to supply the lowest cost electricity are now the favored model. At least 130 countries have started competitive auctions and solicited astonishingly low prices. Since 2000 solar prices have fallen from around $750 per megawatt-hour to just $11 per MWh today—a 99% drop. Much of that decline has happened in recent years even as conventional fuel prices stay the same or rise slightly (coal for example remains around $100 per Mwh).

“Competitive forces were allowed to work and dramatic price reductions followed as a result of moving down the technology and cost curves” says Dan Shreve the head of wind energy research at Wood Mackenzie an energy research firm. “All of these working together lowered the cost until the question in the market is ‘Do you still require these subsidies?’”

That’s made it increasingly hard to justify subsidizing the cost of solar and wind directly. While the price of renewables used to be dominated by the value of government subsidies today it’s being driven by manufacturing and materials—silicon and steel nuts and bolts. Capital markets eager for reliable returns are piling in with favorable contracts and interest rates. In response governments are phasing out renewable subsidies and unsubsidized wind and solar plants are going up around the world.

Germany and Japan have ended direct subsidies embracing auctions as a way to manage the growth (and ensure the stability) of renewables on the grid according to Georgetown University. In Vietnam an expiring tariff sparked a frenzy as solar developers connected 78 solar plants (up from four) in just a few months in the middle of 2019. The country has announced it will be switching to competitive auctions in 2021 and wind will follow in 2023. India Mexico Zambia Madagascar and Kazakhstan are following suit as well



Solar prices keep falling

Renewable projects owe their advantage to incurring most of their costs upfront during construction. Less than 25% of the total energy cost is for operation and maintenance a share that’s falling fast. Fossil fuel generators are forever yoked to the cost of fuel. That’s made wind and solar now priced well under $30 per Mwh the world’s cheapest source of new electricity in most places around the world.

And that’s just a preview of what’s to come. ”We are still in the early days of very very cheap solar” says Chase at BNEF. A combination of rapidly improving solar cells more efficient construction favorable government policies and a sea of capital pouring into stable attractive and green investments is set to drive down costs further. That’s forced analysts to radically revise their forecasts for new installations up 15-fold in recent decades while cutting expected power-sector emissions in half according to the consulting firm McKinsey. Analysts at the International Energy Agency have moved up their projections every year since 2005.

Endesa a successful bidder in Portugal’s recent auction sees the price wars intensifying. “Fierce competition has been a constant in the renewable industry for some years now so it isn’t really something new” said Endesa spokespeople Julia Llata Lavín and Iratxe Manchobas Fernández by email. Their company’s ultra-low Portugal bid is not yet commonplace but securing a grid connection for low-cost renewables is now so valuable that developers like Endesa are now willing to return money utilities were prepared to pay for electricity. “The business rationale behind this was that the project would be profitable enough…. that we are able to give some contribution to the system” they wrote.

The global shift in subsidies

Policy-makers are now grappling with a tectonic shift in the nature of energy markets. To manage this clean-energy transition the nature of how to pay for a megawatt must change as well.

There’s still a huge gap between the world’s emission targets and what the market can achieve on its own. To achieve a carbon-free grid by 2035 as US president Joe Biden has proposed the US will need to add at least 70 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar annually starting in 2025. Right now estimates BNEF the US is forecast to add an average of 43 GW per year. Only incentives financing and policy can make up that gap. “When we say subsidies are no longer required what’s the end goal?” asks Shreve at Wood Mackenzie. “If the end goal is to rapidly decarbonize the grid there may be a case for subsidies to remain in place.”

The next era of subsidies forecasts IRENA will shift to overhauling the grid to support higher penetration of zero-carbon fuel sources and accelerate the retirement of existing fossil-powered plans before their normal lifespan. In a high renewables scenario energy sector subsidies now around 1% of global gross domestic product (GDP) would fall to 0.2% by 2050. Solar subsidies should shrink and disappear completely by 2050. More than $100 billion would be redirected to energy efficiency heating and cooling for industry and buildings. The fossil fuel sector would see 90% subsidies redirected to carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) for industrial applications (mostly the iron and steel cement and chemicals sector).

“I describe this as a shift from technology subsidies—for solar or storage—to systems planning and infrastructure” says Kammen. “It’s that kind of thoughtful step-by-step planning that changes the story.”

Getting there will be difficult. Not all fossil fuel subsidies are created equal. Politicians opposed to the shift will be quick to pounce on any failure even when programs succeed (the US Department of Energy loan program supporting defunct solar cell manufacturer Solyndra ended up returning a profit to the US Treasury). Some subsidies such as heating oil for the poor are still essential to fight poverty. Figuring out the right mix of financial carrots and sticks will be politically perilous.

In the meantime renewable prices will keep falling. In 2020 Abu Dhabi set the record for the cheapest solar price ever for a new solar project at the time: $13.50 cents/MWh. Recently it fell under $10 per MWh for the first time according to Kammen. At that price it’s now becoming cheaper to build new solar farms than run existing coal plants. But powering a country on solar and wind even at such low prices means incentivizing enormous investments in transmission storage and grid balancing assets that have yet to be made. Not even experts agree on how to do that yet. “If you can do that” says Kammen “you can jump ahead of 90% of the world economists.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjNuZXdzbm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3Mvb3BwZC10by1idWlsZC1zb2xhci1mYXJtLWluLXNhdW5kZXJzLWNvdW50edIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OPPD to build solar farm in Saunders County,"SAUNDERS COUNTY Neb. (KMTV) – Community Energy Inc. is leasing 500 acres in Saunders County near the intersection of Yutan Road and County Road K to build a solar facility.

OPPD’s power to purpose goal is to have 400 to 600 megawatts of solar energy in the state.

""This is kind of the first one in our series of potential projects that we were able to announce” said Courtney Kennedy manager of alternative energy programs at OPPD. “I’ll say behind the scenes we're continuing to evaluate a number of different projects locally around OPPD service territory. We will likely have more coming soon.""

Construction will begin in 2022 bringing around 150 to 200 construction jobs to the Yutan and Saunders County area.

""They have talked about sourcing locally for what they can” Kenendy said. “Once it's online it will bring two to three full-time jobs to operate and maintain the facility.""

One concern residents have is the solar facility will become an eyesore and lower property value.

""Provide trees and fencing where needed. They will meet with any impacted landowners and work with them on what is a reasonable negotiation to put trees up so that they have a pleasant view” said Michaela Valentin manager of government and community relations at OPPD.

If the plan is executed every year the Yutan School District could receive around $200000.

""There is a nameplate capacity tax that is called an excise tax and it is set at a certain dollar amount for each megawatt” Valentin said. “That money is returned to the county and then it is dispersed to various entities.""

The facility alone is said to be able to power roughly 14000 homes.

Today is National Lineman Appreciation Day and we hope you’ll join us in recognizing these talented and committed essential workers who have been working through a uniquely challenging year to keep our customers safe and comfortable.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

Nearly 2500 line workers are employed at FirstEnergy’s 10 electric utility companies in Ohio Pennsylvania New Jersey Maryland and West Virginia. Some have been with the company for decades or have strong family ties to the industry while others are just starting their careers after completing the company’s Power Systems Institute line worker training program.

Regardless of their backgrounds our line workers have faced the coronavirus health emergency head on. Throughout the pandemic they have been performing routine maintenance and reliability enhancement projects to keep the power flowing to our homes and businesses while quickly adopting new health and safety procedures to protect our employees and the public every step of the way. And when a storm blew through they continued to answer the call stepping away from their families for extended periods of time to restore service to customers.

As we move toward the light at the end of this tunnel our workers are continuing to maintain a safe social distance. Under these unusually perilous circumstances a wave or a thumbs up is fine recognition for a job well done.

We couldn’t be prouder of the men and women who put their lives on the line and sacrifice valuable time away from their families to provide the safe and reliable power we depend on each day. Thank you!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpcnN0ZW5lcmd5Y29ycC5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vZmVhdHVyZWRfc3Rvcmllcy93ZXN0LXBlbm4tbGluZW1lbi1oZWxwLXdvbWFuLXB1cnN1ZS1jYXJlZXItZHJlYW1zLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tomorrow's Promise: West Penn Power Linemen Help Women Pursue Career Dreams,"On April 18 each year the nation comes to together for National Lineman Appreciation Day a day to show our utmost appreciation for the men and women who work 24/7/365 to keep the power flowing to homes and businesses. Join us in honoring linemen like Jason Tomich who dedicate their lives to delivering safe and reliable service to customers through sometimes difficult circumstances. Celebrate Lineman Appreciation Day using #thankalineman on social media.

Jason Tomich scales the wooden utility pole with the agility of a wiry sailor ascending a ship’s mast. His sharp spikes dislodge splinters of yellow pine as he climbs.

“Wood chips are fine” notes the West Penn Power lineman descending the practice pole outside the Charleroi Service Center. “As long as it’s not chunks.”

Tomich kills time with fellow lineman Nash Harbaugh on a chilly March afternoon awaiting a pair of tryouts for the Power Systems Institute (PSI) FirstEnergy’s award-winning program to train the next generation of line workers. Tomich and Harbaugh are preparing the candidates for their technical evaluations.

No one would blame the men if they took the day off after a long night restoring power to thousands of West Penn Power customers courtesy of an overnight windstorm.

Instead Tomich and Harbaugh rig a handline on the practice pole for the candidates to hoist a kettlebell weight. To demonstrate strength and control PSI candidates must raise and lower a wooden crossarm from ground to pole top three consecutive times.

“This thing is really heavy” Tomich says lifting the kettlebell. Harbaugh hefts it and agrees it definitely feels heavier than the typical crossarm.

“Linework is my passion” says Tomich of his willingness to stick around to coach PSI candidates after a 16-hour shift. “And I want it to be their passion.”

Alyssa Imbrogno arrives and pulls her gear bag from the trunk of her car. Tomich helps the 27-year-old pizza shop manager and mother of two secure her red safety harness. The harness attaches to a self-arresting tether system that prevents novice climbers from falling.

Imbrogno previously worked as a flagger specializing in traffic control around utility work zones along roadways. She recognizes a good career opportunity when she sees one and hopes to be selected for the incoming PSI class.2

“Hold up a minute” Tomich tells Imbrogno. He sits down on a nearby brick wall. “I need to change my foot.”

Pulling up his left trouser leg Tomich reveals a short metal prosthetic leg attached to his knee by a hydraulic carbon fiber socket. At the bottom of the metal leg is a foot encased in a leather work boot. He loosens two screws with a torque wrench and swaps out his rigid “climbing” foot for a more shock-absorbent “walking” foot.

“I hate this foot” Tomich confides trying in vain to bend his climbing boot between his hands. “No flex. If I wanted to get this foot out of the boot I’d have to cut it out.”

Surgeons amputated Tomich’s leg below the left knee after a distracted driver struck his motorcycle in September 2017. The devastating injury came just five months after Tomich graduated from PSI.



&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;



Tomich spent two and a half years rehabbing and learning to walk independently. Never once did he consider taking an indoor position.



“I can’t sit inside” Tomich says swatting away the thought. “I couldn’t do a desk job. I like being outside and active.”

He climbed repeatedly with a buddy and requalified as a lineman.

Watching Tomich scuttle up a pole there is no hint that he is working with a prosthetic.

“I had to get used to not feeling the spike in the pole with my left foot and leg” he says.

Tomich faces no work limitations.

“The sky is the limit” says Joe Musco Tomich ‘s direct supervisor. “Jason can walk through the woods carry heavy loads. He does everything. We are all very proud of him.”

Wearing climbing gear and her personal protective equipment Imbrogno attacks the pole fighting nerves and moving higher. Tomich barks instructions and encouragement from the ground.

“Keep those knees away from the pole” he calls. “And keep your butt out.”

A decade out of high school Imbrogno says she is more concerned about mastering the classroom curriculum than the physical training.

Harbaugh who graduated from PSI eight months ago reassures her that academic support is available. “Don’t worry” he says. “Once you’re in you will get plenty of help with challenging classes.”

As Imbrogno climbs high school senior Paige Sethman shows up for some pointers. Enrolled in utility tech classes for several years she considers climbing her strength.

“I find it enjoyable and freeing” she says.

More worrisome for the petite 17-year-old is the crossarm test. Sethman completes one repetition and looks incredulous when told she has two more to go.

Harbaugh shows Sethman how to lower a knee to the ground with each tug. This technique teams body weight with muscle power to complete the exercise.

Musco appreciates the efforts of his linemen to tutor the candidates and understands how important it is to help the recruits. He also knows the two hopefuls will never forget the assistance they received.

“We teach it like the PSI instructors teach it” Tomich says. “It’s all still fresh in our minds.”

Ford is also moving quickly to meet changes in consumer preferences and demand by optimizing its sales network and services and further improving customer experience built around its Pioneering Innovation brand spirit accelerating technological innovations and treating customers like family.

“At Ford our purpose is to help build a better world where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams. That’s as true today as it was when the company was founded nearly 118 years ago” said Jim Farley president and CEO of Ford Motor Company. “We are working together with our partners to deliver a superior and distinctive branded experience for our customers in China and around the world and continue delivering on the ‘Best of Ford Best of China’ commitment. Moving forward we will still deliver great new products globally plus develop valuable always-on relationships that grow and evolve over time.”

All-new Ford EVOS defines Ford’s “Progressive Energy In Strength” design philosophy and applies the latest smart technology

Part of Ford’s China 2.0 plan the all-new Ford EVOS is the company’s first vehicle developed largely by a China-based team leveraging Ford’s global product development expertise and designed entirely around the Chinese consumer experience and ownership scenarios.

Ford EVOS is the first vehicle to reflect Ford’s “Progressive Energy in Strength” design philosophy with its innovative silhouette that communicates the agility and dynamic value of a coupe combined with the strength and sense of freedom of an SUV. The connected coast to coast lighting 3D parametric scale grille taillights with scale pattern and more distinctive design elements integrate Ford’s design heritage with Chinese aesthetic values.

Inside the intelligent embraced cockpit bridging the instrument panel and doors unites the entire interior space. On this foundation a 1.1m-wide horizontal screen including a 12.3” digital cluster and 27” 4K touch screen is nested into the soft and stitched instrument panel unfolding an advanced premium digital space.

Similar to the Mustang Mach-E Ford EVOS is equipped with Ford’s all-new Fully Networked Vehicle E/E architecture which supports dynamic quick and seamless over-the-air software updates to enhance product quality capability and customer experience over time.

The extra-wide horizontal screen is powered by SYNC+ 2.0 which combines Baidu's AI technology and its digital application ecosystem. Using Ford’s new UI design it offers more intuitive and concise function distribution and simple shortcut menus for smooth and seamless interaction.

EVOS has Ford’s first Virtual Personal Assistant providing an emotional and personalized human-machine interface experience. Reflecting feedback from Chinese customers EVOS introduces a unique smart digital cabin experience to meet demands of customers’ various life moments. The industry-first “co-driver” mode makes road trips much more fun and efficient for both drivers and front passengers who can use the extra-wide screen simultaneously for different tasks. The front passenger can view the vehicle status navigation and traffic signs on screen to help the driver better understand road conditions. During long road trips front passengers can enjoy entertainment content on their side of the screen while drivers use navigation functions on their own side. A customized relax mode combines with customized settings for in-cabin audio ambient lighting and seat positions for a truly personalized experience.

With EVOS Ford also plans to provide customers on-demand subscription services through the full-cycle user journey which includes a series of unique customized on-board content and features a more direct real-time owner communication and value-added maintenance service through over-the-air software upgrades.

EVOS is equipped with BlueCruise a first-for-Ford SAE Level 2 driver-assist technology that allows drivers to operate truly hands-free on prequalified sections of divided highways called Hands-Free Blue Zones. C-V2X technology is also deployed in EVOS to help drivers navigate potential risks ahead as well as improve automotive safety and traffic efficiency.

“The all-new Ford EVOS not only represents a step forward in creating high-end products around customer experience to address the diverse needs of Chinese customers but is also a pioneering vehicle demonstrating our next-generation intelligent features that herald the future development direction of Ford vehicles in China” said Anning Chen president and CEO of Ford China. “Adhering to our Pioneering Innovation brand spirit Ford will provide customers with a truly intelligent mobility experience based on customer-centric insights and our global cutting-edge smart technology expertise.”

Ford EVOS will be built by Changan Ford sold and serviced through the Ford NDSD distribution network across China.

Accelerating electrification plan and aspirations to win in the electric era

Ford is bringing the world’s favorite pony car to kick off the electric era with the all-new all-electric Mustang Mach-E SUV and demonstrate its strong determination and aspiration to win in the electric future. On April 13 the domestically built Ford Mustang Mach-E opened for pre-orders with four trims including the Mustang Mach-E GT First Edition ranging from RMB 2650001-379900.

Positioning for growth in the fast-evolving Chinese EV segment Ford is deploying a direct sales network that will serve customers in 20 major cities across China in 2021. Leveraging its existing dealer resources Ford will offer an enhanced one-stop ""Everything Online"" experience to include service appointments and pickup and delivery of vehicles.

He was born in Atlantic City on April 9 1930 to Julia and Charles Momjian both orphaned refugees from the Armenian genocide who were raised by American missionaries. The two parents were born in Malatya in the Ottoman Empire. Charles died at an early age and the family which included younger brother Albert had a difficult time during the Depression era.

Set Momjian attended Atlantic City High School LaSalle College and Charles Morris Price School of Advertising. After school he joined the Army where upon learning that the platoon photographer would have his own private quarters he spent a weekend learning all he could about photography. Returning to Atlantic City he used this skill again as the official photographer for the Miss America pageant.

He began and ended his long professional career at Ford Motor Company including years as a marketing executive at Philco-Ford Ford Aerospace and ultimately as a Washington liaison for the company.

Momjian is best known and remembered for his dual passions of antique collecting and politics. A serendipitous find of an old gun under the Atlantic City boardwalk when he was a young boy inspired his lifelong love of antiques. During a 1987 interview about his collecting on the Today show he said “collecting is in the marrow of my bones.” His son Chris said his father “spent every free minute he had digging through stalls at flea markets talking with dealers at antique shows or attending auctions. I’d go along with him leaving before dawn; my ‘reward’ at the end of the long day was usually an antique pocket knife for my collection.”

Early in his collecting career following advice from the Grolier Club he pursued first edition books but his obsession quickly expanded into other areas as he built his Americana collection that spans genres from soda fountain fixtures and coin-op machines to rare historical manuscripts and early photography. He is nationally known for his collection of White House and presidential china much of which has been on loan to presidential libraries. Momjian loved sharing his passion for collecting with others and was in demand as a speaker many groups throughout the country. Today objects from his collections are on loan to numerous museums and historic sites.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvdnctZm9yZC11bnZlaWwtc3V2cy1hdC1jaGluYS1hdXRvLXNob3ctdW5kZXItdmlydXMtY29udHJvbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New SUV models star at China auto show under virus controls,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Last week the popular right-wing talk show host said there was a coordinated Democratic plan to “replace” the existing population of the United States with immigrants from the “Third World.” White supremacists refer to the idea as a “Great Replacement” orchestrated by Jews and that claim has fueled attacks like the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.

After the segment the Anti-Defamation League called on Carlson to be fired. But Fox declined to act citing Carlson’s claim that he wasn’t talking about race and Carlson isn’t backing down.

On Monday he delivered a 20-minute defense of his “replacement” idea. At the end he took aim at the ADL saying its defense of Israel’s Jewish majority and opposition to the return of Palestinian refugees contradicts its advocacy for immigrants in the United States.

“In the words of the ADL why would a government subvert its own sovereign existence?” he wondered referring to an essay on the ADL’s website. “Good question. Maybe ADL President Jonathan Greenblatt will join ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ some time to explain and tell us whether that same principle applies to the United States.”

Perhaps this sounded simply like Carlson going after a group that has been challenging him.

But for far-right extremists his question went beyond a debate about immigration policy. Carlson was alluding to a meme that has traversed white supremacist circles for years and is a direct corollary to the “replacement” theory: Jews want to replace white people in the United States through mass immigration the theory goes but in Israel they protect their own race by restricting immigration.

White supremacists often refer to this idea by calling for “Open borders for Israel” — trollishly suggesting that American Jews should support similar immigration policy for the US as they do for Israel.

“Open borders for Israel” was a rallying cry at the 2017 rally in Charlottesville Virginia where far-right marchers chanted “Jews will not replace us.” A Facebook group called Open Borders for Israel features Pepe the Frog a cartoon appropriated by the “alt-right.” An “Open Borders for Israel” face mask featuring an anti-Semitic caricature is available for purchase on at least one website and a white supremacist group distributed flyers with the slogan at Texas Christian University last year according to TCU360 a campus news website.

The contradiction only works in white supremacists’ imaginations. In reality while American Jews tend to sympathize with immigrants and refugees few Jews actually call for “open borders” in the US And many Jews and Jewish groups including the ADL are particularly critical of Israel’s restrictive refugee policy which has been a topic of heated debate there for a decade.

In the “open borders for Israel” meme white supremacists take substantive debate beyond the pale of legitimacy. Beyond critiquing policy they suggest (falsely) that Israel’s immigration system is one more piece of a Jewish conspiracy to destroy white society and that Jews are playing a dishonest double game by advocating separate policies for the United States and Israel.

On its face this can be phrased like a normal policy debate. Pro-Trump pundit Charlie Kirk  for example tweeted this week “Why is it controversial to say that America should have similarly strict immigration policies the way Israel does?” But to white supremacists that question sounds like an endorsement of perceived Jewish hypocrisy — and hearing it articulated on one of the most-watched cable news shows in the country was invigorating.

An article about Carlson’s monologue by Andrew Anglin in the Daily Stormer a white supremacist publication was headlined “Tucker Nukes Israel – Says Jews Have Same Policy They Claim is Racist for Whites!”

“Jews come to America and force us to have unlimited immigration” Anglin wrote “while in their own country they have a wall and DNA-based citizenship.” (Israel does not use DNA to determine citizenship.)

Nick Fuentes a Holocaust denier with 126000 Twitter followers tweeted that Carlson “really brought it all together & spelled out explicitly what is happening to the country.”

“Demographic replacement ADL Israel it’s all there … a full redpill” Fuentes wrote using a term that denotes people being turned onto white supremacist ideas. “On primetime Fox News for 4 million mainstream conservatives. Can you feel it? We are inevitable.”

The idea that Jews adopt white supremacist policy when it comes to Israel was popularized in 2016 and 2017 by Richard Spencer a white supremacist ideologue. Spencer claimed that all he wanted was for the United States to adopt laws similar to Israel’s — only to benefit white people instead of Jews.

In a 2017 interview with Israeli Channel 2 he referred to himself as “a white Zionist in the sense that I care about my people. I want us to have a secure homeland for us and ourselves. Just like you want a secure homeland in Israel.”

Spencer linked that idea with immigration in response to a question from a rabbi in 2016.

“Do you really want radical inclusion into the State of Israel?” he asked. “Maybe all of the Middle East can move into Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. Would you really want that?”

American Jewish groups reject the comparison. In a statement the ADL said Carlson quoted its materials “out of context” and called his claim “an attempt to distract from his promotion of a white supremacist conspiracy theory that is rooted in antisemitism and racism.”

“Using Israel and the Jewish people to give cover to this white supremacist theory is pretty disturbing” the statement said. “It has nothing to do with the ‘Great replacement theory’ a toxic and extreme ideology that has led to violent attacks both at home and abroad.”

Carlson did not reply to a JTA inquiry asking whether he sees a distinction between his statement and those of white supremacists.

But he’s not the only one to note a perceived contradiction in the ADL’s work. Leftist groups in recent years have also criticized what they see as a discrepancy between the ADL’s values at home and its advocacy for Israel. Unlike white supremacists however they want the ADL to be more critical of Israeli policy not more conservative in the US and don’t claim to see evidence of a nefarious Jewish conspiracy. On Wednesday the left-wing Jewish columnist Peter Beinart tweeted that the contradiction identified by Carlson makes the ADL vulnerable to criticism.

“This is the problem with being an anti-bigotry organization in the US but opposing equality for Palestinians” Beinart tweeted. “You have a glass jaw. As I wrote a while back white nationalists like Carlson see Israel’s system of ethnic privilege as a model for the US.”

Pro-Israel advocates say there’s a reason to differentiate between immigration policies in Israel and the United States. They note that Israel’s immigration system does privilege Jews offering them automatic citizenship because Israel was founded in part as a safe haven for Jews after centuries of lethal persecution. By contrast the United States was founded in theory on the promise of equality for all. And unlike the Jews who founded Israel white people in America are not a persecuted minority.

In Israel non-Jewish Israelis are afforded individual equality under the law. An Arab Israeli sits on the Supreme Court and following Israel’s most recent election an Islamist party may act as kingmaker.

“Tucker is wrong because the ADL opposing a [Palestinian] ‘right of return’ is about preserving a single functioning refuge for an oppressed people” tweeted Gilead Ini a senior research analyst for the right-wing pro-Israel media watchdog CAMERA. In a subsequent tweet he wrote “Surely Tucker understands the difference between what’s described above and the situation of say Americans of English descent.”

Israel’s immigration policy has led to mass immigration however of Jews from around the world. Waves of Jews from the Middle East North Africa Ethiopia and the former Soviet Union have moved to Israel in the seven decades since its founding. But unlike in the United States where Carlson claims that immigration benefits the left those groups of Israeli immigrants have largely supported the political right.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vZm94YW5kd2Vla3MuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvby84MTk2L0FydGh1ci1IYXJyZWxsLVJvYmVydHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arthur Harrell Roberts,"Arthur Harrell Roberts passed away on Sunday April 18th at age 89. The son of Arthur Belmont Roberts and Sula Harrell Roberts he was born in Bainbridge GA in 1931 and moved to Savannah at age 11. Harrell Roberts was a force to be reckoned with. His larger-than-life personality combined limitless love and fierce loyalty with a wicked sense of humor and a deep abiding faith. His love of learning provided him with encyclopedic knowledge of a broad range of subjects and his recall of details was legendary.

Roberts enlisted in the USMC Reserves while still in high school graduating from Savannah High School in 1949. In August of 1950 only days after his 19th birthday his unit was called to active duty at the outbreak of the Korean War and Dog Company boarded the train for California’s Camp Pendleton. With only two weeks training and without the benefit of boot camp he and his brothers in arms shipped out to Korea. Upon his arrival he was assigned to George Company 3rd Battalion 1st Marine Division (G-3-1). Alongside the men of “Bloody George” the young Marine marched through Hellfire Valley to the Chosin Reservoir. In the -40◦ temperatures of the “frozen Chosin” he was wounded at the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir an engagement that remains the most fierce battle in USMC history. The grueling tour of duty earned him a place in the elite brotherhood of The Chosin Few. He was awarded the Purple Heart and retired from the USMC following a year-long recovery.

Returning to Savannah he married Betty Durden the love of his life and they soon became proud parents to Arthur and Susan. He began a career with the Savannah District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that would span 35-years. From his start as a draftsman he moved up through the ranks in Civil Engineering before transferring to Operations Division overseeing dredging operations in Savannah Harbor Kings Bay and many points in between. He and Betty opened and operated one of the first shops on Savannah’s River Street where his exceptional woodworking skills earned The River Street Emporium a national reputation.

Retiring from the COE at age 55 Harrell and Betty traveled the world for annual reunions with his fellow Marines and were active members of the Marine Corps League’s Savannah Detachment 564. He served as Commandant of Savannah’s Marine Corps League and as President of the international G-3-1 Association. Among his many accomplishments was his design and creation of a monument honoring the members of Savannah’s Dog Company located on Savannah’s East Bay Street and a monument honoring the G-3-1 Marines killed in Korea located on Chesty Puller Way at the National Museum of the Marine Corps Quantico VA.

Harrell and Betty provided a warm and loving home filled with lively debate great expectations and laughter that rattled its windows. The pair continue to be an inspiration and an example of lives well-lived for their children and all who knew them. Both were lifetime members of First Baptist Church and devoted to the church and congregation. For many years Harrell’s was the first face to greet members and visitors each Sunday morning. He taught Sunday School served on numerous committees and as Chairman of both the Board of Deacons and the Brotherhood. He was recently named a Life Deacon.

Preceded in death by his parents and Betty Harrell is survived by son Arthur Harrell Roberts Jr. (Donna) of Okatie SC daughter Susan Roberts Frampton (Lewis) of Summerville SC and beloved granddaughter Sara Montgomery Frampton (Gillie Croft) of Charleston SC. The family wishes to express their gratitude for the enduring friendship of Ann Frech the care of the physicians and staff of Savannah Veterans Clinic and the Medical University of South Carolina and the devotion of caregiver Quantina Williams and others.

The Fox Corp chief executive his wife Sarah and their three children moved to Sydney in March joining a host of high profile individuals who opted to ride out the coronavirus pandemic in relatively unaffected Australia.

He is expected to return home to Los Angeles in September.

During his brief sojourn Sydney Morning Herald reports he snapped up a prime piece of real estate in the ritzy eastern suburbs.

The two-storey boatshed is a stone's throw from former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull's home and was once the private playground of the wealthy O'Neil family.

It was sold on to Paul Scharrer Scotts Honda Motors former owner and a local property investor in 2017 before it sold again last month for the eyewatering price of $37million.

The Wunulla Road property on Sydney Harbour is certainly Australia's most expensive boatshed.

Sydney's property boom has reached ridiculous levels with a boatshed lacking a house selling for a record $37million

The Wunulla Road property on Sydney Harbour has a pool - and is certainly Australia's priciest-ever boatshed

The sale set a record for Sydney this year but up until this point there were no indications of who the buyer was.

A caveat placed on the title after the sale - which occurred just three weeks after it was listed - confirmed a mystery buyer purchased the home through McCullough Robertson legal firm.

The 2000sqm property has access to one of the largest private marina berths on Sydney Harbour.

There is accommodation on the top level of the boat shed and Woollahra Council recently approved for it to be turned into a home.

A source told the publication Murdoch's new reported acquisition is the worst kept local secret.

'Everyone at Point Piper Yacht Club is talking about it' the source reportedly revealed.

Lachlan the son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch left Los Angeles for Australia amid claims that Joe Biden's election made things 'rough' for his family given Fox Corp's reputation as catering to the GOP.

Things 'got pretty rough' for their children Kalan Alexander 16 Aidan Patrick 14 and daughter Aerin Elisabeth 10 at school in their final weeks in Los Angeles SMH reported at the time.

Spokesman John Connolly said Murdoch who is also Fox's executive chairman would return to Los Angeles in early September to reopen the company's operational head office there 'and will go back to working and living in the U.S.'

Fox last month told its 9000 staff to return to their U.S. offices from September 7 after working at from home for several months.

It is not clear what plans he has for the expensive boatshed.",,,,,,

Retiring from the COE at age 55 Harrell and Betty traveled the world for annual reunions with his fellow Marines and were active members of the Marine Corps League’s Savannah Detachment 564. He served as Commandant of Savannah’s Marine Corps League and as President of the international G-3-1 Association. Among his many accomplishments was his design and creation of a monument honoring the members of Savannah’s Dog Company located on Savannah’s East Bay Street and a monument honoring the G-3-1 Marines killed in Korea located on Chesty Puller Way at the National Museum of the Marine Corps Quantico VA.

Harrell and Betty provided a warm and loving home filled with lively debate great expectations and laughter that rattled its windows. The pair continue to be an inspiration and an example of lives well-lived for their children and all who knew them. Both were lifetime members of First Baptist Church and devoted to the church and congregation. For many years Harrell’s was the first face to greet members and visitors each Sunday morning. He taught Sunday School served on numerous committees and as Chairman of both the Board of Deacons and the Brotherhood. He was recently named a Life Deacon.

Preceded in death by his parents and Betty Harrell is survived by son Arthur Harrell Roberts Jr. (Donna) of Okatie SC daughter Susan Roberts Frampton (Lewis) of Summerville SC and beloved granddaughter Sara Montgomery Frampton (Gillie Croft) of Charleston SC. The family wishes to express their gratitude for the enduring friendship of Ann Frech the care of the physicians and staff of Savannah Veterans Clinic and the Medical University of South Carolina and the devotion of caregiver Quantina Williams and others.

The Fox Corp chief executive his wife Sarah and their three children moved to Sydney in March joining a host of high profile individuals who opted to ride out the coronavirus pandemic in relatively unaffected Australia.

He is expected to return home to Los Angeles in September.

During his brief sojourn Sydney Morning Herald reports he snapped up a prime piece of real estate in the ritzy eastern suburbs.

The two-storey boatshed is a stone's throw from former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull's home and was once the private playground of the wealthy O'Neil family.

It was sold on to Paul Scharrer Scotts Honda Motors former owner and a local property investor in 2017 before it sold again last month for the eyewatering price of $37million.

The Wunulla Road property on Sydney Harbour is certainly Australia's most expensive boatshed.

Sydney's property boom has reached ridiculous levels with a boatshed lacking a house selling for a record $37million

The Wunulla Road property on Sydney Harbour has a pool - and is certainly Australia's priciest-ever boatshed

The sale set a record for Sydney this year but up until this point there were no indications of who the buyer was.

A caveat placed on the title after the sale - which occurred just three weeks after it was listed - confirmed a mystery buyer purchased the home through McCullough Robertson legal firm.

The 2000sqm property has access to one of the largest private marina berths on Sydney Harbour.

There is accommodation on the top level of the boat shed and Woollahra Council recently approved for it to be turned into a home.

A source told the publication Murdoch's new reported acquisition is the worst kept local secret.

'Everyone at Point Piper Yacht Club is talking about it' the source reportedly revealed.

Lachlan the son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch left Los Angeles for Australia amid claims that Joe Biden's election made things 'rough' for his family given Fox Corp's reputation as catering to the GOP.

Things 'got pretty rough' for their children Kalan Alexander 16 Aidan Patrick 14 and daughter Aerin Elisabeth 10 at school in their final weeks in Los Angeles SMH reported at the time.

Spokesman John Connolly said Murdoch who is also Fox's executive chairman would return to Los Angeles in early September to reopen the company's operational head office there 'and will go back to working and living in the U.S.'

Fox last month told its 9000 staff to return to their U.S. offices from September 7 after working at from home for several months.

Let’s address the elephant in the room right off. Yes this is an expensive pistol. Look at it as something to aspire to own or a “someday” gun or maybe a goal to work toward. Nighthawk Custom’s Agent 2 pistol crafted in conjunction with Agency Arms offers a modern take on the timeless 1911 design an astonishing fighting pistol that is as beautiful as it is functional. Available in both Government and Commander configurations we’ve opted for the slightly shorter Commander model today.

If you’re a fan of the 1911 you recognize that even among high-end models the Agent 2 is a standout. Custom features cover the gun from muzzle to beavertail with a match-grade barrel contoured magazine release custom Nighthawk/Agency collaboration trigger and Railscale G10 grips just a few of the upgraded components. Agency Arms produces the slide with aesthetic side windows and useful cocking serrations both fore and aft while Nighthawk’s frame includes an extended magazine well undercut trigger guard and accessory rail as part of the functional improvements.

Simply charge the pistol and you start to understand the level of workmanship that goes into this collaborative effort. There is something nearly mythical about the way the slide moves seemingly frictionless to charge the Agent 2. Function isn’t just great it’s next-level like the rest of this handgun. While yes it is definitely one of the priciest offerings we’ve chosen for “I Carry” it’s also one of the best-handling. This isn’t just a beauty queen this is a pistol you could take to a weeklong class at Gunsite and be confident in its operation.

Some quick specs on the Agent 2: It’s available in .45 ACP and 9 mm with an optional upgrade to 10 mm for an extra $100. Overall length is 7.85 inches with the 4.25-inch barrel of the Commander with weight at 38.6 ounces and capacity at 10 rounds for the 9 mm we have today. Standard rear sight is a Heinie black ledge with a red fiber-optic pipe front sight and the finish is Nighthawk’s proprietary Smoke Cerakote. Also included with the Agent 2 are two Nighthawk Custom 1911 magazines a new addition to the Nighthawk line.

Note that this model has Nighthawk Custom’s Interchangeable Optics System (IOS) which is a custom-machined dovetail that Nighthawk cuts into the slide. Rather than mill the slide for a specific optic the IOS allows one of three optics-specific plates to be swapped for the rear sight. This particular model is obviously cut for the Trijicon RMR footprint and includes a back-up rear sight milled forward of the optic. This system allows optics and iron sights to be interchangeable with no disruption in zero for either method.

Holster: Milt Sparks Axiom outside-the-waistband (MSRP: $235)

If you’re aiming for a high-end pistol like the Agent 2 you want an equally durable and attractive holster to carry it in. Enter the Milt Sparks Axiom outside-the-waistband holster. Designed to both tuck the pistol in close to the body for optimum concealment while allowing rapid attachment or removal of the holster the Axiom uses dual snap closures to keep things secure. The Axiom features a 20-degree cant for presentation and the offset belt loops help distribute weight for greater comfort.

The Axiom is available in cowhide not horsehide and with several different trim options. The holster we have today features shark trim on the mouth and belt loops. Custom trim options do incur additional cost over standard cowhide and there is a multi-month wait currently. Axiom holsters are available in black and Cordovan (dark brown) for both right- and left-handed shooters.

Accessory: Garmin Tactix Delta – Solar Edition with Ballistics (MSRP: $1399.99)

While it’s unlikely you’ll need a ballistic calculator for a 9 mm handgun it’s possible that you might be the sort to enjoy long-range pursuits. If so what could possibly be handier than having a ballistic chart right on your wrist? Garmin’s Tactix Delta Solar Edition with Ballistics makes use of Applied Ballistics Elite software to both calculate aiming solutions and provide ballistic profiles at a glance. You can also set up range cards for different firearms and/or bullet weights.

In addition to the ballistic capabilities though the Tactix Delta is an amazingly powerful smartwatch. GPS allows it to track a wide range of activities for fitness updates topographical maps navigation and even turn-by-turn instruction on your watch. Features such as GarminPay allow you to link your watch to a credit card to make touchless payments the Delta can stream music to Bluetooth-enabled headphones and a wide variety of health features can be tracked and managed. The Garmin Tactix Delta smartwatch is an incredibly potent survival tool on many levels.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FkZ2V0c2FuZHdlYXJhYmxlcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xOC9hbWF6Zml0LXQtcmV4LXByby1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazfit T-Rex Pro review: ultra-rugged offers a lot for the price,"15 min read

Rugged watches are not for everyone. But they are very popular amongst the outdoorsy types. This includes those into hiking skiing and other outdoor adventures. Such devices are typically bulky they have good navigation systems decent battery life and are built to survive most environments.

A number of brands such as Garmin Suunto and Casio have multiple devices in this category. Even Apple is rumored to be working on a more durable version of its watch.

Essential reading: Top fitness trackers and health gadgets

Huami (or Zepp Health as it is now known) is also in this group. Its entry in the rugged smartwatch space is the Amazfit T-Rex Pro. Launched a couple of years ago the device offers a decent set of features at an attractive price.

Zepp Health has released a follow-up to T-Rex last month. The Pro version brings a number of useful upgrades such as better water-resistance and additional sensors.

I’ve been testing the T-Rex Pro for the past few weeks. Here’s my review.

The verdict

Amazfit T-Rex Pro review: Design

durable build

weighs only 59 grams

15 military-grade certifications

18 day battery life

Identical in looks to the non-Pro version

Amazfit T-Rex Pro is identical in looks to the non-Pro version. The dimensions of both are 47.7 x 47.7 x 13.5 mm and they have the same ultra-rugged appearance. Looking at them you’d think they are the same device. It’s hard to tell them apart unless you know what to look for.

These are sports watches that are designed to take quite a beating. Their case is made of a high-strength polymer that protects against drops shocks and weather elements. The benefit of that type of material rather than for example steel is that the device will not weigh down your wrist. With the 22mm strap the watch weighs only 59 grams.

The way to tell the two generations apart is in the detail. The Pro variant benefits from a metallic painting effect on the bezel. Its two-tone silicone wristband is also a nice improvement over the previous plain one. Both of these help to make the watch slightly more premium looking.

Thanks to a little flex the band feels very soft and comfortable. It’s worth noting – there is no quick release mechanism so it’s not easy to change the strap around for another one. But the included band works well it stays clean and dries quickly.

Amazfit T-Rex Pro

Gadgets & Wearables may get a commission

In essence the design of T-Rex Pro is more practical than attractive. Probably not something you will be boasting about on a night out but those after an adventurers watch will be after this type of form-factor.

The timepiece can be picked up in a few different color options. This include Meteorite Black Desert Grey and Steel Blue. I have the first one on this list as can be seen from the images in this article.

Water-resistance durability

Water-resistance is pinned at 10 ATM. In English this means you can dunk the thing down to depths of 100 meters. That should be more than enough for everyone apart from maybe those into deep sea diving. This is one of the improvements over the original which only has a 5 ATM water-resistance stamp.

In addition to the excellent water-resistance the durability of the Pro version is illustrated in the number of US Military grade certifications it boasts. The total is 15 which is three more than the non-Pro version. I won’t list all of them in this article but take my word for it – the device is super-tough and will not break easily. That is the idea of this type of watch.

Display is excellent

The display is also something that is built to be practical. The 1.3 inch AMOLED packs 360 x 360 pixel resolution that is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. This combination makes it easily visible in most conditions. The ambient light sensor ensures the brightness is adjusted automatically.

I would have preferred it if the bezel around the display was a bit smaller. But this probably helps keep the device shock and drop-proof.

There are various screen settings that you can tweak including brightness wake-up time and similar. More usefully you can also opt for an always-on option. This transitions from a fully functional watch face to one with just the time. I really liked this combination. The caveat is explaned by the message that will pop up saying – type of setting will “severely” affect battery life. And it does reduce it to only a few days.

The T-Rex Pro screen has an anti-fingerprint coating. This helps as you are meant to navigate the display via touch and the four physical buttons labeled Up Down Back and Select. The last of these can be customized so that it performs the action you desire.

Those accustomed to typical Amazfit or Zepp watches might find the four button system a bit confusing. I certainly did. That’s because the other watches have only one or two physical buttons. This means that it will take some time to get used to the controls. I’ve tested quite a few Huami-made timepieces over the years so it was definitely a learning experience navigating the T-Rex Pro menus.

For example just figuring out how to end my run was frustrating. Something that was simple before suddenly became complicated. But even though it was annoying I suppose it does make sense. If you are out in the snow or trecking on a mountain navigating the menus via the touchscreen might be impossible. Especially if you are wearing gloves. In that sense it is better to use the physical buttons.

As far as watch faces you get five pre-installed on the device. A long press on the display will reveal them and let you switch between them. Additional ones can be found in the smartphone app. There are also a ton that can be installed through third-party software. A whole community has grown around these watch faces.

Sensors and battery life

Under the hood there is plenty going on – this is one of the most specs-heavy watches manufactured by Huami. The full list of sensors includes the latest BioTracker 2 PPG biological tracking optical sensor 3-axis acceleration sensor 3-axis gyroscope geomagnetic sensor barometric altimeter and ambient light sensor. The additions over the predecessor are the ability of the Pro version to track blood oxygen and stress along with the altimeter.

Another improvement can be found in satellite navigation. The combination of four global navigation satellite systems (GPS GLONASS BeiDou Galileo) will ensure you never get lost. Previously you had to rely on just the first two.

Battery life is another highlight. T-Rex Pro can keep going for 18 days between charges. That’s a couple of days less than the non-Pro version due to the boost in specs. However battery life with satellite positioning switched on has been doubled to 40 hours.

I found during testing these stats are reflective of reality. You do need to tweak the settings though. The more functionality you switch on the bigger the toll on the battery. For example you can define the frequency of heart rate monitoring decide how detailed you want your sleep stats to be toggle all day stress monitoring etc.

But it’s rare that I needed to reach for the charger. The sizeable 390mAh LiPo battery can be refueled via the magnetic 2pin pogo pin charger which snaps on to the pins on the back of the watch. The benefit of having such a large timepiece is that you can fit a big battery inside the thing.

Amazfit T-Rex Pro

Fitness and health tracking

all the usual fitn ess and sleep stats

blood oxygen on-demand

stress around the clock

detailed sleep stats

The Amazfit T-Rex represents a viable alternative for those that do not want to pay too much for another outdoorsy watch such as a Garmin Instinct or Fenix. Granted you will not get as much functionality but you do get plenty.

The watch works through the same proprietary operating system that is installed on all Amazfit and Zepp timepieces. It is simple to use very stable and smooth – no instability or software problems whatsoever. Those that are coming from WearOS will find it a refreshing experience.

As far as fitness and activity tracking there is hardly any difference between this watch and other Amazfit and Zepp watches. You get the typical activity stats blood oxygen measurements on demand and stress tracking around the clock. The daily stats can be seen on the watch itself while more detail and longer term trends can be viewed in the Zepp smartphone app.

The one thing that is missing is a floor count. Which is strange considering the watch does have the barometric altimeter which is typically what is used to estimate this type of metric. I would have also wished for SpO2 monitoring to be automatic during the day but it’s not.

PAI plays a central role on all Huami-made watches. I’ve become fans of the metric over the years. Instead of the usual step count as a gauge of daily activity it tracks your heart. Whenever you are active your heart rate increases. The PAI metric captures this activity and provides you with a daily score.

The aim is to get to 100 and keep the value above that level. That has been proven by studies to add multiple healthy years to your life.

The smartphone app used to be a rather clunky affair but Huami has been putting in some good work in improving it.

The sleep stats in particular are detailed. In addition to capturing naps different sleep stages and respiratory information you’ll get a daily sleep score. Whats more the app will also spit out insights on what you can do to improve your nightly rest.

Sports tracking

heart rate and GPS works well

tracks 100+ spo rts 8 with auto-recognition

VO2Max Training Load Training Effect

The Pro version builds on the original with some new sports functionality. For starters users can now track more than 100 sports. On the predecessor they only have 14.

Amongst the one hundred are a host of popular outdoor sports modes. Something called ExerSense is also new. It automatically detects and tracks eight types of workouts in case you forget to switch them on yourself. The auto-functionality never kicked in during the few weeks of my testing so I cannot confirm that it does work.

Interestingly Firstbeat metrics make an appearance. These include VO2Max Training Load and Training Effect. Hopefully we will see more of these on Amazfit watches.

I did a number of runs with the T-Rex Pro strapped on one wrist and a Garmin Forerunner 935 on the other. The Vo2Max that was estimated by the Amazfit was considerably below the Garmin value. However I reserve judgement as it typically takes at least for a month for the value to be properly assessed. Both companies are using the same Firstbeat Metrics so presumably the algorithms are identical.

The big screen on T-Rex is conducive to reading stats while you are running. Unlike a Garmin you can’t really tweak the fields so you get what the app is set to show. But you will be able to see all the basics such as distance pace heart rate and there is auto-pause.

The T-Rex Pro will probably fit the needs of most runners although it doesn’t offer too much in terms of advanced performance metrics. The hard-core runners may want to look for a dedicated running watch instead.

As far as GPS positioning Huami has considerably improved this over the past year. Obtaining a signal is quick and the stats are on par with Garmin. Just make sure to update the A-GPS files occasionally. This is done automatically when you sync the watch to the Zepp smartphone app.

As mentioned above for out of the way routes the satellite positioning should be even better as the watch also speaks to BeDou and Galileo satellites. The original is limited just to GPS and GLONASS.

Unlike some other devices in the Amazfit range the heart rate monitor on T-Rex Pro works well during exercise. The bulk of the device probably makes it easier to capture a good signal from the wrist.

For example a recent 4K run yielded an average heart rate of 149 bpm and a max of 172 bpm on the Amazfit. The Polar OH1 put the values at 155 bpm and 173 bpm respectively. More importantly there were no strange drops or peaks in the heart rate on the Amazfit during the run.

I did another 4K run a few days later and the Amazfit estimated my average heart rate at 158 bpm and max 175 bpm. The Polar pinned the values at 161 bpm and 172 bpm. So the discrepancies are to be expected but on the T-Rex they are not huge.

The thing is no wrist watch is going to spit out chest strap quality heart rate data. It would be much better if the Amazfit had the ability to connect to external chest straps. But it doesn’t. In my mind Huami should put that towards the top of their priority list.

Smart features

basic music control

SMS call app notifications

no third party apps

The watch also provides SMS call and app notifications. These are pretty basic so don’t expect an Apple Watch experience.

There is no speaker on-board or microphone only vibration. Which means you can’t answer texts by speaking or answer calls from it. So you don’t get overwhelmed with interuptions the smartphone app lets you define exactly what notifications to allow.

Other smart functionality includes things such as find your phone flashlight and more. There is no built-in storage for music but you do get basic smartphone music control when paired to the phone.

Amazfit T-Rex Pro review: The verdict

The Amazfit T-Rex Pro is a lightweight and durable watch for the outdoorsy types. This iteration brings a number of useful improvements over the original. These combine to make the watch an even more solid option for those that do not want to pay an arm and a leg for an outdoorsy watch.

Basic activity sleep and sports tracking works well the operating system is simple smooth and reliable the display can easily be read . Plus you won’t be chaging it too often. There is clearly lots to like.

On the minus side the T-Rex Pro doesn’t come with too much smart functionality. There’s no built-in music storage speaker or microphone no 3rd party app support and the notifications are basic.

Amazfit T-Rex Pro

Gadgets & Wearables may get a commission

Overall you don’t get as much functionality as the higher-end competition but the T-Rex Pro retails for less than half their price. If you’re into rugged sports watches with decent health and activity tracking it represents a very good deal.

IT,Gartner,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZS1uZXR3b3JrLmNvbS90ZWNoL3doYXQtc2FzZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is SASE?,"In 2019 the analyst group Gartner coined a new acronym secure access service edge (SASE) in its report “The Future of Network Security Is in the Cloud.”

Gartner said “The enterprise data center is no longer the center of access requirements for users and devices.” And it noted that enterprise workloads were being performed in all kinds of new locations outside of the enterprise data center including on public clouds and at edge locations such as branch offices.

According to one of the report’s authors Gartner analyst Joe Skorupa SASE (pronounced “Sassy”) came about because software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN) was becoming incredibly popular. But it “broke security” in the WAN and that caused the “rethinking of security” said Skorupa.

SD-WAN creates a software overlay on top of various WAN connections whether they be MPLS internet broadband wireless or hybrid fiber coax. The software then optimizes the traffic using whichever connection is best at any given time. But the early implementations of SD-WAN left something to be desired in terms of WAN security. Skorupa said initially there were two separate discussions: the network team talking about SD-WAN and the security team talking about security.

The Gartner analysts realized that those discussion would have to come together and they coined “SASE” which is the blending together of SD-WAN and security.

Although SASE was initially driven by SD-WAN SASE encompasses more including secure web gateway (SWG) cloud access security broker (CASB) domain name system (DNS) data loss prevention (DLP) firewall-as-a-service (FWaaS) and remote browser isolation capabilities.

SASE works by identifying entities within a network such as people branch offices devices applications services or edge locations and it continuously assesses the security risks and trusts associated with those entities. A SASE architecture then applies policy-based security in real-time to the entities no matter where they are located.

An organization may take a Zero Trust approach as part of its SASE implementation. This means that there are no trust assumptions made when entities connect to the network.

Several vendors provide SASE as a cloud-based service. They claim the technology reduces complexity and costs. Instead of buying and managing multiple security products from multiple vendors they can use a single security platform consolidated into one cloud-based stack. Security personnel can shift from managing security boxes to setting security policies across the network.

Gartner predicts that organizations will transition from multiple vendors for WAN services to a single SASE vendor or perhaps two-vendor solutions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xNy9yZW1vdGUtd29yay1ob21lLWh5YnJpZC1tb2RlbC1mdXR1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remote work: The pros and cons of working from home,"A great debate is raging in organizations over whether employees will return to their offices or continue to work remotely once COVID-19 is under control and most people are vaccinated.

Gartner’s recent survey finds that about 70% of employees wish to continue some form of remote work. Twitter and Facebook have already given their employees permission to work remotely on a permanent basis. On the other hand Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon calls remote work an “aberration” urging employees to return to the office to collaborate on ideas.

My Harvard Business School colleague Tsedal Neeley has written a timely well-researched book called Remote Work Revolution that demonstrates how to make remote work most effective taking on issues like building trust productivity working in agile teams and leading virtually. Neeley found from her research that “when people have the opportunity to work virtually and the flexibility to arrange job tasks there is an increase in commitment to their companies and in performance and a decreased likelihood for attrition.”

Let’s examine some of the pros and cons of remote work. Among the benefits:

Time savings

Without the need for long commutes to work and travel to other cities and countries people find that they have a lot more time for their work and their families. This “found time” can be used to get more work done or spend more time with family exercising or relaxing.

Productivity

Many people—and their companies—were surprised to find they were more productive when working in remote settings. The absence of time wasted in commuting and travel is an obvious benefit but they also found they were more focused when working without all the typical office distractions.

Schedule flexibility

Remote workers find they can both attend scheduled meetings and preserve quiet time to get solo work completed giving them more flexibility in their schedules. This has also contributed to increased attendance since meetings do not have to work around travel plans and commuting schedules.

Balancing family needs

Although some people complain about the challenges of working with children in their homes the reality is that most people are more easily able to balance their work and family requirements when they have the flexibility to work from home.

Cost savings

Remote work provides clear cost savings for both employers and employees. Employers have dramatically reduced the cost of business travel while employees avoid commuting costs. Many companies like Target are shedding expensive downtown office space by shifting employees to the new concept of “hoteling” in which employees do not have permanent offices and book an available open office.

Organization design

While many companies have been moving away from hierarchical organizations remote work further encourages horizontal interactions with increased equality. In a Zoom meeting there is no privilege on seating order or physical presence as everyone’s screen is the same size.

Yet for all these significant benefits there are several negatives of remote work that both employees and their organizations are coping with.

Trust

There are obvious benefits to in-person communication. Neeley confronts this issue head-on with suggestions for establishing trust remotely. She explains “Unlike in person where the ideal time you spend with your coworkers inevitably leads to serendipitous discoveries about one another in the remote format you have to make a point of sharing your personal side.”

Collaboration

How can organizations replace the collaboration that happens when people work together in the office? New tools such virtual whiteboards as well as new meeting formats such as idea jams can set the stage for recapturing creative collaboration.

Informal interactions

Many leaders depend on the informal spontaneous interactions that occur from “managing by wandering around.” Executives claim they learn more about what is going on through these impromptu interactions than they do in formal meetings but such informal dealings are hard to replicate remotely.

Being with customers

There is nothing quite like meeting with your customers in their place of business especially in retail settings to build relationships and make use of all your senses. Even for remote employees some in-person visits and meetings to build initial relationships can foster insight that can then be followed up with remote interactions.

Concerns over these negatives are stimulating organizations to create hybrid models. Yet designing a fully functioning hybrid model is complicated. Remote workers may perceive that there is an “in-crowd” (in-person) and that they are in the “out-crowd” (online). It can also create anxiety over fear of missing out. To these concerns Neeley argues “Let us never mistake physical proximity with psychological closeness. That’s a fallacy.”

The nature and needs of both employees and the business will shape upcoming decisions about remote work. I expect that various forms of hybrid environments—with some employees in the office and others operating remotely—will become the new norm. After a period of experimentation companies will decide what format works best for their cultures and establish clear ground rules for their organizations.

According to the FAA companies need to be aware of the risk of the engine increasing power without a command from the pilots or the plane's computers.

The error occurs in the electronic engine control (FADEC) involving the microprocessor of the MN4 integrated circuit on the main board of the electronic engine controller (ECC). A failure in the soldering of the microprocessor on the board can make the engine lose control of the power applied by the pilots or by the primary computer.

The FAA stressed that this error is not widespread for the 787 and 747-8 fleet as the electronic engine controller (ECC) needs to present failures at this point the company usually replaces the component with another unused one.

This FAA warning has been issued before for the GE90 engine in October 2020 which uses similar electronic hardware and can also experience this type of failure over years of use.

The FAA requires for both cases that operators replace the engine ECC every 11000 flight cycles one cycle being equivalent to one takeoff and one landing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb3JnYW5jb3VudHljaXRpemVuLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BvbGljZV9hbmRfZmlyZS93YXJyYW50LWlzc3VlZC1mb3ItbWFucy1hcnJlc3QtaW4tcm9hZC1yYWdlLWluY2lkZW50L2FydGljbGVfZTU1MWE0NGMtYTA4Yi0xMWViLTk2MDYtYzNlNTRlOGMxMTExLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warrant issued for man's arrest in road rage incident,"×

Spearheaded by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) Turkey’s current plans are focused on rolling out a prototype in 2023 and potentially a test-flight in 2025.[1]

These dates reflect Turkey’s decision to use an off-the-shelf powerplant – i.e. the General Electric (GE) F110 – to power the prototype TFX/MMU and potentially its first production variants.[2] However Turkey also plans to fly a variant of the MMU with indigenously developed engines by 2029.[3]

TR Motor is managing the indigenous engine development program. TR Motor is a jointly-owned public and private corporation with investment from TAI (i.e. a state-owned entity) BMC (i.e. a private sector giant) and SSTEK (a state-owned entity owned by the Presidency of Defence Industries or SSB).

According to Osman Dur the general manager of TR Motor said that 80 engineers were working (as of 2020) on the engine.[4] However this is likely the start of TR Motor’s human resource investment. According to TAI’s general manager Temel Kotil the various involved in the MMU will need 3000 personnel for the program. This would be in addition to the 3000 TAI alone is hiring to carryout airframe development.[5]

The airframe and engine are basically the flagships of the MMU program but Turkey is taking indigenous inputs seriously enough to even consider less conspicuous subsystems. For example TR Motor will design and develop the auxiliary power unit (APU) and air turbine start system (ATSS) of the MMU.[6]

In addition other Turkish companies across the public and private sector are developing onboard oxygen-generating systems (OBOGS) airframe materials (e.g. composites) onboard electronics (e.g. radar) and air-to-air and air-to-surface munitions. In fact many of these programs are further along compared to the MMU and in turn could see implementation in several years through upgrades for Turkey’s F-16s.

Overall these examples demonstrate that the Turkish government’s seriousness in developing the MMU has now translated into significant industry-wide efforts. Basically the MMU is no longer confined to TAI or the SSB but now involves Turkey’s major aerospace suppliers.

Figuratively speaking the MMU “ball is rolling” but the question now is how much of a runway Turkey is able to afford on its own. There is no doubt that a next-generation fighter aircraft (NGFA) is an incredibly expensive effort especially for a large twin-engine fighter such as the MMU. Turkey recognized this issue early on in 2016-2017 so it invited other countries (including Pakistan) to the MMU.

The story began when Dr. Cao Guangzhi Tesla’s then autopilot engineer uploaded 300000 files and directories including Tesla’s Autopilot-related source code onto his personal iCloud before he left the company in late 2018 which was in violation of Tesla’s policies and its agreements with Cao.

Tesla filed a legal complaint saying that “Cao created .zip files of Tesla’s complete Autopilot-related source code repositories making them smaller and easier to move” while he was preparing for a new career opportunity.

Dr. Cao received an official job offer from XMotors on December 12 2018 and over the course of the following fortnight he deleted 120000 files from his iCloud and disconnected the cloud storage service from his Tesla-issued computer. Dr. Cao admitted such conduct in a court filing.

He also admitted that he logged onto Tesla’s secure network multiple times and cleared his browser history before he left in January 2019.

Dr. Cao Guangzhi worked his way to becoming Tesla’s 40 employees out of 45000 to access the software’s source code. Prior to that he worked successively at GE Healthcare and Apple after earning a Ph.D from Purdue University; he has a strong background in Electronic Engineering from Zhejiang University one of the top universities in China.

In his legal statement Dr. Cao “regrets and apologises for the unnecessary harm that Tesla’s lawsuit caused to XMotors. He is grateful to his colleagues at XMotors who supported him during this litigation.”

XMotors e.g. XPeng is one of the strongest competitors of Tesla in the EV industry in China. Like many electric vehicle start-ups XPeng used talents who were former staff members of the industry giants such as Tesla. Gu Junli its former vice president of research and development was a technical expert of Tesla’s machine learning technology department. Its founder He Xiaopeng also openly voiced Tesla’s impact on him and his understanding of electric car production.

So it came as no surprise when XPeng ’s first model EV-G3 in 2018 appeared visibly similar to Tesla’s Model X which drew Tesla’s attention and laid the land mine for future IP disputes.

In July 2018 Zhang Xiaolang a former Apple employee was arrested and charged with theft of trade secrets after allegedly stealing both the hardware and data on Apple’s secretive autonomous vehicle project. He was facing potentially 10 years in prison.

Regarding Tesla’s lawsuit on Dr. Cao Guangzhi XPeng accused Tesla for being a bully in one statement regarding its request to show XPeng ’s source code “During the litigation process Tesla exerted bullying behaviour against a young competitor instead of trying to resolve the legal case against Dr. Cao on the basis of facts which is regrettable.”

It all came about at a time when the Trump administration was weighing heavily on punishing China’s intellectual property misconducts since 2017 when the USTR declared the initiation to investigate China on the topic of technology transfer and intellectual property rights thus begging an arduous trade war that has adversely impacted both countries. Only with the signing of Economic and Trade Agreement between the United States and China in January 2020 did hope rise for ending the struggles.

The settlement between Tesla and Dr. Cao includes Cao’s monetary payment to Tesla the amount of which was not disclosed. Dr Cao states that he “is gratified that Tesla has finally dismissed its claims and stopped its search for evidence that does not exist.” And “he is eager to move on to new chapters in his personal and professional life and he thanks his family and friends for their support.”

The first target is to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the company’s operations by 2035.

Reducing emissions has favourable implications for a range of sustainability issues that Ford stakeholders have said matter most. All of which get attention in the newly issued report. Combining sustainability and financial performance in a single report Ford said is significant.

“Ford has always been about building a better world where people have the freedom to move and pursue their dreams” said John Lawler the company’s chief financial officer. “Success in sustainability requires a financially healthy business and financial health depends on effectiveness in sustainability areas.

“Combining those topics in a single report reflects that more than ever investors and other stakeholders want to know not only what you plan to do but what you’re accomplishing and how you’re managing risks along the way.”

Highlights in the integrated report include Ford’s large-scale social response to the COVID-19 pandemic; significant investment in and initial launches of high-volume zero-emission electric vehicles; and actions to protect human rights and create greater diversity equity and inclusion within the company.

Earning Trust

In addition to keeping each other safe amid COVID-19 in part by shutting down and then responsibly restarting worldwide manufacturing operations a year ago Ford has gone to great lengths to address social needs created by the global pandemic. Through its ‘Project Apollo’ the company has developed made and delivered vital medical and personal protective equipment.

To date the company has produced nearly 160 million face masks; more than 20 million face shields; 1.6 million washable isolation gowns; 50000 patient ventilators with GE Healthcare; and more than 32000 powered air-purifying respirators in a collaboration with 3M. Additionally virus-related contributions through the Ford Motor Company Fund philanthropic arm included $1.13 million to relief programmes worldwide.

Electrifying the Future Clearing the Air

Through 2025 Ford plans to invest more than $22 billion to engineer and introduce connected electric vehicles which includes EV versions of some its most popular nameplates. Shipments of the highly anticipated Mustang Mach-E in North America began in 2020 followed by Europe in early 2021 and later this year in China. All-electric Transit commercial vans will be introduced towards the end of 2021 and a battery-electric F-150 is scheduled for launch in 2022.

Ford last month announced that its entire commercial vehicle line-up in Europe will be zero-emissions capable by 2024. One-hundred per cent of the company’s passenger vehicles in the region will be zero-emissions capable by mid-2026 and entirely battery-electric by 2030.

To expand production capacity for EVs Ford in 2020 started construction of the new Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn where the all-electric F-150 will be built. In February 2021 the company announced a $1-billion investment to create the Ford Cologne Electrification Center in Germany.

Investments in Dearborn and Cologne manufacturing together with another $1 billion announced in February to transform operations in Pretoria South Africa will further help reduce Ford’s overall carbon footprint. Through improved energy efficiency and conservation initiatives Ford today generates 40% less carbon from its facilities and manufacturing processes around the globe. An additional goal is to use 100% locally sourced renewable electricity at all Ford plants by 2035.

“We will lead in achieving carbon neutrality because it’s the right thing for customers the planet and Ford” said Bob Holycross vice-president Sustainability Environment and Safety Engineering. “Ninety-five per cent of our carbon emissions today come from our vehicles operations and suppliers and we’re tackling all three of those sources with urgency and optimism.”",,,,,,

Generation Z displays strikingly different entertainment preferences than older age groups according to Deloitte’s 2021 Digital Media Trends survey. Among Gen Z consumers in the U.S. (those currently aged 14-24) video games are their No. 1 entertainment activity — and watching TV or movies at home comes in fifth.

About 26% of Gen Z said video games are their top entertainment activity and 87% of those in the age bracket said they play video games daily or weekly. That’s followed by listening to music (14%) browsing the internet (12%) and engaging on social media (11%).

Only 10% of Gen Z respondents said watching TV or movies was their favorite entertainment pastime the Deloitte study found. For every other age group that remains the top pick including among millennials (18%) Gen Xers (29%) and boomers (39%).

The decline in TV viewing among younger demos has been documented. But what’s concerning for Hollywood is that the new data could signal a seismic and permanent shift in consumers’ entertainment habits said Kevin Westcott vice chairman at Deloitte and U.S. technology media and telecom leader.

Popular on Variety

“The youngest generation is looking for video games music and other forms of entertainment” ahead of television and movies Westcott said. “If you’re a traditional media company you’re going have to offer a broader range of entertainment than just movies and TV shows.”

To be sure while video games have seen a dramatic surge in usage during the COVID-19 crisis the popularity of online gaming may ebb with quarantine restrictions easing. A solid majority of Gen Z millennials and Generation X respondents said that during the pandemic video games have helped them stay connected to other people and get through difficult times. About 46% of those said playing video games has reduced time spent with other forms of entertainment.

Still Gen Z’s predilection for video games stand to have long-lasting ramifications for the media biz. “Everybody believed that when millennials aged up they would adopt the same media behaviors as older cohorts. That didn’t happen” he said. “And there’s no evidence that Gen Z will become like millennials.”

Top 5 Entertainment Activities of U.S. Consumers by Age Group

Other findings from the Deloitte survey:

U.S. consumers on average have access to four paid video streaming services; 82% subscribe to at least one paid streaming video service.

The churn rate (percentage account cancellations) for streaming video services has jumped during COVID: That was about 37% between October 2020 and February 2021 (compared with under 20% pre-pandemic).

A price increase is the No. 1 reason consumers cited for canceling a paid video music or gaming service. Content (35%) and cost (46%) are the most important factors in deciding to subscribe to a new paid streaming video service.

55% of consumers say they watch free ad-supported video services; 40% say they would prefer to pay $12 a month for a streaming video service with no ads versus 60% of consumers who would accept some ads for a reduction in monthly subscription costs.

53% of those surveyed are frustrated by needing multiple service subscriptions to access the content they want.

66% of U.S. consumers say they get frustrated when content they want to watch is removed from a service.

Half of Gen Z consumers rank social media as the No. 1 way they prefer to get news whereas only 12% prefer to get news from network or cable TV. By contrast 58% of boomers say they prefer news on network or cable TV and only 8% look to social media first for news stories.

77% of respondents say the government must do more to regulate data collection and use; 45% say they would pay for social media if it didn’t collect their data.

The data in the study is weighted to reflect the composition of the U.S. population.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZGlnaWRheS5jb20vc3BvbnNvcmVkL2hvdy1hdWRpby1wcm9ncmFtbWF0aWMtaXMtdW5sb2NraW5nLXNjcmVlbi1mcmVlLWNhbXBhaWducy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How programmatic audio is unlocking 'screen-free' campaigns,"In recent years there has been rapid growth in audio content available for streaming. Last year 2020 was a particularly big moment for audio growth one characterized by a massive shift in lifestyle. Many adults went from commuting to an office to working from home. As a result they developed new habits and preferences. One of those new habits was consuming digital audio.

Throughout 2020 the time U.S. adults spent with digital audio grew 8.3%. They spent nearly 90 minutes with digital audio per day. Digital audio apps such as Spotify and Pandora reported increased usage through smart speakers and smart TVs and increased use at unusual times of the day as well: Weekday usage resembled weekend usage demonstrating that users were spending more time with digital audio than ever before.

Podcasts also saw an unexpected spike in popularity because long-form audio engagement became easier to undertake at any time. According to Edison One and Triton Digital’s latest ‘Infinite Dial’ survey in 2020 37% of U.S. adults listened to at least one podcast each month up from 32% in 2019. While podcasts have certainly been gaining traction music streaming has already become a significant part of people’s lives. Today more than half of the U.S. population reports listening to music daily. This is impressive when compared with other channels. For example 40% of adults in the U.S. watch video on connected TV (CTV) daily and audio is proving to be just as popular.

Growth in audio adoption has helped uncover trends about audio listeners and usage. One notable aspect of audio is how engaging it is for listeners. Edison Research reports that 70% of monthly podcast listeners don’t do anything else while listening to a podcast. It is worth noting the demographic that it reaches as well: Audio is popular among digitally savvy millennials and Gen Z a younger demographic that represents significant buying power. These trends begin to demonstrate why a new opportunity exists for digital advertisers as digital audio continues to gain traction.

Digital audio is proving an especially effective format for capturing a listener’s full attention. Listeners feel intimately connected to the content they are hearing which sets the stage for a better connection between listeners and brands. Including audio in a digital marketing strategy is enabling marketing teams to reach quality audiences in screen-free moments — and the personal nature of audio results in audio ads having a lasting memorable effect.

Audio programmatic advertising presents a prime opportunity for building screen-free campaigns that can be integrated into an existing digital strategy. It can work in tandem with other channels such as native display video and CTV. An audio campaign can build brand awareness and help with general prospecting. From there a multi-channel campaign will continue to nurture that audience and drive conversions.

Opportunities also lie in the demographics of the audiences that audio programmatic reaches. A young listenership means audio presents the chance to reach an audience entering or already in their prime spending years. By connecting with millennials and Gen Z through audio brands can form long-lasting relationships that with nurturing will result in a higher customer lifetime value for years to come.

Based on recent months’ trends the growth in digital audio saw a meaningful acceleration in 2020. Looking forward this change in behavior is not likely to disappear.

Users have developed new listening habits that are expected to stick even post-pandemic. With this growth digital marketers are seizing the opportunity to leverage the power of programmatic advertising to expand their reach and speak directly to the audience (no pun intended).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9hY2VyLWFzcGlyZS01LTIwMjEtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Acer Aspire 5 2021 Review: Budget laptop takes a step back,"Acer Aspire 5 (2021) review: Not easy on the eyes MSRP $480.00 Score Details “The Acer Aspire 5's awful display ruins what would have been a decent budget laptop.” Pros Solid connectivity

I received an entry-level model with a Core i3-1115G4 CPU with Intel UHD graphics 8GB of RAM a 256GB PCIe solid-state drive (SSD) and a 15.6-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) display. The price for this Aspire 5 configuration is $480 keeping it in that under-$500 segment that past models have owned. Can Acer maintain its track record with the latest Aspire 5?

Design

Acer tweaked the Aspire 5’s design for 2021 with the biggest change being a new hinge that angles the chassis bottom several degrees to provide for better airflow and prop up the keyboard. It’s a welcome change to an otherwise mundane design.

As before the lid is aluminum while the rest of the chassis is plastic and the rigidity is the same as before. There’s quite a bit of flexing in the lid while the keyboard deck and chassis bottom are slightly more rigid but will still give in to light pressure. Some other budget laptops like the Lenovo Yoga C640 Lenovo Flex 5 14 and Acer Swift 3 have more solid build quality.

Aesthetically the Aspire 5 is rather boring with an all-black color scheme broken up with a few chrome Acer logos. If you don’t care about how a laptop looks and focus exclusively on the price then the Aspire 5 will satisfy your tastes. But it certainly doesn’t stand out. Other colors will be available including a silver scheme which are likely to be more attractive than my bland black review unit.

The Aspire 5 isn’t a small laptop thanks to bezels that are still too large for modern machines. The side bezels aren’t too thick but the top and bottom bezels could use some slimming down which results in a laptop that’s wider and deeper than it might otherwise be. The Aspire 5 weighs 3.64 pounds which is down from 3.97 pounds in the previous version and it’s 0.70 inches thick both of which are reasonable for a 15-inch laptop.

One particularly nice design feature that’s been common to the Aspire 5 is its expandability. Access to the inside of the machine is relatively easy allowing users to swap out the RAM and SSD. Acer also includes a kit for adding a 2.5-inch drive to an empty bay making it easy to expand storage with either an SSD or a spinning hard disk drive (HDD). That kind of expandability is rare and it’s welcome here.

As with many budget laptops that aren’t so thin and light as some previous models connectivity is mostly a strength. You get an Ethernet connector a full-size HDMI port two USB-A 3.2 ports and a USB-C 3.2 port along the left-hand side (no Thunderbolt 4 support here). You’ll find a Kensington lock slot a USB-A 2.0 port and a 3.5mm audio jack along the right-hand side. Wireless connectivity is up-to-date with Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1.

Performance

My review unit was equipped with a Core i3-1115G4 a dual-core 11th-gen CPU that runs at the full TDP of 12 watts to 28 watts but incorporates Intel UHD graphics rather than the newer Intel Iris Xe. According to our suite of benchmarks this is a slow laptop. Starting with Geekbench 5 it scored just 1215 in single-core mode and 2544 in multi-core mode. That’s well below the usual Tiger Lake score that typically exceeds 1500 in single-core and 5000 in multi-core. In fact it’s beaten out by some recent Chromebooks running the Android version of Geekbench 5 which is usually a rather slow proposition. Even the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 with an Intel Core i3-10110U was close at 1003 and 2179.

In our Handbrake test that encodes a 420MB video as H.265 the Aspire 5 took five minutes exactly which is at best 50% slower than the slowest Tiger Lake laptops we’ve tested. This is the first 11th-gen Core i3 that we’ve tested and so all our comparison laptops are running faster CPUs. As an example the Lenovo ThinkPad X12 Detachable a Windows 10 tablet equipped with a Core i5-1130G7 (a slower Core i5) took just over three minutes to complete the test. The same held in Cinebench R23 another video-rendering test where the Aspire 5 managed just 1247 in single-core mode and 3128 in multi-core mode. Here the difference between the Aspire 5 and the ThinkPad X12 Detachable (1125 and 3663) wasn’t as great but most other Tiger Lake laptops once again were significantly faster.

In the PCMark 10 Complete test the Aspire 5 scored just 3752 our lowest score ever. It hit just 8220 in the Essentials portion of the test 5975 in Productivity and a paltry 2921 in Content Creation. The ThinkPad X12 Detachable hit 4443 9999 5936 and 4157 respectively. As with our other tests the Aspire 5 lags the field by a significant margin.

I found the Aspire 5 to be fast enough for basic tasks like web browsing and working in Office documents in real-life use. For $480 these aren’t terrible results. We didn’t test the previous versions of the Aspire 5 using the same suite of benchmark tests and so we can’t directly compare their performance.

Display

I’m not going to mince words here: This is the worst display I’ve ever reviewed. That fact was evident the minute I first booted the Acer Aspire 5 and logged into Windows 10. The display has a distinct blue cast to it that I believe is the result of atrocious contrast and on-screen elements could be difficult to discern.

My colorimeter agreed with me. Brightness was very low at 211 meaning you’ll struggle to view the screen in bright office environments. The contrast was confirmed as exceedingly bad at just 60:1 (our threshold for a great display is 1000:1 and an average budget display is 600:1). Colors were poor as well with just 53% of sRGB and 40% of AdobeRGB — both are the lowest in our database and the typical midrange and premium displays hit 95% and 70% or higher respectively. To add insult to injury accuracy was also among the worst I’ve seen at a DeltaE of 10.7 (less than 1.0 is considered excellent and most laptops are under 3.0 at worst). Only the display’s gamma was where it should be at 2.2.

Nobody will like using this display.

In actual use colors were washed out black text was more of a grayish color and the display was absolutely unpleasant. It’s my new standard for “terrible display” and it left a horrible taste in my mouth because of it. Nobody will like this display unless they’ve never used a laptop before and I’d pity them because they’d come away with such a poor impression of the state of the art. Acer needs to source a different panel because this one is just flat-out horrible. The 2019 and 2020 versions of the Aspire 5 were much better.

The audio wasn’t much better than the display. Volume was inadequate for all but the occasional YouTube video although there was no distortion when turned all the way up. Mids and highs were clear enough and as usual there was little to no bass. The dual speakers aren’t bad mind you they just don’t offer much better than budget quality.

Keyboard and touchpad

The Aspire 5 sports a fairly typical backlit island keyboard with black keycaps and white letters. The keys are a little small but they provide comfortable spacing even with the dedicated (but tiny) numeric keypad. The switches are very light with a nice snap and comfortable bottoming action. This is one area where the Aspire 5 shines offering a typing feel that’s better than you get with many budget laptops.

The touchpad is also surprisingly good as it’s quite large and responsive. It’s a Microsoft Precision touchpad and so provides reliable support for Windows 10’s multitouch gestures. It too exceeds the budget norm.

There’s no touch display unsurprisingly and as usual I miss it. There’s also no Windows 10 Hello support neither facial recognition nor a fingerprint scanner. That’s something that we’ve seen on budget laptops lately and so its omission here stands out.

Battery life

Acer equipped the Aspire 5 with 48 watt-hours of battery which isn’t a lot for a 15-inch laptop. Even with the slower CPU I was disappointed with this version’s battery life.

In our web-browsing test that loops through a series of popular websites the Aspire 5 managed just under seven hours two hours less than the 2019 version with a Core i3 but three hours longer than the 2020 version with a Core i5. Generally speaking that’s not a terrible score but it still puts the Aspire 5 in the lower bracket in our database. In our video-looping test that plays a Full HD Avengers trailer until the battery runs out the Aspire 5 made it to 9.5 hours. That’s about 3.5 hours less than the 2020 version and below the minimum of 10 hours we like to see on this test. Again not a terrible result but not great either.

Finally I ran a couple of PCMark 10 battery tests. The first the Gaming test evaluates how long a laptop lasts with the CPU and GPU being stressed. The Aspire 5 came in at 2.25 hours an average score. In the Applications test which is the best measure of productivity longevity the Aspire 5 shut down after just under eight hours at the low end of our database. The ThinkPad X12 Detachable for example made it to over 10 hours.

Overall the Aspire 5’s battery life was mediocre. If you’re doing typical productivity work you might make it through a workday on a charge. The laptop uses a proprietary charger but you can top up using USB-C in a pinch if you happen to have an adapter handy.

Our take

I’d love to say that the 2021 Acer Aspire 5 maintains its place as our best budget laptop under $500. Unfortunately it doesn’t thanks to slow performance and an abysmal display. The 2020 model is still on sale and you’re better off sticking with it.

Is there a better alternative?

As I just mentioned the 2020 Aspire 5 is a better choice than the 2021 version. You’ll get a much better display and a similar build quality for around the same money and you won’t give up much in the way of performance and battery life.

If I were looking for a better budget machine in this price range I’d consider a capable Chromebook option of which there are plenty.

The Lenovo Flex 5 14 with its AMD Ryzen CPU is another alternative. Its display is smaller at 14 inches but it gets better battery life is much faster and its display won’t embarrass you in public.

How long will it last?

It’s not the most robust-feeling laptop but I have a suspicion that it will last for a few years of solid use — which is about what you expect for the money. You’ll have up-to-date components including Wi-Fi 6 although no Thunderbolt 4 is a bummer. The one-year warranty also isn’t anything to get excited about.

Should you buy it?

No. The display is truly horrible which ruins the experience of using this laptop.

Brendan Gibbs VP of Automated WAN Solutions at Juniper Networks has published a blog post to explain “why Cloud Metro is such a big deal.”

Gibbs ask us to “Look at it this way: take a look at a state-of-the-art cloud data centre for a large organisation. Instead of running in one central location it’s distributed across thousands of smaller sites close to end users.

“The data centre still provides the cloud scale and elasticity that operators expect.

“But now the organisation deploying it can push and pull those resources across vast geographies right up to where they’re needed and close to the end user with assured performance and extremely low latency.

“Suddenly a new generation of 5G edge and Internet of Things (IoT) services become possible. And large service provider and enterprise networks are the engines that power it all.""

Before we can get there Gibbs says “we need to start thinking differently about a part of the network that’s been overlooked for too long: the metro.

And by ‘metro’ Gibbs says he means “that critical part of the infrastructure today that handles access and aggregation where all the many things accessing the network come together.

“To unleash tomorrow’s digital experiences we must rethink our basic ideas about how metros are architected how we operate them and even what they’re used for.”

Introducing the Cloud Metro for a Changing Landscape

In the next few years Gibbs says “metro traffic will grow 4x faster than anywhere else in the network—and most of it will stay there serving distributed edge services.

“The lines separating different parts of the network and services (business residential mobile xHaul) will get blurrier. And new distributed 5G and edge services will push nearly a third of all workloads out to edge clouds.

“Traditional metro networks built to trombone traffic through a centralised core won’t get the job done. To capitalise on new 5G and edge opportunities network operators need a network built around experience-driven outcomes not connectivity. They need a Cloud Metro.”

We’re told Juniper’s Cloud Metro vision “reimagines today’s siloed point-to-point metro networks as a single versatile IP services fabric.

“Unlike today’s fragmented architectures a Cloud Metro is built for resource-pooling network slicing and automated cloud-based operations.

“It interfaces with both physical and virtual network functions to offer distributed services closer to the end user.

“It intelligently distributes user plane functions and the service edge wherever needed to maximise efficiency and quality. Plus it uses a cloud-like architecture to bring cloud agility and resiliency to metro networks.”

in his own words Gibbs explains the Cloud Metro solution is built on three core pillars:

Massively scalable IP services fabric: Juniper offers a comprehensive portfolio of platforms optimized to support any Cloud Metro use case. That includes options to move up to cloud-scale link and interface speeds (including 400G ZR/ZR+) and the latest optical technologies. And it includes platforms that meet the most stringent timing and synchronization requirements for ultra-low latency 5G enterprise services.

- All offer the same consistent behavior with the same automation and a “One Junos experience” across all platforms. At the same time an IP services fabric enables network operators to scale up with current ring topologies but also to use scale-out topologies.

- These improve metro scalability and reliability while freeing up huge amounts of protected bandwidth that currently go unused.To enhance this services fabric Juniper is announcing two new additions to the Metro portfolio. These new platforms designed for both metro and data center use cases bring 4.8-Tbps of forwarding ASIC capacity and 400GbE interfaces with support for ZR/ZR+ optics to the ACX family :

The ACX7100-48L  a high-capacity high-density aggregation router is designed for the most demanding 5G use cases offering highly flexible configuration of native 10GE 25GE and 50GE on service ports. The ACX7100-32C  a high-capacity secure router delivers high fan-out density for flexible 100/400GbE use cases.

They can help automate the end-to-end service lifecycle from initial provisioning to continuous assurance. And they enable closed-loop automation to optimize Cloud Metro performance.

""Together"" says Gibbs ""these capabilities create a foundation for a world of new 5G edge and IoT services. And they enable superior end-user experiences—all automatically measured and assured.""

Expanding Metro Capabilities

What can network operators do with a Cloud Metro from Juniper? For starters they can:

Use one converged network for all use cases: A Cloud Metro converges all metro use cases—residential business mobile xHaul transport—onto a single converged architecture with a single operational model. Network operators can apply special treatment to different traffic and service types under different service-level agreements (SLAs) and over the same infrastructure.

Network operators can apply special treatment to different traffic and service types under different service-level agreements (SLAs) and over the same infrastructure. Enable agile service delivery: A Cloud Metro intelligently steers traffic to the right physical and virtualized resources in the most efficient way to optimize the user experience. It optimizes capacity and utilization with CUPS and modern traffic engineering protocols. And it uses our unique Active Assurance technology to measure actual service quality—not just infer it based on passive testing—and ensure that each slice meets the required SLA.

It optimizes capacity and utilization with CUPS and modern traffic engineering protocols. And it uses our unique Active Assurance technology to measure actual service quality—not just infer it based on passive testing—and ensure that each slice meets the required SLA. Support both brownfield and greenfield environments: No matter at what point network operators start they can evolve toward a Cloud Metro architecture. When building out a new greenfield deployment they can build a metro that looks and acts like a cloud scale-out environment. Meanwhile they can scale up capacity and intelligence in existing ring topologies with both architectures coexisting in the same network. Network operators can also gradually migrate traffic while improving resiliency and agility as they go.

Reimagine the Metro

Gibbs ends by noting “the looming 5G IoT and cloud era brings incredible opportunity for businesses in every industry—and a host of daunting new challenges.

“Many of these challenges can only be solved by operators and their transformed networks. But network operators won’t be able to meet these challenges by relying on a metro designed for yesterday’s static transport and aggregation needs.

“With a Cloud Metro network operators can drive down the costs and complexity of today’s siloed metro architectures and operations. More importantly they can add unique value to the most exciting new 5G and edge applications.

“They can be the sole player in the digital ecosystem that brings cloud resources and intelligence closer to end users while providing the latencies timing and guaranteed performance to make next-generation digital experiences possible.”

The UK's biggest defence company BAE Systems (BA.L) has submitted a bid for a contract to supply the US army with new armoured vehicles.

Other companies including US-based General Dynamics (GD) and Germany’s Rheinmetall (RHM.DE) are believed to have entered the race to replace the Bradley armoured fighting vehicles BAE originally built.

Rather than submitting finalised designs the US army is asking defence firms to submit ""concepts"" for the new vehicles inviting them to be imaginative and utilise technology.

But there are some requirements companies should consider.

The army has requested that the new vehicles should have a crew of no more than two as well as be able carry out some missions while being controlled remotely and utilise automatic systems.

America has roughly 7000 of the conventional design tracked M2 Bradley vehicles.

The Bradley vehicles feature a turret equipped with a heavy machine gun and anti-tank missiles and is operated by a crew of three and can carry a squad of six troops.

The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) firm’s US arm has formally submitted a proposal for the US military’s ""Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle"" the Telegraph first reported.

According to the newspaper the contract could be worth as much as $45bn (£32.6bn).

BAE is said to be working with the US arm of Israeli defence firm Elbit Systems's (ESLT) on the design of the vehicle's integrated turret. But the company has not revealed much else about its concept.

Yahoo Finance has approached BAE Systems for comment.

In March the company announced that it received a $21m contract from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to support the Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) over the next four and a half years.

“The UK Ministry of Defence has been a key partner on CMWS for decades” said Christopher Austin BAE Systems’ director of Threat Detection Solutions. “It is a privilege to continue to help ensure the safety of our ally’s aircraft and personnel with the protection of CMWS.”

Last week it was revealed that the company gave its CEO a £2m pay rise in order to prevent a rival company from poaching him.

The defence contractor said it has given Charles Woodburn 50 a base salary increase of more than £100000 and awarded him an additional share package worth £2m ($2.7m) to ensure he stayed at the firm.

Ford-class these ten carriers will still strike fear into potential U.S. adversaries for many years to come.

At 1092 feet the Nimitz-class supercarriers are more than three times the length of a football field and with a crew of 3200 sailors and 2480 airmen these are essentially floating cities. The lead ship of the class USS Nimitz – nicknamed ""Old Salt"" – was commissioned in May 1975 was named after Admiral Chester Nimitz who led the U.S. Navy through the Second World War.

The ship was first deployed to the Indian Ocean during the Iran Hostage Crisis and has since logged untold miles providing security at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games and later service in the Persian Gulf after Operation Desert Storm. Most recently USS Nimitz was deployed against ISIS in Iraq and Syria where her F/A-18s took part in the Battle of Afar in 2017.

A total of 10 Nimitz-class carriers have been built and the last of the class USS George H.W. Bush was commissioned in January 2009. These nuclear-powered carriers which have two reactors and four shafts for propulsion with a top speed of 30+ knots (34.5mph) were the largest warships in the world until the USS Gerald R. Ford the lead ship of her class of carriers entered service in 2017. Each of the Nimitz-class has an expected 50-year service life with one mid-life refueling. These warships which have a displacement of 102000 tons were all built by Huntington Ingalls Industries Newport News Shipbuilding (now Northrop Grumman Ship Systems) based in Virginia at a unit cost of approximately $8.5 billion (constant year FY 12 dollars).

Each carrier has approximately 60 aircraft onboard and this includes a variety of fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft with up to 90 of various types. Typical aircraft on a Nimitz-class carrier include 12 F/A-18E/F Hornets 36 F/A-18 Hornets four E-2C Hawkeyes and four EA-6B Prowlers fixed-wing and helicopters including four SH-60F and two HH-60H Seahawks. In addition the carriers could also deploy the S-3B Viking before these were phased out and replaced the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. The flight deck which measures 1092 feet by 252 feet is equipped with four lifts four steam-driven catapults and four arrester wires. The carriers are capable of launching one air every 20 seconds.

The air wings of the carriers are customized according to the nature of operations with the usual air wings replaced with 50 army helicopters on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower for its operations in Haiti in 1994. Similar considerations can be made when a carrier is used for disaster response and humanitarian assistance.

In addition to the aircraft the mostly recently built Nimitz-class carriers are now armed with three Raytheon GMLS mk29 eight-cell launchers for NATO Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missiles which has semi-radar terminal guidance. There are also four Raytheon/General Dynamics 20mm Phalanx six-barreled Mk15 close-in weapons systems that have a 3000rpm rate of fire.

While the last of the Nimitz-class carriers has been commissioned and the class will eventually be replaced by the Gerald R. Ford-class these ten carriers will still strike fear into potential U.S. adversaries for many years to come.

As a young pediatric oncologist Kevin Heller was struck by the power of bone marrow transplants. While working at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the early 2000s he saw how hematopoietic stem cells taken from a donor’s bone marrow and infused into children with blood cancer could save lives. But the process came at a cost. Before getting the transplant the kids had to endure what doctors call conditioning typically a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy that clears out diseased cells and makes space in the bone marrow for the incoming healthy ones.

“It is like giving a hard reset to these patients but we had to bring these poor kids to the brink of death” Heller says. The collateral damage caused by conditioning can be significant. Risks include severe infection organ damage developmental problems in young people and infertility. And since the chemotherapies commonly used in conditioning damage DNA the process can even trigger new cancers. Conditioning is “incredibly difficult” to endure he says. “And there have been only minor steps of improvement.”

Last year Heller who eventually left academia to lead oncology teams at multiple drug companies joined and became vice president of R&D at a start-up called Jasper Therapeutics which is trying to make conditioning safer and more effective. It is one of a handful of companies—including Actinium Pharmaceuticals Gilead Sciences and Magenta Therapeutics—developing antibody-based therapies designed to selectively remove hematopoietic stem cells with fewer side effects than traditional conditioning.

If these targeted conditioning therapies prove successful they could make stem cell transplants more attractive for treating a broader range of diseases—including ones like chronic autoimmune diseases or genetic disorders in which the tolerance for dangerous side effects is much lower than it is for treating cancer. “I think there are a lot of patients who could benefit from stem cell transplantation but physicians wouldn’t consider it because of the severe side effect profile and the incredible risk associated with conditioning” Heller says.

Targeted conditioning

Since hematopoietic stem cells give rise to all our blood and immune cells stem cell transplants can in theory treat a bevy of conditions linked to those stem cells or their progeny. “Stem cell transplants cure patients. We know they work” Magenta CEO Jason Gardner says. “But they are not used as often as they could be.” According to Magenta’s market research only about 60% of people with cancer 34% of people with genetic diseases and 5% of people with autoimmune conditions who are eligible to get stem cell transplants actually undergo the procedure. And some people are ineligible because they are too weak to undergo the harsh conditioning.

Biotech companies are becoming more interested in targeted conditioning and alternatives to conditioning partly because of growing investments in gene-modified stem cells to treat genetic diseases such as hemophilia and sickle cell disease. “It is something that we think about a lot” says Josh Lehrer CEO of the new CRISPR gene-editing company Graphite Bio which has partnered with Jasper to test its targeted conditioning therapy. “To even be compelling to a patient you have to offer these kinds of curative therapies in a different way.”

Doctors first began using bone marrow transplants to try to reset people’s cancer-ridden blood systems more than 60 years ago. Resetting the system first required wiping it clean with chemotherapy and radiation which sometimes led to deaths from the conditioning itself. Although doctors can tailor the level of conditioning depending on a person’s disease the nuts and bolts of conditioning haven’t changed much in 20 years.

Researchers hope to make conditioning safer and gentler—or in some cases eliminate the need for it altogether. The most advanced efforts use antibodies to target proteins on the surface of hematopoietic stem cells and ultimately kill them. Two popular targets are proteins called CD45 and CD117.

Actinium is focused on targeting CD45 for conditioning for cancer and genetic diseases. Chief Scientific Officer Dale Ludwig says it is a good target because CD45 is found exclusively on hematopoietic stem cells and the immune cells they give rise to not on red blood cells or platelets which are also descendants of hematopoietic stem cells. Actinium’s CD45-targeted antibody is labeled with radioactive iodine (131I) which should provide a means to selectively deliver the radiation to and thus kill cells that have CD45 on their surface. The approach should have fewer side effects than traditional radiotherapy. Actinium is testing the antibody as a conditioning reagent for people with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.

David Scadden a Harvard University stem cell biologist and Magenta cofounder thinks that CD117 which is found in abundance on hematopoietic stem cells and to a lesser extent on their progeny is the best target for cancer and genetic diseases. He thinks CD45 is a better target for autoimmune diseases. Magenta is using its CD117-targeted antibody-drug conjugate to deliver a lethal mushroom-derived toxin called amanitin to kill cells with CD117 on their surface. Jasper’s CD117-targeted antibody which it licensed from Amgen works by preventing a protein called stem cell factor from binding to CD117. That blockade weakens or kills the hematopoietic stem cells Heller says.

To even be compelling to a patient you have to offer these kinds of curative therapies in a different way. Josh Lehrer CEO Graphite Bio

These first iterations of targeted conditioning mainly geared toward cancer won’t completely eliminate traditional chemotherapy or radiation. Jasper and Magenta both plan on using reduced-intensity conditioning alongside their CD117-targeted antibodies which simply means using smaller doses of chemotherapy radiation or both. When treating cancer “you need to get every weed out” Heller says.

Another potential problem is that CD117 is not restricted to hematopoietic stem cells. The protein is found on cells in other parts of the body including in the skin in the vascular system and on germ cells. Targeted conditioning aimed at CD117 may not fully eliminate all serious side effects including infertility. And even if targeted conditioning proves to be safer than traditional conditioning the stem cell transplant itself is not guaranteed to work and the method won’t eliminate transplant-associated risks such as immune rejection.

Some scientists are skeptical that targeted conditioning will ever be potent enough for blood cancer and they caution that any lingering cells could cause the cancer to relapse. “Antibody-based targeted therapy needs some optimization in my opinion” says Monzr M. Al Malki a cell transplant physician at City of Hope a hospital and research center in Duarte California. “But don’t misunderstand me I believe that targeted conditioning is the future” he says adding that targeted conditioning can encompass more precise manipulation of chemotherapy and radiation. At City of Hope he uses an experimental body-scanning approach called total marrow and lymphoid irradiation to channel radiation to the bone marrow and minimize damage to other organs.

The bigger opportunity for the antibody-based conditioning therapies might be in genetic diseases where the weeding doesn’t need to be as complete as it does in blood cancers.

For a disease called severe combined immunodeficiency in which babies are born without white blood cells replacing as little as 1–2% of the hematopoietic stem cells could give the infant a properly functioning immune system. “The bar is fairly low there” Lehrer says and that’s why Graphite is testing Jasper’s CD117-targeted antibody in that condition first. For sickle cell disease Lehrer says that his company is aiming to replace at least 20% of a person’s stem cells. For now people joining Graphite’s clinical trial of its CRISPR-based sickle cell therapy will have to receive traditional conditioning although Graphite may test Jasper’s antibody in a future study for its sickle cell program.

Actinium Gilead and Magenta also have partnerships with academic groups or biotech companies to test their targeted conditioning antibodies in gene therapy applications. But most companies with programs that transplant gene-modified stem cells still rely on traditional conditioning typically with the chemotherapy busulfan and not targeted conditioning.

In February reports of two people who developed cancer years after receiving busulfan conditioning and Bluebird Bio’s gene therapy for sickle cell disease renewed concerns about the inherent risks of conditioning. Although Bluebird neither acquitted nor convicted busulfan as the cause of the cancer genetic tests suggested that the cancer was not caused by gene therapy itself.

It is like giving a hard reset to these patients but we had to bring these poor kids to the brink of death. Kevin Heller vice president of R&D Jasper Therapeutics

Busulfan which damages DNA is a known carcinogen but some gene therapy firms think that experienced physicians can manage its risks. One difficulty is that people metabolize busulfan at wildly different rates which makes precise dosing hard to achieve says Chris Mason chief scientific officer of Avrobio. His company collaborated with a blood diagnostics firm to make a kit that allows physicians to monitor and adjust the dose of busulfan that patients receive during conditioning.

A few groups are thinking about ways to circumvent conditioning altogether at least for genetic diseases. A 2019 study from Hiromitsu Nakauchi a stem cell biologist at Stanford University upended the dogma that transplants won’t succeed without conditioning. His lab discovered a way to spur mouse hematopoietic stem cells to grow to nearly 900 times their original numbers under special conditions in a petri dish in under a month. Surprisingly when the cells were transplanted back into a mouse some of the cells engrafted in the bone marrow without any conditioning. He has started a company called Celaid Therapeutics to apply the idea to human stem cells too.

Another way to sidestep conditioning in gene therapy applications is to modify the stem cells directly in a person’s body rather than removing them modifying them in a lab and reinfusing them. Ensoma is one start-up in the early stages of designing viral vectors that deliver genes preferentially to hematopoietic stem cells. “This could be done in an outpatient clinic” no conditioning required says Ensoma’s executive chairman Paula Soteropoulos. Jasper is also exploring ways to engineer stem cells that “outpace existing stem cells in the patient” and engraft without the need for conditioning according to Heller.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3RoZXByaW50LmluL29waW5pb24vbmV3c21ha2VyLW9mLXRoZS13ZWVrL2luZGlhLWhhcy1hLXJlbWRlc2l2aXItcHJvYmxlbS1kb2VzbnQta25vdy13aGVyZS10by1nZXQtaXQtdW5zdXJlLWlmLWl0LXRyZWF0cy1jb3ZpZC82NDEyNTUv0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcHJpbnQuaW4vb3Bpbmlvbi9uZXdzbWFrZXItb2YtdGhlLXdlZWsvaW5kaWEtaGFzLWEtcmVtZGVzaXZpci1wcm9ibGVtLWRvZXNudC1rbm93LXdoZXJlLXRvLWdldC1pdC11bnN1cmUtaWYtaXQtdHJlYXRzLWNvdmlkLzY0MTI1NS8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India has a remdesivir problem — doesn’t know where to get it unsure if it treats Covid,"Due to its short supply Twitter Instagram and Facebook are seeing dozens of messages and posts every hour from Indians who need remdisivir.

India’s Covid-19 battle has been hit by a bigger ‘second wave’ with the number of cases per day crossing two lakh. What has compounded the problem though is that several states have reported a shortage of vaccines and medicines. The Narendra Modi government has refuted the claims even as it fast-tracked emergency approval for foreign-produced vaccines. But as the battle for vaccine intensifies doctors and relatives of patients alike have come to depend on a drug that hasn’t even been proven to be effective in treating Covid-19 — the anti-viral injection remdesivir. And its demand has been such that it too has run into the problem of short supply  so much so that the Modi government has now banned its export and also decided to ramp up the drug’s production to twice the present capacity — around 78 lakh vials per month.

But India’s clamour for remdesivir sounds like a misfit against the World Health Organization (WHO)’s advice. The WHO had said that there is no evidence to suggest that the antiviral drug can effectively treat Covid-19 patients. With no apparent benefits the drug suits only a small subset of people and in the majority of cases the doctors prescribe the drug either out of pressure from the patient’s relatives or because it is the only drug validated by the US’ Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for use in the treatment of Covid-19.

And yet social media is full of posts and WhatsApp messages from patients’ desperate relatives pleading and hunting for vials of remdesivir. Several Twitter users have mentioned receiving requests for the drug besides enquiries about beds ICUs and plasma. And that is why remdesivir is ThePrint’s Newsmaker of the Week.

The drug was in demand last year too. It was being sold in the black market for prices anywhere between Rs 15000 to Rs 60000. Even now police in Pune and elsewhere have been arresting people trying to sell remdesivir at exorbitant rates. Data released by research firm IQVIA showed that remdesivir registered total sales of Rs 593 crore in just six months since its launch — from July to December 2020.

Scientific evidence behind remdesivir

The largest trial organised by the WHO in 2020 — Solidarity Trial — had shown that remdesivir did not produce “any measurable benefit in mortality or disease course.”

However many smaller studies have shown benefits in limited windows of time such as during low-flow oxygen state in case of pneumonia or when a patient requires oxygen but has not yet progressed to the ventilator.

For instance the Adaptive Covid-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1) study sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health found that “remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery”.

Amesh Adalja senior scholar at the US-based Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said “Remdesivir is a beneficial drug. Its primary benefit is in getting patients out of the hospital faster. To be effective it should be used before a patient progresses to need a mechanical ventilator.”

However the WHO recommends against using remdesivir while different health agencies have imposed varying conditions on its usage in the treatment of Covid.

Based on data from 7333 patients in four studies (including the WHO Solidarity trial) remdesivir has no effect on mortality reducing the need for mechanical ventilation recovery from symptoms and other patient-important outcomes.

According to Dr Soumya Swaminathan chief scientist at WHO and Dr Maria Van Kerkhove the agency’s technical lead on Covid — quoted in a report by India Today — the results from five clinical trials on the drug had shown that it had not helped in the reduction of mortality or reducing the need for mechanical ventilation among hospitalised patients.

Why are doctors prescribing remdesivir?

The suggested adult dose of remdesivir is 200 mg intravenously on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for a total of five days.

“Theoretically it was thought to benefit if administered within nine days of symptoms onset because antivirals are maximally effective in earlier stages of the disease when the viruses are actively multiplying” said Dr S.P. Kalantri professor of medicine and medical superintendent at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences in Sevagram Maharashtra.

However he added that the clinical trials have shown otherwise.

“Given its limited availability cost need for five-day hospitalisation and more importantly no meaningful benefits physicians have started questioning if remdesivir is indeed worth the excitement and hope that it created.

“It hardly lived up to the hype that it succeeded in generating. Unfortunately it has already become part of the toolkit for battling the Covid-19” he said.

Another doctor treating Covid-19 patients in a government-run hospital in Delhi said they are still hoping that remdesivir will work because they have no other drug for the treatment. “In the absence of an authentic treatment for Covid-19 it is the only authorised drug by the US FDA. So probably the doctors have no choice and they hope that it works” he said while requesting anonymity.

Relatives’ only hope

Pressure from patients’ relatives is one of the top reasons the drug is being over-prescribed which has resulted in its shortage.

“Remdesivir should be used within 14 days of the onset of Covid-19 symptoms. However the families of the Covid-19 patients believe that it is a magical drug which might do wonders because of the hype created around the drug” said Sumit Ray head of department Critical Care Medicine Holy Family Hospital Delhi.

Ray compared remdesivir with plasma therapy.

“It has been proven that plasma therapy doesn’t work among Covid-19 patients but some hospitals continue to administer it and the families of patients ask us why we are not prescribing (it). The same is the case for remdesivir. The only benefit if any is the reduction in the length of hospitalisation in a small subset of selected patients” he said.

“In this wave we are witnessing younger patients admitted in ICUs and shifting on ventilators. In this condition should I wait for moderate patient to turn critical or will I apply all available options? The wave is like a tsunami that the demand of drug — which can be given in moderate cases — is so huge. Secondly it is being used by doctors to reduce patient’s stay in ICUs or hospital so that new patients can be taken. This is also one reason for more prescriptions” a senior doctor from a private hospital in Kolkata said.

The majority of the doctors refrained from speaking on the record because the drug has been suggested by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare although with the caution that its use can have adverse effects and the usual disclaimer about the drug having no benefits in terms of reduced mortality.

According to Dr Kamna Kakkar senior resident ICUs Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences Rohtak Haryana “the hype” around the drug has made people believe that remdesivir is a “life-saving drug”.

“Patients and their families won’t understand the specifics of the drug such as when it should be given and how it should be given. It’s not one-size-fits-all solution; instead it suits a very small subset of patients. We can call dexamethasone and other steroids as life-saving in critical cases probably not remdesivir.”

The panic buying of antiviral Remdesivir amid the surge of Covid-19 cases is yet again seeing a discussion on the use of the drug with little or significant benefit. Debates arising looking at the Solidarity trials results based on which the World Health Organisation had issued guidelines against the use of Remdesivir as there was little or no effect on overall mortality mechanical ventilation and duration of hospital stay of hospitalised covid-19 patients.The investigational broad-spectrum antiviral drug Remdesivir was initially manufactured in 2014 by biotechnology firm Gilead Sciences for targeting hepatitis C showed potent activity against Ebola virus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) however it didn’t meet much success.During the Covid-19 outbreak the drug was found to be effective in fighting coronavirus SARS-COV-2 but in few smaller studies.The National Institutes of Health(NIH) Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) results found that hospitalized patients with advanced Covid-19 and lung involvement who received Remdesivir had a faster recovery time than those who received placebo.According to medical doctors treating Covid-19 patients in India the drug does help in reducing the viral replication however they highlight that moderate to severe Covid-19 patients are being treated not only with Remdesivir but a combination of oxygen therapy vitamin supplements steroids and blood thinner at appropriate stages and that has been helping patients in recovering faster.The most critical factor in the effectiveness of Remdesivir is when was it administered to the patient.“Remdesivir should be used within the first 9 days from the onset of symptoms in moderate cases or patients who are progressing from moderate to severe. It should be used only for five days there is no point in using it for more than 5 days. There is no mortality benefit hence it is not a magic wand however it (Remdesivir) is the only antiviral medicine that is available right now so we need to use it properly” said Dr. Rahul Pandit who is the Director of Critical Care Medicine and ICU at Fortis Hospital.Given intravenously Remdesivir interrupts the production of the virus by interfering with one of the key enzymes the virus needs to replicate RNA and this prevents the virus from multiplying. The other drugs support in bringing ease to inflammation triggered by the virus.According to Bhatia Hospital’s Consultant Internist Dr Samrat D Shah Remdesivir is the only sure-shot antiviral drug that reduces that viral replication. ""It gives a lot of assurance that my patient is going to recover soon"" he said.“During shortage of Remdesivir you are relying on all other drugs to work. The treatment is incomplete when there is a combination of broad-spectrum antiviral antibiotic anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant. So until and unless you use this you feel the patient is left exposed to some kind of complication” added Dr Shah while sharing his experience of managing covid patients amid the shortage of the drug.Speaking on the judicious use of the antiviral drug Global Hospital's Consultant Intensivist and Chest Physician Dr. Harish Chafle said “If we start the drug in the initial days of illness where the patient has consistent fever and oxygen requirement then you definitely get a better outcome. All patients who are young and without any comorbidities have a milder form of symptoms and do not require oxygen can be treated without Remdesivir also it is not required to be given to all patients.”In view of the reports of black-marketing hoarding of the antiviral drug and the pressure being built by the patient's family to use Remdesivir the government needs to provide better clarity on its use and safety guidelines.India is currently battling with the deadly second wave which took the total Covid-19 caseload to over 1.42 crore along with some states struggling to meet the shortages in hospitals beds oxygen medicine and vaccine doses.",,,,,,

The median annual wage for U.S. truck drivers in 2020 was just over $47000 according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In Canada the average salary for truckers is around $43000. Ice road truckers in Canada are some of the highest-paid drivers in the world averaging around $100000.

Mexico had the lowest average salary for truck drivers in North America earning about $13800 a year according to the Mexican Social Security Institute.





Brazil which has the largest economy in South America pays truck drivers on average between $6000 and $10000 a year.

China which has one of the largest economies in the world pays truck drivers on average around $15000 to $17000 a year.

Examples of How to Redesign the Economy.,"Redesigning how we do business our patterns of production and consumption or the types of resources and energy we use: these are complex and challenging tasks. To set the stage for success we might have to challenge some basic economic assumptions and integrate different approaches if we hope to redesign the economy.

Why do you say or what do you mean by “the economy is failing us”? You might be fairly wondering.

Growth. Infinite quantitative growth – perpetuated via debt – in a world with finite resources is one reason why economic basic assumptions need to be questioned is one reason.

The state of the biosphere which cannot be factored into economic decision-making and behavior and is only seen as an “externality” – progress on carbon markets has been on hold since COP26 in Madrid where no real progress was made – is reason number two (though there’s no particular ranking).

States supporting legacy industries – aka lobbying – through various forms of direct subsidies and tax breaks making it harder for innovative and more sustainable business models to get to the spotlight is one more reason. The recent 717 Amendment of the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU is a mind-blowing example.

Here’s another reason: the current production and consumption systems are too addicted to the take-make-waste logic resisting the change to circular alternatives processes for as long as legislation allows them to.

The disproportional wealth accumulation that year after year Oxfam’s reports – the latter entitled The Inequality Virus – brings our attention to with no signs of change at sight.

A huge share of the population who is disconnected – and discouraged – from participating and deciding on economic (and political) issues and being at least in some way responsible for it.

An outdated formula to measure “development” “progress” or “success” – GDP – which considers things that can have an adverse effect on human wellbeing – cigarette or alcohol consumption ecological disasters and even war investments – as good (or in the best scenario as neutral) for the economy.

Let’s stop it here: enough shaming the current economic system.

If you’re interested we have explored some of these issues in-depth in our articles: why a sustainable planet means the economy needs to change or how the coronavirus crisis is showing the economy needs to change.

There isn’t one solution to re-design the current economic model.

Luckily there are a couple of them! Many of which have been tested and developed on the best playground for experimentation and trial (and error and improvement) there is – at the community/place and local scale.

One of them are local currencies.

Why Are Local Currencies Growing?

Nowadays a complementary currency movement that enables communities to create and exchange their own money seems to be getting traction again.

On one hand because the growing instability in the international monetary system is provoking serious financial crises from time to time.

On the other hand because there is a growing recognition of the need to protect and nurture local economies.

At the same time exploring ways in which local people and local economies can gain greater control over their financial resources helps reduce the dependence on decisions taken elsewhere with little regard to particular social cultures and bioregional resources. Another reason why the local currencies movement is growing.

What Are Local Currencies Exactly? A Simple Definition

Local currencies are currencies that circulate mostly locally and at a community level. They work as complementary to an official legal currency. They are usually accepted by local traders of all kinds and they give local residents an incentive to shop locally.

As a result local currencies help a particular community or region strengthen and decarbonize its local economy. They help build community spirit while reducing people’s carbon footprint and improve local resilience.

Local currencies aim to operate alongside the official currency of a place. They are not legal tender so no one has to accept them in exchange for goods or services if they haven’t agreed to be part of the currency’s trader network.

So while Euros Sterlings or Pounds will always be needed for national and international trade it becomes possible to promote local trade and strengthen the local economy using a local (complementary) currency.

Another definition of local currency is “when a collective creates its own currency it tries to solve problems in a material world by defining a unit of account and medium of payment accepted by everyone within that community (Desan 2014)”.

Ultimately local currencies are usually complementary currencies that become part of a domestic currency to help achieve a certain goal like strengthening the local economy or reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Though they may work well in localized areas with important industries they may be somewhat idealist across other regions. Let’s take a closer look at some examples before jumping into conclusions.

Printed Local Currencies: Examples and Case Studies

The Bristol Pound

A group of campaigners and financial activists set the Bristol Pound currently changing to Bristol Pay up in 2012. It comprised a network of +2000 individuals and independent businesses who used digital and paper currency to trade in Bristol localizing supply chains and keeping money circulating in our city.

On their website the Bristol Pound CIC says that at its peak “hundreds of transactions were made with Bristol Pounds every week amounting to over £1million per year and well over £6million in total.” Bristol’s local currency was used to pay for various things such as bus and train rides or to buy groceries.

The project seems to be now on a new level under the name Bristol Pay and with the promise of allowing direct payments to other account holders through the online portal where users can pay in-store with the app or card.

The new name and look given to Bristol’s new local currency seems to be related to keeping money inside the area to fund community and environmental projects in Bristol.

Findhorn’s (Scotland) Eko

Eko is a local currency created by members of the Findhorn Ecovillage through a legal entity that was formed in 2002. All the community members and businesses within the eco-village plus 2 pubs and a café in the neighboring village accept the local currency Eko.

The local currency Eko brought multiple benefits to the Findhorn community. First there’s a purchasing power that stays within the local economy – since it’s the only place where it is accepted.

Then in the first year of the system Ekos are estimated to have generated a turnover of business of approximately £150000 – an average of ten full spending cycles for each note (Gaia Education 2021).

The “fiat” money used in the exchange of money was used to provide low-interest loans for community businesses like renewable energy investments or affordable housing.

The Swiss WIR (Wirtschaftsring)

The Swiss WIR (Wirtschaftsring) is a complementary currency founded in the 1930s because of currency shortages and global financial instability and used by around twenty percent of Switzerland’s small and medium-sized enterprises.

The WIR currency has an (equivalent) annual turnover of 1.2 billion Swiss Francs and is serving 62000 SMEs around the country.

Chiemgauer in Bavaria Germany

Germany’s Rosenheim-Traunstein region is home to one of the world’s successful alternative currencies. It all started out in 2003 as a school project by an economics teacher who wanted to teach finance to a group of 16-year-olds in a unique way.

The teacher and his students – who designed the banknotes did the administration and managed the accounts – created their own money to be used in local businesses and shops.

The currency is worth one euro per chiemgauer and there are notes from 1 to 50 euros. The local currency chiemgauer is only valid for three months after purchase to ensure people spend swiftly instead of saving it.

The biggest benefit of the currency is that it is a good way of keeping the money within the region that it was earned instead of spending it at large multinational companies paying taxes somewhere else. It is possible to pay in chiemgauer by debit card and local banks while credit organizations also accept the currency as legal tender.

How Local Currencies Work

Here’s a brief video from the Bank of England explaining how local currencies work:

The Benefits of Local Currencies

In theory local currencies offer several economic benefits such as:

1. Local currencies encourage consumers to shop at local businesses i.e. the ones accepting the local currency;

2. The money stays within the community instead of being exported to large companies in distant countries;

3. Local currencies increase the local money supply which increases demand and stimulates local production and employment;

4. Individuals and businesses can bypass conventional credit channels (with local exchange trading systems). Local currencies become thus an alternative source of capital for which the interest (if any) will circulate back to the community;

5. Increases the ability of locals to make more informed choices when they go shopping;

7. Local currencies make the social and ecological consequences of economic decisions harder to ignore;

8. They help reverse the globalization and homogenization of cultures trend connecting people to other people and places they see every day;

9. Local currencies help raise a flag on the identity of a region potentially attracting visitors and press.

The Disadvantages of Local Currencies

Depending on the currency type there are several distinct disadvantages compared to a national currency including the fact that it may limit them in terms of usage and depending on the issuing process prone to volatility and inflation.

Instead of offering a true alternative currency most local currencies have social goals that are limited in scope and hard to implement in today’s highly globalised economy.

As an alternative incentives for the local economy to grow – without using a different currency – and reviewing external subsidies might be interesting actions too.

The scientifically accurate dinosaurs were made possible by the creativity and scientific expertise of Middletown Township resident Don Lessem AKA “Dino Don.”

Lessem owner of Dinodon Inc. headquartered at a quirky 1784 Addams Family-style mansion in Delaware County is a worldwide dinosaur expert. In fact according to Lessem his company is the world’s leading supplier of robotic dinosaur exhibitions featured in the largest zoos in the U.S. and Europe. Dinodon robots are uniquely full-sized and scientifically accurate. In the last three years his company’s new robotic division has become the world leader in supplying zoos and museums – more than 250 dinosaurs dragons Ice Age animals and Insect robots across the United States and Europe. Dino Don Inc. designs traveling dinosaur exhibits that feature monster-sized Chinese and Argentinean fossil casts moving dinosaur robots and interactive “dig pits.” In addition to building dinosaurs commercially the team at Dinodon will even be happy to build a forty foot dinosaur for a private home or small business if requested.

“We are open to inquiries about our robots” explained Lessem. “We go to great lengths to insure that our dinosaurs are scientifically accurate by taking time with the details. Some of our dinosaurs take up to three years to build.”

Before debuting his dinosaurs at the new Big Time Philadelphia Zoo attraction Dinodon supplied the huge creatures to eleven other zoos including ones in Chicago Seattle and Oklahoma City as well as enormous dragons in San Antonio giant insects at the National Science Center in Brussels and many others. The company has even built the world’s largest dinosaur in the world the 110 foot-long Argentinosaurus. Lessem was the owner and founder of Dino Don’s Dinosaurium a popular dinosaur museum in the former Granite Run Mall that brought area dinosaur enthusiasts school children on field trips and other visitors many hours of pleasure.

“When I see a person look up at one of the creatures we built and their eyes light up and their mouth drops in awe” Lessem shared “There’s no better feeling in the world to me.”

At the Philadelphia Zoo’s Big Time exhibit visitors can encounter the 98 foot-long 6000 pound Alamosaurus the largest dinosaur known in North America as it swings an enormous 20 foot-long tail and the 40 foot-long and an Edmontosaurus an herbivore with a toothless beak so strong it crushed plant material such as ginkgos conifers and cycads. Guests will then continue on to Prehistoric Passage where a 40 foot-long 3000 pound T- Rex chomps his threatening jaws and a strange-looking Ankylosaurus sporting a heavy body armor thrashes its gigantic club-like tail. There is also the Triceratops with its 1000-pound head and three massive horns the 30 foot-tall Quetzalcoatlus one of the largest flying animals of all time with an enormous 35 foot-long wingspan and the Anzu a feathered dinosaur resembling a bird that is 10 feet long. Some of the other dinosaurs on the Big Time journey include the Quetzalcoatlus the Pachycephalosaurs the Dakotaraptor the Thylacoleo the Aepyornis the Procoptodon the Megatherium the Smilodon and more.

“Dino Don” has spent his lifetime surrounded by the prehistoric creatures. Like many young boys Lessem impressed his family as a child with his vast knowledge of dinosaurs and the ability to easily spout off the complicated names of the prehistoric creatures. A native of Boston and a former Knight Journalism Fellow at M.I.T. Lessem earned his undergraduate degree in Oriental Art and a master degree in primatology studying animal behavior. After college he went to work as a science correspondent for The Boston Globe. While in his young 30s his editor sent him out west to Montana and North Dakota to profile a few scientists who were working on unearthing prehistoric fossils of dinosaurs. The story material was so interesting to Lessem that he gave up his journalism career and never looked back.

“I have an ADD personality” joked Lessem. “I’ve worked in dinosaurs my whole life but I’ve done all kinds of different things with them. I am always on to the next project or the next idea!”

Lessem is right about that. He wrote three documentaries on dinosaurs that aired on the Discovery Channel and hosted one Nova television series and acted as scientific advisor to others. Lessem is the author of over 50 books for adults and children on dinosaurs and natural history most recently the best-selling National Geographic “Dinopedia” the most complete dinosaur encyclopedia ever written for children.

In addition to the many books that he has authored for National Geographic Random House Simon & Schuster Scholastic and other publishers “Dino” Don answered than 11000 letters to his “Ask Dino Don” column in Highlights Magazine the nation’s largest-circulated children’s magazine. Lessem’s journalism background comes into play often as he continues to write pieces on dinosaur research in Newsweek The New York Times Discover Magazine The Boston Globe Life Magazine and other publications.

Lessem always an educator said he enjoys teaching others of all ages about their prehistoric predecessors.

“I enjoy meeting and talking to people and explaining science in a down-to-earth way” he said. “I don’t give scientific explanations that are formal stuffy complicated or difficult to understand. I want to have a little fun and give people enjoyment while they’re learning. My job is to interpret science.”

Besides being a dinosaur consultant for Universal and Disney movies and theme parks Lessem helped to create the now-legendary dinosaurs in the original classic Jurassic Park film. He says some of those prehistoric Jurassic Park dinos and props decorate his property today along with some of the skeletons from his private collection which he calls “the world’s largest.”

Through Dinodon Inc. Lessem created the world’s largest and most popular touring dinosaur museum exhibitions including the Jurassic Park exhibit seen by more than five million people worldwide including museums in U.S. Canada Italy England Argentina and the Netherlands.

Lessem makes it clear that he is an idea man an inventor a writer explorer exhibitor TV host and a consultant and not a scientist or a paleontologist though he works with some of the field’s best and brightest. Lessem has also participated in his share of dinosaur exploration and excavations throughout the world. In Patagonia Argentina he dug up and reconstructed the world’s record-sized plant-eating and meat-eating dinosaurs. He has also excavated dinosaurs in Mongolia China Canada and Arctic Alaska.

Although he no longer does the actual excavating as in years past the dinosaur expert says that he continues to sponsor excavations. His work takes him around the world although he hasn’t been jetting around as much during the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic.

Lessem holds the distinction that he shares with only a handful of other living people – a dinosaur is named after him. The giant Argentine plant-eating Lessemsaurus is his namesake. Dino Don’s museum dinosaur exhibitions have raised three million dollars for dinosaur research via the nonprofit Dinosaur Society and Jurassic Foundation charities both founded by Lessem.

Lessem the father of two daughters and twin granddaughters shares his excitement for dinosaurs with his wife Valerie Jones who has guided business development at the privately-owned Dinodon Inc. for over twenty years. The company currently has eight employees on staff and another 15 technicians who work seasonally.

Lessem’s dinosaur creations in “Big Time” at the Philadelphia Zoo will be on display now through Sept. 30.

“I think people are really going to be impressed with this ‘Big Time’ exhibit and learn a lot from it” Lessem remarked. “The subject matter is very useful and current.”

Big Time highlights some of history’s most powerful events volcanic eruptions and asteroid strikes that changed the atmosphere the level of the seas the temperature of the earth even the amount of sunlight on the planet. As a result of these catastrophes some creatures had the time to adapt and others did not dying off forever. Through evocative landscapes realistic settings immersive sounds and life-like giants Big Time takes guests through the Age of Dinosaurs through to present day showing what life was like and the challenges faced when these amazons walked the planet. As the Big Time journey comes to an end guests can take steps to help turn the tide for endangered animals and enact change to ensure a future where everyone can all live and thrive together on the planet.

“We are very happy to welcome guests to the Zoo to experience Big Time a tailor-made adventure immersing guests in the world of history’s most impressive behemoths taking them through cataclysmic events highlighting threatened animal species today and providing ways to help enact change” said Philadelphia Zoo’s President and CEO Vikram Dewan. “Big Time is a dynamic experience that will stimulate the senses and transport guests back in time to walk among dinosaurs like the mighty T.Rex puts them face-to-face with an enormous Woolly Mammoth and side-by-side with a life-sized polar bear elephant and Sumatran rhino – incredible!”

Lessem said that even after four decades of living and breathing all-things dinosaur his passion for the prehistoric creatures has never waned. He bubbles over with enthusiasm as he speaks of upcoming projects that include an all-dinosaur theme park in Texas and a traveling museum of seventy dinosaurs and skeletons from his vast collection that he is planning to take across the country.

“I’m as excited today about dinosaurs as when I was a kid” he shared.

Gartner’s recent survey finds that about 70% of employees wish to continue some form of remote work. Twitter and Facebook have already given their employees permission to work remotely on a permanent basis. On the other hand Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon calls remote work an “aberration” urging employees to return to the office to collaborate on ideas.

My Harvard Business School colleague Tsedal Neeley has written a timely well-researched book called Remote Work Revolution that demonstrates how to make remote work most effective taking on issues like building trust productivity working in agile teams and leading virtually. Neeley found from her research that “when people have the opportunity to work virtually and the flexibility to arrange job tasks there is an increase in commitment to their companies and in performance and a decreased likelihood for attrition.”

Let’s examine some of the pros and cons of remote work. Among the benefits:

Time savings

Without the need for long commutes to work and travel to other cities and countries people find that they have a lot more time for their work and their families. This “found time” can be used to get more work done or spend more time with family exercising or relaxing.

Productivity

Many people—and their companies—were surprised to find they were more productive when working in remote settings. The absence of time wasted in commuting and travel is an obvious benefit but they also found they were more focused when working without all the typical office distractions.

Schedule flexibility

Remote workers find they can both attend scheduled meetings and preserve quiet time to get solo work completed giving them more flexibility in their schedules. This has also contributed to increased attendance since meetings do not have to work around travel plans and commuting schedules.

Balancing family needs

Although some people complain about the challenges of working with children in their homes the reality is that most people are more easily able to balance their work and family requirements when they have the flexibility to work from home.

Cost savings

Remote work provides clear cost savings for both employers and employees. Employers have dramatically reduced the cost of business travel while employees avoid commuting costs. Many companies like Target are shedding expensive downtown office space by shifting employees to the new concept of “hoteling” in which employees do not have permanent offices and book an available open office.

Organization design

While many companies have been moving away from hierarchical organizations remote work further encourages horizontal interactions with increased equality. In a Zoom meeting there is no privilege on seating order or physical presence as everyone’s screen is the same size.

Yet for all these significant benefits there are several negatives of remote work that both employees and their organizations are coping with.

Trust

There are obvious benefits to in-person communication. Neeley confronts this issue head-on with suggestions for establishing trust remotely. She explains “Unlike in person where the ideal time you spend with your coworkers inevitably leads to serendipitous discoveries about one another in the remote format you have to make a point of sharing your personal side.”

Collaboration

How can organizations replace the collaboration that happens when people work together in the office? New tools such virtual whiteboards as well as new meeting formats such as idea jams can set the stage for recapturing creative collaboration.

Informal interactions

Many leaders depend on the informal spontaneous interactions that occur from “managing by wandering around.” Executives claim they learn more about what is going on through these impromptu interactions than they do in formal meetings but such informal dealings are hard to replicate remotely.

Being with customers

There is nothing quite like meeting with your customers in their place of business especially in retail settings to build relationships and make use of all your senses. Even for remote employees some in-person visits and meetings to build initial relationships can foster insight that can then be followed up with remote interactions.

Concerns over these negatives are stimulating organizations to create hybrid models. Yet designing a fully functioning hybrid model is complicated. Remote workers may perceive that there is an “in-crowd” (in-person) and that they are in the “out-crowd” (online). It can also create anxiety over fear of missing out. To these concerns Neeley argues “Let us never mistake physical proximity with psychological closeness. That’s a fallacy.”

The nature and needs of both employees and the business will shape upcoming decisions about remote work. I expect that various forms of hybrid environments—with some employees in the office and others operating remotely—will become the new norm. After a period of experimentation companies will decide what format works best for their cultures and establish clear ground rules for their organizations.

CEOs who adapt rapidly by creating their ideal environment will build stronger companies and wind up with stronger more committed talent.

Goldman Sachs has argued that the critical role copper will play in achieving the Paris climate goals cannot be understated. Without serious advancements in carbon capture and storage technology in the coming years the entire path to net zero emissions will have to come from abatement - electrification and renewable energy.

As the most cost-effective conductive material copper sits at the heart of capturing storing and transporting these new sources of energy. In fact discussions of peak oil demand overlook the fact that without a surge in the use of copper and other key metals the substitution of renewables for oil will not happen the report said.

It added that moving the global economy toward net zero emissions remains a core driver of the structural bull market in commodities demand in which green metals - copper in particular - are critical.

Copper has the necessary physical properties to transform and transmit these sources of energy to their useful final state such as moving a vehicle or heating a home the report said.

""Leveraging our equity analysts' carbonomics analysis across EVs wind solar and battery technology we quantify this demand in a bottom-up model estimating that by 2030 copper demand from the transition will grow nearly 600 per cent to 5.4Mt in our base case and 900 per cent to 8.7Mt in the case of hyper adoption of green technologies"" Goldman Sachs said.

""We estimate that by-mid decade this growth in green demand alone will match and then quickly surpass the incremental demand China generated during the 2000s. Ripple effects into non-green channels mean the 2020s are expected to be the strongest phase of volume growth in global copper demand in history"" it added.

The copper market as it currently stands is not prepared for this demand environment.

""Moreover a decade of poor returns and ESG concerns have curtailed investment in future supply growth bringing the market the closest it's ever been to peak supply. Indeed we see the copper market sleepwalking to a classic case of the ""Revenge of the old economy"" just as oil did during the 2000s commodity boom"" the report said.

It added that the mining sector remains wary of a pivot towards growth after the price collapse in the mid-2010s severely punished any front-footed producers. Even as copper prices have rallied 80 per cent over the last 12 months there have been no material greenfield project approvals.

Coronavirus has only compounded this dynamic creating enough uncertainty to freeze companies' investment decisions. This combination of surging demand and sticky supply has reinforced current deficit conditions and foreshadows large open-ended deficits from mid-decade. We now estimate a long-term supply gap of 8.2Mt by 2030 twice the size of the gap that triggered the bull market in copper in the early 2000s it added.

The report projects that copper is on a necessary path to $15000 per ton. ""We believe that the most probable path for copper price from here - that both avoids depletion risk and as well as a sharp surplus swing - is to trend into the mid-teens by mid-decade"" Goldman Sachs said.

""We now project copper to average $9675/t in 2021 $11875/t in 2022 $12000/t in 2023 before a material step-up to $14000/t in 2024 and $15000/t in 2025. In this context we upgrade our 12-month target to $11000/t"" it said.

She has been on many reality TV shows including The Amazing Race and Big Brother.

Rachel Reilly is a reality TV superstar. She has been on many reality TV shows including The Amazing Race Big Brother and Celebrity Fear Factor. Being on television turned out to be a great thing for Reilly. She met her husband Brendon Villegas on Big Brother Season 12. As of this writing they have two children together.

Reilly recently chatted with Showbiz Cheat Sheet to discuss her latest project. She’s set to star in her own reality TV show titled I Love the Brenchels—Moving On which will air on bspoketv.com. (Brenchel is a combination of Brendon and Rachel.)

Where should you start if you want to be a reality star like Reilly? Here’s the expert advice she shared with us.

Rachel Reilly’s new show ‘I Love the Brenchels—Moving On’

During I Love the Brenchels—Moving On the cameras will follow Reilly and Villegas as they cross the country with their family. Reilly told Showbiz Cheat Sheet her latest show is not about being on TV. She wants to help improve the lives of others through service projects.

“I want to make sure to tell stories and make a sustainable impact in each city we visit” says Reilly. “So we will be working with various service organizations with our reality friends that are important to them and the communities they live in and are a part of. This isn’t a show about us. It’s about the communities we visit.”

Bspoketv CEO Michael Dutcher says he’s thrilled to welcome Reilly to the network.

“The bspoketv/Rachel Reilly show creation agreement is a true partnership” says Dutcher. “It allows Rachel to control her Intellectual Property (IP) while creating more shows for her current and new fans to enjoy. I am very proud of the bspoketv team for their innovative deal-making and invite other celebrities and creatives to come to bspoketv to make their ideas a reality.”

Rachel Reilly’s advice to aspiring reality TV stars

We asked Reilly to give some advice to those who desire to be on a reality TV show. What should you know before taking the plunge and signing on for a reality show? Reilly gave some excellent advice for those brave enough to live their lives before the camera.

“I would say do your research if you want to be on a reality show” Reilly told us. “Know what you’re applying for and go for it with your whole heart. Being behind the camera casting and on camera I feel that I have learned so many things about unscripted TV.”

Reilly says another important thing is to understand beforehand exactly what you want from the reality TV experience. “I think it’s vital to know what kind of show you want to be on and why you want to be on that show” says Reilly. “If you know you want to win money on Big Brother because you are a huge fan let casting know! If you’re going to win love and are looking for a partner find the best option for a good love connection!”

The Big Brother star also advises potential reality stars not to hide who they really are. “I think the only thing I would let someone know before jumping in is to be themselves” advises Reilly. “The most crucial part of unscripted is to be yourself. If you aren’t genuine casting and the audience can tell.”

By Paul Palmer

Conard High School’s Azaiyah Felder was recently honored with her second All-State selection for girls’ basketball in Connecticut.

The center forward was the Chieftains’ most dominant player again this season setting a school record with her 23.3 points per game average and tying the mark for most points in a game – 37 – and most 30-point games in a season with four.

Felder’s coach Laurie Cersosimo said that the effort put forth by the player inspired her teammates on and off the court but this year was even more special. “Azaiyah and her teammates were tested and had much adversity to overcome. Had her season not been cut short I am confident she would have broken her own records and gained additional accolades” Cersosimo said. “Azaiyah’s skill is effortless her knowledge surpasses this level and her passion and creativity for the game is an absolute joy to watch.”

“Yaya” as she is known to friends is headed to Ohio University to continue her basketball career and her education. In addition to her All-State selection this season Felder was also named All-Conference for the third straight season. She leaves Conard as the school’s all-time leading scorer with 1438 points and tied for third all time with 88 3-pointers.

Coach Cersosimo said that watching Felder grow and mature over her time at Conard has been special. “As her coach I reflect on the little things I’ve observed in support of that growth. Her sportsmanship leadership and her ability to handle and thrive in pressure situations are most notable” she said. “The accolades are impressive but I am most proud of the young woman she has become today. Azaiyah is a gifted athlete and a truly special person and I am humbled and fortunate to have had the opportunity to coach her and to be a part of her life.”

Cersosimo is also quick to point out that Felder’s success was also the result of the teammates that surrounded her in her time as a Chieftain. “She would agree that her teammates have held an important role in support of this growth both as an athlete and as an individual. Azaiyah’s career at Conard has inspired current and prospective teammates to strive for greatness in sport and also in life. The coaching staff and I often discuss how special it is to be a part of the school history that she has created and we look forward to the opportunity for someone else to challenge what she has accomplished for herself and this program.”

Hall High School is also represented on the girls All-Conference basketball team. Sophomore guard/forward Lydia Poulin – who missed part of the season with a hand injury – was also named to the CCC squad.

On the boys side of the game Conard’s Riley Fox became the first freshman boys player from the school to ever be named to the All-Central Connecticut Conference team for basketball. Fox averaged 15 points 7 rebounds 1 ½ assists and blocks and 1 steal per game this season. His coach Jared Leghorn has known Fox since the player was in elementary school and attended Chieftain Hoop School.

“Unfortunately Connor Olechna our senior guard and All-Conference player last season got injured early on and missed seven games. Once that happened Riley sort of took over as our go-to offensive player. We knew he had the talent and ability to be an All-Conference level player as a freshman. We didn’t know he would be thrust into that role so early on” said Leghorn.

He described Fox as a special player whose maturity work ethic and overall attitude towards the sport set him apart. “The thing that sets Riley apart from other guys with his talent level is his attitude. He is so coachable and is one of the best teammates we have in the program” added Leghorn.

Joining Fox on the All-CCC team are Hall senior Matt Walker and junior Will Gaumer.

In the pool this winter Hall and Conard swimmers also achieved All-State and All-Conference honors.

Both Dominguez and Raisner earned individual All-State honors as well. In the 100-yard Breaststroke Dominguez’s 59:94 was good enough for 16th place overall in Connecticut and Raisner’s 54:13 in the 100-yard Backstroke was 15th best in the state.

For the Region C All-League (conference) team both Conard and Hall turned in strong performances. In the 200-yard Medley Relay Hall’s entry of Dominguez Sun Raisner and Liddell swam a best time of 1:41.86. The same foursome also earned honors for their 200-yard Freestyle Relay time of 1:29.40.

Both schools’ 400-yard Freestyle Relay teams earned All-Conference status with Hall’s entry of Liddell Carter Morton Michael Neff and Aidan Dorian coming in at 3:32.11 and Conard’s team of Liam Switzer Alexander Petit Nick Hall and Justice Seymour swimming a 3:37:87.

This included Retro Morph figures Lightning Collection figures the Dino Fury morpher and more. All of the items are available through Hasbro Pulse and your favorite retailers. I’ve taken some time with some of the toys and it’s been a blast. The morpher is a lot of fun especially for my daughter. She loves hearing the different sounds and spinning the jaw into the helmet. It’s a fantastic toy and even comes with batteries pre-installed!

Lightning Collection figures are still good quality. I do wish that they paid a bit more attention to detail with their paint jobs. For example why does the Quasar Saber with Lost Galaxy Red have a gold blade? Is it supposed to be the sheath? Some different detailing would’ve been nice then. It’s small things like that.

The Battle Attackers 2-packs are also a lot of fun to play with although it’s a little annoying at how hard it can be to get the Rangers to knock villains over with their kicks. These and the more standard Dino Fury figures are still excellent toys for kids though.

Finally the Retro Morph figures. These take me back. When I was a kid I got a Pink Ranger one and loved it. It was the only official Power Rangers toy I had and it was cherished even though I was a little mad it wasn’t the Red Ranger. These have the same spirit as those old ones but have been redesigned. They are much broader than the old figures and I’m not really sure why.

Overall if you’re a fan of Power Rangers we’re living in a great time. The toys are fun. I cannot wait to check out the toys for the Dino Fury Zords though. Those looked really cool! You can watch me play around with some of the toys in the video below.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbHlsZXNtb3ZpZWZpbGVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzE3L3Bvd2VyLXJhbmdlcnMtbGlnaHRuaW5nLWtpbmctc3BoaW54L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Power Rangers Lightning Collection Mighty Morphin Power Rangers King Sphinx figure review — Lyles Movie Files,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://lylesmoviefiles.com/2021/04/17/power-rangers-lightning-king-sphinx/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbHlsZXNtb3ZpZWZpbGVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzE3L3Bvd2VyLXJhbmdlcnMtbGlnaHRuaW5nLWtpbmctc3BoaW54L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMveG0tc3R1ZGlvcy1oYXNicm8tdHJhbnNmb3JtZXJzLXJvZGltdXMtcHJpbWUtc3RhdHVlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Transformers Rodimus Prime Gets New Mighty Statue From XM Studios,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bleedingcool.com/collectibles/xm-studios-hasbro-transformers-rodimus-prime-statue/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMveG0tc3R1ZGlvcy1oYXNicm8tdHJhbnNmb3JtZXJzLXJvZGltdXMtcHJpbWUtc3RhdHVlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcmR3YXJlem9uZS5jb20uc2cvdGVjaC1uZXdzLWhhc2Jyby1yb2Jvc2VuLXNlbGYtdHJhbnNmb3JtaW5nLW9wdGltdXMtcHJpbWUtcHJpY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You can now buy an Optimus Prime figure that transforms itself,"You can now buy an Optimus Prime figure that transforms itself

Note: This article was first published on 12 Apr 2021.

The dream of many Transformers fans has come true. There's now a figure of Optimus Prime that transforms itself.

Called the Transformers Optimus Prime Auto-Converting Programmable Robot Collector's Edition (a mouthful) the figure is a collaboration between Hasbro and Robosen. The latter is a robot company that has been making transforming robot toys for a while.

The figure is based on G1 Optimus Prime (thankfully) and stands a whopping 19 inches (~48cm) tall and consists of over 5000 components 60 microchips and 27 servo motors.

It has built-in speakers to play 80 sound effects and microphones for 25 voice-activated commands including iconic lines like ""Roll out"".

The figure is voiced by the ""original voice"" of Optimus Prime which presumably means Peter Cullen.

There's also an app that lets owners program and customise their Optimus Prime figures with pre-programmed movements and action sequences.

Check out the figure in action below.

Availability and pricing

The Optimus Prime Auto-Converting Programmable Robot Collector's Edition is US$699.99 (~S$938) and it's expected to ship in early August. Sadly it's sold out on Hasbro's website.

No word on local availability and pricing however I've seen local collectible stores accepting pre-orders and asking around S$1150 for it.",,,

While it can leave a bruise or a welt the pain quickly dissipates.

At least for the most part.

“Everyone is freaked out about getting hit by a paintball but the worst kind of pain is that first hit” the 17-year-old North Platte High School student said. “Other than that it’s not bad unless you get hit in the hands. Then it hurts.

“I’ve been hit in the hands twice. There’s the (initial) sting and then pretty much your fingers go numb and your hands start shaking. It just hurts.”

Morrison has taken his share of hits but has handed out more than a few as well as a member of the Splatterbox Hornets a paintball team based in Hershey.

Morrison is in his second year with his team and was among about 10 teenagers of varying abilities who took part in an initial season practice last Sunday on a field at the Splatterbox Paintball & Lasertag site.

The group gathered around Shayne Younghans — the Hornets coach and organizer and manager of the Splatterbox operation which is on his family’s property.

Younghans ran the players through a series of drills and later competitions to get the players familiar with or reaccustomed to the rules equipment and strategies of the game.

“I love this game for a couple reasons” Younghans said. “It’s age and ability-friendly. Pretty much anyone can play.

“The other (reason) is that it’s like chess. You’ve got to learn our angles and learn who can do what and I love the game of chess.”

Paintball has been a passion for Younghans for two decades. He opened Splatterbox Paintball & Lasertag as a business in 2007 and keeps it open from the spring until fall annually for people to play for the day on the six-acre fields. He has even accommodated a request in January for a family that wanted to rent time for a birthday.

“I actually built this for friends and family (initially)” Younghans said. “This is about the fourth or fifth setup that we’ve changed the fields around. I just keep putting money back into (the business) that we make.

“This is more like a hobby for me. I say I still haven’t gotten paid but you know what? I’m having a blast and the kids are having fun.”

Younghans has coached two previous paintball teams — the now-defunct Arch Angels and the all-women squad Foxy Ladies.

The Hornets have been in existence for three seasons. Team members have to be at least 10 years old and most have been high school students.

Younghans’ 15-year-old daughter Ashtyn or “A.J.” is one of three players who have been on the team since its inception.

“Growing up I would watch my (two older) brothers play all of the time” Ashtyn said. “Eventually my dad was like ‘Hey do you want to try it?’ I just like everything about it.”

Morrison tried the sport last year basically because he was looking for an activity to try. He had never played paintball before but he quickly became hooked.

“It just kind of stuck” Morrison said.

The Hornets played in a handful of tournaments last year at Blitz Paintball just outside Denver. The Hornets played in 3-on-3 and 5-on-5 games in which the goal is to shoot or mark all your opponents with paint balls from an air-compressed gun before they do the same.

Matches are generally quick and the first team to get two wins takes the match.

The Hornets charge a $50 fee for each player which covers equipment travel and entry fees for tournaments.

Morrison is a back player one who calls out movement and positioning for his team. He also provides a steady stream of cover for the fronts the players who run and dive from one inflatable or foam bunker to another as they advance toward the other team.

Players like Morrison often have at least five sleeves of paintballs with them. Each one holds about 200 of the marble-like pellets that are about 0.68 inches in diameter.

Ashtyn Younghans is one of the front players as is 17-year-old Jakeb Baker of North Platte.

Baker admits that marking an opposing player is his favorite aspect of the game but adds “Then again I’m a bad shot.

Last year “probably in the first tournament out of the whole team I got the first kill” Baker said. “I didn’t get any after that but I got the first. So that’s cool.”

One of Morrison’s top memories came in a tournament after a match the Hornets had already won. He watched from his back position as two teammates fired on each other each thinking the other was an opponent.

“They didn’t know we already had everyone” on the opposing team Morrison said. “I was just screaming ‘You’re shooting at each other.’ Apparently I wasn’t screaming loud enough or they weren’t listening to me.”

Younghans said he believes the players gain more from being on the field than exercise and perhaps a few bruises.

“To me it’s learning to lead work as a team and overcoming fears” Younghans said. “It’s a big thing when you’ve got someone shooting a bunch of paintballs in your direction. But just like everything else it’s about timing and when do you make your move (on the field)?

“It’s kind of like life and everything else. It’s when are you going to make your move to advance or find that other job. You’ve got to have that courage.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbm5saXZlLmNvbS9oaWdoc2Nob29sc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEvMDQvaGV3cnktcGFuaWFndWEtemFjaC1rbnVsbC1oZWxwLWhlcnNoZXktdGFrZS1kb3duLWxvd2VyLWRhdXBoaW4uaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZW5ubGl2ZS5jb20vaGlnaHNjaG9vbHNwb3J0cy8yMDIxLzA0L2hld3J5LXBhbmlhZ3VhLXphY2gta251bGwtaGVscC1oZXJzaGV5LXRha2UtZG93bi1sb3dlci1kYXVwaGluLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hewry Paniagua Zach Knull help Hershey take down Lower Dauphin,"Hewry Paniagua had a big day at the plate and Zach Knull had a good outing on the mound too as Hershey took down Lower Dauphin 4-3.

The Morning Call’s profile of the town called it “prosperous” and filled with contented families living in “comfortable homes.”

Est. Read Time: 8 mins

Note: The following is a verbatim transcript of a lengthy profile of Hellertown that was published in the Nov. 12 1922 edition of The Morning Call (see below for image). That year the borough celebrated the golden anniversary of its 1872 incorporation. (All articles published prior to 1923 are in the public domain under U.S. copyright law.)

Hellertown is a borough with a population of about 3000 located in Lower Saucon Township Northampton County southeast of Bethlehem. It is the terminus of the Lehigh Valley Transit company lines and also is on the Phila. and Reading railroad.

Hellertown is a prosperous community with comfortable homes and a contented people. Aside from various industries in the town itself the greater number of its residents are employed by the Bethlehem Steel company. A single trolley fare to Bethlehem makes a home in Hellertown a convenient and inviting suburban residence for the steel employee.

Forces are at work to increase the facility with which motor traffic may come and go from Hellertown. A splendid road already leads from Bethlehem and it is proposed to extend a state highway to the Narrows to connect with the Easton-Philadelphia road and another spur to Quakertown to connect with the Allentown-Philadelphia highway.

C.J. Weidner is the burgess* of the borough. The councilmen are Victor Wagner Wye J. Brown Titus Bachman Herbert Cless Charles Schilling Harvey Meyers Elmer Eckert and John Dugan.

R.N. Taylor is the supervising principal of schools.** The members of the school board are Clarence Bigot Asher Kichline Asher Dimmich Ed. Boehm and steward Schantz.

Among the chief industries are the Bethlehem Spark Plug company the Air Reduction Sales company the Halcyon Knitting mill and the Thomas Iron Company.

The American Legion opst known as Ackerman post No. 397 has just purchased a site at Chestnut and Main Sts. for a permanent home.

The town is divided into three wards. It boasts a fire company a splendid water system playgrounds and good schools. The water system it is claimed is the best in the state. Not only is the water of a splendid quality of soft spring water but it is by gravity alone that it is distributed to the residents.

Hellertown also has a Boy Scout organization two churches a high school a bank various fratneral organizations and a business men’s association. The churches are St. Paul’s Evangelical church Rev. Hill pastor and Union church with Rev. Hamm as the Reformed pastor and Rev. Krause as the Lutheran pastor. The Saucon Valley Trust company organized two years ago has become a flourishing financial institution.

Bethlehem’s beautiful Saucon park is located at the northern end of the borough.

Among the organizations are the following:

Corp Weaver Camp No. 295 Sons of Veterans; Washington camp No. 175 P.O.S. of A.; Ackerman post No. 397 American Legion; Killater tribe No. 421 I.O.R.M.; Hellertown castle No. 112 K.G.E.; Hellertown council No. 838 F.P.A.; Hellertown camp No. 200 P.O.S. of A.; Hellertown lodge No. 563 F. and A.M.; Saucon lodge No. 606 I.O.O.F.

Hellertown is the heart of the rich and vertile Saucon valley. It was incorporated as a borough by the January court in 1872 after considerable opposition on the part of some of the old citizens. Credit for the following historical facts is due to the Hon. Jer. S. Hess:

History of the Borough. The first election resulted in the choice of the following officers: Chief burgess Thomas R. Laubach; Town council Charles Wagner J.B. Leith D.J. Weirbach Moses Henninger W.F. Detweiler and T.S. Eisenhart; justice of the peace P.B. Lerch.

In or near Hellertown there originally resided Christopher and Simon Heller two brothers who had come across the ocean from the Palatinate on the ship Winter Gallen out of Rotterdam and arrived on these shores September 5 1738. Christopher obtained the patent for his land September 8 1742 and Simon received his patent October 14 1746. There is reason to believe that they were descendants of a Michael Heller as that name is a favorite of the family. In 1800 three of that name were living in Hellertown and they were distinguished as “Oehlig” Mike “Kricke” Mike and “Heffner” Mike. They had won these various Pennsylvania German sobriquets for reasons peculiar to each. The first was engaged in the manufacture of linseed oil and his nickname is a derivation of the Pennsylvania German word for oil. The second lived close to the Saucon creek and therefore his nickname was the Pennsylvania German word for creek and the third being a potter he received the Pennsylvania German word for pot.

Two of these had sons whose names were also Mike and they were known as “Kriche” Mike’s Mike and “Oehlig” Mike’s Mike.

Anthony Boehm the son (of) the Rev. John Philip Boehm who came to this country about 1720 built what is the oldest house still standing in Hellertown. It is the property of John A. Geisinger. The Schaffers and the M’Hoses were early residents of the town. The borough since its early days has been noted for litigation and the civil court of Northampton is rarely without a case from Hellertown. The criminal court happily is less often appealed to. It is related that at the beginning of the present century when Samuel Sitgreaves a high-toned gentleman was at the head of the Easton bar two Schaffers of Hellertown had a suit at court. Sitgreaves was employed by one of them who stated that he could prove his claim by three witnesses. When they came to court the first witness testified to the very opposite of what had been promised and the second witness corroborated the testimony of the first. This was too much for such an honorable man of the old school as Sitgreaves. He arose from his seat in court put his bag under his arm and addressed the court as follows:

“Your honor my client has decieved (sic) me woefully. I am his attorney no longer” and left the room.

In 1820 the town contained three houses eighteen families three taverns two stores one grist mill and seventy-three inhabitants. There was a linseed oil factory in the place during the early part of the century but it afterwards burned down. A distillery also was among the early industries. For many years the growth of the town was slow.

Educational matters were not neglected in the village although no separate school building was erected until the year 1845 when John Reintzheimer presented a lot for that purpose located along the brook in the center of the town. Previous to that a room was rented from one or the other of the citizens for educational purposes. School was taught in no less than six of the thirteen houses constituting Hellertown of 1820. As soon as the place was incorporated the school was divided into primary and grammer (sic) grades.

A tannery was started between 1780 and 1790 which continued in operation until 1872 when it passed out of the hands of Joseph F. Landis into those of Dr. W.F. Detweiler. The completion of the North Pennsylvania railroad in 1856 gave a new impetus to business. Rudolphos Kent of Gwywid with others from Philadelphia bought the Geisinger farm laid it out in town lots secured the railroad station on the tract and called the new town Hampton. This real estate enterprise proved a failure only one house having been built on it for many years. The station and originally been promised to the other end of town on lands of Rev. Samuel Hess and hence no interest was taken by the old citizens in the new town that was to supplant the old place and name. A number of buildings were erected in that part of town were the station was originally intended to be and Hampton was finally abandoned and the land resold to its original owner John Geisinger. For many years a small frame shanty was used as a station house. In 1865 a large convenient brick building was erected by the railroad.

A coal yard was stated by Joseph F. Boyer the railroad agent soon after the completion of the railroad. It remained in business until 1868 when Jer. S. Hess started a coal and lumber yard in the southern portion of the town where the business is still carried on and is now known as the Hess Coal and Lumber company. A brick yard was started by Rev. Samuel Hess in 1849.

The Saucon Iron Company was organized in 1866 and the establishment of this concern gave a fresh start to the quiet little village and new buildings began to be erected. In one year more than 20 new houses were built. The company was organized largely through the influence of Jacob Riegel a native of Saucon near Hellertown and a successful and prominent dry goods merchant in Philadelphia on August 21 1866. Letters patent were granted on August 23 1866. On March 18 1868 the company obtained a special charter from the legislature authorizing a capital of $300000 with the privilege of increasing it to $1000000.

The company was organized in 1866 by the election of Messrs. Joseph Riegel J. Gillinghamn Fell Joseph B. Altemus Joshua Lippincott George W. Whitaker and William Riegel as directors of the company. George W. Whitaker was elected president and superintendent Mr. Riegel treasurer James D. Bennett secretary and Joseph Diehl superintendent of mines. The works of the company consisted of two blast furnaces and a number of hemtite and magnetic ore mines.

Work on the first stack was completed February 1868 and blown on March 23 1868. The second was completed in April 1870 and blown on May 28 1870.

The Hellertown foundry was founded by Samuel Solliday in 1872. It changed hands repeatedly. In 1876 the company took a contract from the light house board of the United States to erect the iron super structure of a light house to be placed on the Florida coast.

A savings bank planing mill saw mill and flour mill were part of the town’s commercial assets at various times.

The Saucon Trust Company

It is particularly appropriate that this sketch of Hellertown should appear at this date by reason of the fact that it marks the second anniversary of one of the town’s most flourishing institutions. This is the Saucon Valley Trust company.

The organization meeting was held in Odd Fellows hall Hellertown. Victor S. Wagner was elected president Wye Joe Brown and Dr. Theo. Kharas vice presidents and Franklin Sutton burgess of Hellertown temporary secretary-treasurer.

A board of twenty-five directors was elected as follows: Jacob Apple W.J. Brown Harvey M. Freed Dr. Oliver H. Fretz H.H. Funk Albert W. Hicks Benjamin Hottel H.E. Knappenberger Dr. Theo. Kharas Charles Kichline George A. Keck A.E. Leiby H.K. Lerch H.F. Myers W.B. Price Elmer Prosser Paul A. Ricker Robert J. Rickert H.J. Rothermel Franklin Sutton Stover S. Snyder C.H. Stoneback Cyrus W. Weaver.

The company has become close to a half-million dollar institution. Its officers are as follows: Victor S. Wagner president; Dr. O.H. Fretz and C.W. Kichline vice presidents; Elmer E. Kunk secretary and treasurer; Thomas Pfeiffer assistant secretary; Jacob Apple A.L. Bergstresser H.H. Funk A.W. Hicks Benjamin Hottel H.E. Knappenberger Jacob M. Landis W.B. Price George B.

King.

*Burgess or Chief Burgess was the equivalent of mayor at that time. **In 1922 Hellertown operated its own school district. The merger of the Hellertown and Lower Saucon school districts did not happen until many years later.

Opposition Leader Joseph Harmon has asked the President of ExxonMobil Guyana Alistair Routledge for a meeting to discuss a timetable to fix malfunctioning equipment aboard the Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel  Liza Destiny.

In a letter dispatched to Mr. Routledge the Guyanese Opposition Leader wants the American oil major to also explain what the problem with the discharge silencer and what impact that would have on earnings and the environment.

“I therefore seek an urgent meeting with you and your executive team at the earliest mutually convenient opportunity to be briefed on matters to include this recent development the root cause(s) of equipment failures resulting in excessive flaring and reduced production your plan with schedule for permanently addressing these root cause(s) and the short and long term economic and environmental implications for all of Guyana” he said in the letter that his secretariat released to the media.

ExxonMobil last week informed government that it had cut production from 120000 barrels per day to 30000 barrels per day after the gas silencer developed problems after the installation and testing of the already troublesome flash gas compressor aboard the Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel (FPSO) Liza Destiny.

Since ExxonMobil began commercial oil production in December 2019 the FPSO has been dogged by problems leading to a reduction in production twice and an increase in gas flaring.

The Opposition Leader told the ExxonMobil Guyana President that his request for a meeting stems from concerns by supporters of A Partnership for National Unity+Alliance For Change (APNU+AFC) civil society and the wider Guyanese public about the prolonged problems facing the company in getting its oil production systems up to the required standards. “I am in receipt of numerous queries from our constituents civil society and concerned citizens expressing their worry that EEPGL’s (Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited’s) performance since inception appear to be far below expectations and is eroding their confidence in a safe and environmentally sound operation. Similar queries have been received by my colleague Members of Parliament and my office” said Mr. Harmon. EEPGL is the locally-registered ExxonMobil-controlled company with the other partners being Hess Corporation and China National Overseas Oil Company (CNOOC).

The Ministry of Natural Resources has said cautioned that it would take steps to protect Guyana’s national interests even as it joined ExxonMobil in raising concerns about the failure so far to properly remedy the technical issues.",,,,,,,,,

They know what works and what doesn’t when it comes to money and they’re more than willing to share their success. So you might as well listen right?

From tips on investing to growing your savings we’ve rounded up the best pieces of advice to navigate in the right direction in regards to your finances. Let’s dive in!

Experience trumps success

“Get locked out and find a way to climb in another way” Real Housewives of New York star Bethany Frankle says. “You’ve got to get on the road and figure out what it is that you want to do what value you add what clicks what doesn’t.” Frankle is the CEO of Skinnygirl which sold to Beam Global for a reported $100 million in 2011.

“Those people are the people who are successful not the people that are sitting there making $24000 a year complaining that they shouldn’t be making coffee that they shouldn’t be doing this they didn’t go to school for this. It’s called tough s***. Tough s***” Frankle added.

It doesn’t have to be complicated

“Getting straight with your money is as complicated as a trip to the grocery store: You need a comparison shop add and subtract stick with a plan and ask questions — nothing more” says Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

Control is key

“Money like emotions is something you must control to keep your life on the right track” says Natasha Munson bestselling author and CEO of Be Magic Inc – a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering single mothers.

Negotiation is about balance

Sallie Krawcheck former Wall Street executive and the CEO and co-founder of Ellevest said that instead of keeping her negotiation goals private she sets them out explicitly from the start.

“I say: ‘Here are the three most important things to me’. If I can get these three things I’m good” she says. “I find it cuts through a lot of the other stuff that’s lost with the macho ‘I want to win’ back-and-forth of negotiations.”

It doesn’t hurt to be a little greedy

“I will tell you how to become rich. Close the doors. Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful” Warren Buffet chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway says.

Sometimes it’s not about money

“The reason I’ve been able to be so financially successful is my focus has never ever for one minute been money” says Oprah Winfrey.

Investing is key

“And I think the more money you put in people’s hands the more they will spend. And if they don’t spend it they invest it. And investing it is another way of creating jobs. It puts money into mutual funds or other kinds of banks that can go out and make loans and we need to do that” says Michael Bloomberg CEO of Bloomberg LP.

Don’t underestimate small business

“When a small business grows like eBay did it has a multiplier effect. It creates other small businesses that supply it with intellectual capital goods and services” says Meg Whitman former CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and current CEO of Quibi.

Confidence and self-worth go a long way

“Being confident and believing in your own self-worth is necessary to achieving your potential” says Sheryl Sandberg COO of Facebook.

Let change be your motivator

“My goal was never to just create a company. A lot of people misinterpret that as if I don’t care about revenue or profit or any of those things. But what not being just a company means to me is not being just that — building something that actually makes a really big change in the world” says Mark Zuckerberg CEO of Facebook.

The hotel prominently had HGI Promise signs displayed on the front desk:

This image is from my other recent stay at an HGI in Monterrey (no issues).

Here’s the email I receive from the hotel:

First of all I hope you are doing well and I appreciate your staying with us. Your feedback will allows us to improve our service. Our main goal is to meet your satisfaction and to make every stay unique and memorable. I am very sorry for the inconvenience you indicated and I want to notify you that we have taken action Our Executive Housekeeper will be in charge of supervising your next stay.

Here’s the email that I sent to diamond@hilton.com after receiving the mail above:

Dear Diamond Desk Please forward this to the Guest Assistance. This Hilton Garden Inn has housekeeping issues and they were unable to honor the HGI satisfaction guarantee. The housekeeping team member had removed dirty towels that I had left on the floor and used shampoo and conditioner. The person hadn’t replaced them however. Not sure if the hotel is running low on supply. I didn’t realize this until trying to shower after working out at 1 AM. The front desk was unable to resolve the issue at the time of checking out because the General Manager was out of the property. The hotel later sent me an email that they try to do better in the future. How does that help with the stay I just had?

The email doesn’t contain my HH Diamond number the hotel’s name or the reservation information because I forwarded the confirmation email.

The following email was received from the Guest Assistance 13 minutes later:

Thank you for contacting our Guest Assistance team. My name is REMOVED and it is my pleasure to assist with your concerns at the Hilton Garden Inn Tuxtla Gutierrez. I understand your frustration and appreciate you contacting us to share your concerns. As a valued Hilton Honors Member I am pleased to show you how important guest service is to us.

Here’s a video of the “suite” that I had booked at this hotel (not an upgrade):

It appears that this is not the most recent generation HGI property.

Conclusion

If the hotel prominently displays PROMISE signs every employee should resolve issues that guests have without consulting the General Manager first.

It is the fault of the head of this hotel (General Manager) that employees are not adequately empowered to deal with guest relations issues.

Promising to ensure the housekeeping is better on my (very unlikely) future stay by an email a day later is not good enough.

I am glad however that Hilton stands by its guarantees even when hotels fail. I am baffled how fast the Guest Assistance and Diamond Desk can respond to emails. This builds confidence for me to continue to patronize Hilton-affiliated hotels that I have not previously stayed at while continuing my journey to lifetime Diamond status.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRldHJvaXRuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvZ29sZi8yMDIxLzA0LzE4L2NpbmstY29hc3RzLXdpbi1oaWx0b24taGVhZC0ybmQtdGl0bGUtc2Vhc29uLzcyNzk4MjkwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sunday's golf: Cink coasts to win at Hilton Head for 2nd title of season,"Associated Press

Hilton Head Island S.C. — The golf was exceptional for Stewart Cink. What made his third RBC Heritage title truly special was that his family was there to experience his age-defying success.

Cink hugged son Reagan his caddie after he closed out his four-shot victory at Harbour Town with a stress-free par on the lighthouse-framed 18th hole. Wife Lisa their other son Connor and his fiancee Jess Baker were in the gallery cheering Cink's second win this season.

“To have a posse like that waiting at the end to celebrate with” Cink said “it's just an experience you don't get to have in your life that often.”

Maybe the Cink family has more such joyous moments ahead with Stewart's resurgence on the PGA Tour.

He shot a steady stress-free 70 to cap off a dominant record-breaking week at an age — 47 — when many players are looking ahead to the PGA Tour Champions.

Instead it was Cink finishing four better than Emiliano Grillo and Harold Varner III. Grillo shot a 68 while Varner who had the highest finish of his career fired a 66.

The 30-year-old Varner took found plenty of encouragement in the man who beat him.

“He's old and he's kicking everyone's (butt)” Varner said. “Yeah it inspires me. It inspires me to know that I can play golf for a long time.”

The Cinks had their arms around each other to celebrate.

“I don't even know if I have the words” Stewart Cink said.

He won for the second time this season — only he and Bryson DeChambeau have done that. He broke an 11-year winless drought in the season's first tournament the Safeway Open back in September.

That one seemed to come out of nowhere. But Cink backed it up with four more top-20 finishes including a tie for 12th last week at the Masters.

He won $1.278 million nearly as much as the $1.404 million for his two previous victories at Harbour Town combined.

The second win comes with a major perk — Cink earned an exemption into the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines in June. It will be the first U.S. Open since 2017 for the former British Open champion.

Cink became the fourth player to win twice in the same PGA Tour season after turning 47. Sam Snead Julius Boros and Kenny Perry who accomplished it twice are the others.

Cink put on show for the ages by shooting 16-under 126 in the first two rounds — shattering the lowest 36-hole score at Harbour Town of 13-under 129 shared by Jack Nicklaus and Phil Mickelson. Cink added a 69 on Saturday to reach 18 under two better than Justin Leonard's 54-hole score in 2002.

Cink carried a five-shot lead into the final round and dared all chasers to come get him. Nobody made a run at Cink who led by at least three shots throughout.

PGA Championship winner Collin Morikawa paired with Cink opened with a birdie. But bogeys on the second and fourth holes took Morikawa out of the mix.

Maverick McNealy had five birdies on the front nine to climb to 14-under four back of Cink in the middle of the round. Consecutive bogeys on the 11th and 12th ended McNealy's surge.

Grillo and Varner came the closest at 15-under and were just three back until Cink's final birdie at the par-3 17th which made it all but certain he would add another plaid winner's jacket to the ones he won in 2000 and 2004.

Cink had made 17 birdies and two eagles the first three rounds. He had only two birdies Sunday but that was more than enough to claim his eighth career victory.

Cink anticipated a dogfight. Instead he said he fought the course rather than the field for most of the day. After his strong play at Augusta National he was full of confidence.

“I really felt I had the kind of stuff that was going to be very hard to beat” he said.

He was downright impossible to chase down after his blazing hot start on Thursday and Friday.

“What's so amazing is this kind of rebirth that Stewart is experiencing at such an older age” Lisa Cink said. “I'm just in awe of how well he's playing at this time in his career.”

McNealy (67) Corey Conners (68) and Matt Fitzpatrick (68) tied for fourth at 13-under. Morikawa slipped to seventh after a 72 tied with Chris Kirk (67) at 12-under.

Top-ranked Dustin Johnson closed with his best round of the tournament at 66 to finish tied for 13th at 10-under. Johnson was the November Masters champ yet missed the cut there last week and was never in contention at Harbour Town.

“I just feel like I made way too many mistakes” he said. “Around here you make mistakes they penalize you pretty big.”

PGA Tour Champions

Naples Fla. — Steve Stricker figured someone could come out of the pack with a low score and win the Chubb Classic on Sunday and it turned out to be him.

Stricker closed with a 5-under 67 taking control with a wedge into 3 feet for birdie on the 16th hole. That carried him to a one-shot victory in Naples where the 54-year-old from Wisconsin makes his winter home.

The U.S. Ryder Cup captain won for the sixth time on the PGA Tour Champions his first title since the U.S. Senior Open in the summer of 2019.

Robert Karlsson of Sweden who shared the 36-hole lead with Fred Couples and Monday qualifier Alex Cejka of Germany each made birdie on the final hole to tie for second. Cejka is assured of getting into the next open Champions event without qualifying.

Couples shot 71 and tied for sixth.

European Tour

Atzenbrugg Austria — John Catlin won for the third time in the last eight months on the European Tour closing with a 7-under 65 and outlasting Maximilian Kieffer on the fifth playoff hole Sunday in the Austrian Open.

Catlin who grew up in California and played college golf in New Mexico moves into the top 80 in the world and is poised to play in his first major next month at the PGA Championship which typically takes the top 100.

Kieffer who closed with a 66 missed a birdie putt on the first playoff hole. He ultimately made it easy on Catlin by hitting in the water three times on the fifth extra hole.

They finished at 14-under 274.

Catlin now has 10 victories worldwide including four on the Asian Tour.

LPGA Tour

Kapolei Hawaii — Lydia Ko ended nearly three years without a victory by closing with a 65 to win the Lotte Championship by seven shots in an LPGA Tour event that ended Saturday.

Ko torched Kapolei Golf Club and finished at 28-under 260.

It brought back vivid memories of the teenager from New Zealand who became the youngest player to reach No. 1 in the women's world golf ranking in 2015. She also is the LPGA’s youngest-ever winner major champion and player of the year.

Ko turns 24 next Saturday.

So when you’ve spent the better part of your life in a place most people dream of visiting where do you go from here?

Nowhere.

Corbitt and his wife live within walking distance of the golf course have a nice water view and he has a regular Saturday golf game with friends. He may go fishing a little more often and add a second round of golf to his weekly routine. But Corbitt isn’t interested in going anywhere else.

“We’re here to stay” Corbitt said sitting in the stylish Harbour Town clubhouse he helped bring to life in 2015.

A graduate of Lander College Corbitt came to Hilton Head in the mid-1970s wanting to be in the golf business and he was willing to do anything. He started out picking up range balls at Harbour Town handling golf bags for resort guests and staging carts.

It was an unglamorous start – “the absolute bottom” Corbitt calls it – in a glamorous spot. But it spoke to the pull golf had on Corbitt who played collegiately and worked golf jobs in Greenwood South Carolina. A trip to Hilton Head and Sea Pines in 1969 had stayed with Corbitt. It’s what pulled him back.

As Sea Pines and Hilton Head evolved so did Corbitt. He eventually became head pro at the Sea Pines Club which has two courses Corbitt would eventually help get redesigned.

Corbitt has dealt with multiple ownership changes through his four-plus decades and at one point he ran the courses at Shipyard Port Royal Wexford Indigo Run and Sea Pines. Eventually Sea Pines became his focus and his responsibilities reached beyond golf handling facility maintenance the marina and other recreational pursuits.

He has done his job when the resources ran thin survived a corporate bankruptcy and also enjoyed the many good days particularly now under the ownership of Riverstone Group which bought the resort in 2005. His title is vice president of sports and operations.

“It’s pretty awesome that I’ve had the opportunity to spend my entire career here at Sea Pines. I’ve done a lot of different things. But it’s still been great” Corbitt said. “Today we have the financial backing to where we can pretty well do whatever our ownership would like us to do and they don’t do anything less than first class.”

John Farrell who has worked with Corbitt for 32 years and has been hired as his successor has seen it firsthand.

“He has never tapped the brakes once” Farrell said. “It’s his enthusiasm and his passion for the pursuit of improvement not so much for perfection but he wants to get better at everything we do every day and he never lets up.”

Over the past 15 years Sea Pines has undergone an extensive refreshing much of which has centered on the golf operation. Pete Dye redesigned Heron Point in 2007 and Davis Love III completely rebuilt what is now called Atlantic Dunes drawing immediate praise when it reopened in 2016.

A new clubhouse shared by both courses was built as was the new Harbour Town clubhouse. When it came time in 2001 to update the Harbour Town course a revered layout Corbitt worked directly with Dye.

“I said ‘Pete we really want you to be involved.’ He said ‘If anybody’s going to touch this course it’s going to be me.’ That’s all we wanted to hear. We said we are not rebuilding Harbour Town. It’s a total restoration. He said ‘I’ve got it’ and that’s what we did.”

The resort is in the midst of a new golden age.

“It’s as though lightning struck twice in the same place” Farrell said referring to Sea Pines creator Charles Fraser and now Riverstone.

“We work for a family and a company that is so passionate about golf and they believe in doing things in only one way and that’s the finest possible way. We’re so lucky.”

Corbitt always dressed immaculately has had a hand in all of the changes big and small.

“I’m proud of being a part of it and proud of being given the opportunity” Corbitt said. “It’s been pretty amazing.”

As Farrell expands his role from his long-time duties as director of golf he will be guided by the lessons he’s learned from his friend.

“There are almost too many (lessons) to count” Farrell said. “But most notably it’s don’t let up. Keep looking be happy and have a servant’s heart. Keep looking for ways to improve.”

Though Corbitt is retiring – just down the street from where he has worked all these years – Farrell doesn’t believe he’s going anywhere. He will still want to be involved.

“It means too much to him” Farrell said. “We always tease him and say his only regret in life is that he only has one life to give to Sea Pines.”

Here's What to Do... (Part Two),"I recently wrote about some common short-cuts to renewing elite status with your favourite hotel chain(s) even if you don’t meet the lower relaxed criteria in place for 2021. (re-read that article to refresh your memory) If those suggestions don’t work you might be interested in strategies for picking up cheap elite credit especially if you aren’t likely to have much by way of international holidays or work travel in 2021.

A couple of reminders:

You must book directly with the hotel chain to earn elite status credit A “stay” is defined as one or more consecutive nights at the same hotel irrespective of the number of times you check in and out (or change rooms) – this is only now relevant to Hilton Honors

Day Use Rooms / Work From Hotel

Hilton Honors has long been the market leader when it comes to offering hotel rooms for daytime use only. You can book these online by simply setting the arrival and departure dates to be the same.

A Day Use Rate works exactly as the name suggests – you can use a room during the daytime but you cannot stay overnight. Airport hotels often offer these rates because some people just want a quick shower and change of clothes after an overnight flight. Others want somewhere to spend a day working using the gym taking a nap etc.

The precise definition of “day” varies at each hotel but it usually runs from 9 or 10 am until 5 or 6 pm. Moreover with Hilton Honors a “day use rate” room is treated exactly as an overnight stay for elite status purposes – you earn both a night and a stay credit.

Why “day use room” for elite status purposes? Because it’s usually much cheaper. You’re never going to find an overnight stay in London for £30-40… (and of course Rob over at HeadforPoints likes to emphasise that working from a hotel ought to be tax deductible for the self-employed making your net cost even cheaper)

For £500-600 you can repeat this 15 times in 2021 and renew your Diamond status without a single “normal” stay. You will also earn many thousands of points. – from your base earnings your elite status bonus any promo points as well as the 1000 point welcome amenity.

The other major hotel chains have started to emphasise their day use rooms as well but they are more fiddly to book and I am less certain about how they are treated for elite status purposes. And because those chains don’t allow you to renew elite status by accumulating “stays” you will require far more morning trips to the hotel to check in for a few hours.

Staycations Using Points

With a hotel chain such as Marriott you will receive the fifth night free when using your points. If you are a Platinum member holding the American Express credit card you will already have 25 + 15 = 40 elite nights in your account.

Although you can of course stay anywhere you like you might be interested in spending as few points as possible to lock in your Platinum renewal. Luckily the UK has 33 Marriott hotels in the lowest 3 award categories..

These aren’t just hotels in out-of-the-way places such as Aberdeen. I am sure that you would enjoy a 5-night getaway to gems such as:

Mattress Runs

A mattress run is essentially a hotel stay that is completely unnecessary but you do it in order to earn credit for elite status purposes. The most extreme example is checking into a hotel and immediately leaving although some people stretch the definition to include local staycations where you actually do spend the night (but are only truly staying because you need elite status credit).

Because these hotel stays are completely unnecessary you want to do them late in the year when you have no other choice to accumulate stays/nights. They can also make sense when you would be taking advantage of a lucrative bonus-point promotion. Or in the case of Marriott Bonvoy and World of Hyatt… when you have managed to make a Best Rate Guarantee claim and have chosen to earn 5000 points as compensation.

But there are a few pitfalls associated with mattress runs that you must avoid:

Somebody must check-in to the hotel in person. Simply booking a prepaid stay doesn’t count. Completing the check-in process on a phone App won’t work either. Unless you access the room with your phone the hotel can consider you as a no-show (and save themselves money).

It doesn’t necessarily have to be you checking in though. Many chains allow for a second person’s name to be attached to a reservation. It is a simple matter of calling the hotel (or loyalty programme) a few days in advance to say that my partner/friend/etc. will be sharing my room and will be arriving before me – please allow them to check-in on my behalf. In some cases the hotel might be strict and might insist that the principal reservation holder (i.e. you) passes by the front desk at some point; many don’t really bother. Of course you won’t really be asking a friend to do a mattress run for you. Instead you’ll be trying to earn elite status credit from somebody else’s hotel stay. (which is a breach of the terms & conditions and could cost you your account)

Don’t just leave. When doing a mattress run I make a point to visit my room briefly to make sure that there is no damage I might be subsequently blamed for. Since I’ve made the effort to travel to the hotel I’ll usually visit the hotel’s executive lounge gym and/or pool. If there are complimentary items such as bottled water etc. I’ll take them as well.

However under NO circumstances should you immediately check-out again. This process will undoubtedly mess up the computer systems and you could miss out on the valuable elite status credit you are making the effort to earn. All modern hotels will automatically check out guests on departure day with their credit card details on file – the only reason to pass by a front desk on departure day is to get a print out of your receipt. So just leave whenever you desire and let the hotel check you out automatically in the morning…

It’s best to only mattress run one night stays. The longer the stay the more likely that housekeeping finds an empty hotel room one morning and informs the front desk that you have left. The hotel may then decide to check you out prematurely. Although housekeeping service is often reduced due to the pandemic a Do Not Disturb sign is no guarantee that your room won’t be occasionally checked to see whether the guest is dead (or is doing something illegal or messy inside). So don’t book a long stay and expect that DND sign to stay there for the duration.

Conclusion

Hopefully you will be able to renew your elite status in 2021 even though your usual travel patterns have surely been affected by lockdown. But if you find yourself needing to make a special effort I hope that my tips have helped you to do it cost (and time) effectively…

All the while she shared the beautiful sunshine with 11 orange-clad strangers building a fancy Home Depot playset.

When Eileen was asked by Make-A-Wish Idaho what her wish was she didn’t fully understand.

Eileen was diagnosed with leukemia in 2019 and was completely unfamiliar with the 501(c)(3) organization. But after an explanation by her parents and representatives of Make-A-Wish Idaho Eileen asked for a swing set so she and her four-year-old sister could play together in their backyard.

The selfless wish for a toy that would provide both Eileen and her sister joy is something Make-A-Wish Idaho Regional Director Julie Thomas called “wonderful.”

“These children are thrown into adult situations nobody asks for it” she told EastIdahoNews.com. “These children are resilient they’re way stronger than you and I.”

Yeral Dia Eileen’s mother recalled discovering her daughter’s condition in June 2019.

“We were just going in for her check-up” she said. “It was summer time and I saw a paleness in her I was like ‘she just doesn’t look right maybe she’s dehydrated or something.’ We never suspected anything else.”

After lab tests the Dia family learned Eileen had cancer. An early discovery though allowed doctors to get a quick jump on treatment and the little girl has been in remission since July 2019.

“It’s been really hard” Dia said. “We just never imagined she would be going through anything like this. She’s been really brave.”

The Dia family is hopeful that by the end of August this year Eileen will be able to cease treatment entirely.

When that happens the little girl will be able to enjoy a massive playset situated in her backyard along with an accompanying sandbox.

The playset complete with two slides monkey bars and three swings was supplied free of charge by Home Depot and constructed by the company’s associate volunteer force — Team Depot.

Team Depot is made up entirely of Home Depot employees willing to volunteer their time off and expertise explained Chubbuck Home Depot spokeswoman Lynn Frahm. And this group had no shortage of volunteers. In fact Frahm said she was forced to turn several volunteers down.

“We usually do several of these projects a year whether it’s for veterans or just something in community” she told EastIdahoNews.com. “In 2020 with COVID it put restrictions on everything we couldn’t do any of those community projects. So when we were given the green light this year we were so excited.”

Team Depot arrived at the Dia home early Saturday morning for the all-day project and wouldn’t be leaving until the job was complete Frahm said.

Thomas lauded the commitment of both Home Depot and Team Depot whom she said have been “110%” invested in the endeavor.

“It’s incredible” she said. “They have been phenomenal Lynn and I have been in constant contact. They have made it seamless for us they’ve done all the work.”

Team Depot has been itching to get back to serving according to Frahm.

“I’ve got an amazing team out here today” Frahm said. “I’m really proud of everybody. We’re just super-excited to be here giving back. Giving back is one of the core values with Home Depot and this is a perfect opportunity for us to give back to the community it means a lot to us.”

As for the selection process that led Make-A-Wish Idaho and Team Depot to the American Falls backyard Thomas explained that there are multiple ways for a wisher to be referred. Referrals can either come from the family or the hospital or doctor’s office.

In order to be considered by Make-A-Wish a child must have a progressive degenerative or malignant illness.

After a wisher is selected their information is forwarded to a physician who either approves or denies their selection.

Then comes a virtual interview where one of Make-A-Wish Idaho’s seven staff members chats directly with the wisher and their family and the wish is made.

Thomas said that she had been in regular contact with Eileen and her family throughout the process.

Wishes granted must fall into one of four criteria; go be have or meet. Eileen chose to *have* and swing set.

*Go* is difficult right now Thomas explained. COVID restrictions especially having to do with travel have sent a lot of kids back to the drawing board.

“With COVID a lot of kids have had to reimagine their wish and rethink it because we don’t know when travel is going to open” Thomas explained. “And even when it does open we’re going to wait until it is extremely safe for our kids.”

Still Make-A-Wish Idaho has 80 wishes slated for 2021.

As difficult as the past two years have been for the Dia family they have been nothing but grateful for all the support they have gotten from all directions. Family and friends have been there to help during long trips to receive treatment or providing care for Eileen’s younger sister Dia said continuing to fight back tears.

“Through all this experience we’re just grateful for everybody’s support. That’s what really matters to us right now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vYm9pbmdib2luZy5uZXQvMjAyMS8wNC8xOC9teS1saWZlLW9uLXRoZS1yb2FkLWxvc2luZy1pdC5odG1s0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly9ib2luZ2JvaW5nLm5ldC8yMDIxLzA0LzE4L215LWxpZmUtb24tdGhlLXJvYWQtbG9zaW5nLWl0Lmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My Life on the Road: Losing it,"I've worked from where ever I've called home for the past eleven years.

In my old career I worked in close contact with the public during Ontario's SARS outbreak in the early 2000s. Later that same decade I was charged with creating a business continuity plan for a large private security company as the threat of Swine Flu loomed large. When I first read about the viral outbreak in China in late 2019 dancing with paranoia and anxiety as I do I calmly headed to Home Depot in search of N95 masks and a number of pharmacies to buy up the supplies I'd need to keep myself an my extended family well-stocked with homemade hand sanitizer and cleansing wipes for months to come. On the way home I thought to myself that without knowing it I'd been preparing for a long time to deal what might be to come. My wife and I then fucked off to Africa on a working vacation for a month. As we backpacked across Morocco I kept up on the case count in Asia.

We left Morocco a day before the kingdom closed its doors to air travel.

We were only home for a few days when Calgary where we staying with family at the time was ordered into lock down. I made hand sanitizer and wipes. We'd just done a Costco run. We were worried but calm.

Most days I spent time talking my sister-in-law down after she watched our Prime Minister's daily COVID-19 briefing. I did my job. I prepared an isolation room for my wife when while on her way home from a week's rotation at her job she called to tell me that she had a number of symptoms that suggested that she might have contracted the virus. I brought food to her and monitored her condition over the next week. I prayed to Santa Muerte (we'll talk about that some other time) and brought my wife food and cold medication. She was tested. She was fine.

We lasted until the fall in Alberta before making for Vancouver Island to winter in the RV.

Setting up camp in relative isolation helped with the stress of living in a time of plague. We were fortunate enough to be surrounded by wooded walking trails. The ocean was a few minutes of driving away. We could do nothing in so many beautiful places. We're still doing well as the number of third-wave cases and an inept vaccine rollout fills hospitals and soon morgues across my county. We've laid in supplies again hoping for the best expecting the worse.

At any time during any of this I could have fallen into a deep depression. The isolation or the fear of simply breathing the air could have paralyzed me despite the drugs I take daily to help me hold my shit together. It didn't happen.

And then it did.

Two weeks ago all of the shit I had managed to hold on to for over a year got lost.

I was surprised to find that it had nothing to do with sickness worry over my family and few friends or how unbalanced I feel staying in the same places for so long. I realized that I was fed the fuck up with technology. It's digging a hole and asking me to lay down and fill it.

My days are spent in front of laptop desktop and tablet displays. On the evenings that I write for this site my screen time runs hours longer. I left Facebook and Instagram in a white hot rage. My interactions on Twitter with friends I have not seen for years feel hollow. Cruising CounterSocial for content reminds me of what Twitter used to be but I'm not able to engage and know no one on the network. The news angers and numbs me in turns. I have a smartwatch that tracks the meaningless moments of my life and a smartphone which of late only tells me things I do not want to know. It's all I can do to sit down and write. I started this post and deleted it five times before surrendering. My first successful draft was crafted in longhand.

I hope to find a way out of my digital despair. But working in online service journalism for a living and currently having no other window on the world—due to the state of the world—I have no idea yet of what changes I can practically make.

I'm looking at it as an experiment in mental health. I'll let you know how its going as things proceed.

The e-commerce giant is reportedly launching a service that would have workers deliver and build furniture positioning it against retailers in the home improvement space such as Lowe’s Home Depot and online home goods store Wayfair which charges extra for a building fee.

Amazon did not immediately return a FOX Business request for comment.

WOMEN IN HOME IMPROVEMENT BUSINESSES ARE NAILING IT DURING THE PANDEMIC

The new assembly furniture service is slated to roll out in Virginia and two other markets sources told Bloomberg. Customers who order big-box items such as sofas beds or mattress sets would be able to have them put together on-demand and an Amazon employee would then take away the packaging according to the report.

Amazon’s move to compete with the furniture assembly market comes on the heels of staggering growth for the home improvement category spurred by more Americans working at home during the pandemic.

Demand for home renovations also continues keeping business for companies that sell furniture and home design booming. Homeowners are estimated to spend around 4.8% more by the first quarter of 2022 data from the Leading Indicator of Remodeling from Harvard University’s Joint Center for House Studies as reported by Realator.com found.

However as more Americans become vaccinated and feel more comfortable traveling and being social the same research found consumers may be less willing to partake in DIY projects perhaps signaling the greater need for more assembly services.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvYXByLzE4L2NhdmUtY2l0eS12ZXQtYnVpbGRzLXdoZWVsY2hhaXItcmFtcC1mZWxsb3ctdmV0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cave City vet builds wheelchair ramp for fellow vet | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"SEARCY — About three weeks ago James Mundorff saw on Facebook that a veteran in Searcy needed a wheelchair ramp for his house.

“I contacted the [Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association’s] chapter commander’s wife and asked her where the veteran’s address was” Mundorff said. “She told me that a church was going to go by and give him an estimate on the materials [for the ramp] so I thought I had missed the opportunity.”

The ramp is for Bill Morton the public-relations officer for the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association 7-8. When the church had proposed building the ramp Morton would have had to pay for the materials so Mundorff volunteered to build the ramp for Morton and provide the materials.

“I’ve built many of these things before and I knew what I was doing” Mundorff said. “I went to Home Depot that night and got the materials needed and the next morning I was sitting at his house at 9 a.m.”

Mundorff who lives in Cave City is a support member of the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association. He said it took him and fellow veteran Robert Lawson the whole day to build the wheelchair ramp because of the rain but Mundorff said it would have taken longer if he hadn’t had Lawson’s help.

“I went back a second day and put hand rails on it for Bill” Mundorff said. “He had so much trouble and difficulty getting down the stairs. He needs the ramp now not when somebody could get around to it.”

Mundorff has been a member of the association since last March. He served in the United States Army from January 1976 to August 1982 after graduating from high school in Texas. However he did not see any combat so he is considered a support member for the association.

“I think that is just what support means to help and support our vets any way possible that we can — that’s the way I took it and feel about it” he said. “I was honored to help Bill.”

Mundorff said he joined the Army to see the world but never got to leave the states.

“I was not in a combat situation and I only served stateside never went overseas” he said. “The Vietnam War had just ended and all the branches were recruiting.

“Their biggest sale pitch was to join the military and see the world and they stuck me in the middle of the United States in Kansas and left me there.”

Mundorff said he kept asking to go anywhere overseas but it never happened so after six years he earned an honorable discharge from the Army.

“The military was good to me and I got a college education out of it” he said. “It was a good decision in my life to join.”

After he left the Army Mundorff moved to Jacksonville and lived there for about 10 years. He then lived and worked in Florida for another 10 to 12 years before moving back to Arkansas. He has lived in Cave City for a little more than a decade.

“I had a hard time in Florida” he said. “The housing market deteriorated. We built houses down there too fast with not enough buyers and it all collapsed — I lost quite a bit.”

He said he moved back to Arkansas after seeing a job opening on the internet.

“I’ve been working for this one company ever since” he said.

Mundorff said he decided to join the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association because he believes it has the same ideology that he shares.

“I like everybody” he said. “They are all kind polite and nice. I can’t be a full patch because I am not a combat vet but I am honored to be a supporter.”

He said he wanted to help Morton with the ramp because “veterans aren’t getting the help they need.”

“I don’t know where the problem is because I haven’t been with it long enough to locate the problem” Mundorff said. “I don’t know if veterans don’t know who to ask or if there are just not enough people to actually go out and do the tasks.

“I don’t know where the problem is so I just try to do what I can. Hopefully it will make a difference. Maybe someone will see [me helping vets] and they will say ‘I can do it too.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDQvMTgvb250YXJpby1vcmVnb24tbWFyaWp1YW5hLTQ4MTIxMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Border weed: How the hometown of tater tots became a cannabis capital,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/18/ontario-oregon-marijuana-481211 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDQvMTgvb250YXJpby1vcmVnb24tbWFyaWp1YW5hLTQ4MTIxMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Minnesota is no longer the organizational heart that it was after former Norwest CEO Dick Kovacevich moved from Minneapolis to San Francisco in 1999 to become CEO of the merged bank-holding company that took the Wells Fargo name and California headquarters.

Wells Fargo under its third CEO in five years seems to have put behind it billions in fines and years of damage to its reputation that dimmed its star and capped growth and left Minnesota a declining regional hub.

Wells Fargo last week posted a strong $4.75 billion profit in the first quarter. And its stock price which peaked over $50 per share in 2018 when the worst emerged about its fake-accounts scandal has risen from under $20 per share a year ago to over $40 lately.

""I am confident that we are making progress though it is not always in a straight line"" Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf told investors and analysts last week.

Scharf 55 is a New York-based banker a protégé of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon whose single-most important hire may have been Bill Daley vice chairman of public affairs who followed Scharf from New York-based BNY Mellon to Wells. Daley a lawyer who also once worked for Dimon is a former federal official and chief of staff to ex-President Barack Obama. He led Scharf's two-year quest to end Wells Fargo's legal and political problems.

""Nobody is better wired than Bill Daley"" said Jim Campbell Minnesota CEO of Norwest-Wells Fargo until his 2002 retirement. ""He's in New York with Charlie. Let's face it. … Charlie has basically moved the heartbeat of the Wells Fargo enterprise to New York. That's where the major banks are headquartered.""

Wells Fargo which also has a regional hub in Charlotte N.C. is starting to get traction on its recovery.

In Minnesota Wells Fargo since 2018 has been led by Laurie Nordquist who has the titles of CEO in Minnesota and president of the company's Central States region.

Wells Fargo is the second-largest bank in the state with nearly $72 billion in deposits trailing only Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp.

Nordquist has a mandate to increase Wells Fargo's visibility.

""We are going to focus on affordable housing minority small businesses specifically and small business generally and the financial health of our customers and communities"" Nordquist said in an interview.

""We will be part of significant and positive change. Our team member involvement is as important as our dollars.""

Wells Fargo employment in Minnesota has declined from about 20000 to 18000 over the last decade amid its problems but also reflects a streamlining in financial services focused on electronic banking and fewer branch offices.

Yet Wells Fargo also this month announced plans to redevelop its 2020-destroyed office at Lake Street and Nicollet Avenue into a $50 million-plus 200-home housing project including a smaller branch office at a 2.5-acre site that was mostly a parking lot and a drive-through bank.

It's a working-class neighborhood including immigrant and minority entrepreneurs that needs housing. And it may mark better days ahead for Wells Fargo in the Twin Cities.

Nordquist a native of Elbow Lake Minn. and graduate of St. Olaf College noted that Wells Fargo opened a new regional headquarters campus on the east side of downtown in 2016 and made $7 million in ""diverse community capital grants"" to Twin Cities nonprofits in recent years.

Most recently Wells Fargo said it would refund nationally the $420 million it has made for processing SBA payroll-protection loans in 2020.

The first $112 million has been disbursed including $9 million to Twin Cities-area minority-business counselor-lenders such as Meda African Economic Development Solutions Neighborhood Development Center and WomenVenture.

They take fledgling capital-light entrepreneurs and help the most promising grow until they are bankable by traditional lenders.

Twenty years ago Kovacevich sensitive to public perception when he agreed to move the combined Norwest-Wells Fargo headquarters to San Francisco essentially gave Campbell about $280 million to buy renovate and expand the abandoned Honeywell campus into a Wells Fargo regional mortgage campus. Local employment skyrocketed.

Campbell his successor and Kovacevich proved at least for a decade that you could lose your national headquarters to a merger but still grow locally.

A lot of Twin Citians thought Wells Fargo was still based here which is just what Campbell and his colleagues hoped.

""Kovacevich left me with a lot of money and flexibility"" Campbell said. ""I got everything I wanted. The Honeywell campus was a fortuitous thing. My sense is that Wells Fargo still a heck of a franchise will ride through this period. But Minneapolis-St. Paul will never be within Wells Fargo what it was. They probably say the same thing in Charlotte.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXN0aWdlb25saW5lLmNvbS90aC9saWZlc3R5bGUvZ2FkZ2V0cy94dXBlcm1hc2stYnktd2lsbC1pLWFtLTIwMjEv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJlc3RpZ2VvbmxpbmUuY29tL3RoL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9nYWRnZXRzL3h1cGVybWFzay1ieS13aWxsLWktYW0tMjAyMS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xupermask by Will.i.am To Become the Next Fashion Accessory – Cleaner Air Bluetooth and LED Lights,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.prestigeonline.com/th/lifestyle/gadgets/xupermask-by-will-i-am-2021/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXN0aWdlb25saW5lLmNvbS90aC9saWZlc3R5bGUvZ2FkZ2V0cy94dXBlcm1hc2stYnktd2lsbC1pLWFtLTIwMjEv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJlc3RpZ2VvbmxpbmUuY29tL3RoL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9nYWRnZXRzL3h1cGVybWFzay1ieS13aWxsLWktYW0tMjAyMS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwMzg4NTE5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for Arthur 'Arrador' Vansickle,"Arthur 'Arrador' Vansickle

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

“Design creates something out of the ordinary and makes a major contribution to shaping the brand image in the public eye” – this statement used by Mercedes-Benz to define its design philosophy isn’t relevant just for its vehicles. The bipolarity of intelligence and emotion which are fundamental to the brand is evident also in the way the company preserves and presents its history while also allowing a glint into the future of mobility.

We are talking about the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart Germany. Stuttgart incidentally is home to two iconic automobile brands – Daimler AG and Porsche – and is also the birthplace of leading automotive supplier the Bosch Group which was set-up in 1886 by Robert Bosch as a “Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering.” Mahle is another large global supplier that is headquartered in Stuttgart.

The city is the capital of the state of Baden-Württemberg in southwest Germany and lies at the centre of the historic region of Swabia. It is often referred to as the “cradle of the automobile” as the automobile and motorcycle was invented in Stuttgart by Karl Benz in 1886. The automobile was subsequently industrialised in 1887 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach at the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (Daimler Motors Corporation) which they founded to manufacture engines and vehicles.

This is a trip down memory lane to the Mercedes-Benz Museum located at Mercedesstraße right next to the Daimler factory and a stone's throw away from the Mercedes-Benz Arena home to the German Bundesliga (football league) club VfB Stuttgart.

From our archives we take a look at some of the most iconic exhibits at the museum.

Designed by Dutch architect Ben van Berkel the museum was opened in 2006

The museum is designed like a double helix with a clover leaf pattern. Like the exhibits it houses – 160 vehicles and over 1500 displays – the museum itself reflects innovation in every sense. It is claimed to be the only museum in the world that can document in a single continuous timeline of about 130 years of auto industry history right from the first product created in 1886. Designed by Dutch architect Ben van Berkel the museum was opened in 2006. The shell of the museum is made of glass and aluminium. What is exhibited over nine floors and 16500 sq m area is utter delight for not just an auto enthusiast but anyone with a remote interest in history.

The legends room

First up you step into a lift designed like a space pod but called a 'time machine' by the guide. The lift took us nine floors and 34 m above the ground to 1886 the year the company was born. The first exhibit you see is that of a horse indicating – you guessed it right – one horsepower! Take a right and you are in a legends room that chronicles the first set of automobiles ever made from 1886 through 1900.

Benz Patent Motor Car – the first automobile (1885 – 1886)

Benz Patent Motor Car – the first automobile (1885 – 1886)

Karl Benz developed the first stationary gasoline engine – a one-cylinder two-stroke unit – and ran that for the first time on New Year's Eve 1879 records Daimler history. In 1885 he completed his dream project of creating a lightweight two-seater car powered by a compact high-speed single-cylinder four-stroke gasoline engine that produced 0.75 hp of power. The engine was installed horizontally at the rear of the vehicle which was built on a tubular steel frame with differential and three wire-spoked wheels.

The vehicle also included an automatic intake slide a controlled exhaust valve high-voltage electrical vibrator ignition with spark plug and water/thermo siphon evaporation cooling. Interestingly this vehicle had no steering. The patent Benz received for his 'vehicle powered by a gas engine' under patent number 37435 may be regarded as the birth certificate of the automobile notes the company.

Daimler Single-Cylinder Engine the Grandfather Clock

Daimler's Grandfather Clock was the world's first small high-speed internal combustion engine to run on gasoline. It weighed 92 kg only yet was powerful enough to drive a vehicle. The patent for this engine was filed in 1885. The unit shown here is a more powerful version from 1886 with a displacement of 462 cc and peak power of about 1.08 hp. The epithet 'Grandfather Clock' was given because of the way the engine looked.

Benz Victoria

Built in 1893 the Benz Victoria was Karl Benz's first four-wheeled automobile. It was a fundamentally new design made possible by the kingpin steering system improved by Benz. The new design permitted the two front wheels to assume different cornering radii and therefore the vehicle to negotiate bends more safely. This single-cylinder 1726 cc engine produced about 2.96 hp at 450 rpm and could attain a top speed of 18 km/h.

Daimler Vis-à-Vis Belt-Driven Car

The Daimler Riemenwagen built in 1896 was the first Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft model to be mass produced with about 150 of them being made. This featured a two-cylinder 1060 cc engine that produced 4.5 hp at 740 rpm. The Vis-à-Vis car featured three important inventions – the Phoenix engine the spray nozzle carburettor and belt-drive.

10/40 hp Mercedes Sport-Zweisitzer (Two-Seater)

10/40 hp Mercedes Sport-Zweisitzer (Two-Seater)

World War I had put an end to manufacturing of cars at the Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft. In 1923 new passenger cars – the 10/40 hp Mercedes and the 6/25 hp sister models were made. These were the world's first standard-production passenger cars with supercharged engines. The supercharger still called 'blower' in 1923 supplied the small displacement engine with more air thereby temporarily boosting output from 40 hp to 65 hp. These cars featuring a four-cylinder engine achieved top speed of 110 km/h.

Mercedes-Simplex 40 PS

The 40 hp Mercedes-Simplex is the oldest existing Mercedes today. It was the direct successor of the 35 hp Mercedes designed by Wilhelm Maybach considered to be the first automobile of the modern age. The 'Simplex' name is related to the relative ease with which it handled for the period. This four-cylinder 6785 cc car was built in 1902. The engine peaked at about 1100 rpm and achieved a top speed of 80 km/h.

Mercedes-Benz 500 K Spezial-Roadster

Mercedes-Benz 500 K Spezial-Roadster

In 1936 the company made the 500 K for the rich and beautiful. Together with the representative Grand Mercedes the elegant 500 K sports car was the brand's showpiece in the 1930s. The 500 K got eight different bodywork versions but the special roadster version show here was the most appealing. It was powered by an eight-cylinder 5018 cc engine that delivered approximately 100 hp (160 hp with a supercharger). Top speed was rated at 160 km/h. This car was considered the most elegant looking vehicle of that time and at a price of about € 98000 it was also the most expensive! In total Mercedes-Benz produced 342 units of this car across all versions.

Mercedes-Benz 260 D Pullman-Limousine

This was the world's first diesel-engined passenger car from large scale production. This was an economical car at that point as it consumed less fuel. The four-cylinder engine with a displacement of 2545 cc peaked at about 45 hp. In the Pullman sedan version the 260 D was the ideal taxi and also in great demand as a sedan for long distance travel. This vehicle was in production for a period between 1936 and 1940. A total of 1967 units were made.

Mercedes-Benz 300

Mercedes-Benz 300

The 300 was the fastest and biggest German-built production car in 1951. It followed the tradition of the Grand Mercedes and quickly became the most important status car of the young federal republic. The 2996 cc engine with four cylinders achieved a top speed of 160 km/h and the peak power was rated at 113 hp @ 4600 rpm. The four-door 300 models produced between 1951 and 1954 were often referred to as Adenauers after Konrad Adenauer the first Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Coupé

Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Coupé

Presented in 1954 this 300 SL production sports car was based on the successful completion version of 1952. Its space frame weighed just 50 kg but was particularly sturdy. However the structure didn't permit fitment of normal doors because of the high frame side members. With its characteristic upward-opening doors this dream car of the 1950s popularly became known as the Gullwing. The company produced 1400 units of the car between 1954 and 1957. A top speed of 250 km/h 212 hp of peak output at 5800 rpm were some of the other core characteristics of the car.

The three-box design brought in a radical change in 1950s

There was a radical change in the appearance and construction of Mercedes-Benz cars in the 1950s. The three-box design with a self-supporting body space frame and flat radiator grill were some of the hallmark features of this transition into a new era. Other changes in form and design included the cab-over-engine and short-nose designs.

Mercedes-Benz O 303 Reise-Omnibus

Mercedes-Benz introduced a series of buses in 1974 setting a new standard in comfort and safety in touring coaches. This model the O 303 Colonia Reisen featured a V8 engine that displaced 12763 cc and peaked at about 252 hp. Beginning in 1980 rollover tests were performed with these buses which eventually led to the development of rigid body skeletons for buses and coaches. This model also led the way in active safety. In 1981 it became the first bus in the world to be fitted with an ABS. This series of buses continued to be produced till 1992 with the company making 25778 units in total.

Mercedes-Benz 190 E

Mercedes-Benz 190 E

In 1982 Mercedes-Benz extended its medium-sized car range with the introduction of a third car series – the 190 and 190 E. It soon came to be known as the Baby Benz. Owing to low wind resistance and low weight the Baby Benz consumed comparatively less fuel. Despite its compact dimensions it was just as safe and comfortable as the larger Mercedes cars. This model from 1984 could achieve a top speed of 195 km/h powered by a four-cylinder 1997 cc 120 hp engine. The company produced 638180 units of these cars between 1982 and 1993.

Mercedes-Benz 500 SL

The gallery that houses vehicles used by celebrities and world figures offers a fascinating sight. This Mercedes-Benz 500 SL was acquired by Princess Diana the wife of the Prince of Wales in December 1991. She thus became the first member of the royal British family to drive a foreign car privately. However this didn't go down well with the government trade unions and industry in Great Britain as a result of which she had to return the vehicle in September 1992.

Mercedes-Benz 230 G Popemobile

Mercedes-Benz 230 G Popemobile

The Mercedes-Benz Museum notes that the 230 G Popemobile is perhaps the most famous Mercedes product belonging to a VIP. Built in 1980 to protect Pope John Paul II from wind and rain during his visit to Germany the bodywork of this vehicle was furnished with bulletproof glazing following an assassination bid on him in May 1981. The custom-built unit was based on the Mercedes-Benz cross-country vehicle. Only two such units were ever built.

Mercedes-Benz 600 Pullman Staatslimousine

In 1963 Mercedes-Benz presented a new prestige car – the 600. This fully armoured state limousine with a raised roof was built in 1965 as a unique specimen for the company's own car fleet. For over 30 years this vehicle carried Kings Chancellors and Presidents on state visits to Germany. The company made only two of these limousines. Also on display is a Mercedes-Benz ML 320 [W163] featured in the movie 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park'.

Mercedes-Benz C 111

Mercedes-Benz C 111 (in Yellow)

At the Frankfurt International Motor Show (IAA) in September 1969 Mercedes-Benz presented the C 111 – the 'test lab on wheels' – with its wedge-shaped body and upward-opening gullwing doors. The body consisted of fibre-glass reinforced plastic and was riveted and bonded to the steel frame-floor unit. It was also a test bed for the Wankel engine which was a three-rotor unit developing 280 hp and one that achieved a top speed of 260 km/h – a remarkable feat for its time (1969). In 1970 a thoroughly revised version of the C 111 was shown at the Geneva Motor Show featuring a four-rotor Wankel engine with an output of 350 hp. The car accelerated from standstill to 100 km/h in 4.8 s and attained a top speed of 300 km/h. The record-breaking C 111-IV of 1979 came with further aerodynamic refinements featuring distinctive spoilers a changed front end and two tail fins. Its propulsion unit was a series-production 4.5 l V8 engine enlarged to displace 4.8 l and to develop 500 hp. This version of the C 111-IV was no longer purely a research vehicle but one that achieved top-class sporting performance. As such it provided many insights that benefited series production.

Dieselmotor

This 3 l diesel engine fitted with an exhaust gas turbocharger achieved an output of 115 hp. It was with this engine that in the same year the Mercedes-Benz 300 SD (W116 series) became the first series production passenger car to feature a turbocharged diesel engine.

Mercedes-Benz 2 5 l Rennwagen W 196 R

Mercedes-Benz 2 5 l Rennwagen W 196 R

For the 1954 and 1955 Formula 1 seasons Mercedes-Benz lined up two versions of the W 196 R. while the streamlined variant was selected for the high speed circuits of Reims Berlin and Monza the classic monoposto with open wheels got the vote for majority of the races as it was better suited for twistier tracks. These cars had V8 engines that displaces 2497 cc and produced about 286 hp at 8500 rpm and clocked top speed of 275 km/h.

Mercedes-Benz B-Class Fuel Cell

Mercedes-Benz B-Class Fuel Cell

In 2010 Mercedes-Benz introduced the first series-produced electric car with fuel cell drive. The B-Class F-CELL as the car was called features an electric motor with a new-generation fuel cell drive that is compact efficient safe and fully suitable for everyday use claims the company. The fuel cell generates the traction current on board producing no pollutant emissions but merely pure water. The car has a range of 400 km achieves a top speed of 106 km/h and has a combined output of 136 hp.

Mercedes-Benz's racing legacy

One of the floors had the whole range of Mercedes-Benz racing cars displayed on a circular banked platform where sound is designed to mimic a race track. Simulations pods have also been installed in the area for visitors to get a feel of these racing machines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphZ3Jhbmpvc2guY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3N1cmF0LW11bmljaXBhbC1jb3Jwb3JhdGlvbi1yZWNydWl0bWVudC0yMDIxLW5vdGlmaWNhdGlvbi1kb3dubG9hZC0xNjE4NDA4MjY0LTHSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5qYWdyYW5qb3NoLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9hbXAvc3VyYXQtbXVuaWNpcGFsLWNvcnBvcmF0aW9uLXJlY3J1aXRtZW50LTIwMjEtbm90aWZpY2F0aW9uLWRvd25sb2FkLTE2MTg0MDgyNjQtMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Surat Municipal Corporation Recruitment 2021 for 1376 MO Staff Nurse SR and Other Posts|Apply Online,"Surat Municipal Corporation Recruitment 2021: Online Application are ongoing at the official website of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) for various posts including Medical Officer Staff Nurse Senior Resident Ward Boy Radiographic Technician & Ayah.

Ford-class these ten carriers will still strike fear into potential U.S. adversaries for many years to come.

At 1092 feet the Nimitz-class supercarriers are more than three times the length of a football field and with a crew of 3200 sailors and 2480 airmen these are essentially floating cities. The lead ship of the class USS Nimitz – nicknamed ""Old Salt"" – was commissioned in May 1975 was named after Admiral Chester Nimitz who led the U.S. Navy through the Second World War.

The ship was first deployed to the Indian Ocean during the Iran Hostage Crisis and has since logged untold miles providing security at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games and later service in the Persian Gulf after Operation Desert Storm. Most recently USS Nimitz was deployed against ISIS in Iraq and Syria where her F/A-18s took part in the Battle of Afar in 2017.

A total of 10 Nimitz-class carriers have been built and the last of the class USS George H.W. Bush was commissioned in January 2009. These nuclear-powered carriers which have two reactors and four shafts for propulsion with a top speed of 30+ knots (34.5mph) were the largest warships in the world until the USS Gerald R. Ford the lead ship of her class of carriers entered service in 2017. Each of the Nimitz-class has an expected 50-year service life with one mid-life refueling. These warships which have a displacement of 102000 tons were all built by Huntington Ingalls Industries Newport News Shipbuilding (now Northrop Grumman Ship Systems) based in Virginia at a unit cost of approximately $8.5 billion (constant year FY 12 dollars).

Each carrier has approximately 60 aircraft onboard and this includes a variety of fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft with up to 90 of various types. Typical aircraft on a Nimitz-class carrier include 12 F/A-18E/F Hornets 36 F/A-18 Hornets four E-2C Hawkeyes and four EA-6B Prowlers fixed-wing and helicopters including four SH-60F and two HH-60H Seahawks. In addition the carriers could also deploy the S-3B Viking before these were phased out and replaced the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. The flight deck which measures 1092 feet by 252 feet is equipped with four lifts four steam-driven catapults and four arrester wires. The carriers are capable of launching one air every 20 seconds.

The air wings of the carriers are customized according to the nature of operations with the usual air wings replaced with 50 army helicopters on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower for its operations in Haiti in 1994. Similar considerations can be made when a carrier is used for disaster response and humanitarian assistance.

In addition to the aircraft the mostly recently built Nimitz-class carriers are now armed with three Raytheon GMLS mk29 eight-cell launchers for NATO Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missiles which has semi-radar terminal guidance. There are also four Raytheon/General Dynamics 20mm Phalanx six-barreled Mk15 close-in weapons systems that have a 3000rpm rate of fire.

While the last of the Nimitz-class carriers has been commissioned and the class will eventually be replaced by the Gerald R. Ford-class these ten carriers will still strike fear into potential U.S. adversaries for many years to come.

In his current role as the chief communication officer for IBM he is in charge of the corporate giant’s Global Communications and Corporate Citizenship organization in addition to overseeing internal and external communications content creation social media and more. His team operates in more than 170 countries but Adashek has plenty of international experience: Before joining IBM he lived and worked in Yokohama Japan as the Chief Communications Officer at Nissan and in Paris France as the Alliance Global Vice President Communications for Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi. He’s also worked with Microsoft and Edelman Public Relations. Before his jump to the private sector Adashek spent time in Washington D.C. in various roles at the White House and Treasury Department and also worked on presidential candidate John Kerry’s campaign.

In March he Zoomed in to meet with several students in the College of Letters & Science for an “AMA” or an “Ask Me Anything” session. Here are his responses.

Q: How many languages do you speak?

A: I speak one. I speak English. I learned some basics whenever I moved places or would travel places for extended periods of time. But I only speak English but I can still get in a taxi in Japan and get anywhere I need to go.

Q: Given your current position what was the most helpful thing that got you to where you are?

A: If I were to be honest about it I was a terrible student. I’m going to be the wrong person to talk to about classes. The only thing I would say is to do a lot better than I did.

I tried to stay singularly focused on what I wanted to do and that’s been very helpful. … Don’t run from something. Run to something. Run to an opportunity that you think you are going to love and is right for you.

When I was at Microsoft and knew it was time to look for something new I said “I want to be the chief communications officer at a big multinational (company).” Nissan was an amazing opportunity. It was staying singularly focused on being the chief communications officer for a Fortune 500 that got me there.

Q: What keeps you up at night?

A: There’s one thing that keeps up at night and that’s people. People is the thing I love most about my job and people is the thing I worry most about in my job. You can have the best idea in the world but if you don’t have people to carry out those plans you can’t do anything. You won’t get anywhere. I want to make sure that I have the right people doing the right things.

Q: How do you start networking?

A: The tools on networking – like LinkedIn – make it much easier than when I was trying to network. I would say what are you interested in? Find a few people who would be interesting to talk to whether you know them or not. Make some cold calls.

When I was younger I read the paper and it says “In May East Timor will celebrate their independence.” … I did a quick search online and found the name of an organization tied to East Timor. I found a number I made a cold call and less than a month later I was in New York City meeting the foreign minister of East Timor who won the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize and he said “Would you be willing to come to East Timor to help us secure our independence as UN rolls out?”

It was a cold call! But it turned into something. So talk to your friends or your professors but when you’re done say “Can you give me names of two or three other people?” Ask them to help build that network.

Q: How do you select your team members?

A: I’m not going to hire somebody because I’m being a nice guy. … I want to know what benefit I’m going to get out of it. Why are we going to get better with you on the team? Everybody has value they can add.

I look for people who have a propensity to learn – people who are going to dig in roll up their sleeves learn about the business and get to a place where they’re going to be really smart on it.

I don’t have a communications degree as you all know. I’m a big proponent of diversity. I look at diversity of lived experiences as well because that helps provide value that you can bring to the table.

Q: You started at IBM in January 2020. You’re coming into a new CEO who would be coming in in April. COVID happens. It’s a contentious political season. How did you balance so much change at one time?

A: When I was at Microsoft we had an event called the Microsoft CEO Summit. We would get the Who’s Who in business. … I was talking to somebody and the topic of work/life balance came up. They said that they don’t believe in work/life balance; it’s work/life harmony. There will be ebbs and flows between work and your personal life. Taking that approach has really helped in the last year. Now the person I was talking to happened to be (Amazon CEO) Jeff Bezos!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNpdGl6ZW4uY28udHovdGFuemFuaWEvbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC90cmFkZXJzLWhvcGUtZm9yLWxvd2VyLWNvc3RzLWFmdGVyLW5ldy1kZWFsLTI1NDg3MjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Traders hope for lower costs after new deal,"Holili/Taveta. Regional traders shuttling between Kenya and Tanzania through the Holili/Taveta border have every reason to smile as they will now spend less than 15 minutes to clear their goods following the recent launch of a one-stop border post (OSBP).

Time taken to cross the border will be reduced by about 30 per cent according to Prof Theo Lyimo who is the director of Inter-border Management (IBM) at Trade Mark East Africa which is providing funding for the construction of the facility. The firm is also supporting lead agencies to implement the project on time and ensure quality.

A one-stop border post means all services will now be provided under one roof that houses customs officials from the two countries.

Improved physical border infrastructure will also offer an alternative transportation route to northern Tanzania and reduce time taken to ferry goods to and from Mombasa hence contribute to reducing trade costs in East Africa.

“There will be a 30 per cent reduction of time spent at the border according to a survey that we conducted to see the real impact of these Centres” said Prof Lymo.

He said traders were spending alot of time at borders with many of them complaining that it is very hard to conduct business in the region.

The launch of the centre which is the first to be operational marks an important milestone in facilitating trade across the borders of the two countries.",,,,,,,,,

Cindy McCain’s calendar for the coming weeks signals her significance at center stage. On April 27 Penguin Random House publishes Stronger: Courage Hope & Humor in My Life With John McCain an autobiography sure to instantly hit bestseller lists everywhere. And then on May 11 she will keynote the Woman’s Board of Rush University Medical Center’s first virtual spring luncheon benefit with participants registered from across the country for what has been known for nearly three decades as a signature of the season.

Recognized for her clarity compassion courage and her lifelong dedication to improving lives around the world Cindy McCain is keeping a promise made to the Woman’s Board in the depths of COVID last April when planners realized they had to postpone the 2020 spring luncheon where she was a highlight of the day’s program. “What a message Cindy McCain has for all at this pandemic time” Rush Woman’s Board Chair Cindy Mancillas shares. “Her new book highlights all the ways she has gained strength through the ups and downs of a life well lived.” McCain will share these secrets to her own inner strength at the upcoming virtual program.

The Board is working with the Rush Medical Center’s technology department to enhance all of Zoom’s features to make sure guests feel as though they are right there together while sharing their screens from all over the world. And as a fun bonus all guests will receive hand-delivered gift bags filled with surprises including (at a certain level) a copy of McCain’s book.

And going virtual has its benefits: “Put on a pretty top if you’d like but keep your fuzzy slippers on too! We are having guests register from all around the country people connecting from their vacation spots as well as friends here who have been hesitant in the past to take off work for a longer lunch hour. Kelly Lynch from our Woman’s Board office has done a great job coordinating with Rush’s excellent tech staff” says Mancillas.

Since the luncheon’s beginnings the Board has brought forth vibrant voices with powerful messages to sold-out audiences every spring. From the first luncheon featuring fashion editor Grace Mirabella to speakers throughout the years including Madeleine Albright Doris Kearns Goodwin Laura Bush Sherry Lansing Nora Ephron and other enlivening legends the Rush Spring Luncheon bursts forth each year as the event to inspire.

This year in addition to McCain’s much-anticipated appearance Megan Mawicke a Rush Woman’s Board member who worked for more than 20 years as sports reporter for CBS 2 Chicago will also join in on the fun handling the program’s Q & A portion.

The much-anticipated spring social event where guests get to pull out cheerful floral prints and pastel suits from the backs of their closets after a long winter and connect with friends returning from warmer climes always has a profound underlying purpose. Next month’s luncheon will underscore Rush’s determination to study and pilot new models of care delivery for cancer patients. On average cancer patients have to wait almost a month for first treatments to begin and then struggle to navigate the complexity of care. This project aims to reduce patients’ time to first treatment and create value and reduce costs. The Board aims to raise $500000 towards this goal.

Their dedication to this principal project The Woman’s Board Fund for Precision Oncology Research convinced luncheon chairs Brooke Kuehnle and Katie Frekko to extend their chairmanship for an extra year when the 2020 luncheon was postponed. “It is called Precision because the research is directed to finding a cancer treatment that is tailor-made for each patient. The technology the researchers are developing with be a big game changer” says Kuehnle. “This is also a time to celebrate all that Rush has done during the pandemic for some of the patients sickest with COVID who were transferred there and for the community surrounding our hospital.”

Frekko adds “We are determined to create the perfect experience for all cancer patients which they so deserve: coordinated cost-effective and highly compassionate. These should be extra special services that let people know how much the center cares about them. There has been cancer in my family and learning how effective and precise this research program will be is amazing.”

Funds raised by the 2021 Spring Luncheon will be directed to Rush Medical Center’s education research and community service programs as well as to the Precision Oncology Research project. “We are so grateful to our donors sponsors and to the Women’s Board which has adapted to all the pandemic changes” Mancillas explains citing friends and partners Hindman Auctions the Segal Family Foundation Carlette McMullan William Blair 2×2 Health Clover’s Garden The Book Stall Illinois Tool Works and Graystone Consulting. In honor of the event and its important cause The Book Stall in Winnetka is offering ten percent off all purchases of Stronger made at their store to customers who mention the luncheon or the Woman’s Board.

Stronger: Courage Hope & Humor in My Life With John McCain will focus on the author’s much-beloved husband their nearly 40-year partnership and the “trials and triumphs of a singular American life” per publisher Penguin Random House.

Of the late United States Senator and heavily decorated Vietnam veteran she has said: “My husband John McCain never viewed himself as larger than life—but he was. He had more tenacity and resolve than anybody I ever met. Being with him didn’t hold me back—it gave me flight a courage I never would have felt on my own.”

As the chair of the Board of Trustees of the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University she oversees the organization’s focus on advancing character-driven global leadership based on security economic opportunity freedom and human dignity. McCain also chairs the Institute’s Human Trafficking Advisory Council working to end human trafficking and supporting victims in Arizona the United States and around the world. Through her work with the McCain Institute several partnerships have been formed with anti-trafficking organizations working on solving various aspects of the problem. McCain also serves as co-chair of the Arizona Governor’s Council on human trafficking and on the Board of Directors of Project C.U.R.E the advisory boards of Too Small To Fail and Warriors and Quiet Waters. The mother of four chairs her family’s business Hensley Beverage Company one of the largest Anheuser-Busch distributors in the nation.

Author philanthropist and businesswoman McCain continues in the tradition of the Woman’s Board Spring luncheon presenting leaders with something riveting to say.

The Intel Core i5-11600K vs AMD Ryzen 5 5600X rivalry is a heated battle for supremacy right in the heart of the mid-range CPU market. AMD's Ryzen 5000 processors took the lead in the desktop PC from Intel's competing Comet Lake processors last year upsetting our Best CPU for gaming recommendations and our CPU Benchmarks hierarchy. Intel's response comes in the form of its Rocket Lake processors which dial up the power to extreme levels and bring the new Cypress Cove architecture to the company's 14nm process as Intel looks to upset AMD's powerful Zen 3-powered Ryzen 5000 chips.

Intel has pushed its 14nm silicon to the limits as it attempts to unseat the AMD competition and that has paid off in the mid-range where Intel's six-core Core i5-11600K weighs in with surprisingly good performance given its $232 to $262 price point.

Intel's aggressive pricing and the fact that the potent Ryzen 5 5600X remains perpetually out of stock and price-gouged has shifted the conversation entirely. For Intel all it has to do is serve up solid pricing have competitive performance and make sure it has enough chips at retail to snatch away the win.



We put the Core i5-11600K up against the Ryzen 5 5600X in a six-round faceoff to see which chip takes the crown in our gaming and application benchmarks along with other key criteria like power consumption and pricing. Let's see how the chips stack up.

Features and Specifications of AMD Ryzen 5 5600X vs Intel Core i5-11600K

Swipe to scroll horizontally Rocket Lake Core i5-11600K vs AMD Zen 3 Ryzen 5 5600X Specifications and Pricing Header Cell - Column 0 Suggested Price Cores / Threads Base (GHz) Peak Boost (Dual/All Core) TDP iGPU L3 AMD Ryzen 5 5600X $299 (and much higher) 6 / 12 3.7 4.6 65W None 32MB (1x32) Intel Core i5-11600K (KF) $262 (K) - $237 (KF) 6 / 12 3.9 4.6 / 4.9 (TB2) 125W UHD Graphics 750 Xe 32EU 12MB

The 7nm Ryzen 5 5600X set a new bar for the mid-range with six Zen 3 cores and twelve threads that operate at a 3.7-GHz base and 4.6-GHz boost frequency. Despite AMD's decision to hike gen-on-gen pricing the 5600X delivered class-leading performance at its launch not to mention a solid price-to-performance ratio. Things have changed since then though due to overwhelming demand coupled with pandemic-spurred supply chain disruptions both of which have combined to make finding the Ryzen 5 5600X a rarity at retail let alone at the suggested $299 pricing.



Intel's Core i5-11600K also comes with six cores and twelve threads but Team Blue's chips come with the new Cypress Cove architecture paired with the aging 14nm process. Intel has tuned this chip for performance; it weighs in with a 3.9-GHz base 4.9-GHz Turbo Boost 2.0 and 4.6-GHz all-core clock rates. All of these things come at the expense of power consumption and heat generation.



Intel specs the 14nm 11600K at a 125W TDP rating but that jumps to 182W under heavy loads while AMD's denser and more efficient 7nm process grants the 5600X a much-friendlier 65W TDP rating that coincides with a peak of 88W. We'll dive deeper into power consumption a bit later but this is important because the Core i5-11600K comes without a cooler. You'll need a capable cooler preferably a 280mm liquid AIO or equivalent air cooler to unlock the best of the 11600K.



Meanwhile the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X comes with a bundled cooler that is sufficient for most users though you would definitely need to upgrade to a better cooler if you plan on overclocking. Additionally a more robust cooler will unlock slightly higher performance in heavy work like rendering or encoding. Still you'd need to do that type of work quite regularly to see a worthwhile benefit so most users will be fine with the bundled cooler.



Both the Core i5-11600K and Ryzen 5 5600X support PCIe 4.0 though it is noteworthy that Intel's chipset doesn't support the speedier interface. Instead devices connected to Intel's chipset operate at PCIe 3.0 speeds. That means you'll only have support for one PCIe 4.0 m.2 SSD port on your motherboard whereas AMD's chipset is fully enabled for PCIe 4.0 giving you more options for a plethora of faster devices.



Both chips also support two channels of DDR4-3200 memory but Intel's new Gear memory feature takes a bit of the shine off Intel's memory support. At stock settings the 11600K supports DDR4-2933 in Gear 1 mode which provides the best latency and performance for most tasks like gaming. You'll have to operate the chip in Gear 2 mode for warrantied DDR4-3200 support but that results in performance penalties in some latency-sensitive apps like gaming which you can read about here.



For some users the 11600K does have a big insurmountable advantage over the Ryzen 5 5600X: The chip comes with the new UHD Graphics 750 comes armed with 32 EUs based on the Xe graphics engine while all Ryzen 5000 processors come without integrated graphics. That means Intel wins by default if you don't plan on using a discrete GPU.



Notably you could also buy Intel's i5-11600KF which comes with a disabled graphics engine for $25 less. At $237 the 11600KF looks incredibly tempting which we'll get to a bit later.



Winner: AMD



The Ryzen 5 5600X and the Core i5-11600K are close with six cores and twelve threads (and each of those cores has comparable performance) but the 5600X gets the nod here due to its bundled cooler and native support for DDR4-3200 memory. Meanwhile the Core i5-11600K comes without a cooler and you'll have to operate the memory in sub-optimal Gear 2 mode to access DDR4-3200 speeds at least if you want to stay within the warranty.

The Core i5-11600K comes with integrated graphics so it wins by default if you don't plan on using a discrete GPU. Conversely you can sacrifice the graphics for a lower price point. AMD has no high-end chips that come with integrated graphics though that will change by the end of the year when the Ryzen 5000 Cezanne APUs arrive.

Gaming Performance on AMD Ryzen 5 5600X vs Core i9-11600K

The Ryzen 5 and Core i5 families tend to be the most popular gaming chips and given the big architectural advances we've seen with both the Zen 3 and Cypress Cove architectures these mid-range processors can push fast GPUs along quite nicely.



That said as per usual we're testing with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 to reduce GPU-imposed bottlenecks as much as possible and differences between test subjects will shrink with lesser cards which you'll see most often with this class of chip or higher resolutions. Below you can see the geometric mean of our gaming tests at 1080p and 1440p with each resolution split into its own chart. PBO indicates an overclocked Ryzen configuration. You can find our test system details here.

At stock settings at 1080p the Core i5-11600K notches an impressive boost over its predecessor the 10600K but the Ryzen 5 5600X is 7.8% faster over the full span of our test suite. Overclocking the 11600K brings it up to snuff with the stock Ryzen 5 5600X but the overclocked 5600X configuration is still 3.6% faster.



As you would expect those deltas will shrink tremendously with lesser graphics cards or with higher resolutions. At 1440p the stock 5600X is 3.3% faster than the 11600K and the two tie after overclocking.



Flipping through the individual games shows that the leader can change quite dramatically with different titles responding better to either Intel or AMD. Our geometric mean of the entire test suite helps smooth that out to one digestible number but bear in mind – the faster chip will vary based on the game you play.



Notably the 11600K is 14% less expensive than the 5600X and that's if (a huge if) you can find the 5600X at recommended pricing. You could also opt for the graphics-less 11600KF model and pay 26% less than the 5600X again if you can find the 5600X at recommended pricing.



Winner: AMD



Overall the Ryzen 5 5600X is the faster gaming chip throughout our test suite but be aware that performance will vary based on the title you play. This class of chips is often paired with lesser graphics cards and most serious gamers play at higher resolutions. In both of those situations you could be hard-pressed to notice the difference between the processors. However it's rational to expect that the Ryzen 5 5600X will leave a bit more gas in the tank for future GPU upgrades.

Pricing is the wild card though and the Core i5-11600K wins that category easily — even if you could find the Ryzen 5 5600X at suggested pricing. We'll dive into that in the pricing section.

Application Performance of Intel Core i5-11600K vs Ryzen 5 5600X

We can boil down productivity application performance into two broad categories: single- and multi-threaded. The first slide in the above album has a geometric mean of performance in several of our single-threaded tests but as with all cumulative measurements use this as a general guide and be aware that performance will vary based on workload.

The Core i5-11600K takes the lead at both stock and overclocked settings by 3.8% and 1% respectively. These are rather slim deltas but it's clear that the Rocket Lake chip holds the edge in lightly threaded work particularly in our browser tests which are a good indicator of general snappiness in a standard desktop PC operating system. We also see a bruising performance advantage in the single-threaded AVX-512-enabled y-cruncher.



The Core i5-11600K is impressive in single-threaded work but the Ryzen 5 5600X isn't far behind. It's too bad that the 11600K's lead in these types of tests doesn't equate to leading performance in gaming which has historically been the case with processors that excel at single-threaded tasks.

Here we take a closer look at performance in heavily-threaded applications which has long been the stomping grounds of AMD's core-heavy Ryzen processors. Surprisingly in our cumulative measurement the Core i5-11600K is actually 2.5% faster than the 5600X at stock settings and is 1.8% faster after we overclocked both chips.

These are again slim deltas and the difference between the chips will vary based on workload. However the Core i5-11600K is very competitive in threaded work against the 5600X which is an accomplishment in its own right. The substantially lower pricing is even more impressive.



Winner: Intel



Based on our cumulative measurement Intel's Core i5-11600K comes out on top in both single- and multi-threaded workloads but by slim margins in both categories of workloads and that can vary based on the application. However given that the Core i5-11600K has significantly lower pricing and pulls out a few hard-earned wins on the application front this category of the Core i5-11600K vs Ryzen 5 5600X competition goes to Intel.

Overclocking of Ryzen 5 5600X vs Core i5-11600K

We have reached the land of diminishing returns for overclocking the highest-end chips from both AMD and Intel largely because both companies are engaged in a heated dogfight for performance superiority. As a result much of the overclocking frequency headroom is rolled into standard stock performance leaving little room for tuners making memory and fabric overclocking all the more important. There's still plenty of advantages with overclocking the midrange models though in today's Ryzen 5 5600X vs Core i5-11600K battle but be aware that your mileage may vary.



Intel benefits from higher attainable clock rates especially if you focus on overclocking a few cores instead of the standard all-core overclock and exposes a wealth of tunable parameters with its Rocket Lake chips. That includes separate AVX offsets for all three flavors of AVX and the ability to set voltage guardbands. Intel also added an option to completely disable AVX though that feature is primarily geared for professional overclockers. Rocket also supports per-core frequency and hyper-threading control (enable/disable) to help eke out more overclocking headroom.



The Core i5-11600K supports real-time memory frequency adjustments though motherboard support will vary. For example this feature allows you to shift from DDR4-2933 to DDR4-3200 from within Windows 10 without rebooting (or any other attainable memory frequency). Intel also supports live memory timing adjustments from within the operating system.



Intel has long locked overclocking to its pricey K-series models while AMD freely allows overclocking with all SKUs on almost any platform. However we see signs of some improvement here from Intel as it has now enabled memory overclocking on its B560 and H570 chipsets across the board. That said Intel's new paradigm of Gear 1 and Gear 2 modes does reduce the value of memory overclocking which you can read more about in our review.



AMD's Ryzen 5000 chips come with innovative boost technology that largely consumes most of the available frequency headroom so there is precious little room for bleeding-edge all-core overclocks. In fact all-core overclocking with AMD's chips is lackluster; you're often better off using its auto-overclocking Precision Boost Overdrive 2 (PBO2) feature that boosts multi-threaded performance. AMD also has plenty of Curve Optimization features that leverage undervolting to increase boost activity.



Much of the benefit of the Ryzen 500 series0 comes from its improved fabric overclocking which then allows you to tune in higher memory overclocks. We hit a 1900-MHz fabric on our chip allowing us to run the memory in a 1:1 mode at a higher DDR4-3800 memory speed than we could pull off with the 11600K with the same 1:1 ratio. It also isn't uncommon to see enthusiasts hit DDR4-4000 in 1:1 mode with Ryzen 5000 processors. There's no doubt that Intel's new Gear 1 and 2 memory setup isn't that refined — you can adjust the 5600X's fabric ratio to expand the 1:1 window to higher frequencies while Intel does not have a comparable adjustable parameter.

Winner: Tie

Both the Ryzen 5 5600X and the Core i5-11600K have a bit more overclocking headroom than their higher-end counterparts meaning that there is still some room for gains in the mid-range. Both platforms have their respective overclocking advantages and a suite of both auto-overclocking and software utilities meaning this contest will often boil down to personal preference.

Power Consumption Efficiency and Cooling of Intel Core i5-11600K vs AMD Ryzen 5 5600X

Image 1 of 12 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The Core i5-11600K comes with the same 125W TDP rating as its predecessor but that rating is a rough approximation of power consumption during long-duration workloads. To improve performance in shorter-term workloads Intel increased the PL2 rating (boost) to 251W a whopping 69W increase over the previous-gen 10600K that also came with six cores.



Power consumption and heat go hand in hand so you'll have to accommodate that power consumption with a robust cooler. We didn't have any issues with the Core i5-11600K and a 280mm liquid cooler (you could get away with less) but we did log up to 176W of power consumption at stock settings during our Handbrake benchmark.



In contrast the Ryzen 5 5600X sips power reaching a maximum of 76W at stock settings during a Blender benchmark. In fact a quick look at the renders-per-day charts reveals that AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X is in another league in terms of power efficiency — you get far more performance per watt consumed which results in lower power consumption and heat generation.



The 5600X's refined power consumption comes via TSMC's 7nm process while Intel's 14nm process has obviously reached the end of the road in terms of absolute performance and efficiency.



Winner: AMD



AMD wins this round easily with lower power consumption higher efficiency and less thermal output. Intel has turned the power up to the extreme to stay competitive with AMD's 7nm Ryzen 5000 chips and as a result the Core i5-11600K pulls more power and generates more heat than the Ryzen 5 5600X. Additionally the Core i5-11600K doesn't come with a bundled cooler so you'll need to budget in a capable model to unlock the best the chip has to offer while the Ryzen 5 5600X comes with a bundled cooler that is good enough for the majority of users.

Pricing and Value of AMD Ryzen 5 5600X vs Intel Core i5-11600K

AMD was already riding the pricing line with the Ryzen 5 5600X's suggested $299 price tag but supply of this chip is volatile as of the time of writing to put it lightly leading to price gouging. This high pricing comes as a byproduct of a combination of unprecedented demand and pandemic-spurred supply chain issues but it certainly destroys the value proposition of the Ryzen 5 5600X at least for now.

The Ryzen 5 5600X currently retails for $370 at Microcenter which is usually the most price-friendly vendor a $69 markup over suggested pricing. The 5600X is also $450 from Amazon (not a third-party seller). Be aware that the pricing and availability of these chips can change drastically in very short periods of time and they go in and out of stock frequently reducing the accuracy of many price tracking tools.

In contrast the Core i5-11600K can be found for $264 at Amazon and $260 at Microcenter which is surprisingly close to the $262 suggested tray pricing. Additionally you could opt for the graphics-less Core i5-11600KF if you don't need a discrete GPU. That chip is a bit harder to find than the widely-available 11600K but we did find it for $240 at Adorama (near suggested pricing).



Here's the breakdown (naturally this will vary):

Swipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 Suggested Price Current (volatile for 5600X) Price Per Core Core i5-11600K $262 $262 to $264 ~$32.75 Ryzen 5 5600X $299 $370 to $450 ~$46.25 to $56.25 Core i5-11600KF $237 $240 (spotty availability) ~$29.65

The Core i5-11600K doesn't come with a cooler so you'll have to budget that into your purchasing decision.



Winner: Intel



Even at recommended pricing for both chips Intel's aggressive pricing makes the Core i5-11600K a tempting proposition but the company wins this stage of the battle convincingly based on one almost insurmountable advantage: You can actually find the chip readily available at retail for very close to its suggested tray pricing. With much cheaper pricing both on a per-core and absolute basis the Core i5-11600K is the better buy and if you're looking for an even lower cost of entry the Core i5-11600KF is plenty attractive if you don't need integrated graphics.

AMD's premium pricing for the Ryzen 5 5600X was a bit of a disappointment for AMD fans at launch but the chip did offer enough advantages to justify the price tag. However the arrival of the Core i5-11600K with its disruptive pricing and good-enough performance would probably merit a slight pricing adjustment from AMD or the release of a non-X model if these were normal times. These aren't normal times though and instead of being able to improve its value proposition AMD faces crippling supply challenges.

Here's the tale of the tape: AMD wins this Ryzen 5 5600X vs Intel Core i5-11600K battle with a tie in one category and a win in three others marking a four to three victory in favor of Team Red. Overall the Ryzen 5 5600X offers up a superior blend of gaming performance power consumption and efficiency and a bundled cooler to help offset the higher suggested retail pricing remaining our go-to chip recommendation for the mid-range. That is if you can find it at or near suggested pricing.



Unfortunately in these times of almost unimaginably bad chip shortages the chip that you can actually buy or even find anywhere even near recommended pricing is going to win the war at the checkout lane. For now Intel appears to be winning the supply battle though that could change in the coming months. As a result the six-core twelve-thread Core i5-11600K lands with a friendly $262 price point making it much more competitive with AMD's $300 Ryzen 5 5600X that currently sells far over suggested pricing due to shortages.



The Core i5-11600K has a very competitive price-to-performance ratio compared to the Ryzen 5 5600X in a broad swath of games and applications. The 11600K serves up quite a bit of performance for a ~$262 chip and the graphics-less 11600KF is an absolute steal if you can find it near the $237 tray pricing. If you don't need an integrated GPU the KF model is your chip.

Even if we compare the chips at AMD's and Intel's standard pricing the Core i5-11600K is a potent challenger with a solid value proposition due to its incredibly aggressive pricing. While the Core i5-11600K might not claim absolute supremacy its mixture of price and performance makes it a solid buy if you're willing to overlook the higher power consumption.



Most gamers would be hard-pressed to notice the difference when you pair these chips with lesser GPUs or play at higher resolutions though the Ryzen 5 5600X will potentially leave you with more gas in the tank for future GPU upgrades. The Ryzen 5 5600X is the absolute winner though provided you can find it anywhere close to the suggested retail price.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpdGd1cnUubmV0L2NvbXBvbmVudHMvY3B1L2pvYW8tc2lsdmEvbGVha2VkLWludGVsLXJvYWRtYXAtcG9pbnRzLXRvLW5ldy1hbGRlci1sYWtlLXMtY3B1cy1jb21pbmctcTMtMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leaked Intel roadmap points to new Alder Lake-S CPUs coming Q3 2021,"A newly leaked Intel roadmap has given us a hint at what to expect from Intel in the coming months. As it turns out Intel Alder Lake-S could be landing a bit sooner than anticipated with this roadmap showing plans for a Q3 2021 release.

The roadmap leaked by @9550pro refers to Intel workstation products. Divided into “Expert WS” “Mainstream WS” and “Entry WS” the roadmap hints at a release of the Alder Lake workstation platform in Q3 2021. The platform seems to feature the Intel W680 chipset 125W (K processors) 65W and 35W processors with up to 16 cores 20 PCIe lanes and the LGA1700 socket.

The roadmap further informs us of an 8+8 SKU which is set to enter production starting on the 35th week of 2021. A 6+0 SKU is also confirmed due to enter production on the 41st week of 2021.

It's worth noting the roadmap might not be updated to Intel's current plans. As seen by the image Intel Rocket Lake-S shows up with a release in 2020 but these processors only just arrived at the end of March.

It all starts with the pre-binned Core i5-11600K offering 4.8GHz all-core boost for $250 while 4.9GHz costs you $260 and then 5GHz costs $340. Next up we have the higher-end and flagship Rocket Lake-S chip with Intel's new Core i9-11900K at 4.9GHz offered by Silicon Lottery for $620 5GHz costs you $700 while 5.1GHz bumps up to $880.

Silicon Lottery is only offering the 6-core Intel Core i5-11600K and 8-core Core i9-11900K with no factory pre-binned Core i7-11700K on offer at all.

You will have to be careful with temperatures and power consumption on such a heavily overclocked Core i9-11900K processor with MSI showing that on an overclocked Core i9-11900K the temperatures get pretty crazy. At stock 4.7GHz and a DIY water cooling solution the Core i9-11900K runs at 73C -- but at 4.9GHz that goes up to 84C.

But when you push past 5GHz on Intel's flagship Core i9-11900K -- even on a liquid cooling setup -- we're looking at 92C for 5GHz 102C for 5.1GHz and an insane 113C for 5.2GHz. You will want to ENSURE that you have great cooling -- I would recommend a decent 360mm AIO cooler at the very least if you were to purchase a pre-binned Intel Core i9-11900K chip at 5.2GHz.

It's not just cooling but also power -- at stock 4.7GHz the 11900K can consume 220W or so -- but at 5.2GHz we're looking at an additional 150W of power for a total of 380W or so.

However Amazon Italy has revealed albeit briefly that ASUS has a Tiger Lake-H45 and RTX 30 refresh planned. It looks like ASUS has re-used the chassis from the current model which includes a 17.3-inch display and yellow-accented keyboard.

The Core i7-10870H has made way for the Core i7-11800H though which Intel is yet to announce. While the listing does not reveal any details about said processor its description confirms that ASUS has paired it with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU with 6 GB of VRAM. Additionally the F17 FX706 will be available with at least 16 GB of DDR4 RAM and 1 TB of PCIe storage. The model number to look out for is FX706HM-HX062T although this may be a European variant rather than a global one.

These components will power a 17.3-inch display that outputs at up to 144 Hz. sRGB colour space coverage may come in at under 65% though which would make the new F17 unsuitable for content creators unless you have a more colour accurate external monitor. According to Amazon Italy ASUS intends to price the F17 FX706HM-HX062T at €1799 including VAT. We imagine that the company will release cheaper variants too such as Core i5 models or Core i7 ones with less RAM and storage.

No OS

The OS section can be a big deal. Sometimes the units are advertised as supporting Windows 10 but one gets a Windows 10 Home license. If you want to or may want to run Windows 10 Pro knowing exactly which OS is on the device is ultra important. Having Ubuntu Linux installed from the factory is nice since we know many of our readers will use these with Linux. We also had our system running Proxmox VE as a Linux virtualization node but that is not an officially supported OS. Ubuntu installed without issue. One also usually needs to make BIOS tweaks in order to run Linux on Lenovo machines since they are optimized for Windows but we did not with our test unit.

Note: These systems sometimes change specs mid-generation. If you find another spec sheet with items you think we should add please let us know in the comments.

Next we are going to look at the performance and power consumption before getting to our final words.

Lenovo ThinkCentre M90q Tiny Performance and Power Consumption

Instead of going through the entire Linux-Bench test suite we are going to show a few performance and power numbers here to give a general sense of performance. We actually planned to do storage testing but then we realized that there was a huge variability in terms of what drives could be found in machines.

Python Linux 4.4.2 Kernel Compile Benchmark

This is one of the most requested benchmarks for STH over the past few years. The task was simple we have a standard configuration file the Linux 4.4.2 kernel from kernel.org and make the standard auto-generated configuration utilizing every thread in the system. We are expressing results in terms of compiles per hour to make the results easier to read:

Overall the Intel Core i9-10900T performs very well. Our tests are designed to let full heat soak to set in due to the fact we test a lot of servers. There we do see some impacts of running 10 cores/ 20 threads in only 35W TDP. We will discuss power later but that is a major story with this CPU. Still we ordered this SKU because it was the biggest available and Lenovo had good coupons which made it more reasonable. As a quick note here we are testing with 2x 32GB DIMMs not the single 4GB DIMM because we wanted to test on a similar configuration to the rest of the high-performance units we have tested to date.

7-zip Compression Performance

7-zip is a widely used compression/ decompression program that works cross-platform. We started using the program during our early days with Windows testing. It is now part of Linux-Bench.

This is a great example of where the higher-core count CPU can really perform well. We see some nice performance gains over other generations and over the Ryzen 7 4750GE.

OpenSSL Performance

OpenSSL is widely used to secure communications between servers. This is an important protocol in many server stacks. We first look at our sign tests:

Here are the verify results:

The two ways to look at the 35W TDP Intel Core i9-10900T system are that when the CPU is not overly constrained by that TDP limit it performs better than the AMD parts. If it is constrained it is closer to what AMD offers in 8-cores. At this end of the spectrum the TDP is a major limiting factor.

Next we are going to take a look at power consumption before getting to our key lessons learned and final words."

Most Massachusetts citizens and long-distance runners call the third Monday of April as Marathon Monday. Interestingly another event that takes place on this day is the celebration of 'Patriot's Day' in the USA. It is not a Sunshine State holiday however Maine and Wisconsin are the only two states where the holiday is legally observed (although they still celebrate it on April 19). Since it's a holiday at some places people often question that whether the stock market remains open or closed on this day? Read on to know the details.

Is stock market open on Patriot's day in USA?

The stock market on Patriot's Day remains open in the USA. The market holiday is referred to as any non-weekend day when the New York Stock Exchange Nasdaq or bond markets close for the day. Usually that holiday is something like Christmas or New Year's. Regular hours for the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq go from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. ET from Monday to Friday. The markets are closed over the weekends.

Patriot's Day celebration

The Battles of Lexington and Concord held on April 19 1775 marked the beginning of the colonists' war for independence from Great Britain. Just two months after Parliament proclaimed Massachusetts in revolt the colony's courageous citizens took up arms and fought for freedom ultimately leading to the formation of the United States of America. Governor Frederic T. Greenhalge of Massachusetts wanted to replace Fast Day (a then-rarely observed day of fasting and prayer that had been around since the 17th century) in the state calendar without declaring it a workday in 1894. Greenhalge was inspired by the state's valiant fight for independence from British control and renamed the holiday Patriots' Day and moved it to April 19.

The Boston Marathon was introduced to the celebration of Patriots' Day in 1897. It is influenced by the restoration of the marathon race at the preceding year's summer Olympic games in Athens. It became a much-loved April 19 tradition almost as much as the holiday itself. The Boston Red Sox have also joined in on Patriots' Day by hosting a game at Fenway Park at 11:05 am enabling fans to see the race finish. To make a three-day weekend the entire celebration was moved to the third Monday in April in 1969.",,,,,,,,,

Strategic divestitures and cost management reflect a proactive approach to market challenges.

Legal and regulatory hurdles pose potential risks to IFF's operational stability.

Investment in R&D and productivity gains signal a commitment to innovation and efficiency.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) a global leader in specialty ingredients production has recently disclosed its financial performance for the first quarter of 2024. Despite a slight decrease in net sales from $3.027 billion to $2.899 billion the company has shown an impressive increase in gross profit from $964 million to $1.024 billion indicating effective cost management and operational efficiency. As we delve into a SWOT analysis of IFF we'll explore the company's internal dynamics and external market conditions that could influence its strategic decisions and future growth.

Beyond the Balance Sheet: What SWOT Reveals About International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF)

Strengths

Robust Gross Profit Margin Improvement: IFF's ability to increase its gross profit margin from 31.8% to 35.3% amidst a sales decline is a testament to its strong operational management. This improvement suggests that IFF has effectively controlled its cost of goods sold which decreased significantly by $188 million and has optimized its manufacturing processes to enhance profitability.

Strategic Divestitures and Portfolio Optimization: The company's strategic decision to divest certain business units such as the Savory Solutions and Flavor Specialty Ingredients (FSI) businesses reflects a focused approach to streamline operations and concentrate on core growth areas. These divestitures while impacting sales have allowed IFF to reallocate resources and reduce associated costs positioning it for more targeted growth.

Investment in Research and Development: IFF's commitment to innovation is evident in its increased R&D expenses which rose to $166 million. This investment is crucial for the company to maintain its competitive edge by developing new and improved products thereby ensuring long-term sustainability in a rapidly evolving industry.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Global Economic Conditions: IFF's performance is closely tied to global economic trends as seen in the impact of unfavorable exchange rates on its sales. The company's reliance on international markets exposes it to currency fluctuations and economic volatility which can affect its financial results.

Increased Selling and Administrative Expenses: The rise in S&A expenses to $490 million primarily due to higher legal fees and professional consulting costs indicates potential inefficiencies and increased overheads. These expenses if not carefully managed could erode the company's profitability over time.

Story continues

Legal and Regulatory Challenges: IFF faces ongoing legal proceedings and regulatory investigations such as the antitrust investigations into its fragrance businesses. These issues not only incur additional costs but also pose reputational risks and could lead to significant financial penalties.

Opportunities

Productivity Gains and Favorable Net Pricing: IFF has demonstrated the ability to achieve productivity gains and secure favorable net pricing as reflected in the increased Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA for its Nourish and Scent segments. These achievements provide an opportunity for IFF to further enhance its operational efficiency and pricing strategies to boost profitability.

Focus on Health & Biosciences: The Health & Biosciences segment showed a sales increase indicating strong market demand for biotechnology-derived products. IFF's position in this segment offers significant growth potential particularly in the areas of probiotics enzymes and specialty ingredients which are increasingly sought after in the health and wellness markets.

Emerging Markets Expansion: With sales to Israeli and Russian customers representing a small percentage of total sales there is an opportunity for IFF to expand its presence in emerging markets. By leveraging its global footprint and diverse product portfolio IFF can tap into new customer bases and drive sales growth.

Threats

Competitive Industry Landscape: IFF operates in a highly competitive industry where innovation and customer preferences rapidly evolve. The company must continuously adapt to maintain its market position against competitors who may offer more innovative or cost-effective solutions.

Regulatory and Compliance Risks: The complexity of operating in multiple jurisdictions brings about various regulatory challenges. IFF's involvement in legal disputes and the necessity to comply with diverse regulations can lead to increased compliance costs and potential disruptions to its business operations.

Global Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the potential impacts of the Israel-Hamas war could disrupt IFF's supply chains and affect its sales. The company must navigate these uncertainties while managing the risks associated with its international operations.

In conclusion International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) exhibits a strong financial foundation with improved gross profit margins and strategic portfolio management. However the company must address its increased S&A expenses and navigate legal and regulatory complexities. Opportunities for growth lie in its Health & Biosciences segment and potential expansion into emerging markets. Nevertheless IFF must remain vigilant against competitive pressures and global economic uncertainties that pose threats to its operational stability. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses IFF can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats positioning itself for continued success in the specialty ingredients industry.

Positive Points

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF Financial) achieved volume growth for the first time since Q1 2022 with mid-single digit growth in Q1 2024 driven by strong contributions from Scent Nourish and Health & Biosciences segments.

The company reported double-digit comparable adjusted EBITDA growth benefiting from both volume growth and productivity gains across its businesses.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF) successfully closed the divestiture of its cosmetics ingredients business and announced the sale of its Pharma Solutions business which is expected to complete in the first half of 2025 aiding in strengthening the capital structure and focusing on high-growth areas.

The company is trending toward the upper end of its previously announced guidance ranges for the full year 2024 reflecting increased confidence in its financial outlook.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF) introduced a refocused operating model which is business-led and supported by lean functions aimed at enhancing collaboration driving profitable growth and improving financial performance over time.

Negative Points

The CFO Glenn Richter announced his plan to retire at the end of 2024 initiating a succession plan that could lead to transitional challenges within the financial leadership of the company.

Despite positive volume growth the company noted that pricing was modestly positive and would have been negative without FX-related pricing benefits indicating underlying challenges in pricing power.

The company's Pharma Solutions segment experienced lower volumes due to ongoing destocking trends which could impact short-term performance until the completion of its divestiture.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF) reported a negative free cash flow of $19 million in Q1 2024 although it was an improvement from the previous year highlighting ongoing challenges in cash flow generation.

The company's net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 4.4x at quarter end indicating a relatively high leverage that the company aims to reduce to 3x following the Pharma Solutions transaction.

Experts address weaknesses and inconsistencies in the U.S. regulation of looted cultural artifacts.

Font Size: A A A

After the U.S. invasion of Iraq looters stole thousands of Iraqi artifacts which may now be purchased online for relatively low prices. Although the United States has returned many of these artifacts thousands have slipped through the cracks. Service members have allegedly brought home stolen artifacts as war trophies without repercussion. One museum in Washington D.C. has a history of purchasing looted Iraqi artifacts. Despite a $3 million fine the museum is struggling to identify all of the stolen artifacts to be returned.

A patchwork of laws and international agreements currently governs the transport and sale of illegally obtained cultural artifacts in the United States. The National Stolen Property Act (NSPA) makes it illegal to transport stolen artifacts across state lines but only covers items worth more than $5000.

The NSPA also does not apply to museum collections that were illegally or unethically obtained in the past. For example the Penn Museum holds a collection of skulls acquired in the 19th century that includes the crania of individuals who were enslaved in Cuba and the United States. Facing pressure from the public the museum recently moved the skulls to storage and announced that it would try to repatriate or bury the skulls but U.S. law does not require these actions.

Native American artifacts on the other hand receive additional protection under U.S. law. The Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) makes it illegal to damage or remove without authorization artifacts from federal and Native American lands. ARPA also prohibits the buying selling exchanging or transporting of items obtained illegally under the act. The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) meanwhile facilitates the repatriation of Native American artifacts held by museums or agencies that receive federal funding. Yet looters have stolen thousands of Native American artifacts including human remains likely from burial grounds. Repatriation of these items is a slow and difficult process.

In this week’s Saturday Seminar experts weigh in on how U.S. policymakers can strengthen the legal regime that governs stolen cultural artifacts to deter looting and reduce the illegal trade."

As of September 6 2019 the company operated approximately 1490 retail stores in the United States Canada the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland primarily under the Journeys Journeys Kidz Schuh Schuh Kids Little Burgundy and Johnston & Murphy names.

Activist Commentary: Legion is an activist investor whose partners are Chris Kiper previously of Shamrock Activist Value Fund and Ted White previously of European activist fund Knight Vinke. Legion prefers to do their activist work behind the scenes with resorting to a proxy fight if amicable discussions do not go well. They have significant experience with consumer retail companies.

Legion sent a letter to the company nominating a slate of the following seven director candidates for election to the company's eight-person board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: (i) Marjorie L. Bowen a private investor and former board member at Genesco with a 20-year career in investment banking at Houlihan Lokey; (ii) Thomas M. Kibarian a freelance advisor to private equity firms that invest in mid-cap retail and consumer wholesale businesses and former CEO at Garden Ridge (n/k/a At Home Group Inc. (HOME)) a home décor retailer; (iii) Margenett Moore-Roberts chief inclusion & diversity officer at IPG DXTRA a global collective of marketing services and agency brands and a division of The Interpublic Group of Companies Inc. (IPG); (iv) Dawn H. Robertson CEO of On Campus Marketing LLC a premier ecommerce website for college students and their families; (v) Patricia M. Ross former executive advisor at Apple Inc. (AAPL); (vi) Georgina L. Russell former portfolio manager at Willett Advisors LLC an investment management company and (vii) Hobart P. Sichel former CMO and EVP of Burlington Stores Inc. (BURL) a national off-price department store retailer.

Legion previously filed a 13D on the company on January 16 2018 and their thesis was that the company should monetize certain business segments and return capital to shareholders. On April 25 2018 Legion and the company entered into a cooperation agreement pursuant to which the company added two new directors: Marjorie L. Bowen and Joshua E. Schechter to the Board. On December 14 2018 the company announced the sale of Lids Sports Group and that they would be increasing its share repurchases. On August 31 2018 Legion sold below 5% and by March 31 2019 was out of the investment completely. As a result Bowen and Schechter were not re-nominated for election at the 2019 annual meeting.

Legion makes some very good points about enhancing shareholder value such as de-conglomerizing and cutting overhead. Between selling Schuh Johnston & Murphy and potential associated real estate the company could make as much as $270 million. Even before sales the company has a healthy balance sheet so proceeds from these sales could be used to buy back shares and continue to decrease the float. This would leave Journeys as the core business which could continue to grow and generate significant cash flow. Legion believes that if its plan is followed the company could have EPS of $7.50 by 2023 and double the stock price of today. However these are the same or similar plans Legion had for the company in 2018 most of which did not get implemented after Legion's underwhelming activist campaign where it settled for two non-Legion directors for one year while it sold down its position.

This time Legion is nominating seven individuals to the board out of eight possible seats. They stated that they are not looking to replace Mimi Vaughn as a director or as CEO and that Legion intends to vote for her and their nominees are prepared to partner with her in order to implement a strategic plan for Genesco. This is very refreshing but if they have so much confidence in her as CEO why not give her a little more time to implement a plan – she was just named CEO in July of 2020. Moreover if you have confidence in the CEO and believe you can work with her why would you need seven of eight directors on the board?

The company might be underperforming its peers and the market and there might have been mistakes made by management. Legion's plan just may remedy much of that but there is nothing that this board or management team has done that justifies replacing a majority of the board. While Legion's plan is once again strong there is no reason to think that they have any more commitment to this campaign than they did in 2018. For one thing just like last time they are not nominating a Legion principal to the board. While activists do not always include one of their people on board slates it is rare that one is not included in a seven-person slate. Including a Legion nominee would signal a long-term commitment and this is even more important after their 2018 campaign where they started selling four months after getting non-Legion directors on the board.

Legion is a thoughtful experienced investor with a good plan that the company should strongly consider. However implementing that plan should not take more than two or three new directors particularly if one of them was a Legion principal who would be around to see it through.

It is not unheard of for activists to target a company multiple times but generally that does not work out well for them. In a study we conducted in 2019 we looked at 14 such situations and in the first campaign the activist averaged a 46.5% return versus a 6.3% return for the S&P 500. The second time around – the activist averaged just 16.8% versus 28.6% for the S&P 500.

To get to the root cause of failures that could be in upstream data pipelines we had to first get visibility into end-to-end lineage. The enterprise scheduler gave us dependencies that users specified when scheduling their jobs. Interestingly 90% of analytical jobs were scheduled without any job dependencies. Due to this any upstream delays or failures did not prevent downstream jobs to run; these jobs went ahead anyway and caused operational issues metric inconsistencies and data holes.

We determined the need to build lineage tracking based on source code in Git for data processing and data movement frameworks running Hive Spark & MPP workloads. We use open source and custom SQL parsers to derive relationships between jobs scripts and input/output tables. Similar parsing is done for BI reports and homegrown data movement frameworks to find associated tables.

Using this metadata we “glue” the end to end lineage which includes three key entity types: jobs tables & reports (a.k.a. dashboards). Users can search for these entities and land on their lineage view.

Users can search for tables jobs or reports

Here is an example of table lineage for the job selected from the search page. Jobs are represented in ovals and tables are represented in rectangles. Color of the job represents whether the job has failed (red) completed successfully (green) or is active (light green).

Table lineage

Here is scheduler lineage for the same job based on user specified job dependencies in the enterprise scheduler.

Scheduler lineage

And here is an example of lineage for a report represented in a circle.

Report lineage

Dependency Recommendation

With table lineage based on source code and job lineage based on dependencies specified in the enterprise scheduler we have visibility into which tables feed into which jobs which tables are produced by which jobs and which jobs depend on which other jobs. This helped us build dependency recommendation as a feature in Superglue. Using this feature we are able to pinpoint job dependencies that are missing. It’s like saying — “This job depends on these two tables which are created from these two other jobs but you haven’t specified these two other jobs as dependencies. Please add them as dependencies in the scheduler.”

Lineage APIs

Along with backward lineage we also made forward lineage available. Forward lineage helps with use cases that need to assess the impact of source and schema changes to downstream pipelines and/or reports. Lineage APIs enabled engineering automation to detect the impact of such changes.

Lineage APIs and data quality frameworks also played a key role when we moved thousands of analytical pipelines tables and reports to the public cloud. Using forward lineage APIs we were able to detect which pipelines and reports could be tested when the raw source data was ready in the cloud. Similarly when we found metric issues in the cloud reports during migration we could use backward lineage APIs to identify sources of data issues in raw tables.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sales of cars and light trucks surged an incredible 58% in March compared to last year according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Some 1.6 million vehicles were driven off car lots during the month representing over 18 million on a seasonally-adjusted annual rate (SAAR).

There could be several reasons why car sales skyrocketed last month the most obvious being that pandemic restrictions are gradually being lifted. A fresh infusion of stimulus money also didn’t hurt.

But then there’s the matter of cost. Due to the global semiconductor chip shortage which has temporarily halted production at some North American auto plants the price of used vehicles is up an eye-watering 26% from last year according to the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index. Borrowing costs are also on the rise prompting consumers to act fast.

Last month I advised readers to buy a new car now if they were in the market for one and it looks as if many Americans were of the same mind. I expect prices to climb even more before they start to plateau.

Luxury Carmakers Set New Sales Records

Looking globally I was surprised to see just how well the luxury vehicle market performed in the first quarter. Daimler-owned Mercedes-Benz sold over 78000 cars and trucks during the period a 16% increase from last year. Toyota’s Lexus brand took the number two spot in terms of sales moving 74000 units for the quarter.

Tesla announced that it delivered a record 185000 vehicles in the three-month period well over double the amount in the first quarter of 2020. The electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer which reported its first profitable year in 2020 is the heaviest weighted stock in the benchmark S&P Global Luxury Index.

Rolls-Royce Motor Cars also reported a new sales record in its 116-year history. The superluxury British carmaker fully owned by Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) delivered 1380 vehicles up 62% from the same period in 2020 and exceeding the previous quarterly record set in 2019. Among its bestsellers were the Cullinan a nearly three-ton SUV that starts at $335000 and its new Ghost model which has a similar price tag.

PMIs at Highest Levels in Decades

All of this is positive economic news that tells me we’re more than ready to put the pandemic in the rearview mirror. For the first time since this all started a year ago mMore than one million people per day have been flying commercial in the U.S. for 30 straight days the longest streak since this started a year ago. Even more passengers are expected in the coming days and weeks as greater than one in five Americans are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Restaurants and diners across America are reportedly struggling to find workers fast enough to meet demand.

Indeed in a report last week LPL Financial wrote that we were entering the “best business conditions of the 21st century.” Both the ISM Manufacturing and Services PMIs hit their highest levels in decades on accelerating vaccine distribution and unprecedented fiscal stimulus.

The JPMorgan Global Composite PMI meanwhile rose to a 79-month high of 54.8 in March one of its best readings of the past decade. U.S. leads the expansion with growth not only at its fastest pace since August 2014 but also running close to an all-time U.S. survey high. Looking just at manufacturing of the 29 countries that are tracked only three—Myanmar Thailand and Malaysia—were below the 50.0 threshold.

This boom could run well into 2023 Jamie Dimon said last week. In his annual letter to shareholders the JPMorgan chief wrote that he sees the U.S. economy entering a “Goldilocks moment” buttressed by “excess savings new stimulus savings huge deficit spending more QE a new potential infrastructure bill a successful vaccine and euphoria around the end of the pandemic.” With the S&P 500 having returned an unbelievable 54% year-over-year at the end of March markets “may very well be pricing in not only a booming economy but also the technical factor that lots of the excess liquidity will find its way into stocks” Dimon said.

In other words the bulls are solidly in charge for the foreseeable future. I expect to see another quarter of stock outperformance relative to bonds though the debt selloff may not be as pronounced in this second quarter as it was in the first.

Gold Miner Debt Near Record Low

So where does that leave gold?

The yellow metal is off to its worst start in years having fallen more than 10% during the first quarter as investors largely shunned safe haven investments in favor of risk assets.

This has created an incredible buying opportunity that other savvy investors have jumped at. The U.S. Mint reported that sales of American Eagle gold coins climbed to 412000 ounces in the first three months of 2021 its best quarter since 1999. Australia’s Perth Mint also had a remarkable quarter with sales in February up 441% year-to-year.

At the end of last month I shared with you that gold producers had their most profitable year ever in 2020 based on the average all-in sustaining cost (AISC) margin. For every ounce of the metal produced last year miners pocketed a record $828 on average.

Now we know what they’ve been doing with their increased cash flow. According to a recent report by Metals Focus gold miners have been paying down their debt which currently stands at a collective $5.5 billion the lowest level since 2011 and near all-time lows. Two miners in Metals Focus’s peer group are now net cash positive the precious metals consultancy says.

Like physical gold stock in the producers looks like a buy to me. All of the companies in the peer group are paying regular dividends and with debt reduction near completion we could be seeing some mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the sector soon.

Isom Place one of Oxford’s oldest homes will soon be able to host weddings and other events.

During Monday’s meeting the Oxford Planning Commission approved a special exemption request to allow Isom Place to be used as an event venue.

The home had been owned by the University Foundation preventing it from community use but was sold to SRM Properties LLC according to Invitation Oxford Magazine publisher Rachel West. Invitation Oxford Magazine rents the second floor of Isom Place as their office from SRM Properties.

West submitted the request to the planning commission but said turning the Isom Place back into an event venue was not solely her idea.

“When the owners of SRM asked me some other ways the house could be used it seemed like a natural fit for the space to be used” West told the EAGLE. “The process of approval from the city began which was approved on Monday.’

Located at 1003 Jefferson Ave. north of the Oxford Square Isom Place is listed on the National Registry of Historic Places. The home was constructed by Thomas Dudley Isom a Lafayette County physician. The exact date the home was constructed is not known due to construction plans being lost over time but it is estimated that it was built nearly 200 years ago around the 1830s.

Invitation Oxford Magazine will still keep its office on the second floor while the first floor and outside areas will be the spaces used for events according to West.

In the planning commission staff’s approval of the request it states the proposal “Seems to be a great way to preserve this historic structure and make it accessible to the community as a venue.”

There are eight parking spaces located on the property which will be used by Invitation Magazine’s staff during the week and business hours but will be used by the clients who rent the home during their respective event. The home is diagonally across from the downtown parking garage and West said she secured a secondary parking lot at the Baker Building on North Lamar Boulevard.

As a senior at Detroit Douglas Brooks had a dominant year. He averaged 33.1 points and 9.3 rebounds per game. This performance allowed Brooks to edge out Iron Mountain’s Foster Wonders (verbally committed to Southern Illinois) Grand Rapids Christian’s Kobe Bufkin (University of Michigan) Orchard Lake St. Mary’s Julian Roper II (Northwestern) and River Rouge’s Legend Geeter (Providence) for the award.

Brooks is currently ranked as a top-70 recruit nationally by both 247Sports (No. 66) and Rivals (No. 68). He is part of a three-man class that ranks No. 8 in nationally which also includes top-25 shooting guard Max Christie and top-60 point guard Jaden Akins.

This trio of incoming freshmen wings and guards will all be expected to make an immediate impact on the Spartan roster in 2021-22 along with Northeastern transfer point guard Tyson Walker and possibly Keon Coleman who will be under scholarship for football but plans to also play basketball. The new additions will try to offset for the departures of Aaron Henry to the NBA Josh Langford to graduation and Rocket Watts to the transfer portal.

Pierre Brooks II becomes the 16th overall Mr. Basketball award winner to suit up for the Spartans over the 41 years in which the award has been in existence leading all other schools. The University of Michigan is in second place with a total of 11 awardees.

The Mr. Basketball Award was initiated in 1981 with Spartan great Sam Vincent claiming the first trophy. Then Michigan State coach Jud Heathcote would go on to sign three additional Mr. Basketball winners in Matt Steigenga (1988) Anthony “Pig” Miller (1990) and Jon Garavaglia (1993).

Since Coach Tom Izzo took over the program in 1996 he has signed a total of 12 Mr. basketball winners starting in 1999 with Jason Richardson. The other awards winners were Marcus Taylor (2000) Kelvin Torbert (2001) Paul Davis (2002) Drew Neitzel (2004) Derrick Nix (2009) Keith Appling (2010) Matt Costello (2012) Deyonta Davis (2015) Cassius Winston (2016) and Foster Loyer (2018) and now Brooks (2021).

Of those 12 award winners all but two (Appling and Deyonta Davis) played on a team that made the Final Four. Only time will tell if Brooks will be able to add to that legacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,

*GAAP revenue is comprised of services and support and processing revenues (see page 2). Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $843 for the current fiscal year quarter and $6143 for the prior fiscal year quarter results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 6.4% quarter over quarter. There were no non-GAAP adjustments to processing revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023. Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the nine months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $9861 for the current fiscal year-to-date period and $17042 for the prior fiscal year-to-date period and by $2 of revenue from acquisition in the current fiscal year-to-date period results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 7.2% period over period. Reducing processing revenue by revenue from acquisition for the nine months ended March 31 2024 which was $1943 results in non-GAAP adjusted processing revenue growth of 8.5% year-to-date period over year-to-date period. **The VEDIP program expense for the nine months ended March 31 2024 was related to a Company voluntary separation program offered to certain eligible employees beginning in July 2023. ***Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted operating income by non-GAAP adjusted revenue.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting in the United States. GAAP includes the standards conventions and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted segment income adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income margin non-GAAP earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (non-GAAP EBITDA) free cash flow return on invested capital (ROIC) and non-GAAP adjusted net income.

We believe non-GAAP financial measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals and true operations of our business. Adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income adjusted segment income margin adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses and adjusted net income eliminate one-time deconversion revenue and associated costs the effects of acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net all of which management believes are not indicative of the Company's operating performance. Such adjustments give investors further insight into our performance. Non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to the Company before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for net income before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization attributable to eliminated one-time deconversions acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less capitalized expenditures internal use software and capitalized software plus proceeds from the sale of assets. ROIC is defined as net income divided by average invested capital which is the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and stockholders' equity for a given period. Management believes that non-GAAP EBITDA is an important measure of the Company's overall operating performance and excludes certain costs and other transactions that management deems one time or non-operational in nature; free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions; and ROIC is a measure of the Company's allocation efficiency and effectiveness of its invested capital. For these reasons management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its assessment and management of the Company's performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable with calculations of similar measures for other companies.

Any non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to related GAAP measures are included.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

Disparities in cohort characteristics prevalence of stroke event and determinants of post-stroke limitation were compared between the two groups. Of the 42038 women under 60 identified form NHIS data 1.58% (n = 664) had been diagnosed with stroke compared to 7.44% (n = 1715) of the 23054 women over 60. While stroke is more common in older women the National Stroke Association strokes has reported a rise in stroke incidence among younger adults. Over the past decade the US has seen a 44% increase in the number of young adults hospitalized due to stroke. Age inclusive studies to date have been primarily mixed gender. This analysis however examines within gender differences comparing characteristics prevalence of stroke and determinants of post-stroke functional limitation between women above and below the age of 60.

Understanding risk factor profiles are critically important to understanding strategies to reduce stroke risk in women. For example a recent study showed that stroke risk factors are more strongly associated with risk of stroke in women compared to men regardless of the stroke subtype and with men having higher incidence than women [39].

These findings highlight the complexity of the relationship between stroke risk factors and stroke onset particularly among women in general women of different ages and women of different races. They also suggest more detailed analyses should be completed to examine variability among women as well as differences between men and women. More importantly comparison of these age cohorts indicates two distinctly different populations of women experiencing stroke. While older women had a higher prevalence of healthcare utilization including blood pressure checks cholesterol screening speaking with healthcare providers and taking prescription medications the young cohort was significantly more likely to visit the emergency or engage in an appointment with a physician. Younger women with stroke were more likely to be Black reside in the south and be married. However they were also more likely to smoke and slept significantly fewer hours per night than their older counterparts. These results compare with similar mixed gender and age inclusive assessment of stroke in women and minority populations [404142]. These findings also highlight previously reported age-related differences in disease prevention practices [43]. Magwood et al. [43] found that although many young stroke survivors exhibit comorbid disease conditions that are similar to older stroke survivors they are less like to follow-up with physicians than older stroke survivors.

Additional comparisons showed that older women had a significantly higher prevalence of those physical health conditions traditionally related to stroke—diabetes hypertension and high cholesterol—while the younger cohort reported substantially higher mental health concerns—frequently feeling depressed worthless or sad. These findings provide a sensible explanation for stroke in the older cohort—increased age coupled with confounding comorbidities and poor health results in stroke among women over 60. Magwood et al. [43] suggest that the higher rate of known risk conditions among young women and women of color could account for these observations. While the patterns of office and ER visits among women under 60 would suggest poor health status the lower proportion reporting physical health issues could suggest that these issues are present but remain undiagnosed likely due to lack of preventative health services or regular health screening. Interestingly while this comprises only one plausible explanation women in poor health have shown to be reluctant to utilize health services for a variety of reasons [44].

A second explanation may be related to a greater presence of vascular risk factors among older stroke women. The role of vascular risk factors has not been widely studied among young women stroke survivors. Cigarette smoking alcohol consumption and drug use were also associated higher stroke rates particularly among those with confounding chronic or cardiovascular conditions [32 45 46]. Age inclusive studies have shown higher rate of stroke among those who have less than high school education and live below poverty level. Numerous studies have shown a correlation between socio economic status (SES) and stroke/stroke mortality—results were robust to the SES indicator used [42 47]. While not widely studied in adults of any age being overweight or obese and having inadequate levels physical activity were also more common among individuals with stroke [48 49].

Young and old women exhibited different predictors of stroke or suspected lifestyle demographic or environmental characteristic highly correlated with the likelihood of experiencing a stroke According to Carandang et al. [50] risk factors are relevant if they are strong and dose-related predictive in a variety of samples pathogenically plausible and supported by other investigations. While relatively few investigations have focused on age specific heterogeneity in women factors shown to be highly correlated with stroke in this study largely align with those vascular and lifestyle characteristics cited elsewhere [51].

While relevant predictors of stroke were generally consistent in previous research this cohorts displayed largely different subsets of predictors. For example risk of stroke increased with the presence of hypertension diabetes high cholesterol and high BMI in older women by 19 23 53 and 3% respectively. For young women with stroke both marital status and sleep lower the risk of stroke by 27 and 10% respectively. In contrast while smoking and alcohol consumption increase the risk for stroke by two and 27%. The older cohort showed increased risk of stroke from primarily health related comorbidities while the younger cohort shows risk to be more closely related to lifestyle and behavioral characteristics. Overall demographic/lifestyle predictors of stroke were consistent with previous studies of men and women which have shown that blood pressure smoking physical activity and healthy diet reduce the risk of stroke [52 53]. In fact longitudinal assessment has demonstrated that modest changes in modifiable lifestyle risk factors can have a substantial effect on risk as all ages.

Black race also emerged as a primary correlate of stroke in younger women and has been previously reported as a risk factor in other studies. Evidence suggests significant racial disparities in stroke and stroke mortality among women with the highest disparities among women aged 50–< 60 [54]. Previous research has shown that hypertension coronary artery disease hyperlipidemia and diabetes more common in older Black compared to White adults [555657]. While the root causes of these disparities is not fully understood studies suggests a younger age of stroke onset among Black adults [585960] potentially because of a heavier burden of stroke risk factors among Black adults at younger ages as early as adolescence [61]. For example elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) may confer a greater risk of stroke among Black adults compared with White adults [62]. Importantly socioeconomic factors have demonstrated only a minimal role in explaining racial disparities in stroke compared with the contribution of traditional stroke risk factors [58 60]. Although higher socioeconomic status may attenuate racial disparities in stroke Jiménez et al. [54] suggests that the elevated stroke incidence among younger Black women and those without a family history of stroke could reflect persistent racial differences in the distribution of deleterious exposures at the individual neighborhood and institutional levels across the life course. Unequal access to material and social resources and psychological stress among Black women may result in accelerated cardiovascular aging. While cursory assessment of these disparities may suggest that they could be driven by income or other socioeconomic differences studies have shown that lower income does not increase risk of ischemic stroke [63]. We do note that previous that showed higher level of income was associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke the study focused only on individuals over age 65 indicating a reversal of the social gradient. Ultimately the results could be explained by selective survival yet no evidence of higher stroke risk among lower socioeconomic groups was found.

A second issue that should be considered in analyses of stroke relates to genetic contribution to stroke risk. To date studies including genetic disposition have been limited but family history is suggested to be a risk factor for ischemic stroke [64 65]. While strokes occurring in very old age tending to be less familial those occurring at younger ages are believed to be at least partially heritable [6667686970]. However evidence of heritability is not sufficient to assert it comprises the primary cause of stroke in younger adults. However alternative theories fail to explain the fact that nearly one fourth of strokes occur in people under the age of 65.

Finally measures of post-stroke function were completed to examine potential differences between older and younger women. Binary indicators for overall functional limitations stroke problems impeding activity and chronic conditions limiting behaviors used to assess limitations were highly related with physical health determinants in both cohorts. Hypertension diabetes and high BMI indicate lower levels of general health reduced functionality and limited activity. All three indicators show a negative relationship to age suggesting that limitations increase over time. Not surprisingly women taking prescription medication experiencing surgeries and visiting the emergency show an increased likelihood of limitations and obstructed activity suggesting higher levels of impairment and greater post-stroke limitations.

Limitations

Although interesting findings the study does have a number of imitations. First NHIS did not include respondent age at stroke. Without this information individuals were classified into age cohorts by their age at the time of the interview rather their age at the event. Therefore it is possible that older women who experienced a stroke below the age of 60 were misclassified. Second NHIS does not include an indicator for the totally number of stroke events the type of stroke suffered months post-stroke stroke severity or the receipt of post-stroke rehabilitative care. These factors were unavailable in the NHIS data but have the potential to confound estimations of functional limitations and other post-stroke outcomes. While data from 5 years of the NHIS data were pooled for this analysis NHIS is a cross sectional data set precluding longitudinal assessment of individuals over time as they recover from each stroke event. Third all women in the sample were insured; therefore results are not generalizable to an uninsured population which could have different outcome correlates. Fourth all NHIS data included functional status and stroke events are self-reported and therefore subject to recall and selectivity bias. Finally type quality and the relationship to the primary care has been shown to impact post-stroke outcomes disability status and quality of life. Unfortunately caregiver information and type are not included in the NHIS survey. Finally the NHIS is based on respondent interviews. Survey data is subject to recall telescoping and social desirability bias.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXN0aW4zNjAuY29tL3N0b3J5L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbXVzaWMvMjAyMS8wNC8xNy9jYXJyaWUtcm9kcmlndWV6LXRlYW1zLXVwLW90aGVyLWF1c3Rpbi1hY3RzLW5ldy12aWRlby1zZXJpZXMvNzI2MDE1MDAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carrie Rodriguez teams with fellow musicians in the great outdoors for new video series,"When we last saw Carrie Rodriguez she was onstage at the Long Center Lawn with her partner Luke Jacobs opening a show for Patty Griffin. The longtime Texas fiddler and singer-songwriter appears to be emerging from the pandemic with a lot going on — including a new video series that launches on Wednesday.

""From Texas With Love"" features Rodriguez presenting what she describes as ""a musical conversation in the wilds of Texas with some of our state’s most celebrated artists."" A short preview clip indicates the videos will feature duet performances set in quintessentially Central Texas outdoor settings.

Marjorie Taylor Greene met for a second day at the Capitol on Tuesday political adversaries trying to engineer an off-ramp from the escalating standoff over her threat for a vote to oust him from office.

The stakes are high for both.

Republican Johnson is hoping to avoid a politically fraught outcome in which he would keep his job but only after relying on Democrats who have pledged their support to save him at least this time.

Greene a top ally of Donald Trump faces her own potentially embarrassing setback if her motion to vacate the speaker fizzles as is expected.

“Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson’s court” said Greene R-Ga. “I am so done with words. For me it’s all about actions.”

In a brazen move Greene has forced her way to the negotiating table and outlined four demands — including no more funding for Ukraine as it fights Russia and an end to the Justice Department special counsel’s legal cases against the indicted former president Trump.

Throughout Johnson has tried to portray himself six months on the job since the ouster of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy as in control of the situation and not beholden to the hard-right forces that have created chaos throughout this session of Congress.

“Look they’ve been very productive discussions. that’s what I’ll say” Johnson R-La. said after Tuesday’s 90-minute meeting.

Johnson downplayed the idea that there was any deal to be made saying the meetings are simply part of his open-door policy to hear out the ideas of fellow Republican lawmakers as is his practice as the new leader.

“It’s not a negotiation” Johnson said.

But it’s clear whether or not Greene proceeds with her plan to call the vote this week — or lets the moment slip away — the threat of removal will trail the speaker’s tenure and force him to consider concessions to the far-right forces to keep members satisfied.

Greene said she had “high expectations” the speaker would deliver.

“This is what people all over the country are screaming for” Greene said Tuesday on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast. “They want to see this vote.”

Another hardline congressman Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has joined in the meetings and warned Johnson not to draw out a decision.

“If his plan is to drag this out so the pressure comes off of this and to drag it out for weeks or days even without making some movement in our direction then he would just be far better off to have this vote and get it behind him” Massie said.

The effort to oust Johnson has been panned by Trump who gave his nod of support to the speaker and it has failed to gain traction among Republicans leaving Greene almost alone with just a few colleagues on her side.

But the demands Greene is making are mostly popular among Republicans and could be difficult for Johnson to ignore. That gives both her and the speaker incentive to embrace a deal — particularly since Trump would almost certainly be supportive.

In a signal of what’s to come Johnson lashed out at the Justice Department’s two cases from special prosecutor Jack Smith against Trump — over mishandling classified documents as well as the effort to overturn the 2020 election in the runup to the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack.

Johnson echoing Greene’s claims of sham trials called the Justice Department cases against Trump “election interference” that “has to stop” as the former president is the party’s presumptive nominee in the 2024 race for the White House.

“President Trump has done nothing wrong here” said Johnson who led one of the defeated president’s legal efforts trying to overturn Biden’s 2020 election victory before the bloody Capitol siege.

Johnson said the House will consider the flow of federal funds to the Justice Department and oversight of the special prosecutor’s office. “Stay tuned” he said.

Greene is also demanding that Johnson abide by the Hastert rule named for another former Republican speaker that requires leaders to proceed with voting on bills only when they have support from the majority of their members.

Relying on the Hastert rule could have tanked congressional support for Ukraine since the recently approved $61 million foreign aid package did not have backing from most Republicans. It passed with Democratic support.

Greene also wants to insist on federal spending reductions championed by Massie which would require a 1% across-the-board cut if Congress fails to pass the regular appropriation bills by the Sept. 30 deadline for the end of the fiscal year. A similar deal was struck last year lending support to the idea.

Other Republicans even if they agree with some of the ideas being proposed are wary of Johnson making any deals with a select few.

“I don’t have a problem with him listening but what I will have a problem with and we had this problem with Speaker McCarthy is when you start making special special deals and hidden deals “said Rep. Kevin Hern R-Okla. “And then people not just conservatives but moderates and everybody else says where’s my deal?”

But ultra-conservative Rep. Tim Burchett R-Tenn. said Greene backing off the motion to vacate for now would be a “a wise move.” He said it signals “she’s going to play her best hand and that’s to get what you can get.”

The speaker is working to show he is in control of the House and not being led by Democrats who are in the minority but have outsized influence because they have provided the votes for much of the consequential issues this Congress.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries the Democratic leader has emerged as an empowered speaker-in-waiting if Democrats win party control in November. He and his leadership team have promised to vote to table Greene’s motion essentially saving Johnson’s job.

But Johnson insisted Tuesday he has no interest in relinquishing the gavel any time soon. Even though some Republicans have said he should step aside Johnson said he intends to continue leading the House Republicans well into next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vUG9saXRpY3Mvam9obnNvbi1ncmVlbmUtbWVldC1ncmVlbmUtdm93cy1mb3JjZS12b3RlLXdlZWsvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9MTA5OTU4MzQ40gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvUG9saXRpY3Mvam9obnNvbi1ncmVlbmUtbWVldC1ncmVlbmUtdm93cy1mb3JjZS12b3RlLXdlZWsvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9MTA5OTU4MzQ4?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marjorie Taylor Greene says she'll meet with Speaker Mike Johnson again Tuesday amid threat to oust him,"Johnson said he had ""a lengthy constructive meeting"" with Greene and Massie.

Marjorie Taylor Greene says she'll meet with Speaker Mike Johnson again Tuesday amid threat to oust him

House Speaker Mike Johnson and Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie met privately on Monday amid Greene's looming threat to try to oust him.

Emerging from a nearly two-hour meeting inside the speaker's office Greene said on camera they will have another meeting with Johnson on Tuesday afternoon.

""I just want to thank you all for waiting -- we just had a very long discussion with the speaker. We are going to be meeting again tomorrow based on the discussion that we've had. And so we really don't have any news to report at this time"" Greene said Monday.

When pressed by ABC's Rachel Scott if Greene still plans to move forward with a motion to vacate the congresswoman said: ""Again we had a very long discussion with Speaker Johnson. We will be meeting with him again tomorrow based on the discussion that we had and then I'll have more information for you.""

Asked again if she plans to force a vote on a motion to vacate Greene said: ""I have been patient. I have been diligent. I have been steady. And I have been focused on the facts. And none of that has changed.""

Greene said the meeting Monday afternoon was about ""ways to move forward for a Republican-controlled House of Representatives.""

Johnson said he had ""a lengthy constructive meeting"" with Greene and Massie Monday afternoon.

""We have discussed some ideas and we are going to meet again tomorrow"" Johnson said.

Johnson said he told Greene and Massie he understands their frustration saying ""I would really like to advance much more of our conservative policy on a daily basis here. But the reality is we are working with the smallest majority in U.S. history with a one-vote margin.""

""We are going to keep this team together and work for the American people"" Johnson added.

The meeting comes as Greene has said she will force a vote to remove Johnson from the leadership post this week.

The timing of when Greene plans to trigger the motion to vacate however remains unclear. The House held votes later Monday evening and Greene did not act on the motion to vacate.

The Georgia congresswoman said last week she was moving ahead with her ouster effort despite pushback from many Republicans and a statement from Democrats that they would step in to help save Johnson.

""Mike Johnson is not capable of that job"" Greene said in a fiery press conference outside the U.S. Capitol on May 1 alongside her co-sponsor Massie of Kentucky. ""He has proven that over and over again.""

Greene and Massie continued their criticisms of Johnson publicly on social media on Monday.

""This week we vote on whether Mike Johnson should remain as Speaker"" Massie said in a statement on X. ""If you're happy with what he's done this year and if you're looking forward to what he will do the remainder of the year you should join the Democrat leader Hakeem Jeffries in supporting Mike Johnson.""

Greene has dangled the motion to vacate the speaker's chair for more than a month. Johnson's defended himself from her criticism -- namely that he's worked with Democrats to keep the government open provide foreign aid and more -- by emphasizing that he's a lifelong Republican but must do his job to serve the entire House with an extremely thin Republican majority.

""This motion is wrong for the Republican Conference wrong for the institution and wrong for the country"" Johnson said last week of the ouster threat.

Johnson also received a boost over the weekend from former President Donald Trump who brought Johnson on stage at the Republican Nation Committee's spring retreat luncheon at Mar-a-Lago.

Trump praised Johnson ""for his leadership and work in the US House"" emphasizing ""the need for party unity collaboration and expanding the GOP's House Majority"" according to Trump's campaign.

Last week Greene denied she was defying Trump in pushing ahead against Johnson.

""I'm the biggest supporter of President Trump and that's why I fight every single day. And that's why I'm fighting here against my own Republican conference to fight harder against the Democrats"" she told ABC News Correspondent Elizabeth Schulze.

A return to the “Hastert Rule ” meaning no legislation is brought to a vote without support from a majority of the House majority;

” meaning no legislation is brought to a vote without support from a majority of the House majority; Defunding the special counsel probes into former President Donald Trump in upcoming appropriations; and

into former President Donald Trump in upcoming appropriations; and Enforcement of the “Massie Rule” whereby government funding is automatically cut across the board if no superseding agreement is reached before a set deadline.

They’ll meet again today at 12:30 p.m. in hopes of finding a detente. Spokespeople for Greene and Johnson declined to comment on their discussions but the speaker struck a conciliatory note after yesterday’s meeting sympathizing with Greene and pledging to “keep this team together.”

Make no mistake though the pressure for Republican party unity in an election year is weighing on Greene who is battling exasperated GOP colleagues and skepticism from the party’s unquestioned leader Trump.

Johnson could be in a position to grant at least some of Greene’s asks. Since this Congress has effectively finished passing controversial must-do items such as funding the government raising the debt ceiling and extending surveillance authorities Johnson can probably stick to the Hastert Rule (named for former now-disgraced speaker Dennis Hastert).

Democrats agreed to a version of the Massie Rule during last year’s spending talks with then-speaker Kevin McCarthy — so Johnson could probably go there as well.

On Ukraine Congress just sent Kyiv $60 billion in aid — enough to last through the year by most estimates though Greene might also want to strike an expected nine-figure aid authorization in the annual Pentagon policy bill that’s expected to move later this year.

But defunding special counsel Jack Smith’s Trump investigations could be much trickier. Front-line Republicans in the past have balked at such demands to say nothing of Democrats. If Greene is expecting Johnson to put up a fight on a much-anticipated September continuing resolution that would be a recipe for a federal shutdown just weeks before the election.

The two sides don’t have a deal yet — and might never get one — but it’s clear temperatures are dropping. A handshake solution after all is in the interest of both parties: It would spare Johnson a risky vote where he’d be relying on the generosity of Democrats to save his gavel.

And for Greene her relationship with Trump and his inner circle is on the line we’re told. The former president “could not have been clearer” one person close to him said last night in signaling that he isn’t interested in any more intraparty drama this election season.

Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. and Thomas Massie R-Ky. met with Johnson behind closed doors for roughly two hours late Monday afternoon after promising last week to force a House-wide vote on his removal. They declined to give details to reporters immediately after the sit-down but said they would have a follow-up discussion with Johnson on Tuesday.

However Fox News Digital was told they are broadly seeking four points – including no more funding for Ukraine nor special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into former President Trump.

They are also demanding that Johnson vow to block any legislation from getting a House-wide vote unless it has the support of a majority of the House GOP – a longstanding informal provision called the Hastert rule named after a former Republican speaker.

MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FILES MOTION TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON

On government funding the conservatives are also pushing Johnson to adhere to the Massie rule which would require automatic federal spending cuts if an agreement is not reached on fiscal year 2025 funding by the Sept. 30 deadline.

Fox News Digital reached out to Greene Massie and Johnson's offices for comment. A spokesman for Greene declined to discuss the contents of a private meeting.

Meanwhile Rep. Paul Gosar R-Ariz. the third GOP rebel who signed onto Greene's motion to vacate the chair – a resolution calling for a House-wide vote on removing the speaker – suggested to reporters on Monday evening that he wanted Johnson to have some more time to change course.

HOUSE DEMS SAY THEY’LL BLOCK MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FROM OUSTING SPEAKER JOHNSON

""I don't think it's going to happen this week. I hope it doesn't happen this week"" Gosar told reporters. ""I think it would be nice to see him go back to regular order get things coming from committees you get a majority of the majority to get something on the floor.""

Greene is leading the push to oust Johnson amid conservative frustrations over his bipartisan work on critical legislation related to government funding and foreign aid. She and Massie pledged to force the vote sometime this week.

To do so she would have to notice her resolution as ""privileged"" – meaning the House would have two legislative days to vote on the measure itself or first vote on scuttling it via a procedure known as ""tabling"" the resolution.

Democrats have pledged to block the ouster vote by voting to table the resolution whenever it comes up something that could save Johnson while also likely raising more conservative frustrations.

Johnson told reporters on Monday evening that his meeting with Massie and Greene was ""lengthy"" but ""constructive.""

""We have discussed some ideas and we're going to meet again tomorrow"" Johnson said. ""I just want to say and I told them and I've said this repeatedly that I understand the frustration. I share it. I would really like to advance much more of our conservative policy on a daily basis here. But the reality is we are working with the smallest majority in U.S. history with a one-vote margin."""

As a child I believed that every LEGO set I completed brought me one step closer to being an engineer. And as it turns out that’s not totally outlandish as Renault proved during the development of the transmission for its E-Tech hybrid system.

The system is available in the hybrid and PHEV 2020 Clio Captur and Megane models and Renault loves to mention how it’s inspired by Formula 1 technology. But in trying to work out how to make the system work in an economy car engineer Nicolas Fremau turned to the decidedly lower-tech world of LEGO.

“When I saw my son playing with LEGO Technic sprockets at home I said to myself ‘well it’s not so far from what I’d like to do’. So I bought what I needed piece by piece to have all the assembly elements” said Fremau.

The set model ended up taking Fremau about 20 hours to complete. That’s not just because he was building it without an instructional booklet but because he had to create his own pieces with glue and a drill.

But it turned out to be very useful. The set could easily be put together and taken apart and that allowed Fremau to think of new ideas that hadn’t occurred to him when he was designing on paper.

The result was a transmission that has no clutch and is connected to two electric motors as well as the engine. Renault says that with E-Tech 80% of city driving can be handled on electric power only despite the Clio Hybrid’s small 1.2 kWh battery. But in order to get it approved Fremau had to present his LEGO model to the higher-ups.

“Renault has always been a very open company especially when it comes to research” said Fremau. “But the day I brought the model to the Gérard Detourbet and Rémi Bastien I didn’t know how they would react. They walked around the model they touched it and they felt that we had a real object. And I will always remember Gérard Detourbet’s remark: ‘If we can make it in LEGO it will work!’”

From there it only took 18 months to get the principles developed by the LEGO model into a moving car. Now it’s on roads all over Europe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vZnVuZXJhbC1ob21lcy9vYml0dWFyaWVzL25hbWUvYm9ubmllLXNpZWdtYW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_cGlkPTE5ODQ4NDQyNiZ2PWJhdGVzdmlsbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bonnie Siegman Obituary - Milwaukee Wisconsin,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/funeral-homes/obituaries/name/bonnie-siegman-obituary?pid=198484426&v=batesville on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vZnVuZXJhbC1ob21lcy9vYml0dWFyaWVzL25hbWUvYm9ubmllLXNpZWdtYW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_cGlkPTE5ODQ4NDQyNiZ2PWJhdGVzdmlsbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWxvbmRvbmVjb25vbWljLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9qb2huc29ucy10b3AtYWlkZS1oYXMtc2hhcmVzLWluLWZpcm0taGFuZGVkLTFtLWluLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtY29udHJhY3RzLTI2NTMxMy_SAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVsb25kb25lY29ub21pYy5jb20vcG9saXRpY3Mvam9obnNvbnMtdG9wLWFpZGUtaGFzLXNoYXJlcy1pbi1maXJtLWhhbmRlZC0xbS1pbi1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LWNvbnRyYWN0cy0yNjUzMTMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Johnson’s top aide has shares in firm handed £1m in government contracts,"One of Boris Johnson’s most senior advisers owns shares in a company which has won close to £1 million in government and NHS contracts.

Tory peer Eddie Lister has more than £50000 worth of shares in Johnson Controls a US-based engineering firm; its UK arm has secured six public contracts since Lister joined Downing Street as the prime minister’s Chief Strategic Adviser.

Johnson Controls merged with Tyco where Lister had worked for more than a decade as ‘director of government relations’ – before Johnson brought him to City Hall as mayor and then to Downing Street.

A total of £998000 worth of contracts have gone to the company since Lister became the prime minister’s adviser the Mail on Sunday reported – the latest being awarded just this month.

The contracts include work for a Birmingham children’s NHS hospital the NHS-owned North of England Commercial Procurement and Collaborative HM Land Registry and South Tees Site Company Limited.

The biggest contract was £521000 for fire alarm systems handed to Johnson Controls in January 2020 through an arrangement with the Cabinet Office.

Meanwhile the prime minister has been warned that he risks losing his election gains against Labour if he does not clean up the “shameful” Westminster lobbying controversy a Tory grandee has warned.

Sir Bernard Jenkin chair of the Commons Liaison Committee – made up of senior MPs has urged the Johnson to get a grip on the lobbying system following a series of revelations in the wake of Greensill Capital’s collapse into administration.

A failure to be “more transparent” than previous administrations could risk the so-called “red wall” seats on which Johnson built his 2019 majority on Sir Bernard suggested.

A series of probes have been commissioned including by Downing Street as Westminster looks to understand the role former prime minister David Cameron played in securing Whitehall access for Greensill which was selected to delve out government coronavirus support loans at the start of the pandemic and whose collapse now risks thousands of jobs particularly in the steel sector.

The saga deepened last week after it emerged the former head of government procurement Bill Crothers took a part-time position with the failed firm while in his Whitehall post.

Writing in The Observer Sir Bernard said the “lines between public service and private gain” had become “blurred”.

The senior Tory described the current situation as “shameful” and “utterly corrosive of public trust in government”.

In an apparent dig at the former Remain-backing Cameron government he added: “This should matter to Boris Johnson.

“He does not need to pretend to be a saint but his ‘red wall’ voters who gave him his majority will start to dismiss him unless he can show he is more open more transparent and very different from the out-of-touch elite he defeated in the 2016 referendum and ousted from government.”

It may be time to shake things up and consider tying employees' health plan premiums to their pay.

Today at most U.S. workplaces nearly all employees from the C-suite to the mailroom pay the same amount for health coverage. An alternative to this traditional structure is to set cost-sharing levels or tiers based on employee compensation. That will reduce the amount lower-paid workers must contribute to maintain and use their health coverage at no additional cost to companies. Higher-paid employees will see a moderate increase in their contributions as they effectively subsidize health coverage for lower-paid workers.

""Most employers don't think about shifting from the current one-size-fits-all approach to using a fixed percent of pay for health insurance coverage because they have always done it that way"" says benefits consultant Gary Kushner president of Kushner and Co. in Portage Mich.

But there are several reasons why an employer may want to move to income-based cost-sharing with employees a model that is rising in popularity.









Communication and Competition

First asking lower-paid workers to pay a larger percentage of their pay than higher-paid individuals undercuts efforts to help improve employees' financial wellness and stress levels. Second if cost-sharing is too high employees may avoid seeking needed care because of high out-of-pocket costs thereby risking more-serious long-term health issues.

And for some employers taking a fresh approach to apportioning health care costs is a competitive strategy. Indeed organizations that are having difficulty attracting and retaining lower-paid employees may want to consider income-based health care contributions to stand out in the talent marketplace.

The Small Business Association of Michigan (SBAM) is based in Lansing where it competes for talent against much larger employers including Michigan State University that tend to offer more-generous benefits. As a small organization with 27 employees the association has had to get creative in its benefits offerings.

For nearly 15 years the SBAM has tied employees' health insurance contributions to their pay according to Ann Parker the organization's chief operating officer. Because the SBAM assesses employee contributions as a flat percentage of the total premium it is much simpler to communicate the total cost of health insurance coverage to employees—and how much of that cost the organization is covering.

The SBAM segments employees into four tiers based on their title or role in the organization such as clerk salesperson vice president and CEO. Parker and her team review the structure annually once they know the cost of health coverage for the coming year. When the organization began using this structure employees in the lowest tier paid 5 percent of health insurance costs and those in the highest tier paid 12.5 percent. The 2021 structure ranges from 15 percent to 22.5 percent with employee costs rising 2.5 percentage points from tier to tier.

""We are highlighting that the organization is still taking care of employees"" even as the cost of health insurance continues to increase Parker says. ""People tend to be blind to the costs of health insurance so it's important to give them clear numbers about the value of their plans.""



Not Just Premiums

Of course premiums are just one part of employee health care costs. Some companies have also begun tying all employee cost-sharing to income. JPMorgan Chase & Co. not only sets employee health insurance premium contributions based on income (12 percent of pay for employees making less than $60000 and more than 25 percent of pay for employees earning above that amount) but it also uses income to set deductibles and co-insurance levels for in-network care. (Deductibles and co-insurance are the same for out-of-network care regardless of how much money an employee earns.)

To set deductible levels the company uses the same two tiers it uses to set employee premium contributions. A single employee earning less than $60000 would have a deductible of $1000 for in-network care for example while the in-network deductible for a single employee earning $60000 or more would be $1750 for the same plan.

Co-insurance costs for in-network care are segmented using three income tiers. In-network co-insurance levels for family coverage are $2000 for those earning less than $60000; $3000 for those earning $60000 to $149999; and $4500 for those earning $150000 or more.









Sorting Out the Details

Making the change to income-based cost-sharing should be done carefully and in support of an organization's goals. For example the required changes can be cost-neutral to the employer if designed to reduce premiums for lower-paid employees and increase them by the same amount for higher-paid employees. In a three-tier structure the employees in the middle tier would see no change in their premiums. ""I have not seen employers use this to collect more in premiums just how those premium contributions are allocated"" Kushner says.

Administrative challenges associated with income-based cost-sharing are surmountable. ""Payroll systems can create multiple deductions"" Kushner says. Rather than have one or two flat-dollar deductions for health insurance premiums employers can create deductions for different levels as a percentage of pay. ""There is no difficulty doing it"" he adds.

Even so employers should carefully consider whether this is the right approach for them strategically. ""This should be a talent conversation not a health care conversation"" advises Julie Stone managing director with HR consultancy Willis Towers Watson in the New York City area. ""It requires time and thought about issues like hiring turnover salary levels and talent mobility.""

If the shift to premium tiers turns out to be the wrong approach reverting to the cost-sharing structure will again mean higher contributions for lower-paid employees. Consider the change carefully and be fully committed to it before rolling it out says Nancy Daas executive vice president with benefits brokerage firm Hub International in Chicago.

Stone notes that she knows of one employer with income-based cost-sharing that is moving away from that approach. ""They want to focus on what they can do to drive health care affordability for everyone"" she says. ""They're focused on the need to address the underlying issue of cost instead of shifting cost.""









How Will You Structure It?

While employers could assess income-based premium contributions as a flat percentage of pay most create multiple contribution tiers to ensure fairness and make the changeover cost-neutral. Limiting the number of tiers also makes the change easier to deal with from an administrative standpoint.

When setting up income-based health care cost-sharing employers need to decide how to delineate the various levels. For example some small businesses are able to segment the workforce by title as the SBAM does. However the more common approach is to set the levels based on pay ranges.

Determining how many levels to create will depend on several factors including the number of employees and pay ranges in the compensation structure. ""Are there natural break points?"" Kushner asks. Employers generally subdivide employees by income and charge a set premium for that band or tier. While employers have used two to six bands the most common approach is to use three or four.

Employers can create as many tiers as they want. However more bands add administrative complexity Daas says ""because it increases the number of payroll deductions the HR information system must handle.""



Will the Structure Really Work?

To make sure the switch from a flat contribution rate is cost-neutral employers can evaluate how the new structure will work in a real-life situation.

""Look at current contributions versus future contributions under the new structure"" Daas suggests. What is the resulting total for all employee contributions? ""You want to find out if there are any unintended consequences that run up employer costs or adversely impact employees"" she says.

Understanding the financial impact of cost-sharing changes to individual employees and groups is important Daas adds. If an employer develops a contribution structure that allows lower-paid employees to move from paying 10 percent of their pay for health care coverage to 5 percent of their pay how does that affect pay for the higher-paid employees whose contributions will be rising?

Questions Daas advises asking include ""How many winners and losers will there be among employees?"" and ""Is this reasonable and will higher-paid employees be willing to absorb the resulting X percent increase in health care contributions?""

If contributions start at a relatively low level a 50 percent rise for higher-paid employees may not make much of a difference in take-home pay. However if employees are paying $200 or more per month for health care a sudden large premium increase could be a problem.

""Contribution strategy is always great in theory"" Daas says ""but it can have a big impact in real life.""





​

Is income-based cost-sharing gaining momentum?

It depends who you ask. In general larger employers are more likely to pursue this strategy and its use has been increasing slowly over time. For example the Mercer National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans found a slight increase in salary-based health plan contributions between 2016 and 2020 but only among larger employers. A 2019 survey of 610 large employers by HR consultancy Willis Towers Watson found that 27 percent of employers were planning to base employee health care contributions on employee pay levels in 2020 and 34 percent were considering doing so in 2021 essentially unchanged from the survey’s 2017 data. Add in smaller employers however and the numbers decline. The Kaiser Family Foundation’s 2020 Employer Health Benefits survey of 1765 employers looked at the broader category of total cost-sharing and found that only 7 percent of employers with 50 or more employees have any sort of program that reduces cost-sharing for lower-wage workers.







Communicating the Change

Given the magnitude of this type of plan adjustment communication is critical. Employers need to carefully explain and build their case for income-based health care contributions so that higher-paid employees understand what company leaders are trying to achieve. At the same time communication to lower-paid employees can ensure that the employer gets credit for making health insurance more affordable for this group Daas says.

Before implementing and communicating the change conduct market research to find out what peers and competitors for talent in the same industry or region are doing. This does not have to be limited to companies that use income-based premium tiers for health insurance. The key is to get a clear sense of how much employees at competing companies pay for coverage.

Transparency is also important. Stone at Willis Towers Watson advises employers to communicate the entire strategy around these changes and why employees' cost-sharing levels will be changing.

""This should not be a surprise or a secret"" she says. If the employer differentiates premiums by income or any other means such as geography that should also be clearly communicated. ""Employees should also know or be able to find out the impact on their premium contributions if they get married get a raise or move to a new location.""



Managing Promotions and Pay Raises

The final and perhaps most critical question is how to handle salary increases and promotions that cause employees to move into the next income tier with a higher health care premium level.

Modeling can show how much impact the chosen bands are likely to have as people advance. For example in a band that covers employees making $30000 to $50000 per year someone making $49500 who is expecting a pay raise may find that raise has a smaller impact as he or she moves to another band that requires higher health care cost-sharing.

""This could slash the impact of the promotion or raise"" says Christopher Calvert senior vice president with consulting firm Segal in New York City. The change ""can be difficult to manage and navigate"" without taking steps to neutralize this potential outcome.

Therefore he suggests employers should focus on total compensation not just direct pay. ""It's important to make sure the total pay increase is enough to offset any increase in health care contributions"" Calvert says. ""Or it might make sense to offer a slightly lower increase to keep someone in a lower tier for health care contributions.""

For this reason employers should pay close attention to employees' positions in the cost-sharing structure. ""Don't set it and forget it"" Kushner says. ""Look at the distribution."" If there's a cluster of people at the top of a given band's range for example that can indicate it's time to examine and possibly update the structure.

Here's a rundown of news on hires exits and promotions from the past week. Are we missing anyone?

But there could still be more to come.

In the first quarter JPMorgan Chase (JPM -0.13%) released $5.2 billion it had been reserving for potential loan losses back into its earnings which helped juice profits. It's one of the main reasons the bank reported a blowout quarter of $14.3 billion in profits and a return on tangible common equity of 29% far surpassing analysts' estimates.

JPMorgan also released $2.9 billion in reserves in the fourth quarter of 2020 meaning the bank has now released a total of $8.1 billion over the past two quarters. While that is a massive amount the nation's largest bank is likely not done and could actually release billions more in reserves later this year. Here's why.

The reason for such big reserve releases

The pandemic hit at an interesting time for the banking sector. After many years of debate and delays the Financial Accounting Standards Board finally implemented a new accounting standard at the beginning of 2020 called the current expected credit losses (CECL) method.

To make a long story short CECL requires banks to reserve for losses on the life of a loan as soon as it hits the balance sheet. This so far has resulted in many of the big banks front-loading reserves because CECL requires banks to reserve for loans even if there is not yet a reason to believe that they will sour. CECL reserving is based on historical experience current conditions and ""reasonable and supportable forecasts"" according to Moody's.

Then of course right as CECL was going into effect the coronavirus pandemic hit shutting down broad swaths of the economy for weeks at a time and making it much more difficult for people to travel go out and essentially spend money. With so much uncertainty in the air banks braced for heavy loan losses simply because they had no idea how long the pandemic could last or what was going to happen and again CECL by its very nature results in banks front-loading reserves.

But as last year progressed trillions of dollars in stimulus went into the economy and scientists around the world made significant progress on coronavirus vaccines. At the end of the year it began to look like the U.S. would be able to recover from the pandemic much quicker than previously thought. It also began to look like the stimulus money could support borrowers until the pandemic ended providing the time they needed to get back into better financial health and keep making loan payments.

With the situation trending much better than the doomsday scenarios many banks initially planned for JPMorgan felt that it could safely start releasing its massive buildup of reserves at the end of last year.

How much more will JPMorgan release?

After the $5.2 billion reserve release this past quarter JPMorgan still has roughly $25.5 billion left in its total reserves for losses. On the bank's recent earnings call CFO Jennifer Piepszak noted that at this level JPMorgan is still reserved roughly $7 billion above its base case. Think of the base case as an economic scenario that the bank actually expects to happen.

However Piepszak also noted that the bank is unlikely to release $7 billion in reserves because it always reserves with downside scenarios in mind just in case things don't go as planned. But that still leaves a lot of room left for reserve releases -- potentially billions.

One area where there will likely be more reserve releases is in the bank's credit card portfolio. Of the bank's $25.5 billion total reserves $14.3 billion is specifically slated for potential losses in the credit card portfolio. However the bank in the first quarter of this year only reported $983 million in credit card net charge-offs (debt unlikely to be collected and a good representation of actual losses).

If this were the run rate for the rest of the year which is unlikely that would mean JPMorgan would lose $3.93 billion in its credit card portfolio in 2021 or the equivalent of 2.97% of its total current credit card loan portfolio. However Piepszak said she expects the bank to see a net charge-off rate for the year of 2.5% which would mean even less credit card losses than what the first quarter indicated. Although banks always reserve more conservatively for credit card loans because of their higher loss rates with $14.3 billion of reserves and only $3 billion to $4 billion in expected losses there should be plenty of room to release some of these reserves.

Final takeaway

While the economy is trending much better and we can all but rule out a doomsday scenario there is still some degree of risk that the economy will not grow at the pace many economists are now projecting if the pandemic isn't fully brought under control.

But assuming vaccine efforts and cases keep trending positively the economy reopens and U.S. economic growth is strong I do think it's possible that JPMorgan could release as much as another $4 billion or even $5 billion of reserves later this year which would significantly boost earnings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vZmluYW5jZS1hbmQtZWNvbm9taWNzLzIwMjEvMDQvMTcvcHJvZml0cy1hdC1hbWVyaWNhcy1iYW5rcy1hcmUtc2t5LWhpZ2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Profits at America's banks are sky-high,"T HE GOOD old days seem to be returning to America.

JPMorgan Chase posted record revenues in the first quarter; those at Goldman Sachs were twice the level in the first quarter of 2020. Profits at Bank of America doubled on the year; those at Citigroup tripled. Returns on tangible common equity a measure of profits relative to capital leapt to 20% at Citigroup 29% at JPMorgan and 33% at Goldman. Not since before the global financial crisis more than a decade ago have the banks’ shareholders been so flush (see chart)."

Brendan Gibbs VP of Automated WAN Solutions at Juniper Networks has published a blog post to explain “why Cloud Metro is such a big deal.”

Gibbs ask us to “Look at it this way: take a look at a state-of-the-art cloud data centre for a large organisation. Instead of running in one central location it’s distributed across thousands of smaller sites close to end users.

“The data centre still provides the cloud scale and elasticity that operators expect.

“But now the organisation deploying it can push and pull those resources across vast geographies right up to where they’re needed and close to the end user with assured performance and extremely low latency.

“Suddenly a new generation of 5G edge and Internet of Things (IoT) services become possible. And large service provider and enterprise networks are the engines that power it all.""

Before we can get there Gibbs says “we need to start thinking differently about a part of the network that’s been overlooked for too long: the metro.

And by ‘metro’ Gibbs says he means “that critical part of the infrastructure today that handles access and aggregation where all the many things accessing the network come together.

“To unleash tomorrow’s digital experiences we must rethink our basic ideas about how metros are architected how we operate them and even what they’re used for.”

Introducing the Cloud Metro for a Changing Landscape

In the next few years Gibbs says “metro traffic will grow 4x faster than anywhere else in the network—and most of it will stay there serving distributed edge services.

“The lines separating different parts of the network and services (business residential mobile xHaul) will get blurrier. And new distributed 5G and edge services will push nearly a third of all workloads out to edge clouds.

“Traditional metro networks built to trombone traffic through a centralised core won’t get the job done. To capitalise on new 5G and edge opportunities network operators need a network built around experience-driven outcomes not connectivity. They need a Cloud Metro.”

We’re told Juniper’s Cloud Metro vision “reimagines today’s siloed point-to-point metro networks as a single versatile IP services fabric.

“Unlike today’s fragmented architectures a Cloud Metro is built for resource-pooling network slicing and automated cloud-based operations.

“It interfaces with both physical and virtual network functions to offer distributed services closer to the end user.

“It intelligently distributes user plane functions and the service edge wherever needed to maximise efficiency and quality. Plus it uses a cloud-like architecture to bring cloud agility and resiliency to metro networks.”

in his own words Gibbs explains the Cloud Metro solution is built on three core pillars:

Massively scalable IP services fabric: Juniper offers a comprehensive portfolio of platforms optimized to support any Cloud Metro use case. That includes options to move up to cloud-scale link and interface speeds (including 400G ZR/ZR+) and the latest optical technologies. And it includes platforms that meet the most stringent timing and synchronization requirements for ultra-low latency 5G enterprise services.

- All offer the same consistent behavior with the same automation and a “One Junos experience” across all platforms. At the same time an IP services fabric enables network operators to scale up with current ring topologies but also to use scale-out topologies.

- These improve metro scalability and reliability while freeing up huge amounts of protected bandwidth that currently go unused.To enhance this services fabric Juniper is announcing two new additions to the Metro portfolio. These new platforms designed for both metro and data center use cases bring 4.8-Tbps of forwarding ASIC capacity and 400GbE interfaces with support for ZR/ZR+ optics to the ACX family :

""Together"" says Gibbs ""these capabilities create a foundation for a world of new 5G edge and IoT services. And they enable superior end-user experiences—all automatically measured and assured.""

Expanding Metro Capabilities

What can network operators do with a Cloud Metro from Juniper? For starters they can:

Use one converged network for all use cases: A Cloud Metro converges all metro use cases—residential business mobile xHaul transport—onto a single converged architecture with a single operational model. Network operators can apply special treatment to different traffic and service types under different service-level agreements (SLAs) and over the same infrastructure.

Enable agile service delivery: A Cloud Metro intelligently steers traffic to the right physical and virtualized resources in the most efficient way to optimize the user experience. It optimizes capacity and utilization with CUPS and modern traffic engineering protocols. And it uses our unique Active Assurance technology to measure actual service quality—not just infer it based on passive testing—and ensure that each slice meets the required SLA.

And it uses our unique Active Assurance technology to measure actual service quality—not just infer it based on passive testing—and ensure that each slice meets the required SLA. Support both brownfield and greenfield environments: No matter at what point network operators start they can evolve toward a Cloud Metro architecture. When building out a new greenfield deployment they can build a metro that looks and acts like a cloud scale-out environment. Meanwhile they can scale up capacity and intelligence in existing ring topologies with both architectures coexisting in the same network. Network operators can also gradually migrate traffic while improving resiliency and agility as they go.

Reimagine the Metro

Gibbs ends by noting “the looming 5G IoT and cloud era brings incredible opportunity for businesses in every industry—and a host of daunting new challenges.

“Many of these challenges can only be solved by operators and their transformed networks. But network operators won’t be able to meet these challenges by relying on a metro designed for yesterday’s static transport and aggregation needs.

“With a Cloud Metro network operators can drive down the costs and complexity of today’s siloed metro architectures and operations. More importantly they can add unique value to the most exciting new 5G and edge applications.

“They can be the sole player in the digital ecosystem that brings cloud resources and intelligence closer to end users while providing the latencies timing and guaranteed performance to make next-generation digital experiences possible.”

Gardens are the perfect way to explore some vast colors and botanical sights but what about spicing things up for your tastebuds? Philadelphians can do just that by heading to the mainline’s newest eatery Lola’s Garden.

The new concept located in Ardmore comes from Avram Hornik and FCM Hospitality who are known around the city for other venues such as Morgan’s Pier Juno The Garden at Cherry Street Pier Rosy’s Taco Bar Harper’s Garden River Beer Garden and Parks on Tap. Lola’s however marks the first venture for the organization out to the suburbs.

“We are excited to be part of the renewed energy and exciting changes in Suburban Square and in Ardmore” said Hornik in a statement. “Back in the early 90s I owned several coffee houses and wanted to bring an outdoor coffee kiosk and seating to the very same spot at what will now become Lola’s Garden. Now 25 years later my relationship with Suburban Square comes full circle. Kimco Realty is transforming what was one of America’s earliest planned suburban shopping centers. Shopping centers and malls are no longer designed exclusively as a place for commerce. They are now community gathering spots with a much larger purpose of promoting and fostering socialization and interaction. We want to be part of that energy and the new direction for Suburban Square as it evolves into an urban pedestrian-friendly town center and community hub that includes a grocery store gourmet farmers’ market restaurants green space and much more. Exciting developments in the near future that really attracted me are the plans for new housing coming to the Suburban Square area plus the new rail station for Downtown Ardmore. This is FCM Hospitality’s opportunity to partner with Kimco and Suburban Square to spotlight and celebrate all things local and from our state – from food and beer to wine and cocktails. We are excited to join the Ardmore and Main Line community.”

Lola’s Garden opened just last weekend and in all the 4300 square foot space is broken down to 1800 square feet inside for dining a lounge and bar and 2500 square feet outside for the giant four-season outdoor trellis. The socially distanced seat count is 240+ people with tables presented six feet apart.

According to the release from the kitchen Lola’s Garden will offer a seasonally influenced modern American culinary program that will offer a variety of options including vegan vegetarian and gluten-free selections. Under the leadership and talents of Executive Chef Andrew Wood guests will find dishes featuring uniquely paired honest and local ingredients. Lola’s Garden will open with bites salads sandwiches and entrees along with a brunch and lunch menu to roll out a few weeks later. Diners are also informed not expect more than a handful of ingredients on each plate.

Highlighted menu items include spinach fettuccine with crab pepperoncini and blood orange; braised happy valley lamb leg with roasted carrots turnips and onion soubise; salt-roasted fingerling potatoes with Serrano ham romesco sauce herb salad and more. The menu will rotate with seasonal and local finds similar to FCM’s Harper’s Garden in the city. Cocktails will also follow a similar suit and even seasonally rotating hand-crafted artisan mocktails such as their Blackberry Ginger Soda Spicy Pineapple Cucumber Basil Butterfly and Hibiscus Palmer. On top of the fruity lobations Philadelphians can also find a selection of beers wine and a full line-up of spirits.

If you haven’t already gathered from the name the new eatery will be florally appealing and has its own springtime aesthetic that will last all year long and well into the winter. Lola’s features one-of-a-king art handcrafted pieces and hidden nostalgic nods throughout the inside and outside.

For now Lola’s Garden (51 St Georges Road) is open Wednesday through Sunday 5 to 10 p.m. Starting Wednesday April 28 Lola’s will open for lunch and dinner and launch brunch service that weekend. Starting May 3 look for Lola’s to be open seven days a week for lunch dinner and brunch. For information visit lolasgardenrestaurant.com",,,,,,,,,,,,

Around the world scientists and advocates call for keeping carbon in the ground as a means of staving off climate change. But in the Southwestern United States – mainly in Colorado and New Mexico – a mainstay of obtaining more oil is facilitated by doing the exact opposite: drilling pure reserves of carbon dioxide out of the ground.

After it’s extracted from these natural-source underground fields the gas then gets piped to the Permian Basin the nation’s top-producing oil fields of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. There oil companies use the CO2 to flood their wells forcing the last dregs of crude to the surface in a process also known as enhanced oil recovery or EOR.

Carbon flooding is often described as a way of helping recover available oil providing power while the energy sector transitions away from fossil fuels altogether. Sometimes oil companies mention it alongside questionable carbon capture technology suggesting that pulling CO2 from the atmosphere and pumping it underground into oil wells for permanent storage – and to loosen up remaining crude for extraction – would facilitate “carbon neutral” oil production.

However that picture of carbon flooding is a futuristic fallacy. The first barrel of so-called carbon neutral oil was produced only earlier this year by Occidental Petroleum. And it relied on carbon offsets rather than direct capture of CO2 and injection into wells.

The reality is that this little-known process uses mostly CO2 extracted from natural sources where it would’ve otherwise remained safely underground – not risking emission into the atmosphere nor furthering the use of planet-warming fossil fuels.

While the industry remains out of view of even many dedicated observers and watchdogs it has existed for four decades and its scale is massive.

Occidental Petroleum – a Houston-based corporation that recently rebranded itself as a “carbon management” enterprise despite being one of the top greenhouse gas emitter in history – says that it injects 2.6 billion cubic feet of CO2 per day into its Permian fields. The company is the largest leaseholder and one of the top producers in the Permian in both New Mexico and Texas. It drilled 13% of the basin’s production in 2015 and has said it foresees billions more in oil production from future CO2 floods.

Kinder Morgan another major player in this sector claims it transports 1.3 billion cubic feet of CO2 every day aiding the extraction of 50000 barrels of crude daily.

Carbon flooding and drilling have occurred in the U.S. for decades and they’re likely to grow in prominence. On this front oil companies have support from both major parties as well as President Joe Biden.

And tucked into the nearly 5600-page coronavirus relief bill passed late last year are more tax credits for CCUS (carbon capture utilisation and storage) – a suite of processes that includes carbon flooding as the most-prominent “utilisation” piece. In addition the legislation fast-tracks permitting of CO~2~ pipelines and other CCUS infrastructure. Since then congressional lawmakers in the current session have introduced more legislation along similar lines including the recently introduced SCALE Act.

However carbon flooding isn’t the innocuous technology that energy companies and politicians hope it to be. An exploration of the industry reveals it poses significant environmental harms existential climate threats and health risks.

In addition carbon drilling companies have a pattern of creating local economies that depend on their existence while simultaneously trying to undercut tax and royalty payments to town governments and residents.

How it works

Though the Permian is widely known for companies’ usage of hydraulic fracturing or fracking for oil it’s also where companies use carbon dioxide extracted from underground fields known as domes in Colorado and New Mexico to flood oil wells forcing 8%-20% of additional original oil in place to the surface.

An oil industry consultant and former engineer who also has done carbon flooding work for a company in the Permian told Capital & Main that drilling for CO2 is in many ways similar to drilling for oil and natural gas.

“It’s really the same tools the same equipment the same calculation going on. It’s just using different types of numbers” he explained. “But you find a CO2 source field which obviously can be several thousand feet underground and you move a drilling rig in and you drill for it.”

Nearly 80% of all oil extracted via carbon flooding in the United States is done with gas obtained from the domes in New Mexico and Colorado according to a 2015 US Department of Energy report. While the amount varies from year to year 2.9% of daily domestic oil production came from carbon flooding in 2018 according to a report from Denbury Resources a player in the industry.

Carbon flooding could help oil companies recover up to 284 additional billion barrels of oil a 2020 presentation given by industry consultancy Advanced Resources International concluded.

Today carbon flooding is touted as a potential climate solution due to the fact that a portion of the carbon dioxide used during the enhanced oil recovery process gets sent back underground keeping it out of the atmosphere where it would contribute to global warming. However the oil companies have viewed the drilling process as a way to extend the duration of their wells. As Kinder Morgan put it in a 2003 ad “Thanks to something invisible the Permian’s future is solid” adding that “CO2 flooding breathes new life” into oil fields.

However carbon flooding furthers the climate crisis by facilitating both more fossil fuel use and leakage of natural-source CO2 into the atmosphere.

“At best you’re just not changing the status quo” said Jeremy Nichols climate and energy program director for WildEarth Guardians. “Inevitably the CO2 will enter the atmosphere. … It will be released.”

A long list of safety and environmental threats

From day one carbon extraction has proven an environmental risk and sometimes a deadly one.

One of the byproducts of drilling for and then flooding wells with carbon dioxide is the potential release of a toxic corrosive gas called hydrogen sulphide or H2S. It and other gases can surface during the venting of carbon wells. And in some cases the chemical compound has proven deadly.

One such incident occurred in the central hub for carbon flooding Denver City Texas – once dubbed the “Carbon Dioxide Capital of the World“. After gas escaped from an injection well in 1975 nine people died from H2S exposure most of them residents living nearby. In total 17 people died from exposure in that area within a four month period.

An Environmental Protection Agency report points to 10 other H2S leaks from oil and gas extraction between 1974 and 1993. None of the incidents killed humans but they did kill jackrabbits and blackbirds a coyote groups of moose and cows a horse and other animals.

Some people living near carbon extraction sites cite H2S as a threat to their communities.

In southwestern Colorado’s Montezuma County – home to one of the world’s largest natural CO2 sources the McElmo Dome – these wells are rampant. Kinder Morgan the main stakeholder in McElmo Dome must keep an H2S contingency plan on public file with the county.

“Where they’re drilling and the H2S might be there you need to have a [respirator] mask” said Jimbo Buickerood of the San Juan Citizens Alliance an advocacy group that has worked on CO2 drilling issues in Montezuma County and elsewhere. “It’ll just kill you.”

On top of noise complaints and other disruptions related to the drilling citizens have reported smelling mystery gases coming from the wells from which CO2 is extracted.

Tom Hayden filed a complaint with Colorado’s oil and gas commission in 2019 after he said Kinder Morgan had been venting a CO2 well about 1000 feet from his home. He had the company check an air-quality monitor for anything dangerous but the alarm wasn’t functioning according to the complaint.

Knowing the potential danger Hayden wrote that Kinder Morgan seemed “lawless” and that he didn’t feel safe in his home fearing he “could be killed at any time.” Hayden’s complaint led to the state suspending Kinder Morgan’s well later that year.

CO2 leakage too has proven a persistent issue around extraction sites. Many are relatively low stakes such as the 2017 leak of 1 million cubic feet of CO2 at an Oxy USA facility in New Mexico’s Bravo Dome – another major drilling site.

Others are more devastating. Also in 2017 a CO2 pipeline in West Texas’s Scurry County blew and hurt at least eight people. One man was hit by shrapnel in his leg and back Snyder News reported. And in 1982 Colorado’s Sheep Mountain Unit CO2 extraction site was the source of one of the largest CO2 leakages and the largest recorded industrial release in human history.

Carbon flooding has likely caused small earthquakes in Texas one study found after researchers correlated shakes with the underground injection of CO2 for oil recovery over a five-year period.

Another carbon flooding byproduct – dirty “produced water” – is another potential source of leaks that can contaminate the soil and groundwater. Environmental advocacy group Clean Water Action calls carbon flooding “one of the most water intensive forms of oil production” one that demands freshwater drawn from the drought stricken Permian regions of Texas and New Mexico.

Climate peril and carbon flooding’s politics

Carbon flooding is often billed as a solution to climate change. The pitch from its proponents is that carbon can be captured at an emissions source like a power plant and piped safely away to an oil field. There it can help recover available oil and provide power while the energy sector transitions away from fossil fuels altogether.

But while some of the gas used in carbon flooding comes from capturing CO2 at emissions sources such capture technology remains unproven and too costly for widespread use – leaving much of the oil recovery to CO2 drilled from places where it otherwise would’ve stayed underground.

The carbon flooding process ends with between 3.7 and 4.7 metric tonnes of CO2 emitted for every metric ton of CO2 injected into the earth according to a 2009 study . Less than 0.2 metric tonnes of CO2 gets sequestered underground for each barrel of oil produced.

A 2020 study further concluded that the CO2 capture and storage process leaks between 0.43 and 0.94 kilograms of carbon for each kilogram of CO2 that gets stored. Carbon flooding using natural CO2 sources like the McElmo or Bravo domes the study concludes “cannot contribute to reductions in anthropogenic CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.”

Despite these studies the EPA statutorily mandates that CO2 drilling sites self-report their emissions data to the EPA only if the site emits over 25000 metric tons of CO2 per year. Asked if the agency had ever brought an enforcement action against any CO2 dome operators an EPA spokeswoman instead pointed a Capital & Main researcher toward a factsheet that didn’t answer the question.

(Update: On April 10 the EPA responded by stating “EPA has not brought any enforcement actions against any companies in there [sic] carbon drilling space.”)

Despite their flaws and little regulation carbon flooding and CCUS have powerful political allies.

President Biden has long favoured CCUS. His climate platform says he “will double down on research investments and tax incentives for technology that captures carbon and then permanently sequesters or utilises that captured carbon.”

His energy secretary Jennifer Granholm has also endorsed CCUS. “If confirmed I fully plan to commit resources to carbon management across the fuel and technology spectrum” Granholm wrote to senators after her January 27 confirmation hearing. “I am particularly excited by the opportunities for game-changing advances in carbon capture.”

An unreliable ally for local communities

Money is the driver for both carbon companies and the localities that allow such work on their land. But in many instances energy companies do just about everything in their power to keep their money out of locals’ pockets.

Extracted CO2 helps energy companies get more oil to sell and creating a market for carbon dioxide allows them to profit from a greenhouse gas.

Drilling operations primarily sit in rural areas that depend on their existence. New Mexico’s Harding County one of three counties housing the Bravo Dome gets 70%-80% of its tax revenue from carbon drilling operations. Neighbouring Union County takes more than 20% of its tax base from them.

In addition governments and individual landowners are often due royalties from the entities working their land. But to get the money they’re owed they often wind up in court fighting the energy companies. The state of New Mexico once sued Occidental companies for underpaid CO~2~ royalties. They settled in 2006 for $11.6 million.

The Department of the Interior is involved in an ongoing lawsuit against Oxy USA over royalties with a U.S. District Court ruling in December 2020 that the company owes the agency $1.82 million in royalty payments. Occidental has appealed the ruling.

Dolores County Colorado home of the Doe Canyon CO2 source field operated by Kinder Morgan raises an estimated 64% of its tax revenue from carbon extraction. Colorado’s Montezuma County depends on carbon drilling for more than half of its tax base. They’ve had to file suit to get their dues too winning a case against Kinder Morgan for more than $2 million in underpaid taxes.

“That gives money to our fire departments our cemeteries our roads – the whole county is based on the taxes” said Leslie Bugg the county assessor. Without the taxes she said “We wouldn’t even be able to have employees anymore in the offices.”

While lucrative for the county’s tax base there’s a glaring issue in Montezuma County: The carbon dioxide will likely run out in the coming decades. A 2011 Energy Department paper predicted that the current commercially produced CO2 sources at the current production rate could run dry by about 2050.

Just like an oil town before its crude dries up the county must prepare for a major economic blow. County Commissioner Jim Candelaria said he hopes the logging industry there can have a resurgence but building it up will take a while.

“I hope we have some time before that (carbon) runs out” he said “but it will run out.”

The first-quarter earnings season got off to a good start with banking giants JPMorgan Chase Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs unveiling their latest financial data mid-week. They were joined by software firm Infosys on Wednesday.

The spotlight stayed on financial services Thursday also when the closely followed reports of Citigroup and Bank of America came out. Delta Air Lines and soft-drink behemoth PepsiCo released earnings on the same day. The first phase of bank earnings concluded on Friday with Morgan Stanley’s blockbuster Q1 report.

It’s going to be mixed bag next week. For instance the companies scheduled to report on April 19 include United Airlines Holdings IBM and Coca-Cola. The important corporate houses preparing to report on April 20 comprise Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson as well as streaming giant Netflix which has been thriving on the COVID-driven boom. The earning reports of superbike company Harley-Davidson and Lockheed Martin are also slated for Tuesday.

The other major companies that can elicit investor interest include Halliburton Verizon Communications Chipotle Mexican Grill and Kinder Morgan – the companies will report earnings on April 21. The next day it is the turn of American Airlines and Southwest Airlines as well as tech firms AT&T and Intel. American Express is probably the only big player to report on April 23.

The market was abuzz with the news of Microsoft’s $20-billion buyout of cloud software company Nuance Communications. In another important deal in the cloud space Datadog completed the acquisition of the SaaS-based security platform Sqreen.

The otherwise quiet M&A market witnessed Dell Technologies becoming two standalone public companies by spinning off its 81% ownership in VMware. The other major deals include Amgen’s $2-billion purchase of Five Prime Therapeutics and the acquisition of Upchain by software firm Autodesk.

KHC,Kraft Heinz,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc2hvY3RvbnRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMS8wNC8xOC9qb2JzLXBsZW50aWZ1bC1jb3Nob2N0b24tYnV0LXdvcmtlcnMtbm90LzcyMTg3MjIwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jobs are plentiful in Coshocton but workers are not,"Many businesses in Coshocton County are hiring but can't find workers.

Issues in the past have been people with the right skill set or being able to pass a drug test.

The current problem is people not wanting to work because of stimulus and increased unemployment benefits.

Coshocton has more than 130 jobs available with an unemployment rate of 6.9% or 900 people.

COSHOCTON - Driving around Coshocton County will reveal plenty of 'help wanted' and 'now hiring' signs. There are jobs available but there doesn't appear to be people clamoring for them.

This is reverse of the Great Recession where people wanted to work but jobs weren't available. In the past few years management of local businesses said jobs were plentiful and the hurdle was finding applicants with the right skill set or who could pass a drug test both issues that can be worked on. However you can't solve any personal problems of someone when nobody is applying to start with.

The local office of Ohio Means Jobs part of Coshocton County Job and Family Services had more than 180 open positions listed for this past week in the county including 70 at Kraft-Heinz. The latest unemployment figures has Coshocton County at 6.9% or about 900 people not working. Lynn Jacobs Administrator for Ohio Means Jobs of Coshocton County said if you discount those who are unemployable for various reasons the rate drops to 2% to 3%.

Open jobs range a wide gamut from manufacturers such as McWane Ductile and AK Steel to restaurants like Dairy Queen and Coshocton Coffee Connection to retail stores including Dollar General and the soon to open Ollie's Bargain Outlet.

Many believe the reason is the COVID-19 pandemic. You not only have people with health concerns but others who can stay home and make more money via stimulus funding and increased unemployment benefits. That will eventually run out and perhaps the only thing that can be done is to ride the lull.

Need for workers

In 2014 Kraft-Heinz centered all of its Oscar Mayer bacon production at the Coshocton plant. This came with a promise of adding 300 jobs as part of an enterprise zone agreement giving a tax break on expansion construction. Kraft and Heinz companies merged in 2015.

While the company is ahead of its payroll promise of $8.8 million at more than $12.5 million and has kept the 372 positions it already had it's only added 252 new employees so far. This hasn't been from a lack of trying.

Controller Jody Wright said in 2020 they hired 242 employees but lost 206. So far this year they've hired 74 employees but lost 111.

Recruiting efforts have included advertising and working with the Ohio Means Jobs and other agencies. She said they are also looking to raise starting salary from $12.55 an hour in upcoming union negotiations to entice new employees.

The company made 133 million pounds of bacon in 2020 and the projection is to produce 141 million pounds this year. Demand is higher than that Wright said but they don't have enough employees to increase production. Currently employees are working 60-hour weeks to keep up with needs the best they can.

""On our docket for 2021 is to get all our positions filled and get back to our weekly production capacity"" Wright said. ""Kraft at one time was the place people wanted to work and we've kind of fallen from that with the merger. So how can we become a strong community partner again and what can we do to help there and be an employer of choice again.""

McWane Ductile also has an enterprise zone agreement related to creation of its ductile pole division in 2013. The promise was to create 12 new jobs with a payroll of $424320. To date they've added 46 employees and increased payroll by more than $2 million. In 2020 McWane made 1916 more poles than in 2019 and the average weight went up by 300 pounds.

Even with that being the case Genera Manager Tom Crawford said they're having a hard time hiring and retaining workers as well. They recently had 25 new workers come in.

""There should be no reason there should be any unemployment in the City of Coshocton these days. There are jobs plentiful we just can't get people to come in"" Crawford said.

From a different realm River View Local Schools has had trouble finding teachers and other staff. This is after the district cut many positions last year to compensate for lost tax revenue with the closure of the American Electric Power plant outside Conesville.

""I can't hire paraprofessionals. I can't hire teachers. It's not just the general labor force right now. We're struggling to find people to fill our positions too"" said Superintendent Dalton Summers.

He was recently at a local restaurant and stood in line for 20 minutes to pay his bill because they didn't have enough people to run the register. Summers spoke with the owner who expressed his frustrations on finding employees.

""I feel everybody's pain on trying to fill positions right now. I can't understand how we have an employment problem with so many open positions. It blows my mind"" Summers said.

How to fill the need

One idea is to connect with the next generation of workers students coming out of high school. Summers said he as spoken with recruiters from different companies including Kraft Heinz about promoting jobs in the schools. This includes having a job fair and distributing information to students.

Tiffany Swigert Executive Director of the Coshocton Port Authority said her office was recently assigned Sherri Gibson as an economic recovery coordinator through the Resilience Initiative for Southeastern and Eastern Ohio (RISE Ohio). One of her goals is to work with students on entering the local workforce straight out of high school or college or while still in school with the idea of those part-time or summer positions translating into full-time jobs.

""Her sole two years here will be working with Ohio University on what that message needs to be and how to reach it to the kids"" Swigert said.

She said the past year has been a real challenge for most companies because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of workers is just another problem. Not to mention businesses having trouble filling slots prior to the pandemic too.

""You add COVID-19 on top of work force challenges we have anyway and the stimulus dollars coming in and you have significant issues with getting people to come to work because they've made more money this year than ever before not having to show up"" Swigert said.

She's encouraged local officials and management to write letters and reach out to legislatures to explain problems. There could be workforce development funding or new initiatives possible. She also stresses this is not a problem that Coshocton County only is dealing with.

""This is not specific to Coshocton by any means. This is happening in many many areas over the nation"" she said.

Time is right to find a job

Jacobs agrees it's not only a local problem. They've been talking with OMJ branches in other counties to figure out best practices in attracting workers.

This includes virtual job fairs but Jacobs said Coshocton residents are more likely to attend an in-person event. A job fair with about a dozen employers is planned from noon to 3 p.m. May 6 at the Coshocton Elks Lodge 434 Chestnut St. It's in conjunction with In-Demand Jobs Week.

Jacobs said there are many more open jobs in the community than the ones OMJ knows about. He recently talked with a restaurant owner who wants to reopen his dining room from the pandemic closure but can't find any help. He said another company he's talked to said they're hiring people but they don't get through the two week orientation process. They just stop showing up with no explanation.

""It's a wonder we have an unemployment problem. We shouldn't have"" Jacobs said. ""It's totally opposite from what we've faced here at Ohio Means Jobs before. We've never had so many jobs available.""

He said they're still seeing issues with finding candidates who can pass a drug test and have the right skills. But it's also people not working who aren't looking. He said that can sometimes happen in the spring with people wanting to take time off but right now stimulus funding and unemployment benefits being what they are is elevating it. However that's going to all run out eventually.

""We've lived through it before. They'll take the time off and that pendulum comes back. The jobs aren't as readily available or the jobs that are higher paying aren't available. They're in a quandary and say 'hey Ohio Means Jobs I need a job within the next six weeks because my unemployment is going to run out'"" Jacobs said. ""Normally in the whole scheme of things it takes a good three to six months to find your next career. It's a gamble on their part if they're doing that.""

Jacksonville Journal-Courier (TNS)

CARROLLTON — Two Kroger grocery stores in Greene County are set to close within the coming month the company said Wednesday.

The Cincinnati-based retailer the largest U.S. supermarket chain by revenue with 2920 stores nationwide has stores in Carrollton and White Hall.

""It's a devastation to the town"" White Hall Mayor Brad Staats said. ""We're going to lose jobs revenue. It's going to disrupt a lot of people's lives.""

Aside from Kroger the closest grocery stores to White Hall are 20-plus miles away in Greenfield Jerseyville and Jacksonville.

Any of those can be a long trip Staats said.

Staats is hoping the town will get another grocery store he said adding that the absence will create issues for residents who don't drive and instead walk to the grocery. The price of gas being in the $3-a-gallon range makes it an issue for those who do drive he said.

More:Peoria has tried to erase its food deserts. Here's why it hasn't worked

""It's terrible"" White Hall resident Diana Monroe said. Because the post office is closed by the time she gets off work she relies on the White Hall Kroger for both groceries and postage stamps she said.

It's also about the products the store sells she said noting that Kroger sells brands she might not be able to get elsewhere.

""Either way all around it's going to be a big pain"" Monroe said.

Some areas south of Interstate 80 in northern Illinois can be considered a food desert state Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer said noting that he is worried that Kroger leaving Greene County will create a food desert between Jacksonville and Jerseyville.

Food deserts especially affect those at or below the poverty level he said.

""I hope community-minded people will step up and come together and try to figure out a solution but in the meantime food deserts are something that are in regular conversation in Springfield"" Davidsmeyer said. ""We will certainly be working on opportunities to expand those services into those communities.""

Also:Peoria Grown not-for-profit brings fresh produce distribution hub to city's south side

Kroger spokesman Eric Halvorson said the decision to close the stores follows extensive evaluation of the stores' financial performance.

Carrollton officials asked about possible incentives the city could offer to prevent that store's closing but were told the decision had been made.

""As a city we are working to keep our only grocery store open"" a news release from the city said.

""We've been working with Kroger for many many years and just have been falling on deaf ears"" said Debbie Dunlap the Carrollton treasurer. ""The grocery store is like a color of your community and if you don't have a grocery store it's difficult.""

Kroger cited years of failure to make a profit.

""Company analysts report the stores have not operated profitably for several years and research indicates neither has realistic prospects for a turnaround"" the company said in a statement.

Store employees were told of the decision Wednesday morning. The company said the decision was not a reflection on employees or their service.

The two stores have a combined 46 employees. Severance will be offered to qualified associates based on the length of service with the company a Kroger spokesperson said.

In early January 2018 Kroger also decided to close two longstanding Peoria stores shuttering its locations on Harmon Highway and Wisconsin Avenue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2xvc2FuZ2VsZXMvbmV3cy9rcm9nZXItY2xvc2luZy1yYWxwaHMtYW5kLWZvb2QtNC1sZXNzLW92ZXItaGVyby1wYXktbGF3L9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9sb3NhbmdlbGVzL25ld3Mva3JvZ2VyLWNsb3NpbmctcmFscGhzLWFuZC1mb29kLTQtbGVzcy1vdmVyLWhlcm8tcGF5LWxhdy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kroger Closing Ralphs And Food 4 Less In Long Beach Saturday Over Hero Pay Law,"LONG BEACH (CBSLA) —Kroger is closing two of its stores Ralphs and Food 4 Less on Saturday after the City of Long Beach mandated that the company pay employees $4 extra an hour in ""hero pay"" amid the coronavirus pandemic.

As customers came by the store on Saturday there wasn't much left to buy and the shelves were visibly empty but people in the neighborhood said they wanted to shop there one more time.

""I came to get the last minute deals and say goodbye to the store"" shopper Nick Savala told CBSLA's Joy Benedict. ""It's almost like you're losing a part of your family because you get to recognize the faces you see when you come shopping. So it's a real bummer.""

Santiago Vasquez has been working at the Ralphs part-time for about a year handling pick up orders and helping out in the meat department. He said all of his coworkers were offered jobs some of them in nearby stores. But Velasquez said the offer of a transfer didn't make much sense for him.

""I was offered to stay with the company in Huntington Beach and Seal Beach"" he said ""...but I'd rather just work a minimum wage job around where I live.""

Employees tell CBSLA that the empty buildings are slated to be used for storage and then eventually shutter leaving residents with little idea about what's to come of the properties.

""I have no idea what the property value is"" Brian Bogey a customer said. ""I know there's open real-estate next door. So there may be some kind of deal going on. The land may be pretty valuable.""

Kroger announced back in February that it was closing the two stores — Food 4 Less at 2185 E. South St. and Ralphs at 3380 N. Los Coyotes Diagonal — directly in response to the passage of the new law.

""I'm very sad about it"" Ricardo Galvan a Downey resident told CBSLA Friday. ""I love coming here especially after work. It was great coming here to get something to eat. We're definitely going to miss it.""

In December the Long Beach City Council passed an ordinance that requires grocers with at least 300 employees nationwide to provide their employees with an extra $4 per hour in hazard pay for at least a period of 120 days.

""That's disappointing"" shopper Ashley Carlton said. ""I think these guys they toughed out the pandemic and they deserve hero pay.""

Kroger maintained that he extra cost of temporary hazard made make it impossible for them to operate what they called ""underperforming stores.""

However customers told CBSLA Friday that the stores were not underperforming and in fact were often very busy.

""This is the one we prefer to come to and the lines are long sometimes"" shopper Jose De La Cruz said.

Meanwhile Kroger last month also announced plans to close another three stores in the city of Los Angeles which passed its own $5 per hour hero pay mandate in early March.

LONG BEACH Calif. (KABC) -- Two grocery stores in Long Beach will permanently close Saturday after Kroger said it couldn't afford the city's ""hero pay"" law.

Kroger announced plans in February to close a Ralphs location on North Los Coyotes Diagonal and a Food 4 Less store on East South Street.

Kroger says the two stores have been underperforming and that it would be financially impossible to keep both stores open if it had to pay workers the extra $4 an hour over four months.

Long Beach City Council passes resolution giving grocery workers extra $4 per hour in hazard pay

The planned emergency ordinance would order grocery store employers to pay their frontline employees an additional $4 an hour in hazard pay wages.

Mayor Robert Garcia was a major proponent of the ordinance. Before signing the measure he wrote on Twitter that grocery workers ""have been on the front lines of this pandemic and deserve this support.'' He added grocers have made record profits amid the pandemic.

The Long Beach City Council in January gave initial approval to a law requiring large grocers to pay its workers an extra $4 an hour in ""hero pay"" for their work during the COVID-19 pandemic. The law applies to companies with 300 or more workers overall and more than 15 employees per location in Long Beach.

The California Grocers Association was among those opposing the ordinance saying it would not do anything to boost the safety of workers but could actually lead to higher costs for consumers.

Police say Fesnando Santos stabbed and injured a man at an East Nashville Kroger this week. Santos pleaded guilty to killing a man with a knife in a motel parking lot in 2017.

The prosecutor on the homicide case says Santos was initially charged with second degree murder but the evidence couldn’t prove that.

“We could not meet a second degree murder charge the evidence just didn’t support that” Assistant District Attorney Doug Thurman said. “I’m ethically prohibited from pursuing a charge I can’t prove.”

Instead ADA Thurman pursued a lesser charge of reckless homicide. He says Santos had a solid case for self-defense and didn’t know he hurt the victim enough to kill him until police told him later.

RELATED:

“Had we gone to trial I felt like there was a strong chance the jury may have acquitted him based on the facts of the situation he was not the aggressor of this case” Thurman said.

Thurman says Santos received an appropriate sentence for reckless homicide according to state law. It’s a class D felony carrying a two to four year sentence.

Other felonies carry harsher sentences. Aggravated assault which could include threatening someone with a dangerous weapon carries a three to six year range. Certain felony drug dealing charges could put someone in jail from eight to 12 years.

“Some of these things don’t always make perfect logical sense but that’s what the legislature passed that’s what they say” Thurman said.

A person’s criminal history factors into a person’s sentence. The more prior felonies on a person’s records the more jail time they could receive in a sentence.

In Santos’ case he had a lengthy history of arrests but Thurman said many of those arrests were misdemeanors or dismissed. A judge can’t use a dismissed charge as part of their sentencing decisions.

Thurman says Santos had just one felony arrest on his record for robbery at the time he was sentenced for reckless homicide.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vaG93LWN2cy1jYW4tYnJpbmctYmV5b25kLW1lYXQtaGVhbHRoeS1mb29kcy1mb29kLWRlc2VydHMtMjAyMS000gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9ob3ctY3ZzLWNhbi1icmluZy1iZXlvbmQtbWVhdC1oZWFsdGh5LWZvb2RzLWZvb2QtZGVzZXJ0cy0yMDIxLTQ_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How CVS can bring Beyond Meat healthy foods to food deserts,"By clicking “Sign Up” you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .

CVS is bringing healthy foods and meat-alternatives to communities across America.

The pharmacy chain and Beyond Meat just announced a partnership that would bring meat-alternative burgers and meatballs to 7000 stores nationwide. CVS will also add 60 new ""better for you"" snacks and 50 new frozen foods that are vegan organic gluten-free plant based and zero-sugar-added.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Now valued at $8.7 billion Beyond Meat became the first plant-based meat-substitute company to go public just two years ago. The company has continued to expand by partnering with McDonald's and Taco Bell as traditional meat seller Tyson rushes to catch up with its own plant-based line.

The deal may suggest Beyond Meat decreasing its reliance on foodservice. Foodservice sales through restaurants that sell Beyond Meat including Carl's Jr. and BurgerFi dropped 31% year-over-year in 2020 CEO Ethan Brown said on a recent earnings call.

Revenue from retail however increased by 108% between 2019 and 2020 but Brown said the trend will drop in 2021 as the pandemic subsides. ""We've got a lot of room still to grow in retail"" Brown said.

The CVS partnership which represented the first pharmacy Beyond Meat sold at could be its first step into retail growth.

""CVS is ubiquitous in neighborhoods and communities across America and Beyond Meat is proud to partner with them as our first pharmacy partner to bring increased choice and access to nutritious food options to their consumers"" a Beyond Meat spokesperson told Insider. ""The addition of the Beyond Burger and Beyond Meatballs at CVS aligns with CVS' larger effort to help its millions of customers make healthier choices.""

How bringing Beyond Meat to CVS could bring meat-alternatives to food deserts.

CVS sells more groceries than Trader Joe's and Whole Foods the Guardian reported due to the store's prevalence in low-income areas that don't have access to high-end grocery stores.

CVS has nearly 10000 locations in the US D.C. and Puerto Rico. Kroger the company's largest supermarket has just 2750 locations. Walmart the country's largest retailer has 5342 stores as of January 2021 — meaning CVS has more stores than Kroger and Walmart combined.

The lack of quality grocery stores in disproportionately low-income areas result in ""food deserts"" or areas more than a mile from fresh produce-sellers that rely more on processed and pre-packaged food.

Diets that limit processed foods and sugary beverages are associated with higher life expectancy. But there's twice as many supermarkets carrying fresh produce in higher-income areas than lower-income ones per non-profit World of Vegan and just 2% of meat alternatives are available in low-income areas.

Independent nutritionists told Insider's Aria Bendix and other outlets Beyond Meat burgers are processed and have roughly similar calories to beef patties. Beyond Meat maintains its products are less caloric.

But nutritionists said Beyond Meat burgers are high in fiber and protein and can provide a better alternative to red meat. Beyond Meat can also lead to fewer instances of food poisoning than when consuming beef.

Bringing Beyond Meat and other ""better for you"" snack options to CVS locations might lessen the reliance on junk food in ""food deserts."" Better access to nutritional food would be most beneficial to Black and Latino Americans whose communities have fewer supermarkets than their white counterparts per Johns Hopkins.

""The expanded assortment of food items is the latest way we serve as a premier health and wellness destination making it easier for millions of customers to access healthier choices and meal solutions without having to make extra trips to specialty and grocery stores"" a CVS spokesperson said in a statement.

This story has been updated to add Beyond Meat's claim its burgers are less caloric than beef patties."

The announcement came a few hours after SpaceX's most international crew of astronauts yet arrived in Florida for a liftoff next week.

Elon Musk's Starship — the futuristic shiny steel rocketship that's been launching and exploding in Texas — beat out landers proposed by Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Dynetics a subsidiary of Leidos. The contract is worth $2.89 billion.

“We won't stop at the moon” said NASA's acting administrator Steve Jurczyk. Mars is the ultimate goal he told reporters.

NASA declined to provide a target launch date for the moon-landing Artemis mission saying a review is underway. The Trump administration had set a 2024 deadline but on Friday NASA officials called it a goal.

“We'll do it when it's safe"" said Kathy Lueders who leads NASA's human space exploration office.

She indicated NASA and SpaceX are shooting for later this decade. The astronauts will fly to the moon on the NASA-launched Orion capsule then transfer to Starship in lunar orbit for the ride down to the surface and back.

NASA has said at least one of the first moonwalkers since 1972 would be the first woman on the moon. Another goal of the program according to the space agency is to send a person of colour to the lunar surface.

On Friday Jurczyk greeted the four astronauts arriving at Kennedy Space Center for SpaceX's third crew launch in less than a year. By coincidence their flight to the International Space Station is set for next Thursday — Earth Day. It's a reminder of NASA's core mission of studying the home planet Jurczyk said.

The three men and one woman represent the US France and Japan: NASA's Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur Thomas Pesquet and Akihiko Hoshide all experienced space fliers.

“It's definitely getting real” Kimbrough the spacecraft commander said after arriving by plane from Houston.

This will be SpaceX's first crew flight to use a recycled Falcon rocket and Dragon crew capsule. NASA turned to US private companies for crew transport after the space shuttle programme ended in 2011.

“Certainly I think all of them until we get several years under our belt should be considered test flights” Kimbrough told reporters.

SpaceX uses the same kind of rocket and similar capsules for supply deliveries and recycles those as well.

McArthur is the only member of the crew who has yet to visit the space station. She flew the shuttle to the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009. And launching out of Kennedy is new to Pesquet after more than 11 years as an astronaut.

“We're living in the golden age of human spaceflight” said Pesquet a former Air France pilot. “Looks like everybody every country has a project or a spacecraft.”

The astronauts left the runway in a pair of white gull-winged Teslas; SpaceX founder Musk also runs the electric car company. They had an early bedtime to sync up with what will be pretty much an all-nighter Thursday. Liftoff time is 6:11 am.

The four will replace the SpaceX crew that launched last November. Those four will return to Earth at the end of April. A fresh three-person Soyuz crew meanwhile arrived at the space station last week from Kazakhstan replacing two Russians and one American due back on Earth this weekend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vamVyc2V5ZXZlbmluZ3Bvc3QuY29tL21vcmVuZXdzL3dvcmxkbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA0LzE3L3NwYWNleC13aW5zLWJpZC1mb3ItbHVuYXItbGFuZGVyLXRvLXB1dC1maXJzdC13b21hbi1vbi1tb29uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SpaceX wins bid for lunar lander to put first woman on moon,"Nasa has chosen SpaceX to build the lunar lander that will eventually put the first woman and person of colour on the moon.

For the first nine years of her life Lisa Marie Presley spent much of the time living with her father Elvis Presley at Graceland. The King left the Memphis mansion to his daughter and in 1982 the home was opened to the public for tours. Even though Graceland remains an incredibly popular tourist attraction to this day it’s still very much home for Lisa Marie.

During a recent virtual live tour of Graceland which Express.co.uk attended archivist Angie Marchese shared details of what Lisa Marie and her family get up to when they visit plus the changes made inside for their arrival. The Elvis Presley expert said: “The family…do not stay here at Graceland but they do come here and visit. “They don’t use Elvis and Priscilla’s china we do have new china which we’ve purchased for Lisa to use when she’s here.” Angie also explained how two extra tables are set up next to the one in Graceland’s dining room for when the family have meals together there.

And inside the chest of drawers there Angie revealed the storage place for the china that Lisa Marie and her family use when they visit the mansion for meals. While back in Graceland’s kitchen the archivist was showing off the oven when she explained another change made for the arrival of Elvis’ daughter.

Fans who have taken the walkthrough tour of the mansion will know there’s plexiglass over the kitchen’s oven to stop people from reaching over and touching or even taking the irreplaceable knobs. Angie shared: “We do take the plexiglass off whenever Lisa’s here because all of this still works. “And when Lisa’s here and has dinner here at the house we flip the switch and turn all of this on. “So for safety precautions all of this is turned off right now so there’s no fire hazard.” DON'T MISS

Later on during the virtual live tour Angie guided the camera outside The Jungle Room to the porch. Here she revealed how Elvis’ grandmother Minnie Mae Presley liked to sit there while Lisa Marie uses it to relax to this day. It’s not surprising considering how quiet and peaceful that outdoor space is overlooking Graceland’s horses. After the tour ended a fan asked Angie: “When Priscilla and Lisa Marie visit Graceland do they listen to records on the jukebox in the TV room and do any of the family members play either the piano in the Music Room or the one in the Racquetball court? And do they ever swim in the pool?”

The rapper shared in 2011 some of his 'Romeo Must Die' co-star's characteristics.

Aaliyah and DMX became celebrities around the same time. The “One In A Million” singer was a global music star and actor before she died from a plane crash in 2001. Twenty years later Dark Man X born Earl Simmons passed away at age 50 on April 9 2021. Before his death the Grammy-nominated rapper spoke about Aaliyah’s personality.

DMX and Aaliyah’s song came out in 2000

During the late 1990s DMX and Aaliyah were at the top of their game. Both artists received mainstream success with hits such as “Party Up (Up In Here)” and “Back & Forth” respectively. The performers also discovered a knack for acting at the height of their careers. DMX made his acting debut in the film Belly. Two years later Aaliyah booked her first role in the action movie Romeo Must Die.

Before production began on Romeo Must Die the “4 Page Letter” songstress approached DMX about acting in the film. Impressed by her willingness to meet him in person the rapper accepted a supporting character role. However due to their fame the artists collaborated on a song for the movie’s soundtrack. Their song “Come Back in One Piece” debuted in 2000. In 2011 DMX spoke to The Juice about taking Aaliyah to his hometown of Yonkers New York to shoot the video per Billboard.

“We did the video in Mount Vernon and Yonkers” DMX recalled. I got to bring Aaliyah to the hood. Not many people can say that.”

What DMX thought was ‘sexy but kind of gangster’ about Aaliyah

Shortly after Romeo Must Die DMX and Aaliyah worked on other projects. However the rapper often discussed their close relationship in interviews. In 2001 Aaliyah died while traveling home from shooting a music video in the Bahamas. The singer was 22.

Although Aaliyah was notoriously aloof in public her calmness attracted many of her fans including DMX. In his interview with The Juice the rapper said that Aaliyah’s real-life persona and TV presence was something he found to be “sexy.”

“She had a presence on TV that was incredible” DMX said. “It was sexy but kind of gangster.”

“She was easy to talk to and down to earth” he continued. “Aaliyah made you feel comfortable with her and with yourself. That’s one hell of a combination.”

The rapper once said no artist compares to Aaliyah

Since Aaliyah died many artists such as Beyoncé and Ciara have drawn comparisons to the “Rock the Boat” singer. However DMX shared that he doesn’t see any artists who could compete with Aaliyah thus far. Before he died the “Where the Hood At” rapper declared that his friend was one of the best performers in the music industry.

Michael Jackson was renowned for his charity work. The pop star loved children and spent a lot of time and money in making sure that kids with less fortunate backgrounds could be happy. On top of working for charities and donating money he also donated parts of his home to kids in need as well as sick children. On several occasions the King of Pop opened the doors to his remarkable estate Neverland for them to visit.

During these visits Michael would allow his guests to take turns on the amusement park rides that were on his property. On top of being allowed to go on the Ferris wheel and roller coasters the singer also let them visit his zoo. Michael had an animal settlement full of wildlife including giraffes elephants and monkeys.

Physical or data systems modifications to the aircraft are essentially not allowed. But there are exceptions.

Here's What You Need to Remember: Israel has essentially been allowed to create an “app” that operates on top of Lockheed’s C4 information architecture. This “app” will use data gathered by the F-35 to network with the other “nodes” in their information-gathering network — Israeli F-15s and F-16s that operate on in tandem with Israeli C4 architecture.

Israel secured a number of contractual rights from Lockheed-Martin that make their F-35I variants optimized for conflicts in the Middle East — and potentially the most capable F-35 variant in the world.

Domestic Repair and Maintenance

The F-35 Lightning II program is tightly owned by Lockheed. Physical or data systems modifications to the aircraft are essentially not allowed. Any maintenance other than the routine is to be done at specialized Lockheed facilities to protect the airframe’s design from prying eyes.

But not for Israel.

Israel’s Nevatim Air Base hosts F-35 maintenance facilities that have the necessary repair tooling and the properly trained personnel to conduct not only routine maintenance but beyond-routine overhauls as well. Other F-35 partner countries are contractually required to have any deep maintenance done at Lockheed facilities. While this is more lucrative for Lockheed it would also keep F-35 know-how under wraps and could help to keep technical details about the F-35 program a secret.

Israel’s unique geopolitical situation in the Middle East necessitates a rapid domestic-repair capability. In the event of a regional conflict Israel could require rapid on-site repairs to keep their F-35I fleet in the air. Although the requisite technician training tooling installation won’t happen overnight Israel is the only F-35 partner country with a domestically operated maintenance regime.

Israeli C4 Systems

One of the F-35’s greatest strengths is its ability to gather real-time battlefield information and use this information to update battlespace knowledge also known as command control communications and computing (C4) architecture which is state of the art. Israel has essentially been allowed to create an “app” that operates on top of Lockheed’s C4 information architecture. This “app” will use data gathered by the F-35 to network with the other “nodes” in their information-gathering network — Israeli F-15s and F-16s that operate on in tandem with Israeli C4 architecture.

Electronic Warfare

All F-35s are equipped with BAE Systems’ AN/ASQ-239 EW suite which offers “offensive and defensive options for the pilot and aircraft to counter current and emerging threats” designed to “optimize situational awareness while helping to identify monitor analyze and respond to threats.” Essentially BAE’s EW system allows the F-35 to stop enemy radar and beat opposing aircraft and their missile threats.

Lockheed has allowed Israel to modify the standard BAE EW suit with their own Israeli-made system presumably a kind of attachable pod which could be tailored to counter regional capabilities.

Support of Israeli Weapons

One of the weapons systems Israel uses with the F-35 platform is their Spice family of guidance kits. The Spice kit is essentially a guidance kit that can be equipped to a variety of munitions to improve their accuracy through electro-optics GPS or through a “man-in-the-loop” system in which an onboard Weapons Officer can guide bombs to a target using the bomb’s nose camera and a secure television link for very high accuracy.

Conformal Fuel Tanks

Typically aircraft can increase their range thorough inflight refueling — which the F-35 is capable of — with drop tanks which are attached to hardpoints under the wings or fuselage of an aircraft or by installing conformal fuel tanks which are contoured tanks that usually hug the fuselage or wing roots of a plane.

Drop tanks negatively impact an airframe’s stealth characteristic because they are optimized for internal volume and not for defeating radar although they can be jettisoned when empty. Conformal fuel tanks however can be more “stealthy” than drop tanks. If carefully contoured Israel could in theory installed fuel tanks that not only increase the F-35’s range but also only marginally affect the Lightning II’s stealth characteristics.

Once fully implemented Israel’s F-35Is will be among the deadliest in the world.

With Sikorsky pilots Christiaan Corry and Bill Fell at the controls the Raider carried out low-level maneuvers and high-speed runs on April 13 and 15 2021.

Sikorsky's candidate for the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program under the US Army's Future Vertical Lift (FVL) initiative the S-97 Raider is a compound helicopter based on the company's X2 technology demonstrator. It uses variable speed rigid coaxial main rotors that can tilt independently of one another and a variable-pitch pusher propeller for improved horizontal speed hovering and low-speed maneuverability. It also uses a fly-by-wire system and dynamic anti-vibration actuators to reduce shaking.

In terms of specifications the Raider can carry a crew of two in a side-by-side configuration along with up to six passengers. Powered by the same General Electric YT706 turboshaft engine used in the MH-60M Black Hawk helicopter it can put out 2600 bhp (1900 kW) giving it a cruising speed of 250 mph (410 km/h 220 knots) and a range of 350 miles (570 km) with external weapons load. The standard armament will be a .50 caliber machine gun and seven-round rocket pods.

Future Vertical Lift aircraft like Sikorsky’s Raider are designed to provide US Army commanders with information to self-diagnose maintenance Lockheed Martin/Sikorsky

The Raider is also designed to provide commanders with a flow of maintenance data and self-diagnosis that working with Sikorsky's Fleet Decision Tool allows the helicopter to provide solid information as to how many of the aircraft will be available for missions at any one time.

""Flying Raider continues to amaze me"" says Corry a former US Marine. ""The combination of the coaxial rotors and the propulsor is really the enablers for this transformational technology. As we demonstrated today in low-speed flight we are as capable as a conventional helicopter but when we engage the prop we are able to operate in a whole new way – it's much more like flying an airplane.""

More from a press release issued by Dorna:

Lowes denies Gardner by just 0.023 as the duel rolls on

The Brit remains undefeated on Saturday. But will the same be true on Sunday? Gardner is homing in…

Sam Lowes (Elf Marc VDS Racing Team) has made it three from three in 2021 as the Championship leader took pole once more for the Grande Premio 888 de Portugal. It was close though with Remy Gardner (Red Bull KTM Ajo) just 0.023 off as the 2020 winner at the track remains the man closest on the chase. Xavi Vierge (Petronas Sprinta Racing) went from Q1 to P3 as he completes the front row.

In Q1 Somkiat Chantra (Idemitsu Honda Team Asia) came out on top the Thai rider moving through along with Albert Arenas (Solunion Aspar Team) Cameron Beaubier (American Racing) and Xavi Vierge. Jorge Navarro (Lightech Speed Up) crashed as did Lorenzo Baldassarri (MV Agusta Forward Racing) riders ok but the former especially losing out as he didn’t set a time. Nevertheless the clock rolled on and Q2 began.

Lowes was the early leader in Q2 as the first laps of the second part of qualifying were fired in but Gardner soon took after after setting a 1:43.032. However the fight between Gardner and Lowes had already begun. The British rider was back on top by 0.114s after two flying laps but the number 22 had a hairy moment heading into the tight Turn 5 left-hander on his third flyer. Responding Gardner improved his lap time to lie just 0.006s behind Lowes.

Q1 graduate Vierge was in P3 already having shown some impressive pace in the early stages of Q2 and the Spaniard was ahead of two rookies in the form of Ai Ogura (Idemitsu Honda Team Asia) and Albert Arenas. The reigning Moto3™ World Champion was shuffled down to P7 rather rapidly though as Marco Bezzecchi (Sky Racing Team VR46) and Augusto Fernandez (Elf Marc VDS Racing Team) moved to P5 and P6 respectively.

Another great lap from Lowes came in next and his advantage over Gardner grew to 0.023s – not a lot – but the Brit was then down at Turn 11 ending his session a little early. No one could better him regardless although Gardner runs him closest in P2 once again and the top two in the title fight so far line up side by side. Vierge joins them on the front row.

Ogura takes fourth and that’s the Japanese rookie’s best Moto2™ qualifying performance just 0.220s down on Lowes and showing his Doha GP speed was no flash in the pan. Bezzecchi and Augusto Fernandez join Ogura on Row 2 which is Augusto Fernandez’s best Saturday result of the year. Arenas is another rookie to bag his best Moto2™ qualifying in P7 the Spaniard beating one of the pre-qualifying favourites in Joe Roberts (Italtrans Racing Team) by just 0.010s. The American is P8 on the grid just ahead of Aron Canet (Solunion Aspar Team) and a seemingly disappointed 10th fastest Raul Fernandez (Red Bull KTM Ajo). The rookie sensation who won in Moto3™ at the track last year in some style will be hoping to shoot through to the podium fight on Sunday.

Chantra Hector Garzo (Flexbox HP 40) Cameron Beaubier (American Racing) Jake Dixon (Petronas Sprinta Racing) and Nicolo Bulega (Federal Oil Gresini Moto2) complete the fastest 15 in Q2.

It’s three from three for Lowes on a Saturday this year but will it be a hat-trick of wins on Sunday? And a Lowes vs Gardner shootout for victory again? Find out when the Moto2™ riders go racing in Portimão at 14:30 local time (GMT+1) on Sunday afternoon.

Sam Lowes: “It was a bit different from this morning yesterday I think the grip was down in general the laptimes were not so fast. Today was more similar to last year laptimes were similar. This afternoon maybe a bit of temperature and a bit of wind and the laptimes were a bit slower but I felt good. We improved the bike a lo over the weekend. It was the first time with a new tyre and low fuel in qualifying the bike was feeling good and we could make a good rhythm. I’m happy with the work we’ve done and I’m looking forward to the race.”

Lowes powers to pole position in Portugal

Elf Marc VDS Racing Team riders Sam Lowes and Augusto Fernandez showed they have podium potential in tomorrow’s 23-lap Portuguese Grand Prix after both qualified inside the top six for the first European race of 2021.

Lowes maintained his perfect pole position record in 2021 by powering to top spot for the third successive race in Q2 with Fernandez also excelling in the 15-minute session to claim a place on the second row.

The Moto2 race will conclude the action at the Algarve International Circuit tomorrow and is scheduled to follow the MotoGP clash at 14:30pm local time.

Augusto Fernandez

6th 1’43.259

The Spaniard went into this afternoon’s crucial Q2 session with confidence high after a brilliant last lap of 1’43.239 in FP3 was only 0.3s away from the top three with Fernandez making huge progress in finding more front-end feel this morning.

With track temperatures almost 10 degrees hotter for Q2 Fernandez produced another impressive flying lap in the 1.43.2 bracket to claim a place on the second row with a richly deserved sixth his best grid position in 11 races since the Styrian Grand Prix in Austria.

“Starting from the second row is very positive”

“It was a good Q2 session and we have to be happy to be on the second row of the grid. We made a very big step with the bike compared to yesterday and I was much happier with how the front-end was working. It wasn’t easy to improve in Q2 because there was quite a lot of wind but I still managed to make a good lap and starting from the second row is very positive. We can still improve in some areas to help me feel comfortable at setting consistent lap times. The good thing is we have the pace but I’d like to feel like the times are coming a little bit easier. If we make another step in the Warm-up I’m sure we can have a strong race.”

Sam Lowes

1st 1’42.901

A lap of 1’42.939 was the fourth quickest of FP3 and ensured Briton Lowes eased into Q2 where he produced yet another masterful display to secure his third pole in three races and 14th of his Moto2 career.

A small improvement to a 1’42.901 despite a late crash at turn 11 means Lowes remains firmly on course to be the first rider in 20 years to win the opening three intermediate category World Championship races since Daijiro Kato did in the 250cc class back in 2001.

“I’m confident we can keep this great start to the season going”

“I’m really happy with this pole position because this weekend has been more difficult than the first two races in Qatar and we’ve had to work hard for this result. I’ve got to say a big thanks to the team because we have worked hard to be well prepared for the race by doing a lot of laps with a full fuel tank on worn tyres. But then we went out in Q2 with low fuel and new tyres and the feeling was incredible so in all circumstances the team have given me a great package. Our race pace is good and I’m expecting a hard battle but I’m confident we can keep this great start to the season going.”

Joe Roberts and Lorenzo Dalla Porta to start Portuguese Grand Prix from the 3rd and 7th row.

The MotoGP World Championship is back to Europe for the third round of the season with the Portuguese Grand Prix.

After the double race in Qatar with ups and downs Italtrans Racing Team arrives to the Autodromo Internacional do Algarve Portugal ready to make the most of the work done here during the private tests last March with the aim of confirming among the top teams in Moto2.

After the best lap time in FP1 and FP2 and the second fastest time in FP3 Joe Roberts went straight to Q2 finishing 8th in 1’43”314 just four tenths from Lowes’ pole. An important starting point which will allow the American rider to race in the top positions fighting for the top five.

Tough weekend for Lorenzo Dalla Porta: he didn’t make it thru Q1 but he improved his times. With a best lap of 1’43”778 he will start 21st on the grid with the aim of finishing in the points.

Lorenzo Dalla Porta

21° | 1’43”778

“Yesterday I struggled to keep up the pace and the gap to the other riders was a lot. Today we improved but not enough. Tomorrow’s goal is to finish in the points. We have the right skills to do that and it will be important to push from the start”.

Joe Roberts

8° | 1’43”314

“I didn’t finish exactly where I predicted to be but we are really positive for the race. The pace is good and I’m feeling really strong. I’ll give my best for a good start fighting in the front”.

Giovanni Sandi Technical Director

“We are not completely satisfied with the result because in the free practices we were very fast while in qualifying we slowed down. Both riders were under pressure when the conditions changed and the wind was against. Anyway the pace is good and we can ride a good race: Joe can fight for the top five while Lorenzo for the points”.

Beaubier Ramirez show speed in qualifying for Portuguese Grand Prix

American Racing teammates will start Sunday’s Moto2 race midfield

PORTIMAO Portugal (April 17 2021) — American Racing is back to nearly full strength for the Grand Prix of Portugal Round 3 of the FIM Moto2 World Championship.

At the Autódromo Internacional do Algarve known for its challenging elevation changes and blind corner entries Cameron Beaubier and Marcos Ramirez delivered their best qualifying performances of the season.

In Free Practice 3 Ramirez posted the fifth-quickest lap of the session 1:42.997 transferring directly to Qualifying 2. The 23-year-old Spaniard missed the opening two rounds of the series at the Losail International Circuit in Qatar with a shoulder injury.

Five-time MotoAmerica Superbike Champion Beaubier cut more than a second from his best lap time on Friday. He was third in Q1 advancing to Q2. The 28-year-old American will start Sunday’s 23-lap race from 13th on the grid.

“I felt pretty good in qualifying today with a couple changes that we made” said Beaubier. “I am happy because I know I could have been faster if I cleaned up some stuff. I definitely need to improve the last split.”

Ramirez 11th in November’s Moto2 race at Portimão could not replicate his performance from the morning session and will start 17th.

American Racing Team Owner Eitan Butbul had mixed feelings about qualifying at the 2.85-mile circuit with its nine right-hand turns and six lefts.

“Cameron started in Q1 but he performed very well and managed to get into Q2” said Butbul. “We were sure he would be able to get into the top 10 but he got caught in traffic all session and couldn’t made the perfect lap. Still we are happy. We see his progress and his lap times are consistent.

“On Marcos’ side we started the weekend with minimum expectation due to his injury but he showed that he is strong and managed to finish fifth in FP3. We are a bit disappointed that he couldn’t qualify in the top 10 but he as well couldn’t find the perfect lap and ended up 17th.”

For the third consecutive race weekend Marc VDS rider Sam Lowes earned pole position. Lowes won the first two races and is the championship points leader.

“The race tomorrow will tough” said Butbul “but I know both riders are fighters and will push hard.”

So when TikTok user @emilyelizabeth315 posted a video of herself modeling a pair of $20 biker shorts that she — along with many-a-commenter — swears are just like Lululemon's Align style you can imagine what happened: Virality of course.

The video quickly garnered more than 250000 views 15000 likes and countless comments begging to know where exactly these miracle shorts can be found. If you're aware of TikTok's affinity for all things Amazon you shouldn't be surprised to know that this Lululmeon dupe is from the site.

The Heathyoga bottoms come in 12 different styles including 5- and 8-inch inseam options in a variety of colors. Made from a mixture of polyester and spandex the stretchy shorts contour the body thanks to a high-waisted fit and a tummy control panel that smooths the area while highlighting curves. Nearly 4500 shoppers left the biker shorts a perfect rating with many citing these flattering features in their reviews.

""They fit like a glove"" one wrote. ""Just enough compression to make you feel secure in all the right places but not too tight anywhere. I was particularly nervous about the waistband because I often have issues with them as my stomach is pretty sensitive to pressure from them. The material is so soft and it's not flimsy at all.""

Designed for working out the shorts are ""squat-proof"" sweat-wicking and ""don't ride up or create chafing"" according to customers. As comfortable as they are you'll be wearing them outside of the gym too.

They're a no-nonsense WFH go-to that can keep your bottom half cozy while your top half is in business attire for Zoom meetings. Or if you've got errands to run and want to look chic yet casual throw on an oversized hoodie of the same color scheme. The minimalist athleisure look will probably have you getting confused for a Kardashian while shopping for veggies.

No matter how you style them you can take solace knowing that you can snag two pairs for the price you'd pay for one at more expensive retailers. ""I'm just convinced that there's never a need to buy Lululemon ever again"" wrote one TikTok commenter.

Ron Novak and Michelle Bush spent more than two months across three trips to Dallas to hunt for the lamp hidden by the company Treasure Games which launched the contest in January according to WWPL.

It was the company’s first-ever competition offering the winner the choice of $1 million cash or three wishes worth $1.2 million Dirk Gibson the founder of Treasure Games told the outlet.

On their third trip to Dallas they decided to stay an extra day longer than planned because they felt close to finding the life-changing treasure.

The couple said they realized the vital clue was related to an episode of “Seinfeld.”

Fortunately for them that decision paid off.

“The initial moment I was in shock” Novak told the outlet.

The exact clue from the hit sitcom that led to the lamp’s discovery wasn’t revealed.

However the couple did share that they chose to accept the three wishes worth $1.2 million after finding the lamp.

But instead of spending the first wish on themselves they opted to donate money to a charity Hare Krishna Food for Life Group which helped Novak when he was homeless.

“For me it was the biggest gift to be able to give them money for this because I used to be a taker. I just took and I needed help and wanted help” Novak said.

For their second wish the couple bought the Southwest Motel in their native New Mexico to fix up.

For their third and final wish they asked for a Sprinter van big enough to fit their four dogs.

“We bought the van for the dogs. That’s an internal joke” Bush told WWLP.

The couple was so thrilled by their treasure-hunting experience that they plan to launch one of their own for others to enjoy.

“It will be a lot easier than this one — meant to be solved within a weekend or a week” Bush told the outlet.

“It will start at $5000 at least” said Novak.

As for the company Treasure Games they revealed their second Wish Lamp hunt worth a $1 million prize kicks off in June.

The competition is open to anyone willing to sign up for a subscription fee to the particular game in season — which varies in price depending on the value of the prize according to the Treasure Games website.

After the dull opening of Universal’s Fall Guy Jesus God Saint Mary and Joseph let’s hope those projections stay steady. Apes plans to pull in the under 35 guy demo in a way that Fall Guy did not. Presales stateside of around $3.1M in line with what was the 3-day of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning ($54.6M) indicate a $50M-plus debut. That start in U.S./Canada isn’t far from the $56.2M opening of Matt Reeves’ 2017 movie War of the Planet of the Apes and that would be considered solid. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ has the advantage that it’s opening at a time with less competition than War of the Planet of the Apes. This sequel which takes 300 years after the events of War of the Planet of the Apes is directed by Maze Runner filmmaker Wes Ball. No Rotten Tomatoes reviews yet.

The last three Planet of the Apes movies at 20th Century Fox the latter two directed by Reeves all received A- CinemaScore’s. The Tim Burton directed Mark Wahlberg starring 2001 version landed a B- grade.

The $165M production is booked at 3700-plus theaters boosted by a two-week Imax run and PLFs. The PG-13 movie has advance screenings in Imax and PLFs Wednesday at 7PM and on Thursday starting 3PM.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is rolling out in 100% of its offshore footprint this week beginning Wednesday in France Italy Germany and Korea. Majors joining on Thursday include the UK Brazil Australia and Mexico. China Spain and Japan follow on Friday.

Current projections for the frame are at $80M+ internationally. Broken out that’s $70M from overseas excluding China. That market is increasingly hard to call and is also coming out of a very prosperous five-day May Day holiday stretch which saw three local films excel. What happens with Kingdom will depend on how those hold up — note also that Saturday is a working day. China at this point should be $10M+.

Looking at comps and at today’s exchange rates 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes bowed to $62M internationally ($8M was from China). In 2014 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes did $127M ($37M in China) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes came in at a $130M launch ($56M from China).

The other advantage to those movies were that they had 3D whereas the Ball version does not.

Overall the latest rendition of the franchise tends to perform best in a mix of the mature European majors Mexico Brazil Australia and Korea. While we do expect Kingdom to land several No. 1 openings it is likely in some cases to be topped by the continued play of a strong local title (think Korea for example).

Overseas promotion included a launch event at the BFI IMAX in London on April 25 with Ball Freya Allan Owen Teague and Kevin Durand in attendance. Andy Serkis who memorably played Caesar in the first three films of the recent franchise was also out lending his support to this one.

The recent trilogy of Planet of the Apes movies from 2011-2017 grossed $1.68 billion at the global box office. The first movie based on Pierre Boulle’s novel launched in 1968 and grossed over $32M stateside unadjusted for inflation. Several sequels were spawned in the 1970s. Burton’s reboot only made $362M-plus at the global box office and did not trigger any sequels. All in The Planet of the Apes franchise has minted over $2.1 billion worldwide.

Briarcliff Entertainment has Not Another Church Movie in 1100 theaters this weekend stateside. Pic stars Jamie Foxx as God Mickey Rourke as the devil and Kevin Daniels.

Several Jewish students were outraged by the messages about genocide and freeing Palestine. Did this mean freeing the region from Jews? The expressions “Globalize the Intifada” “Glory to the Martyrs” and “Terror is justified as long as Palestine is occupied” indicated toleration if not support of Hamas an organization that justifies raping women and killing babies as long as you call them Jewish settlers. A few students showed up with an Israeli flag and were shamed on social media. Their counterprotest didn’t result in productive conversation alas. But it didn’t spill into violence either and my team did its best to make sure that was the case.

I’ve checked in with many Jewish students individually and sat down with a group to talk about their fears—and their complaints about faculty bias. Amazingly to them and to me a few professors took votes in their classes to decide whether they should hold class in the encampment. Minority rights? Not something these faculty seemed concerned with at least not until the provost reminded them that they could not force any student to support a cause with which the professor happened to agree. Of course faculty are free to support any cause they like but whatever political acumen they believe themselves to possess they are not free to impose this on their students. The Jewish students opposed to the protesters seemed glad to be able to talk openly about their concerns. I emphasized to them that I could not protect them from opposing views but that I could protect their safety and capacity to pursue their education.

There was some graffiti vandalism after the encampment settled in and we let people know that if that continued the university would have to step in. Fortunately that didn’t continue and so far almost all the protesters seem eager to find a constructive path: to make their arguments about divestment and about boycotts. They know that I have long been on record opposing these arguments but I will try to listen to them with an open mind. Ultimately it is the Board of Trustees that will decide about investment policy. Myself I am eager to find ways of supporting Gazan relief efforts and of doing whatever we can to promote a sustainable peace in the region that would acknowledge the rights of all parties. I’d like to think students know that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzaW5kdXN0cnkuYml6L2FjdGl2aXNpb24tdG8tcGF5LTIzNG0tZm9yLXBhdGVudC1pbmZyaW5nZW1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Activision to pay $23.4m for patent infringement,"A jury has ruled that Activision Blizzard will pay tech incubator Acceleration Bay $23.4 million for patent infringement.

As reported by Law.com the May 3 ruling comes after the incubator began its legal action back in 2015.

The case filed in the US District Court for the District of Delaware claims that patents for networking and broadcasting were used in Activision's multiplayer title.

The publisher owes Acceleration Bay $18 million in copyright infringement for World of Warcraft and $5.4 million for two Call of Duty titles.

Jurors were asked two questions to reach a verdict among them was ""Did Acceleration Bay prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Activision's products as identified below infringe one or more claims of the following asserted patents?""

In response to the question the jury was then asked after verdict to ""reasonably compensate Acceleration Bay for Activision's infringement of Acceleration Bay's asserted patents.""

While the case against Activision Blizzard has been decided in favor of the tech incubator it has also filed similar patent infringement suits against EA Take-Two and Amazon Web Services.

In response to the ruling Activision Blizzard said ""While we are disappointed we believe there is a strong basis for appeal. We have never used the patented technologies at issue in our games."

The morning of Wednesday February 18 2015 had started just like any other day for Summer Spencer. Back then she was a sixth grader at South High School in Torrance a coastal city in the South Bay region of Los Angeles County. But at around 9am Spencer and her classmates were given a ‘shelter in place’ order by their teacher. It was the now 17-year-old says pretty exciting at first. “I just figured I might not have to go to my next class.”

Summer’s teachers closed the doors secured the windows and pulled the drapes shut. It was only when she went home that day and spoke to her dad an environmental safety expert that she realized she her classmates and thousands of other Torrance residents had had a near miss with a chemical so deadly the Department of Homeland Security lists it as a substance of interest for terrorists.

“I told [my dad] all we did was shut the windows and he explained it wouldn’t have been enough to protect the students” she recalls.

Spencer’s dad explained if the chemical had been released “thousands of Torrance residents would have died”.

The threat came from the Torrance Refinery just three miles away from Summer’s school a 700-acre plot which processes around 155000 barrels of crude oil every day and uses hydrofluoric acid (HF) — or “modified hydrofluoric acid” (MHF) as refineries often refer to the substance — to make high octane gasoline. Around 400000 people live within three miles of the refineries.

On that Wednesday morning unbeknown to Summer pent up gases at the refinery back then owned by Exxon had triggered an explosion so big that it registered as a 1.7 tremor. A processing unit had burst open propelling a large piece of equipment into the air which narrowly avoided hitting a tank that contained more than 50000-pound of the deadly HF.

“It was a complete surprise. Nobody really knew the danger of the Torrance refinery” Spencer told Drilled.

Although the 48 US oil refineries that use MHF claim it is safer than HF both substances are deadly to humans. And in fact scientists say the two substances are virtually identical. When released both substances travel in a vapor cloud that can reach eight feet in height penetrating buildings and causing catastrophic eye bone deep tissue lung and nervous system damage. Essentially as Torrance-based scientist Dr. Sally Hayati put it the substance can liquify your organs.

Hayati was alerted to the chemical following the same explosion that piqued Summer’s interest. An engineer with a PhD who formerly had secret clearance for her job at the Aerospace Corporation Hayati has been investigating the use of HF and MHF in refineries for the past six years. “Now I know what I know I can’t just turn a blind eye” she said.

Hayati discovered that MHF is a proprietary substance — meaning its exact makeup is protected as a trade secret — and is nearly identical to HF. “By molecule count MHF is 99% the same as HF” Hayati says. “The refineries claim it’s safe. It’s not. It’s a fraud.”

Generally refineries add a chemical called sulfolane to HF to modify it. The sulfolane is supposed to stop MHF from spreading like a vapor if leaked but according to Hayati it wouldn’t. Refineries claim their MHF substance is different from HF insisting there is enough sulfolane added to make MHF safe to use. However as Hayati points out the two chemicals are 99% identical and like HF MHF disperses like a cloud if released which is what makes it so deadly.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) told Drilled if the concentration of HF in the MHF mixture is 50% or greater the agency would classify the chemical as HF.

The modified HF used in the Torrance and Wilmington refineries has around six to 10% of sulfolane added to reduce the chemical’s volatility which should prevent the HF from forming a vapor cloud when released. Essentially the sulfolane is intended to ground the HF keeping it in liquid form and therefore not a danger to the public. However this amount of sulfolane Hayati said is too little a percentage to prevent MHF from exhibiting the same vapor cloud behavior as HF exhibits on release. And there’s another wrinkle: Sulfolane can prevent alkylation units which are integral in the conversion process from crude oil to high quality gasoline from properly functioning. According to Hayati in 1997 the additive caused the MHF unit to malfunction and the Torrance refinery reverted back to using HF.

“The public was told the MHF unit was successful” Hayati says. “That was a lie. Quietly behind the scenes Mobil cut the safety additive and to cover themselves threw in some useless proprietary ‘safety measures’.” [In 2016 the refinery was purchased by PBF Energy.]

That information was revealed in the Consent Decree Safety Advisor’s 1999 report made after the city of Torrance sued Mobil following an explosion in 1987 that released around 100 pounds of hydrofluoric acid.

The US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board commissioned a report into the 2015 incident — which very nearly resulted in an MHF tanker being hit by an 80000-pound chunk of flying debris — but did not recommend the refinery switch to a safer alternative. However the board noted that ExxonMobil “resisted” requests for safety information pertaining to the potential release of HF.

“ExxonMobil continues to refuse to provide the CSB with information detailing safeguards to prevent or mitigate a release of HF” the report reads. The CSB has issued subpoenas for this information and is pursuing enforcement in US Federal district court.” The refinery was later fined $566600.

In 2019 federal judges ordered ExxonMobil to hand over HF documents however as of April 2021 that has still yet to happen.

That same year the CSB wrote to the EPA to say it “strongly encourages” the agency to conduct another study to “determine whether these refineries’ existing risk management plans are sufficient to prevent catastrophic releases.”

Two oil refineries in LA County use HF: the Wilmington refinery owned by Valero and the Torrance refinery. Both have fought proposals to ban HF primarily due to the cost involved in switching to a safer alternative — sulfuric acid — which independent experts estimate would be in the millions of dollars although the industry argues it would cost almost $1 billion. Alternative technologies that don’t carry the risks of either HF or sulfolane such as a solid acid catalyst have been slow to catch on although in a US-first Chevron has committed to retrofit its alkylation unit in its Salt Lake City refinery with ionic liquids technology.

Hayati founded TRAA — Torrance Refinery Action Alliance — to argue for a ban of HF and MHF.

South Bay supervisor Janice Hahn is one of the few local officials who has spoken out against the use of HF. “We’re talking about a deadly flesh-eating vapor cloud that could affect 1 million people” Hahn said.

In April 2019 the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health concluded that MHF should be phased out of the two refineries as the current healthcare structure is inadequately equipped to respond to the atrocities that would result in the event of a chemical release. However later that year the South Coast Air Quality Management District killed the push for stronger regulation instead opting for safeguards that were suggested by the oil refineries themselves saying “now is not the time” to phase out the deadly acid.

Drilled spoke to the SCAQMD which confirmed the board had accepted Valero and Torrance’s voluntary efforts to install safety enhancements.

The Torrance community is supposed to be alerted to an MHF release by a siren — Wilmington does not have one — that is tested every Wednesday. The SCAQMD added the alarm system was “outside the scope of commitments” in the safety enhancement offers made by the refineries. Numerous Torrance residents that spoke to Drilled did not know what the siren meant and had never heard it before.

In response to the public being unaware of the meaning of the alarms the spokesperson for the SCAQMD said it had held numerous public meetings concerning HF.

“The South Coast AQMD Governing Board expressed concerns about viable alternatives” the spokesperson added. “Implementation of the Proffers ensures expeditious safety enhancements instead of requiring a phase out of MHF at this time.”

Refineries elsewhere in the US have experienced HF leaks; in 1987 an HF cloud covered Texas City prompting the evacuation of 3000 people across 50 city blocks and sending 800 to hospital. In 2018 27000 people in Wisconsin were evacuated following a refinery fire as there were fears the HF tank would blow up. In 2019 Philadelphia dodged a catastrophe after more than 5000 pounds of the chemical was released following an explosion. The CSB again released a sobering statement.

“The board remains concerned that the next time there is a major explosion at a refinery that uses HF for alkylation workers and those living nearby will not be so lucky” CSB’s interim executive Kristen Kulinowski said at the time. Philadelphia is now considering a ban on the use of HF in refineries.

In 1986 Dr. Ronald Koopman a scientist working at government-owned Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory conducted an experiment in the desert. He wanted to show how deadly HF could be and filmed the results. Video footage shows 8300 pounds of HF released within just two minutes with all of the acid forming a dense ground-hugging cloud. Even two miles downwind of the release site the HF cloud still contained more than twice the chemicals needed to kill a person. By contrast the combined amount of HF held at Torrance and Valero refineries is 829000 pounds.

“There haven’t been any fatalities yet. But it’s only a matter of time” Hayati warned. The location of these refineries in earthquake-prone Los Angeles County only adds to the risk. The refineries sit atop the San Andreas fault. “It should be criminally insane…it should be absolutely forbidden to have something so inherently dangerous in an earthquake zone” Hayati said.

A spokesperson for the Torrance refinery told Drilled the plant has been using the “HF/MHF catalyst” for more than 50 years without ever having an offsite release. The spokesperson noted that HF is used to make refrigerators and other consumer products. They added that alternative alkylation options “have not yet been proven to be safe…or inherently safer than MHF”.

“Therefore” the spokesperson continued “MHF remains the safe proven and superior alkylation technology.”

Summer Spencer’s experience on that Wednesday morning back in 2015 remained with her for years.

“In hindsight I would definitely have been scared. Being so young I didn’t comprehend the scale of the danger. I felt other people should know” she said.

When the opportunity came up with the Girl Scouts to complete a project for her gold award Spencer knew exactly what she was going to do.

She jumped into action and began researching how to protect her school from an HF release. She came up with a plan to put up plastic sheeting and duct tape in the classrooms — which CDC guidelines suggest. “We actually found that that doesn’t protect fully either you actually have to have full face respirators as well” Spencer added.

Nevertheless Spencer’s project caught the attention of the Torrance school district which has since asked the teenager to extend her plan for every school in the district.

“They asked me to write an adaptable protocol for all Torrance schools — around 21 in total. They felt it wasn’t fair to do it for one school and not the rest of them.”

Spencer is now responsible for creating a safety protocol to protect thousands of children and she is well aware of the pressure.

“I was a little intimidated at first. I never imagined I would be creating an adaptable protocol myself.

Meanwhile there’s very little happening to regulate HF or MHF nationally. An EPA spokesperson told Drilled by email: “EPA is aware of the concerns raised by various stakeholders regarding the dangers of hydrofluoric acid and the recent history of accidents and near-misses involving hydrofluoric acid alkylation units at refineries. EPA will closely review information regarding these incidents when considering potential regulatory changes.”

In the meantime the millions of Americans living in the shadow of a potential vapor bomb will continue to rely on refineries to self-regulate an ineffectual emergency alarm too quiet for anybody to hear high schoolers to design safety protocols and community activists to push for better.

However later that year the South Coast Air Quality Management District killed the push for stronger regulation instead opting for safeguards that were suggested by the oil refineries themselves saying “now is not the time” to phase out the deadly acid.

Drilled spoke to the SCAQMD which confirmed the board had accepted Valero and Torrance’s voluntary efforts to install safety enhancements.

The Torrance community is supposed to be alerted to an MHF release by a siren — Wilmington does not have one — that is tested every Wednesday. The SCAQMD added the alarm system was “outside the scope of commitments” in the safety enhancement offers made by the refineries. Numerous Torrance residents that spoke to Drilled did not know what the siren meant and had never heard it before.

In response to the public being unaware of the meaning of the alarms the spokesperson for the SCAQMD said it had held numerous public meetings concerning HF.

“The South Coast AQMD Governing Board expressed concerns about viable alternatives” the spokesperson added. “Implementation of the Proffers ensures expeditious safety enhancements instead of requiring a phase out of MHF at this time.”

Refineries elsewhere in the US have experienced HF leaks; in 1987 an HF cloud covered Texas City prompting the evacuation of 3000 people across 50 city blocks and sending 800 to hospital. In 2018 27000 people in Wisconsin were evacuated following a refinery fire as there were fears the HF tank would blow up. In 2019 Philadelphia dodged a catastrophe after more than 5000 pounds of the chemical was released following an explosion. The CSB again released a sobering statement.

“The board remains concerned that the next time there is a major explosion at a refinery that uses HF for alkylation workers and those living nearby will not be so lucky” CSB’s interim executive Kristen Kulinowski said at the time. Philadelphia is now considering a ban on the use of HF in refineries.

In 1986 Dr. Ronald Koopman a scientist working at government-owned Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory conducted an experiment in the desert. He wanted to show how deadly HF could be and filmed the results. Video footage shows 8300 pounds of HF released within just two minutes with all of the acid forming a dense ground-hugging cloud. Even two miles downwind of the release site the HF cloud still contained more than twice the chemicals needed to kill a person. By contrast the combined amount of HF held at Torrance and Valero refineries is 829000 pounds.

“There haven’t been any fatalities yet. But it’s only a matter of time” Hayati warned. The location of these refineries in earthquake-prone Los Angeles County only adds to the risk. The refineries sit atop the San Andreas fault. “It should be criminally insane…it should be absolutely forbidden to have something so inherently dangerous in an earthquake zone” Hayati said.

A spokesperson for the Torrance refinery told Drilled the plant has been using the “HF/MHF catalyst” for more than 50 years without ever having an offsite release. The spokesperson noted that HF is used to make refrigerators and other consumer products. They added that alternative alkylation options “have not yet been proven to be safe…or inherently safer than MHF”.

“Therefore” the spokesperson continued “MHF remains the safe proven and superior alkylation technology.”

Summer Spencer’s experience on that Wednesday morning back in 2015 remained with her for years.

“In hindsight I would definitely have been scared. Being so young I didn’t comprehend the scale of the danger. I felt other people should know” she said.

When the opportunity came up with the Girl Scouts to complete a project for her gold award Spencer knew exactly what she was going to do.

She jumped into action and began researching how to protect her school from an HF release. She came up with a plan to put up plastic sheeting and duct tape in the classrooms — which CDC guidelines suggest. “We actually found that that doesn’t protect fully either you actually have to have full face respirators as well” Spencer added.

Nevertheless Spencer’s project caught the attention of the Torrance school district which has since asked the teenager to extend her plan for every school in the district.

“They asked me to write an adaptable protocol for all Torrance schools — around 21 in total. They felt it wasn’t fair to do it for one school and not the rest of them.”

Spencer is now responsible for creating a safety protocol to protect thousands of children and she is well aware of the pressure.

“I was a little intimidated at first. I never imagined I would be creating an adaptable protocol myself.

Meanwhile there’s very little happening to regulate HF or MHF nationally. An EPA spokesperson told Drilled by email: “EPA is aware of the concerns raised by various stakeholders regarding the dangers of hydrofluoric acid and the recent history of accidents and near-misses involving hydrofluoric acid alkylation units at refineries. EPA will closely review information regarding these incidents when considering potential regulatory changes.”

In the meantime the millions of Americans living in the shadow of a potential vapor bomb will continue to rely on refineries to self-regulate an ineffectual emergency alarm too quiet for anybody to hear high schoolers to design safety protocols and community activists to push for better.

Here's What to Do... (Part Two),"I recently wrote about some common short-cuts to renewing elite status with your favourite hotel chain(s) even if you don’t meet the lower relaxed criteria in place for 2021. (re-read that article to refresh your memory) If those suggestions don’t work you might be interested in strategies for picking up cheap elite credit especially if you aren’t likely to have much by way of international holidays or work travel in 2021.

A couple of reminders:

You must book directly with the hotel chain to earn elite status credit A “stay” is defined as one or more consecutive nights at the same hotel irrespective of the number of times you check in and out (or change rooms) – this is only now relevant to Hilton Honors

Day Use Rooms / Work From Hotel

Hilton Honors has long been the market leader when it comes to offering hotel rooms for daytime use only. You can book these online by simply setting the arrival and departure dates to be the same.

A Day Use Rate works exactly as the name suggests – you can use a room during the daytime but you cannot stay overnight. Airport hotels often offer these rates because some people just want a quick shower and change of clothes after an overnight flight. Others want somewhere to spend a day working using the gym taking a nap etc.

The precise definition of “day” varies at each hotel but it usually runs from 9 or 10 am until 5 or 6 pm. Moreover with Hilton Honors a “day use rate” room is treated exactly as an overnight stay for elite status purposes – you earn both a night and a stay credit.

Why “day use room” for elite status purposes? Because it’s usually much cheaper. You’re never going to find an overnight stay in London for £30-40… (and of course Rob over at HeadforPoints likes to emphasise that working from a hotel ought to be tax deductible for the self-employed making your net cost even cheaper)

For £500-600 you can repeat this 15 times in 2021 and renew your Diamond status without a single “normal” stay. You will also earn many thousands of points. – from your base earnings your elite status bonus any promo points as well as the 1000 point welcome amenity.

The other major hotel chains have started to emphasise their day use rooms as well but they are more fiddly to book and I am less certain about how they are treated for elite status purposes. And because those chains don’t allow you to renew elite status by accumulating “stays” you will require far more morning trips to the hotel to check in for a few hours.

Staycations Using Points

With a hotel chain such as Marriott you will receive the fifth night free when using your points. If you are a Platinum member holding the American Express credit card you will already have 25 + 15 = 40 elite nights in your account.

Although you can of course stay anywhere you like you might be interested in spending as few points as possible to lock in your Platinum renewal. Luckily the UK has 33 Marriott hotels in the lowest 3 award categories..

These aren’t just hotels in out-of-the-way places such as Aberdeen. I am sure that you would enjoy a 5-night getaway to gems such as:

Mattress Runs

A mattress run is essentially a hotel stay that is completely unnecessary but you do it in order to earn credit for elite status purposes. The most extreme example is checking into a hotel and immediately leaving although some people stretch the definition to include local staycations where you actually do spend the night (but are only truly staying because you need elite status credit).

Because these hotel stays are completely unnecessary you want to do them late in the year when you have no other choice to accumulate stays/nights. They can also make sense when you would be taking advantage of a lucrative bonus-point promotion. Or in the case of Marriott Bonvoy and World of Hyatt… when you have managed to make a Best Rate Guarantee claim and have chosen to earn 5000 points as compensation.

But there are a few pitfalls associated with mattress runs that you must avoid:

Somebody must check-in to the hotel in person. Simply booking a prepaid stay doesn’t count. Completing the check-in process on a phone App won’t work either. Unless you access the room with your phone the hotel can consider you as a no-show (and save themselves money).

It doesn’t necessarily have to be you checking in though. Many chains allow for a second person’s name to be attached to a reservation. It is a simple matter of calling the hotel (or loyalty programme) a few days in advance to say that my partner/friend/etc. will be sharing my room and will be arriving before me – please allow them to check-in on my behalf. In some cases the hotel might be strict and might insist that the principal reservation holder (i.e. you) passes by the front desk at some point; many don’t really bother. Of course you won’t really be asking a friend to do a mattress run for you. Instead you’ll be trying to earn elite status credit from somebody else’s hotel stay. (which is a breach of the terms & conditions and could cost you your account)

Don’t just leave. When doing a mattress run I make a point to visit my room briefly to make sure that there is no damage I might be subsequently blamed for. Since I’ve made the effort to travel to the hotel I’ll usually visit the hotel’s executive lounge gym and/or pool. If there are complimentary items such as bottled water etc. I’ll take them as well.

However under NO circumstances should you immediately check-out again. This process will undoubtedly mess up the computer systems and you could miss out on the valuable elite status credit you are making the effort to earn. All modern hotels will automatically check out guests on departure day with their credit card details on file – the only reason to pass by a front desk on departure day is to get a print out of your receipt. So just leave whenever you desire and let the hotel check you out automatically in the morning…

It’s best to only mattress run one night stays. The longer the stay the more likely that housekeeping finds an empty hotel room one morning and informs the front desk that you have left. The hotel may then decide to check you out prematurely. Although housekeeping service is often reduced due to the pandemic a Do Not Disturb sign is no guarantee that your room won’t be occasionally checked to see whether the guest is dead (or is doing something illegal or messy inside). So don’t book a long stay and expect that DND sign to stay there for the duration.

Conclusion

Hopefully you will be able to renew your elite status in 2021 even though your usual travel patterns have surely been affected by lockdown. But if you find yourself needing to make a special effort I hope that my tips have helped you to do it cost (and time) effectively…

She worked with Jet for about three years and witnessed the steady decline in the airlines’ fortunes before things reached a point of no return.It was around 5 in the morning on April 9 2019 when Sameera received a call from the office asking her to report at the airport to attend a flight operating on the Bombay-Amsterdam route. Although it was her scheduled day off she decided to head to Amsterdam on an assurance that she would receive her layover allowance she said. Every flight attendant with Jet was given $108 per flight on international routes as a meal allowance.The reason she was asked to report at such short notice was that one of Jet’s aircraft was grounded in Amsterdam leaving the crew members stranded. It was reported that a European cargo services provider had seized the airline’s planes at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport due to non-payment of dues leaving hundreds of passengers stranded.Sameera was a regular on the international routes serving on flights London Amsterdam Paris among other global cities.“I got ready took a pair of clothes and essentials and headed to the airport without any knowledge that what was coming next would be painful” she recalled.“After much difficulties and technical issues we managed to take off at 10:30 in the morning. Everything went on as usual on the flight except that we had no idea about the heartbreak that awaited. When we landed in Amsterdam the first thing I did was connect to the Wifi to check if I had received my allowances and yet again like a few previous cases I had not. But this was nothing compared to the blow that was coming. On connecting to the internet we received the news that Jet had suspended all its international operations. To be precise I had almost lost my job. It was my last flight which I of course realized much later” Sameera told CNBCTV18.com.According to her she and other crew members remained stuck in Amsterdam for five days until April 15 when they were brought to Paris by road and then Mumbai on an Air France flight from Paris. Jet took care of the travel expenses.Sameera joined the airline in February 2016 as a trainee and after completing the training which lasted for three months she was sent to fly. Initially she attended Jetlite on domestic routes. Jet’s business then was at its peak -- all flights full new routes introduced new planes bought and aggressive operations on primary sectors like Delhi Mumbai and more.“To be very honest I never considered a career in aviation and hence did not pursue any specialised course. I am a B.Com graduate from Mumbai and after graduating took up a job in the hotel Hyatt Regency in the front office department. It was somewhere during that time when I started going for walk-in interviews for airlines just to accompany my friends but little did I know I would end up getting two job offers. I however chose Jet” she explained.It was somewhere during 2017-18 when things started turning bad for Jet due to rising crude and falling rupee. Profitability was hit severely forcing Jet to take extreme cost-cutting measures like withdrawing meals and even asking staff to take a pay cut.“We hoped it was a part of a business cycle but it only got worse” Sameera said.In February 2019 salaries were put on hold – and employees were not paid the pending flying allowances either Sameera said. A lot of routes were cut down flights were cancelled and aircraft were grounded.“Despite things looking bad we could never imagine a suspension of all operations. After all it was known for its premium service once and it was because of this name that our flights – the ones that operated till the very end – were always fully booked. I believe neither the passengers nor the staff had imagined Indian aviation minus Jet until the day arrived” she said.Jet finally announced the suspension of all operations on April 17. Sameera resigned after two months in June.“I would be lying if I said I didn’t apply for other Indian airlines which was the case with many other Jet employees but things didn’t quite work as there were too many seeking jobs in the industry” she says.She then decided to move away from the aviation sector and took up a job at Courtyard by Marriott International as an Executive Elite Ambassador.“But everything in between left me shattered. I was repeatedly reminded what I got into was a wrong place. My family was visibly troubled. I took care of a significant amount of family expenses” recalled Sameera.Jet’s suspension had left more than 22000 employees including its 15500 permanent staff without jobs. As per a TOI report about 3681 still remain on its payroll without drawing salaries. Among the several reasons that these employees stayed back was also the hope of its revival.While Jet’s Committee of Creditors approving the revival plan of a consortium of UK-headquartered Kalrock Capital and UAE-based entrepreneur Murari Lal Jalan last year has sparked a fresh ray of hope the government’s refusal to hand over the airline’s slots for arrival and departure to the new entity has again brought uncertainty.The ministry has said that Jet will have to reapply for these slots as currently they remain with other airlines. It may or may not be given these slots. While the matter is being discussed by both parties the staff remains hopeful that these issues will be resolved soon.“Hope our beloved 9W will be back to skies and I get to wear that uniform again” says Sameera.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3dGVsZWdyYXBobmcuY29tL3NoZXJhdG9uLWFidWphLWhvdGVsLWdldHMtZmlyc3QtZmVtYWxlLW1hbmFnZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sheraton Abuja Hotel gets first female manager,"Grace Acheampong has been appointed as the first female manager of Sheraton Abuja Hotel making history as not the only first female head of the hotel but also as the first West African to rise to the exalted position of the head of the over 30 years old hotel management team.

The pandemic has forced employers to revisit their talent management strategies particularly as remote working has transformed the way we think about office spaces and business travel. At the same time monitoring and maintaining company culture has never been more difficult and managers have needed to adapt to “virtual” employment.

Pre-pandemic just 4% of HR teams believed they delivered an exemplary employee experience. Now firms have had to come up with innovative talent management practices policies and procedures to reinvent the employee value proposition to ensure depth of talent build trust and find new ways of monitoring behavior to ensure it is aligned to company objectives and values.

This is not just about building a strong talent pipeline demonstrating commitment to the employment value proposition and motivating the needed workforce. There are other people risks inherent in talent management practices.

For instance it is important that companies identify assess and control talent-related risks like: misconduct – including fraud or unethical conduct; key person dependency; or productivity and performance risks associated with a mobile population.

While talent practices have previously been considered largely an HR responsibility firms are waking up to the importance of workforce well-being and morale to the health of the business and a multi-disciplinary approach to bringing diversity of perspective and greater integration with the business. This means that decisions about benefits are gaining more C-suite attention. For instance 74% of executives are anxious about lower-than-desired employee engagement and 70% are concerned about the impact of high employee absences on productivity.

As such HR teams must consider their strategies through the lens of risk management and wider board objectives. At Mercer Marsh Benefits (MMB) we have identified five key people risks when it comes to talent practices:

Talent attraction retention and engagement: The inability to create a strong talent pipeline employment value proposition and the growth opportunities needed to sustain and motivate the workforce.

The inability to create a strong talent pipeline employment value proposition and the growth opportunities needed to sustain and motivate the workforce. Conduct and culture: Misconduct including bullying harassment dangerous behavior fraud and cultures that foster behaviors that are misaligned to corporate values or illegal/unethical.

Misconduct including bullying harassment dangerous behavior fraud and cultures that foster behaviors that are misaligned to corporate values or illegal/unethical. Succession and key person risk: Lack of depth in succession bench and talent flight risks resulting in the business being heavily reliant on key individual(s).

Lack of depth in succession bench and talent flight risks resulting in the business being heavily reliant on key individual(s). Changing nature of work: Issues associated with flexible working gig workers technology adoption and/or growth mindset that create new business challenges in areas like innovation and workforce management.

Issues associated with flexible working gig workers technology adoption and/or growth mindset that create new business challenges in areas like innovation and workforce management. Travel and mobility: Business travel and international assignments creating more risk issues like crisis/evacuation management business/colleague dissatisfaction and duty of care.

The benefits for organizations that successfully modernize HR strategies to address talent risk can be substantial. Our research demonstrates a strong correlation between the number of benefits provided and the loyalty and energy levels of employees.

We found that energized employees are six times more likely to say their workplace is focused on health and well-being. When asked what type of company they would prefer to work for one-in-two employees said for an organization that protects employees’ health and financial well-being.

Talent practices are also critical from a brand standpoint – both as an employer but also for building a broader business image and reputation. Benefits can be an expression of your brand. One place to start is by ensuring benefits align to the external image you are seeking to convey.

For example in China we helped a healthcare industry client revamp its health screening program to be more in line with clinical best practices. From a brand standpoint it was really important that features were not included in their annual health checks that were not clinically sound – like too many x-rays.

Another common strategy is to redesign programs to add more choice and hence make benefits more attractive. This can be done in a way that contains cost while appealing to a broader set of employee needs. This goes a long way in building an employee value proposition that addresses talent risks.

HR directors that are looking to revamp policies and strategies to help manage and mitigate these key risks should start by addressing five core questions:

When was the last time we reviewed our employee benefit plan to ensure it was competitive and reflective of employee needs including those of traditionally disadvantaged populations like women?

How did our benefit plan perform during the pandemic – did it adapt in order to meet the needs of a more remote workforce?

What does a benefit plan that is attractive to employees while also being cost conscious look like?

Do our benefit plans provide employees with the support they need?

What concerns do we have around employee experience?

Three key aims when using benefits to help manage talent risks

The whole person agenda – understanding people and their realities inside and outside of work.

understanding people and their realities inside and outside of work. Increased duty of care - for employee well-being including exhaustion grief and change fatigue.

for employee well-being including exhaustion grief and change fatigue. Rethinking the HR model - including new benefits that work in a digital-first and/or blended work environment.

Conclusion

The war for talent impacts employers across all regions; talent attraction retention and engagement is crucial for firms that want to be agile innovative or need new skillsets to drive business change and results. As such HR teams need to re-evaluate business plans to ensure that they meet the risks and needs of a modern workforce.

More importantly benefits are pointless if they don’t actually benefit the workforce. That is why solutions to add more choice to benefits are so important. Whether it is through flexible benefit plans voluntary benefits engaging benefit platforms or inclusive benefits that better address the needs of women the LGBTQ+ community essential workers or other disadvantaged populations it is all about delivering value.",,,,,,,,,,,,

One of a series of security leadership profiles prepared by Cybersecurity Collaborative in conjunction with SC Media. Cybersecurity Collaborative is a membership community for cybersecurity leaders to work together in a trusted environment. Find out more here.

Ron Green is chief security officer with Mastercard.

About Ron Green: Ron Green is chief security officer with Mastercard. In that role he leads a global team that ensures the safety and security of the Mastercard network as well as internal and external products and services. He is chair of the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council (FSSCC). He holds a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the United States Military Academy is a graduate of the FBI’s Domestic Security Executive Academy and holds a graduate certification in information assurance from George Washington University.

What makes a successful security leader?

For starters you have to be a team player to make it in this field. You need to work well with all parts of the enterprise — not just the security team. You need to understand the business and build trust just as a quarterback needs to trust the offensive line. Finally stay humble; no one can know everything about cybersecurity — it’s a vast complex field.

What internal and external priorities should today's security leaders focus on?

Fostering a spirit of inclusivity both within the security team as well as with partners and stakeholders is critical. We need everyone to feel empowered and comfortable sharing their ideas as that diversity of thought is essential when defending against the adversary. Second creating security standards provides the business with a framework in which employees operate. Equally important however is ensuring communication and compliance of those standards so everyone understands expectations. Finally readying the business so it can take advantage of emerging technologies like the cloud 5G and internet of things (IoT) is definitely a priority — but it's also important to never lose sight of the basics. Keeping systems and software up to date and educating employees about security basics — like phishing and data protection — are equally critical.

Externally there has never been a greater need for information sharing and collaboration with others in the same sector as well as across sectors. The adversaries work together to attack; as such we must work together to improve our collective defenses. I also believe that we are only as strong as our weakest link. Today we are all so interconnected that those businesses that haven’t made cybersecurity a priority — either because it is too complicated or too expensive — adversely affect us all. As experts it is our duty to help others especially small business owners improve their defenses and overall security posture.

How can cyber leaders work with corporate peers to win buy-in from c-suites and boards of directors?

Security is very much top of mind with both our c-suite and our board of directors. But as experts in our space we often forget that not everyone understands the security world. We must be deliberate when discussing security with others by putting our messages into a context they can understand. This means adjusting our terminology to simplify the complicated.

Dashboards are also helpful tools because they showcase the challenges while illustrating the positive strides we are making over time. Bringing others into our security world also helps. For example we host capture-the-flag events with our board of directors. This immersive experience pairs them with a member of the security team and teaches the board member how to hack into a system. Through this hands-on experience they gain first-hand exposure to security concepts and a greater reference point.

Finally security is everyone’s responsibility including the c-suite. We enable our peers with security standards and policies and clearly communicate expectations so everyone is aware and can be held accountable for their actions. But we go one step further by embedding our top-notch team of cybersecurity experts within their team to partner advise and assist them with implementing controls.

What kinds of non-technology training do security leaders need to be successful in large and/or global enterprises?

Before working in cybersecurity I was an agent with the United States Secret Service. During that time I faced several life-or-death situations that solidified for me some of the greatest lessons of my career. First clear and direct communication is critical if you want to inspire action. This is especially true when working in a large global enterprise with colleagues that often speak several languages. Second use critical thinking and have confidence in your decision. While I’m no longer facing life-or-death situations the stakes are still high and quick decision-making is essential.

What attracted you to join the Cybersecurity Collaborative as an Executive Committee member?

We knew (or recognized) many of the Cybersecurity Collaborative members. As an Executive Committee member we realized this was an opportunity to improve security for all by helping to shape the member discussions.

What do you value about Cybersecurity Collaborative’s Executive Committee?

Partnerships like this are valuable for a number of reasons but benchmarking tops the list. By sharing information with one another in a trusted setting we’re all able to glean insights into what others are doing and learn firsthand what is or isn’t working. This also opens the door for deeper discussions about process and technology improvements we can make to help our people succeed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZC1zaG93ZG93bi1jaXRpLWFhZHZhbnRhZ2UtcGxhdGludW0tc2VsZWN0LXZzLWFhZHZhbnRhZ2UtYXZpYXRvci1yZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Credit card showdown: Citi/AAdvantage Platinum Select vs. AAdvantage Aviator Red,"Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here.

American Airlines flyers have plenty of cobranded credit cards to choose from. For no annual fee there's the American Airlines AAdvantage MileUp℠ Card. Higher in the lineup there's the Citi® / AAdvantage® Platinum Select® World Elite Mastercard® with a $99 annual fee (waived the first 12 months) and the AAdvantage Aviator Silver World Elite Mastercard which costs $199 per year (you can only receive this card if you already have the Barclays AAdvantage Aviator Red World Elite Mastercard). At the premium end there's the Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite Mastercard® which costs $450 per year and includes Admirals Club access for the primary cardholder authorized users and guests.

The information for the AAdvantage Aviator Silver World Elite Mastercard the Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select and the Aviator Red cards has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

In the middle of the range are competing cards from Barclays and Citi. The Aviator Red card includes interesting benefits such as an annual statement credit for inflight food and beverage purchases as well as the possibility of earning a companion certificate through spending — plus a generous 60000 sign-up bonus after making a single purchase.

The Citi / AAdvantage Platinum card allows cardholders to rack up miles faster on everyday purchases with non-airline bonus categories.

Both cards offer similar sign-up bonuses (although Barclays currently has a 10000-mile edge) and travel benefits and charge the same annual fee: $99. However the Citi / AAdvantage Platinum card waives the annual fee in the first year of card membership. We'll put both cards head-to-head to see which one is right for you.

Let's take a detailed look at the two products and their key differences and discuss which one is better for whom.

Annual fee

Both cards charge an annual fee of $99. But you don't pay an annual fee in your first year of having the card with Citi as it's waived for cardholders.

Winner:The Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select

Sign-up bonus

The Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select is currently offering 50000 bonus AAdvantage miles after making $2500 in purchases within the first three months of account opening. Based on our most recent valuations this is worth around $700.

The Aviator Red offers 60000 bonus AAdvantage miles after making your first purchase in the first 90 days — even something as small as a Snickers candy bar — and paying the $99 annual fee. This bonus is worth around $840.

Winner: Earning 60000 miles for a single purchase and a $99 fee makes the Aviator Red a clear winner.

Earning

The cards have significantly different earning rates. The Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select racks up 2 miles per dollar on eligible American Airlines purchases and at restaurants and gas stations. It earns 1x on everything else.

The Aviator Red only earns 2x miles on eligible American Airlines purchases and 1x on everything else.

Winner: The Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select takes home the trophy for earning thanks to two bonus spending categories where cardholders can rack up thousands of extra miles per year.

American Airlines travel benefits

The two cards offer similar slates of inflight benefits. Both include a first checked bag free on domestic American Airlines itineraries for the cardholder and up to four companions traveling with them on the same reservation.

Both cards also confer priority boarding privileges and a 25% discount on inflight food and beverage purchases as well as access to reduced mileage awards.

Winner: Again this is a tie.

Spending benefits

If you spend $20000 or more on purchases during a card membership year and renew your Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select you can earn a $125 American Airlines flight discount. The discount is redeemable toward the base airfare and directly associated taxes fees and charges on flights marketed and operated by American Airlines and its subsidiaries.

The Aviator Red rewards cardholders who spend $20000 or more on purchases in a cardmember year and pay their annual fee with a companion certificate for $99 (plus taxes and fees). It's good toward a round-trip domestic economy ticket on American Airlines and its subsidiaries within the 48 contiguous United States. Residents of Alaska and Hawaii can travel to or from their states.

Although you can apply the Citi card's $125 discount to more flights since there's no class or regional restriction to it you can potentially reap much more value from the Aviator Red's benefit by redeeming it for an expensive fare.

The Aviator Red also participates in Barclays' Flight Cents program. This essentially allows you to round up purchases to the nearest dollar and earn miles at a rate of 2 cents apiece. The example Barclays gives is: If you buy a coffee for $3.10 and opt into Flight Cents you will be charged $4 for the purchase. For the extra 90 cents you will receive 45 bonus AAdvantage miles. The maximum amount you can round up each statement period is $500 which would yield 25000 bonus miles though you can adjust your own Flight Cents ceiling threshold.

For 2021 only the Elite Qualifying Dollar requirement for achieving AAdvantage Gold Platinum or Platinum Pro will be waived if you spend $30000 on a Citi / AAdvantage card this year.

Winner: With flight prices at very low levels we think the EQD waiver for 2021 on Citi / AAdvantage cards gives the Platinum Select card the nod for now. Because the Aviator Red companion certificate has a higher potential value and offers the ability to opt into Flight Cents to purchase miles at a discount the Aviator Red wins out here in the long run.

Other benefits

Both cards waive foreign transaction fees and offer a range of World Elite Mastercard benefits. Those include access to the World Elite Concierge a $5 monthly Lyft credit if you take three or more rides $1000 in yearly cellphone coverage ($800 max per claim two claims per year) global emergency services a $5 reward for every $20 spent on Fandango movie tickets or at-home purchases exclusive golf offers and experiences with the PGA Tour with Priceless Golf and a free ShopRunner membership where you receive two-day shipping and free return shipping at more than a hundred online retailers.

Unfortunately Citi slashed the travel benefits on most of its cards including the Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select in September 2019. Cardholders no longer have car rental insurance trip cancellation or interruption protection travel accident insurance trip delay protection baggage delay protection lost baggage protection or purchase protection.

For its part the Aviator Red also lost select benefits on Nov. 1 2019. The card no longer includes extended warranty price/purchase protection or return protection. On the plus side it does include worldwide secondary rental car insurance that extends to SUVs and trucks if a car is not available and covers vehicles with MSRPs of more than $50000. It also has trip cancellation and interruption coverage as well as travel accident insurance.

Winner: Neither card is great in this category but at least the Aviator Red still includes a few insurance coverage benefits.

Which one should you get?

Which of these cards is better for you depends on which one's benefits you will maximize.

The Barclays AAdvantage Aviator Red World Elite Mastercard offers a bigger sign-up bonus with very low spending to get it. It also offers some travel protections and a shot at earning a valuable companion certificate potentially worth hundreds of dollars.

On the other hand if you only purchase American Airlines tickets occasionally and spend significantly more on dining and gas the Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select World Elite Mastercard might be a better choice for racking up miles.

If you previously had the Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select and earned a sign-up bonus in the past 48 months you will not be eligible for its sign-up bonus again until that window of time has elapsed. So you might want to look to the Aviator Red instead. Likewise the Aviator Red's application page says ""You may not be eligible for this offer if you currently have or previously had an account with us in this program."" So if you already carried the Aviator Red and closed it you might want to apply for the Citi card instead.

Overall both are excellent products that present the opportunity to earn miles quickly with the AAdvantage program while enjoying elite-style perks when you travel — all for a reasonable $99 annual fee.

Police began examining footage from the action on Wednesday night which occurred in Arnhem where Vitesse is based. The two clubs played Sunday and Ajax won 2-1.

Supporters and rivals of Ajax often affectionately refer to the club and its fans as “Jews” out of recognition of the centuries-long strong presence of Jews in Amsterdam. It’s a pattern across Europe used for fans of teams in England Italy and Germany.

But in the Netherlands the “Hamas Jews to the gas” chant has become more commonplace in recent years.

Pascal van Wijk director of the Vitesse team condemned the chants.

Live Score Updates Sunrisers Hyderabad 137-10 (19.4 Ovs) Mujeeb Ur Rahman 1 (1) Mumbai Indians 150-5 Trent Boult 3.4-0-28-3 Mumbai Indians won by 13 runs Live Scores Full Scorecard

It was Bairstow getting out hit-wicket that allowed Mumbai a foot in the door and they jammed it on SRH's face © BCCI

Hardik Pandya on being asked if his direct-hits have come years and years of practice -- ""Not really"". How's that for swagger! Hope you enjoyed reading this and until next time ta ta!!

Just to put things into context SRH's collapse has been 70 runs | 10 wickets. The difference between the two teams though was 13 runs which to be fair has to be credited to those two sixes that Pollard hit to close out Mumbai's innings. But that's what this Mumbai side has become a brutal steamrolling machine winning from anywhere anytime.

SRH Choke. Again.It's not as bad as what they've done over the last two games but still a choke is a choke.

Samad's gone. Rashid's gone. And the last hope that remained Shankar's gone too. Who's the star you ask? Jazzy B -- 4-0-14-1. If only there was a Man of the Match for non-stat-based performances. He's bowled the absolute terror overs two in the powerplay two at the death.

From collapse to stagnation to redemption!It's Vijay Shankar who's taken it upon himself here to get SRH home. Krunal Pandya's the one taking the beating here getting smashed for two sixes and the asking rate falls from the nines to the sevens ..

Suddenly just like that don't ask how the equation has gone to 49 runs in 36 balls. Again seriously don't ask how!

Warner run out (Hardik Pandya) 36(34) ..it's getting eerily similar!

None of Manish Pandey's 30+-ball vigils tonight Rahul Chahar's sent him back in his first over itself. Meanwhile Warner has in fact stepped things up. He really looks in the mood that concentration that grit that need to finish it himself.

So practically there was no way some bowler was normally getting Bairstow out tonight in this mood. Run-out was an option but Mumbai have been really sloppy in the field. Hit-wicket was the other option. And you better believe it he's stepped onto his stumps while trying to pull a Krunal Pandya half-tracker. Mumbai get a massive life ..

It's quite what Mumbai did in their powerplay although the way Hyderabad have done it looks particularly brutal. Anyway 56/0. And Mumbai have the two Bumrah overs to thank that have gone for only 5 runs combined. All the punishment's been reserved for the others.

Okay Jonny Bairstow has gone nuts. He's smashing them all around for fun. Boult. Milne. Chahar. Everyone being smoked to every possible corner. Mind you Warner's very quiet and possibly scratchy at the other end but really nobody's even noticed him. It's all about Jonny!

****

In Vijay Shankar's words ""this is the best pitch in the three games he's played so far"". Hang around the second half promises to be a proper thriller.

Huff. Puff. Six. Six. 150 .. thanks to those last two balls getting smashed big Kieron Pollard has helped Mumbai touch 150. It was a strange li'l innings from a stage where 180 looked within reach in the powerplay to where 140 could've been possible to ending up with 150.

It was a struggle. A proper painstaking struggle. Ishan Kishan -- 21 balls | 12 runs | 9 dots. Mujeeb puts and end to his misery with a half-tracker down leg and given how lost Kishan's looked he's found a way to tickle that to the keeper.

Rashid Khan -- 4-0-22-0.#JustRashidThings. Clearly Pollard has come out with a one-track mind of playing him out.

Here comes the strangle .. from a blazing start to some really struggling middle-overs this Mumbai innings has turned around rather quickly. And it's SRH's spinners who've spun their web -- with Ishan Kishan really struggling at one end. And Quinton de Kock looking to break the shackles only to miscue Mujeeb while look to go big.

And one brings the other. Suryakumar Yadav after smoking a massive six gets foxed by the lack of pace on the very next ball. Yea they're clawing back here and clawing back properly. Remember the tryst with Mumbai and collapses in this IPL?

When in doubt turn to your part-timer. It's an age-old rule in cricket that's been passed down the generations. So Warner goes to Vijay Shankar who's slow innocuous length deliveries tempts Rohit to slog mistime and hole out in the deep. It's a massive breather ..

Powerplay - done. Warner has shuffled his bowlers all around trying out different ends different options and without any risk Mumbai are at 53/0.

STAT TIME -- Rohit Sharma in the first four overs in the day has already hit a couple of sixes and now has becomes the highest-six-hitter among Indians in the IPL. They don't call him Hitman for nothing!

We're live. And how do we start? With a proper full-faced punch straight down the ground and into the boundary courtesy Quinton. First impressions: This does look a slightly better pitch for a batsman.

Now Mumbai and Chennai are master player-backers but if there's a team that comes next on that list it's Hyderabad. But no not tonight. Apparently two losses have hurt and worried them enough to make as many as four changes. Go figure ..

Surprise surprise. Mumbai Indians opt to bat!

So while you stay confused about Kane Williamson's fitness or about Manish Pandey's strike-rates here's the preview for help. Here's an explainer as to why Hyderabad have been messing up at the end. And here are the bbb comms.

Match #9: Hello. It's a battle of the pre-tournament favourites. Mumbai coming off a coming-back-from-the-dead victory against KKR and SRH choking from a in-the-pocket match against RCB. Confused? Well the real confusion that you have to deal with is the toss. Common sense and the trend of T20s dictates that you bowl first. But Chepauk this sluggish pitch and this three-match collapsing history is bound to mess around with your head. Surely when you're SRH and you've thrown away chases that were clearly in the pocket. Mumbai well they've never had a bowler take a fifer against them in 13 years and suddenly have gifted two fifers in their two matches. It's precisely what should make tonight fun ..

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,"Adblocker is on ×

The annual letter-writing campaign is organized by the Northwestern chapters of the Society of Women Engineers the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and the National Society of Black Engineers.

Current McCormick students write the letters in the spring and Assistant Dean for Student Affairs Ellen Worsdall the faculty advisor for SWE SHPE and NSBE mails out the letters to women Hispanic and Black engineering students over the summer.

Worsdall said 38% of McCormick class of 2026 were women and over a third were from underrepresented communities. The goal of the letters is to build community especially within underrepresented demographics in engineering Worsdall said.

McCormick freshman and SWE Mentorship Director Kayla Youhanaie said she loved receiving her letter.

“(The letter) showed me that (SWE) is very active and they care a lot about their club members” Youhanaie said. “I instantly got involved when I first got here.”

SWE hosted a letter-writing event in the Technological Institute on April 30 where colored paper and markers were provided.

“We write individual handwritten notes to every student” Youhanaie said. “We like making them feel like somebody’s thinking about them.”

On Friday SHPE also held a letter-writing event in the Ford Center where they encouraged letter-writers to include introductions to SHPE and its values as an organization give advice and make the recipient excited about coming to NU.

McCormick freshman and SHPE Mentorship Chair Gisela Martinez said she hopes to build relationships between mentors and mentees in SHPE during Fall Quarter. The letters are a first step she said.

SHPE letter-writers are encouraged to leave their contact info on the letters Martinez said in hopes that this will begin to build mentorship relationships.

“I wish to give back to my community and become a mentor even if it’s through a small thing such as a letter” Martinez said.

NSBE will be holding a letter-writing event on Friday in Ford.

Prior to receiving her letter McCormick freshmen Jocelyn Luevanos said she was nervous about going to an engineering school.

Luevanos later participated in both SWE and SHPE letter-writing events because she remembered how the letters impacted her.

“It came to my house and I was like ‘Oh my gosh I got a SWE letter’” Luevanos said. “Even though you’ve already been accepted you still don’t feel like you’re really part of the NU community. (The letter) gets you excited to go to college and helps ease some of that anxiety.”

“I spent most of my life in Pennsylvania growing up in Bloomsburg on my family’s farm” Mr. McCormick now a Republican candidate for Senate told Pittsburgh Quarterly in 2022.

“I’ve truly lived the American dream” he wrote in a fund-raising appeal in October. “My life’s journey — from growing up on a farm in Bloomsburg to graduating from West Point and serving in the 82nd Airborne Division growing a business in Pittsburgh and serving at the highest levels of government — reflects that.”

“I grew up on a family farm from the time I was a kid” he said at the Pennsylvania farm show in January."

The father Jontae Adams 28 and his daughter Jaslyn were in a silver Infiniti about 4:20 p.m. at the McDonald’s 3200 W. Roosevelt Road when they were shot Chicago police said. A McDonald’s employee who asked not to be named said two people got out of a gray car and started shooting at the victim’s car.

Jontae Adams frantically called his mother Lawanda McMullen after the shooting.

“He said ‘Ma come get me. They just shot my baby’” McMullen recalled.

The girl who has three siblings was shot repeatedly and was taken by police officers to Stroger Hospital where she was pronounced dead police said.

Her father was shot in the torso and also taken to Stroger where his condition was listed as serious police said.

Police said the shooting was believed to be gang-related and less than three hours later two people were shot in their car at a Popeyes in Humboldt Park which investigators believe is connected to the McDonald’s shooting.

A 33-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman were in a blue Chevy Malibu having just ordered food at the Popeyes drive-thru window at Chicago and Kedzie when a gunman pulled up in a car at 7:12 p.m and opened fire. The man was shot in the left leg; the woman in the abdomen. Both were taken to Stroger Hospital with the man in serious condition the woman in critical.

Both shooting scenes were littered with shell casings.

At the McDonald’s parking lot onlookers gathered just outside of the police’s caution tape stunned at the audacity of the shooting.

“Unbelievable they did this in front of all those cameras” one man who asked to remain anonymous said. “These kids are getting bold.”

Jaslyn’s aunt Tawny McMullen said her niece was a “beautiful” and “really sweet child.”

McMullen said Jaslyn was best friends with her 8-year-old daughter.

Lawanda McMullen said her granddaughter loved to dance and make TikToks.

Jaslyn was a student at Cameron Elementary School. She was nicknamed Pinky “because she was bright” and pink was her favorite color family members said.

Even before the Popeyes shooting outside Stroger Hospital family members begged for an end to violence.

“Put the guns down” Tawny McMullen pleaded as tears streamed down her face. “Our kids want to play my kids can’t even go out the door because of [the violence.] Please put the guns down please. My 8-year-old baby says she don’t even want to go outside to play because she’s scared she’s going to get shot. This has gotta stop.”

Other community activists including an emotional Andrew Holmes also called for a ceasefire.

“You just took away somebody’s queen. You just took away a mother’s daughter. You just put hurt on the father — for what?” said Holmes who called the shooting “senseless.”

“Every parent has taken a child to McDonald’s to get something to eat. Not to get some bullets. To the shooter why? Why? If you had any kids have you ever taken your kids to McDonald’s?”

Marvin Edwards president of 100 Men Standing a Cabrini-Green group advocating against gun violence encouraged anyone with information relating to the shooting to come forward.

“We are sick and tired of this. It makes no damn sense” Edwards said. “Whoever pulled this trigger on this young lady and took her life trying to get something to eat from McDonald’s whoever housing these individuals turn these people in . . . We are pleading with you do not let this go undone. Turn them in right away. This family are going through living hell right now because of the acts of some fools.”

Sure some of the newer restaurants in strategically important locations feature high-tech design elements and unique interior decor but most share pretty run-of-the-mill features: sloped red roofs boxy shapes and brick walls or gray paneling.

One McDonald's location however retains all the charm of the centuries-long history of the building it occupies and has been called the most beautiful McDonald's in America time and time again according to Gothamist.

Built into the historic Joseph Denton House in New Hyde Park N.Y. this Long Island McDonald's was opened by the company in the '80s. The chain bought the historic building with the intention of demolishing it but the move was met with overwhelming disapproval from the local community forcing McDonald's to change its plans and restore it instead.

The large white mansion was originally built in 1795 as a farmhouse but an 1860 renovation updated the original home to the Georgian style according to Scouting New York. Today it still features multiple brick chimneys shutter-lined windows tapered Doric columns but now with a drive-thru tucked around the back. Despite its deceptive outward appearance on the inside it is a fully functional modern McDonald's restaurant with self-order digital kiosks and a sprawling dining room.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Yet three Minnesota executives from Best Buy Medtronic and U.S. Bank are carving out distinct paths to raise their children and build fulfilling careers.

Amelia Williams Hardy is undaunted by busy schedules but she also recognizes that daily life can quickly deteriorate into chaos when both parents are corporate executives trying to raise four children.

Hardy is vice president of inclusion and diversity strategic initiatives at Best Buy. Her husband Cordell is vice president of global corporate research and development operations at 3M. Their children are Elijah 3; Eden 10; Elise 13; and Isaac 16.

“We live by our Google family calendar” Hardy says. “I always say ‘If it’s not on the calendar then it doesn’t exist.’ ”

But Hardy’s carefully constructed calendar was rendered irrelevant in March 2020 when Covid-19 forced her children’s schools to close and she and her husband shifted into work-from-home mode.

The Woodbury couple had to improvise.

Navigating the ‘Work/Life Sway’ For years executive women have talked about their desire to achieve work/life balance. But veteran journalist Joann Lublin says that elusive balance has been replaced by the concept of “work/life sway” which is embraced by young women business leaders. “They deliberately move back and forth between the professional and personal sides of their digital-centric lives accepting inevitable and aggravating disruptions such as taking youngsters to medical checkups during the workday” Lublin wrote in her new book.

“I had the dining room table for the first couple of months” Hardy says. “It’s not good for your back and neck.” Cordell Hardy was using the home’s office and the three oldest children often did their homework there too.

“The challenge was if he was on video calls which mainly he was then we’d spread out” Hardy recalls. “So you would get my youngest daughter working at the kitchen table my oldest daughter working in my youngest son’s room and then my oldest son would usually be in his room. We needed enough space to spread out so that you could still hear the conversations that you were a part of on the Zoom calls.”

Elijah’s day care center has remained open throughout the pandemic but Hardy says he’s been at home anytime he showed cold symptoms or had any illness.

“That was hard because he would be jumping in the background on my sofa or in the Zoom camera” Hardy says.

“It’s all a blur” is how she describes the early weeks of working from home and overseeing her children’s instruction. “I felt guilty that I wasn’t able to help them more” Hardy says. “We were still working and weren’t able to spend the full time with them that we needed to.”

The disruption that Covid-19 has caused for working mothers worries advocates of gender parity in corporate America.

“During Covid you’ve got so many more personal household responsibilities that women are juggling on average more than men” says Kweilin Ellingrud a senior partner in the Minneapolis office of McKinsey & Co. “[Women] are stagnating at work and so they’re less likely to get the promotion or take on new challenges.”

The annual Women in the Workplace study released in September and conducted for McKinsey and Lean In showed that the pandemic exacerbated the challenges women already face carrying heavy loads at work and at home. Some working women are “downshifting their careers” Ellingrud says while others are thinking about “stepping out of the workforce altogether because right now there are just too many things going on.”

“We don’t have traditional roles. My husband does most of the cooking and meal planning and I tend to do most of the activities.” —Amelia Williams Hardy vice president of inclusion and diversity strategic initiatives Best Buy

‘It’s a Catch-22’

Hardy 45 doesn’t plan to downshift her career but she acknowledges that she and her husband regularly talk about the family challenges associated with two demanding careers.

“It’s a tricky conversation and it’s hard” she says. “It’s a Catch-22. I think we both want each other to succeed and do what’s best for the other and I think we also want that for ourselves. It’s an ebb and flow for us. It definitely is an ongoing conversation. It’s a conversation that I don’t think is going to stop until we retire.”

As a Black woman who has reached the vice president level at Best Buy a publicly traded company Hardy is part of a small number of BIPOC women nationally. The recent McKinsey study documented the gender gap that still exists in the corporate pipeline. Just 19 percent of C-suite jobs are held by white women and only 3 percent are held by women of color. At the vice president level white women occupy 24 percent of the jobs with women of color in 6 percent of the positions.

Hardy a native of Overland Park Kansas initially wanted to be a doctor and earn her undergraduate degree at a historically black college. “I grew up in a suburb that was predominantly white” she says. “My whole experience growing up I never had a teacher of color. I was usually the only child of color in my class. I wanted to experience something different.”

Multiple internships piqued her interest in business and she went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Xavier University of Louisiana. After finishing her MBA at Tulane University she accepted a job at 3M in 2000 and climbed the ranks to global business unit manager over a 14-year run.

She married Cordell Hardy in 2003 after meeting him at Pilgrim Baptist Church in St. Paul where they were both part of the church’s young adult ministry. When they first met Cordell was finishing his Ph.D. at the University of Minnesota and the couple knew they both had strong career ambitions.

When firstborn Isaac arrived it kicked off the discussions about how to juggle children and careers. “Being a new parent I was nervous to send Isaac to day care” Hardy says so she and her husband hired a full-time nanny a young woman they knew from their church who was taking a year off of studies before beginning law school.

“After that we put our kids in day care” Hardy says. “Then when we moved to a bigger house when I was pregnant with our third child we realized that we needed more help. And that’s when we actually started looking into au pairs.”

Financial strain of child care

Their local insurance agent recommended that they try au pairs which typically involves a short-term contract arrangement with someone from abroad who lives with the family and takes care of the children. The Hardys employed au pairs until about two or three years ago and then returned to employing nannies.

It takes two to accommodate two demanding careers. The morning nanny helps get Elijah up and off to day care in the morning while the afternoon nanny picks him up and helps with after-school activities. When the pandemic hit the Hardys furloughed their nannies to follow safety protocols about limiting virus spread. After they learned more about Covid-19 they hired two new nannies who are now part of their Covid bubble.

About six years ago after Cordell’s mother retired she moved from Philadelphia to Woodbury so she could help with driving her grandchildren to events and taking them to doctor’s appointments.

Before the pandemic Hardy says her Kansas-based mother also pitched in. “If Cordell was gone to Asia for a couple of weeks she would come up and help during that time” she says.

Hardy acknowledges that her family has spent a huge amount of money on child care. “The accessibility of affordable child care at all levels is really hard to find” she says which is a major issue that can stymie women’s careers.

In her personal life Hardy says she’s talked to friends early in their careers who asked aloud whether it’s “worth it” to hold certain jobs because their salaries might equal or be less than their child care costs.

“The child care thing is big” Hardy says. “The government can help with that companies can help with that—whether through subsidization or policies to make it more equitable and accessible.”

Hardy says that she and her husband are united in balancing out the work of family life. “We don’t have traditional roles” she says. “My husband does most of the cooking and meal planning and I tend to do most of the activities.”

In their case she says they both have “the mindset” to play the position that’s needed at the given time. “People have to really be in it and intentional about making it work” Hardy says “and not holding so tightly to any stereotypical or familiar roles.”

Joann Lublin author of the new book Power Moms: How Executive Mothers Navigate Work and Life interviewed baby boomer executives and women holding executive roles in their 30s and 40s. “The calculus has changed in terms of the sharing of power on the home front” Lublin tells TCB. “This younger generation of executive moms tend to pick as their partners or husbands or wives individuals who share their outlook about co-parenting and also being partners in terms of the domestic tasks.”

Blazing her own path

Karen Parkhill 55 the chief financial officer of Medtronic just missed the cutoff for the baby boomer generation which contained what Lublin describes as trailblazer women executives.

Early in her career Parkhill encountered the vestiges of male domination in investment banking.

A graduate of Sacred Heart Academy a girls Catholic high school in Springfield Illinois Parkhill originally thought she wanted a career in medicine. But she shifted gears after three semesters at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. “It was an adviser actually who steered me toward the business school and finance because it was related to my love of math” Parkhill recalls. She ultimately earned undergraduate degrees in business administration and mathematics.

She began her professional career at a regional investment bank that’s now part of Dain Rauscher doing public finance work on municipal bonds for cities counties and other government units.

“One of the things that I tell women now is ‘Never ever put your personal life on hold for your professional life.’ ” —Karen Parkhill chief financial officer Medtronic

Three years later she enrolled in a full-time MBA program at the University of Chicago. She thought what she learned at Chicago’s Booth School of Business would be her ticket to the big leagues of investment banking.

She was right. She was hired by JP Morgan in 1992 and moved to New York. But she had a complicated personal life. She was dating Jeff Parkhill whom she had met as a fellow business school student and he had been hired to work for Kraft Foods in Chicago. “We had a long-distance relationship for almost two years” Parkhill says until she was able to land a job in JP Morgan’s new Chicago office.

The couple married on Dec. 31 1994 and planned to have children.

“Sadly back at that time in investment banking there were very few senior women role models” Parkhill says. “And there was this unspoken almost-rule that you shouldn’t have children before you were a vice president. I can’t think of any women back then who had children at a younger career age.”

Parkhill followed the cues of the other JP Morgan women. “I honestly waited until I was a vice president and by that time we were older and we had trouble getting pregnant” she says. “So we ended up having to go through in vitro [fertilization] which is why we were blessed to have twins.” Hayden and Hunter are now 21.

The couple later adopted their daughter Cheney who is 14.

“Things turned out fine” Parkhill says. “But one of the things that I tell women now is ‘Never ever put your personal life on hold for your professional life.’ ”

Before the twins arrived Parkhill needed to come up with a child care solution. “Both my husband and I had big jobs and we both traveled a lot” Parkhill says. “We needed to have the most flexibility that we could have. We had one nanny for the first two years of the boys’ lives and then we hired our second nanny. She is still with us and she is part of our family.”

For a good portion of her career Parkhill says she managed to get promoted by “just working harder than the next person to really prove myself.” Working in the male-oriented investment banking sector women tended to create their own breaks.

“There were a few really great men along the way in my career and all of them were men who either had a spouse who had their own career or had daughters who were ambitious and they wanted their daughters to have strong careers” she says.

Today Parkhill is the executive sponsor of the Medtronic Women’s Network subgroup Commit to Connect which bolsters the corporation’s women vice presidents around the globe. Parkhill says they offer mentors sponsors vice president group sessions and other support to help retain and promote the women into more senior positions at Medtronic.

Parkhill who serves on the board of American Express landed the plum Medtronic CFO job in 2016 after serving as CFO of the Comerica financial services company. She got on the CFO track after making what some might view as a risky move.

“I took a year sabbatical between my investment banking career and my CFO career” she says taking time off about 15 years ago. “I knew that I wanted to do something different and it was impossible for me to figure out when I was on the investment banking treadmill what that was.”

Following the sabbatical she became the CFO for JP Morgan’s commercial banking business.

She’s encouraged women executives at Medtronic to take time off adding when “they come back to the company they haven’t missed a beat.” She contends the sabbaticals are important for people who have long and challenging careers.

Taking a career ‘pause’

Liz Deziel 41 a former senior vice president at U.S. Bank is currently enjoying a sabbatical that she granted herself.

In late October she posted on LinkedIn: “Today was my last day with U.S. Bank. I’m thrilled to share that my next move is to hit pause on my career and spend time with our kids.”

She noted that over 15 years with U.S. Bank she had moved from an administrative assistant to senior vice president and along the way she earned an MBA through evening graduate school and she passed her Certified Financial Planner (CFP) exam. She appeared to be on the fast track in corporate America.

Now she’s focused on supervising the distance learning of her daughters Scarlett 9 and Noelle 7 who are pupils at Garlough Environmental Magnet School in West St. Paul. Deziel’s husband Tom Stukel is a technology professional for their local school district.

“I think women would be more interested in [senior management] roles if they were convinced that the hours the stress the demands and the culture would not suffocate their lives outside of work.” —Liz Deziel former senior vice president U.S. Bank

The couple met when they were undergraduate students at the College of St. Benedict and St. John’s University. “I was fiercely independent” Deziel says with a laugh. “I definitely wasn’t there searching for a husband but I was lucky enough to meet him there.”

Tom was a peace studies major from the small town of Granite Falls while Liz a Burnsville native had a self-designed liberal studies major with philosophy and sociology emphasis areas. She also earned a minor in gender and women’s studies.

Their academic pursuits may have provided an early indicator of the egalitarian relationship they would develop. The couple married in September 2003.

After their daughter Scarlett was born they came up with a child care plan that’s still somewhat rare. “The decision that we made for him to become a stay-at-home dad was one of the easiest decisions we ever made” Deziel says. “I was loving my career and had just landed my first manager role and I had completed my MBA in recent years. Tom had been working for a small nonprofit and enjoyed his work too.”

They had the flexibility to live off of Deziel’s U.S. Bank salary so Stukel stayed home with Scarlett and Noelle and did not return to the workforce until December 2019.

Liz Deziel’s decision to leave U.S. Bank wasn’t made hastily during the pandemic. It had been in the works for a year or so. She had started to feel like she wanted to “trade places” with her husband as the at-home parent.

“In the earlier years he was better suited for that role” she says. “When the kids were babies and toddlers I felt like I had the easier job going to the office. And I liked my work. He handled the exhaustion and the social isolation. He was better at getting on the floor and playing with them and so I didn’t necessarily wish I was in his shoes when the girls were younger.”

At the time she left U.S. Bank Deziel had been working in the bank’s corporate social responsibility area. Previously she had been a senior vice president in the bank’s wealth management business. A few years ago she competed with a male colleague for a market leader position in the Twin Cities. She didn’t get the local job but was offered market leader positions in two other metro areas in the United States. She turned down those opportunities.

“Having family here and having been to college here I feel pretty rooted here and invested in the community” Deziel says. “I have so much history here and I feel so connected to so many aspects of this community that it wouldn’t be worth it to me to give all of that up for a job.”

For the first eight months of the pandemic Deziel was the primary parent at home with her daughters. Deziel did her U.S. Bank work while the girls studied. On some of those days she says “I felt like I was constantly pushing them off” by encouraging them to keep themselves busy while she took part in work video meetings.

Since she left her job the decks are clear for Deziel to enjoy spending time with her daughters and she’s started to cook and do chores around the house that her husband used to do. “I can hang out with [my daughters] on their class breaks and we can play games while they are on a break” she says. “I know they won’t always want to hang out with their mom as much so I am soaking that up. And I’m also enjoying having more open space in my life.”

Deziel emphasizes that she is taking a break from the work world not leaving it for good. As a graduate of a women’s college and longtime

supporter of women’s careers she says she “absolutely” believes that more women should hold C-suite jobs.

However she also urges companies to take a second look at what constitutes success in senior management roles in their workplaces.

“I think women would be more interested in those roles if they were convinced that the hours the stress the demands and the culture would not suffocate their lives outside of work” Deziel says.

Since she posted her career “pause” news on LinkedIn last year she’s engaged in conversations with many women who are reassessing their work and personal lives especially in light of the pandemic.

Women have the capability to perform well in any C-suite job in major companies Deziel says but adds that some women aren’t going to step forward to pursue jobs that currently are designed to be all-consuming and require people to be available 24/7 on a regular basis.

“I have recalibrated what my goals are and I think I’ve realized I am far more motivated by meaning and fulfillment than I am by money and power and status” Deziel says. She hasn’t put a specific timeline on when she’ll reenter the workforce or decided whether she’ll work in the private public or nonprofit sector.

But she’s clear-eyed about her values at home and at work. Deziel says “I look forward to doing more work in the Twin Cities community for a second act after I’ve taken this break and I am excited to pursue that work feeling recharged.”

Hyderabad among preferred locations owing to its ecosystem talent availability and investor-friendly government policies says India chief

By Y V Phani Raj Published Date - 18 April 2021 12:02 AM

The new R&D facility in Hyderabad will focus on several therapeutic areas and innovative technologies.

Hyderabad: India Medtronic the Indian arm of the global medical technology company Medtronic (with a presence in 160 countries) is keen to showcase the country’s manufacturing capabilities to its board and executive committee. The company hopes to bring manufacturing to India and finds Hyderabad among potential locations.

Madan Krishnan vice president and managing director India Medtronic told Telangana Today in an exclusive interview “We are very keen to attract manufacturing to India. We believe that we can support patients and society. The Central government’s production-linked incentive scheme is a good initiative. But it is also important that the domestic market grows in size and the government spends more on healthcare. The attractiveness needs to improve further.”

When asked what would attract the company to explore manufacturing in Telangana he said “Our experience with Telangana has been positive and the government has been very receptive. The ‘Say-Do’ (keeping promises) ratio is very high here and the government engages with the industry well. There are also certain advantages in integrating manufacturing with the R&D center (in the city).

Hyderabad is attractive in terms of a good ecosystem talent availability and investor-friendly policies. We have also received interest from other States. We will evaluate with our board Central and the State governments to see the right approach for manufacturing.”

Hyderabad is significantly contributing to R&D. The team here has already been instrumental in building capabilities in the area of remote monitoring of ventilators in collaboration with Intel amid the pandemic.

Driving innovation

The company recently opened its newly expanded Medtronic Engineering and Innovation Center (MEIC) in Hyderabad. The 150000 square feet center employs engineers for software development & testing test automation mechanical design analysis and hardware. The company during the pandemic has hired 150 engineers from Hyderabad and other talent hubs across India. There are plans to more than double hiring in Medtronic’s next fiscal that starts in May.

MEIC received an investment of Rs 1200 crore ($160 million) for expansion in Hyderabad. This investment spread over five years aims to foster global innovation and create new job opportunities. This is being spent on a combination of physical infrastructure lab and technology equipment as well as human and scientific capital.

Krishnan said “While the physical infrastructure spent is almost over scientific spending will continue while human capital investment will ramp up even more in the coming years. Though the investment is entitled to five years we may spend this amount much earlier in all growth areas.”

Building collaborations

Medtronic continues to explore collaboration opportunities. Recently the company and Apollo Hospitals have partnered towards using artificial intelligence to accelerate the diagnosis of strokes bringing down the time to diagnose from hours to few minutes (2-3 minutes). Apollo has a strong heritage of surgical and physician specialties and this partnership is key.

“We will also look at wide partnerships in the startup ecosystem in India including T-Hub besides entering into curriculum collaborations with good institutions partnerships with Governments of Telangana and Kerala ties in the area of skill development and building biomedical engineering capabilities” he informed.

Therapeutic outcomes

The MEIC serves as a global hub for development testing and qualification for some of the most advanced and innovative technologies. The setting up of the new R&D facility will focus on various therapeutic areas including respiratory intervention remote patient monitoring and digital health surgical robotics electrosurgical generators cardiac rhythm and heart failure and navigation.

He added “We are looking at invention innovation and disruption in technology through our Hyderabad operations. We are addressing unmet needs and improving several therapeutic outcomes by using technologies and bringing together clinicians and engineers. We want to make the maximum impact. Out of the major 20 divisions of Medtronic globally we hope to get a majority of them to come to Hyderabad to utilize the capabilities here. We will also contribute in terms of data and regulatory management.”

Divya Prakash Joshi senior director and site leader MEIC Hyderabad added “Among the several therapeutic areas we are also actively looking at neurosciences surgical robotics (embedded and algorithm development software) suitable for different devices software implantable use of data analytics in cardiac rhythm management and cybersecurity. Most of our focus will be on the software while there will be some emphasis on mechanical design hardware and program management.”

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."

Release of pent-up demand from across the country since the economy opened up has helped the company deliver strong performance particularly in the last two quarters. It reported double-digit volume growth during the December quarter of FY21.

Pidilite Industries is a dominant player in the market for its products has strong market penetration and good brand recognition. The company has witnessed business recovery across its business segments including adhesives and sealants industrial resins and pigment preparations. The acquisition of Huntsman Advanced Material Solution (name changed to PAPL - Pidilite Adhesives Pvt) in November last year is likely to strengthen the company’s adhesives and sealants business. PAPL has presence across the country and is a market leader in epoxy adhesives (an industrial adhesive used for both metal and plastics) which is likely to aid in revenue going forward.

Further improved demand conditions across sectors including construction automotive and other industries should help in the revenue growth of the company. Being the market leader in most of its products it has good command over pricing. The company has negligible debt level.

Despite the positives investors can consider partially exiting the stock at this point high valuation being the main reason; at ₹1806 Pidilite Industries is trading at 94 times its trailing 12-month earnings higher than its five-year average (60 times). While there is no direct comparison for Pidilite it is still expensive when compared to its closest competitor Godrej Industries trading at 40 times its twelve-month earnings.

Also as most of its raw materials are crude derivatives benign crude oil prices helped in the growth of the company last year. But since November 2020 crude oil prices have been slowly inching up. From $35-$37 per barrel prices are currently $65-$67 per barrel. With crude prices rising the company’s margins could take a hit.

Market position

The company operates in two major segments. One is consumer and bazaar (C&B) which includes adhesives and sealants construction and chemicals and art and crafts materials. This segment is the main-stay contributing nearly 80 per cent of the revenue of which 50 per cent is driven by adhesives and sealants products. The company has an extensive distribution network with pan-India presence which helps in easy access to its products in both urban and rural areas. The C&B segment caters to the needs of people from varied professions including painters plumbers and carpenters helping the company achieve a dominant position in the market as well.

The balance revenue about 19 per cent comes from its industries segment where the products including resins chemicals adhesives and pigments cater to industrial needs.

Though the company has a strong presence in both its segments it faces competition from small regional players and a few large players. In its industrial segment particularly paints and other chemical companies have started expanding their market base. For instance Asian Paints entered the water proofing business a few years back. Other products where the company faces stiff competition include wood finishes and paints and construction and chemicals.

While the presence of competitors may not have much impact on companies like Pidilite in the near term it may affect its pricing power in the long run.

Rise in input costs

For most paints adhesives sealants and chemical companies the raw materials are derivatives of crude oil. With lockdown in many countries crude oil prices were benign and helped these dependent companies including Pidilite to save on their input costs and improve margins.

For Pidilite for the September quarter of FY21 raw material cost (as a percentage of sales) stood at 38 per cent about one percentage point lower compared to the same period last year. But in the December quarter of FY21 it stood at 40 per cent about 2 per cent lower compared to the December quarter last year (42 per cent). This helped improve the company’s operating margin. For the same period the operating margin improved to 28 per cent from 24 per cent in December quarter last year.

As the world economies opened up crude oil prices started to increase due to production cut by oil producers. Since then companies whose raw materials are crude oil derivatives have witnessed rise in their input costs including Pidilite. With continued increase in the cost of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) a key raw material Pidilite’s margin is likely to come under pressure going ahead. This along with volatile rupee also adds to margin woes. According to the management the company has taken price hike in its industrial segment of products (B2B products) due to rise in raw material costs but it is yet to decide on price hikes in the C&B segment.

Given that the company is the market leader in various products such as Fevicol and M-Seal it can pass on the input cost increase under normal circumstances which could aid margins. However given the slowdown in the economy price hikes could also impact demand and hence the company may not resort to the same.

Financials

The company was able to improve its earnings despite the challenging market conditions and register double-digit volume growth of over 20 per cent during the December quarter FY21 when compared to the same period last year. During the same period it reported revenue and profit growth of 20 per cent y-o-y to ₹2299 crore and profit growth of 29 per cent y-o-y to ₹446 crore. The company has stable financials. Its revenue and profit registered annual average growth of 5.2 per cent and 6.8 per cent between FY16 and FY20.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vcHJvZ2FtZWd1aWRlcy5jb20vcm9ibG94L2hvdy10by1nZXQtc3BhcmtzLWtpbG93YXR0cy1zZWNyZXQtcGFja2FnZS1pbi1jbHViLXJvYmxveC1yb2Jsb3gtbWV0YXZlcnNlLWNoYW1waW9ucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to get Sparks Kilowatt's Secret Package in Club Roblox | Roblox Metaverse Champions,"Sparks Kilowatt has left us some treasure in Club Roblox during Week 1 of Metaverse Champions.

Your Nevada State Democratic Party – ok it’s not “your” anymore if you’re Harry Reid – says it raised the $450000 and then some that the grownups extracted from party coffers when the lefties won election to executive seats and freaked out the media. Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were putting out mailers urging people to donate which evidently people did.

Meanwhile the grownups or Reidites or the establishment or whatever you wanna call ’em appear to be working mostly through the Home Means Nevada PAC which was a Sisolak thing and maybe still is? Or maybe it’s evolved I don’t know I don’t really follow these things.

Home Means Nevada – the PAC not the song – needn’t rely on inspirational progressives like Sanders or AOC to whip up donations. For instance in October Nevada Gold Mines the unholy alliance between Barrick and Newmont which accounts for the overwhelming majority of Nevada gold production just cold gave Home Means Nevada (the PAC not the song) a half million dollars.

And there’s plenty more where that came from especially since Democrats in the Legislature are about to pass the industry’s preferred i.e. the weakest mining tax constitutional amendment (assuming they pass one at all). And then most elected Democrats including and especially your governor will try to ignore the fact that the amendment is on the 2022 ballot.

If past performance is any indication of future results the resort real estate/development financial pharmaceutical and other industries will also continue to contribute handsomely to Home Means Nevada (the PAC not the song). So don’t worry. There will be plenty of ads next year telling voters to vote Democratic because hey Home Means Nevada!

Reid Machine or Reid myth? When Uncle Joe won Georgia he “received a small but potentially important boost from the state’s conservative areas if at least one local Democrat was running in a down-ballot race” even if the Democrat lost according to some research the NYT reported on this week.

This reminded me of Nevada in 2014 except sort of in reverse – there wasn’t at least one Democrat running at the top of the ballot not even to lose. Democrats didn’t run a candidate for governor (a guy won the nomination despite losing the primary to none of the above but he had no campaign). Instead the much-vaunted and Holy Sacred Reid Machine tried to pretend the race for Nevada lieutenant governor was something Nevada Democratic voters should care about.

For the record no race for Nevada lieutenant governor is ever anything anyone should ever care about and in fact the office of Nevada lieutenant governor should be abolished. But I digress.

And so what happened in 2014? My usual answer to that question is Ask Steven Horsford. But you’ll recall that’s also the year Democrats lost both houses of the Legislature and holy smackers Michele Fiore was momentarily chairing a committee and for about five minutes there Ira Hansen was going to be Assembly Speaker until Dennis Myers told people about the confederate battle flag in Hansen’s home office.

Nevada got a private school voucher bill and some gun nut crap and a bunch of other wingnut stuff thanks to GOP control of the Legislature. Fortunately newly reelected Gov. Brian Sandoval remembered that it is the duty of every Nevada governor in the 21st century to swear “no new taxes” during the first term but create some in the second.

An so in conclusion: Whenever I see references to the amazing power and success of the Reid Machine of which there has been much written lately I can’t help but think of 2014 – or the Sanders performance in caucuses in 2016 and 2020 or the Reidites losing party leadership posts this year – and wonder if the thing Reid built is machine or myth.

You may know John Boehner because he is the co-chair of the MGM Resorts Public Policy Institute at UNLV. OK maybe you did not know he was that because you have never heard of the MGM Resorts Public Policy Institute at UNLV which is fair. (The other co-chair by the way is Harry Reid. Boehner once said FU to Reid a rudeness that area media has always seemed to consider just yowza).

It turns out the MGM-UNLV thing is not the only prestigious position on Boehner’s resume. He was also Speaker of the United States House of Representatives for several years during the Obama administration when the House was primarily a Tea Party enterprise committed to (and ultimately succeeding at) thwarting any and every meaningful piece of legislation proposed by Obama from 2011 through the rest of Obama’s presidency for you know reasons.

One time at a Tea Party rally Boehner even did that thing every Republican who knows and loves the Constitution more than you do does eventually: He held up his pocket version of the Constitution pledged to “stand here with our Founding Fathers who wrote in the preamble…” and then proceeded to quote the Declaration of Independence.

Now he has written a book in which he says never mind about all that Tea Party facilitating he did for all those years because he didn’t really mean it and he was just going along because as he’s saying on his book tour…

“And even though I didn’t really want to go the direction where the team’s going they were the ones who elected me to be the leader and I had an obligation to go lead them… So that means I had to go jump out in front of them even if I thought what they were trying to do really made not a whole lot of sense.”

In other words he is the worst leader of anything that has ever been led ever.

Now no doubt after careful consultation with his publisher regarding a combination of Boehner’s brand current events and things John Boehner might say that might have at least some chance of selling a book Boehner is calling today’s Republicans “crazy” and “knuckleheads.”

It’s true they are. So thanks for that much John Boehner aka Captain Obvious.

But it is also true that the road to crazy knuckleheads was paved by years of Republican “leaders” going along pretending Sarah Palin was a serious person misquoting the Constitution and otherwise applauding and encouraging the dumbing down and destabilization that culminated in Trump. So remember that aforementioned FU of Boehner’s? Back at ya Boehner. I hope nobody buys your dumb book.

The MGM/UNLV thing by the way pursues “case-based research brings together expert viewpoints curates compelling content and spotlights promising projects that are addressing fundamental questions about the future of work.” What Boehner (or Reid for that matter) has to do with any of that has always eluded readily evident explanation.

Jorge Linares Sold Out For May 29th Fight At Mandalay Bay,"By Matt Lieberman: Eddie Hearn reports that tickets have already sold out for the May 29th Matchroom Boxing event between WBC lightweight champion Devin ‘The Dream’ Haney (25-0 15 KOs) and Jorge Linares (47-5 29 KOs) at the Mandalay Bay Resort [now known as the “Michelob Ultra Arena] in Las Vegas Nevada.

Hearn says he’s working with Mandalay Bay to open up more seating to accommodate the high interest in the Haney – Linares fight.

This is a good sign for Hern that Haney 22 has solid out the Mandalay Bay so quickly as he’s from the Bay Arena in California. Haney’s fans are willing to travel to Las Vegas to see him fight in large enough numbers to sell out the Mandalay Bay in light speed.

Hearn isn’t saying how many additional tickets will be put on sale but those will go quickly.

This could be his last fight for Haney before he faces the winner of the July 9th fight between interim WBC lightweight champion Ryan Garcia and Javier Fortuna.

“All #HaneyLinares tickets are now SOLD OUT. We are working with

@MandalayBay to try and release more tickets – look forward to a great night in Vegas! @DAZNBoxing @Realdevinhaney” said Eddie Hearn.

Haney needs to look good in the Linares fight because he hasn’t shined in his last two matches against Yuriorkis Gamboa and Alfredo Santiago. He was forced to go the full 12 rounds in both of those fights and his power didn’t look that impressive.

The last fight in which Haney put on a spectacular performance was in his fight against Zaur Abdullaev in 2019. That was against a fighter that hadn’t done anything to be ranked in the top 15.

Like Ryan Garcia we don’t know how good Haney is as a fighter. We know he can outbox a lot of guys with marginal power but we don’t know how he will react when he gets inside the ring with a puncher like Linares Ryan Garcia and Teofimo Lopez.

Hearn is in a hurry to put together a fight between Haney and Ryan Garcia. Still he’s not shown the same sense of urgency about letting Devin fight Teofimo Lopez Gervonta ‘Tank’ Davis and Vasily Lomachenko. It could be that Hearn realizes that Haney can’t beat any of those fighters and that’s why he’s not pushing hard to make the fights.

The 35-year-old Linares could spoil things for Hearn if he beats Haney on May 29th. The hardcore boxing fans realize that Linares is faster and more powerful than Haney; they won’t be shocked if he beats him.",,,,,,,,,

A crushing computer chip shortage continues to choke the global supply chain.

Automakers are producing vehicles without smart technology — which requires chips — Apple's MacBook and iPad production was reportedly delayed and PlayStation 5s are being produced in limited amounts due to the squeeze.

It's an effect caused over time by pandemic-driven shutdowns and soaring demand for products that need chips.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

But one question that has emerged during the crisis is where chips are produced — and why the US doesn't manufacture much of the global supply.

Here's why it doesn't.

Chips are difficult to produce and it's cheaper for US companies to outsource

In 1990 the US produced 37% of the world's chip supply according to a September 2020 report from the Semiconductor Industry Association. But now the country is responsible for just 12% of global chip production.

Seventy-five percent of the world's chip manufacturing comes out of Asia per the report and China is positioned to become the largest chip producer by 2030.

Why the decline in the US? It became cheaper to build chip facilities in countries outside of the US. Those foreign governments offer more attractive financial incentives to construct semiconductor factories like tax breaks and grants. There's also less regulation in places like Asia. On top of that there aren't as many jobs in the US created to run such high-tech factories.

There was a recent attempt to do so under the Trump administration — Apple supplier Foxconn was slated to build a Wisconsin facility that would produce large-screen TV displays and said it would create 13000 jobs but the whole project never panned out.

Some of the country's largest chip manufacturers are also some of the biggest in the world. Intel still produces much of its chip supply at home as the Wall Street Journal reported. But other major US chip producers outsource manufacturing to companies in Asia due to costs. One of those foreign contract companies is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company which produces more than half of the world's computer chips and is also Apple's primary supplier.

Making computer chips is a complex process. It's also difficult and expensive to build new facilities to manufacture the vital silicon component which means companies have to rely on existing plants. A new semiconductor factory can cost up to $20 billion as ON Semiconductor CEO Keith Jackson wrote in Fortune and that price tag is much higher in the US.

There are economic and national security benefits to ramping up US chip production

There could be risks in depending on foreign chipmakers if the US continues to fall behind China in the chip race as the Journal notes.

President Joe Biden is aware of the issue and the threats posed by relying too heavily on foreign manufacturing. As part of Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure plan there's a $50 billion allotment for domestic chip manufacturing incentives.

In a Monday meeting Biden said the key to navigating the current chip shortage crisis is to invest in the country's chip production.

""We need to build the infrastructure of today and not repair the one of yesterday"" Biden said according to NBC News. ""The plan I propose will protect our supply chain and revitalize American manufacturing.""

But as Recode notes it won't be a simple task to transition reliance to homegrown chip production. There will be a handful of factors to consider over time like weaning off of foreign contract manufacturers and ensuring there are enough US workers to power new facilities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYXUubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vc2hvcHBlcnMtY3JlZXB5LWZpbmQtaW4tbmV3LXVuZGVyd2Vhci1ib3VnaHQtb25saW5lLTIyNTk1NTE1OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shopper's creepy find in new underwear bought online,"A shopper who bought underwear online was concerned after she found a small microchip sewn inside the garment.

The woman claimed she bought maternity clothing and postpartum compression underwear from online retailer SHEIN when she noticed the additional feature after it was delivered.

""Am I being tracked for buying maternity clothes and postpartum compression panties?"" she asked people in a Facebook group dedicated to sharing weird finds.

It is believed the chip found in the garment is an RFID tag. Source: Facebook

While some suggested it was an RFID tag which could be used for tracking and tracing purposes or contain information about the garment other said it was ""scary"".

Many commented saying RFID tags were commonly used to track items and prevent theft and one said it was ""disturbing"" it had been sewn into the garment rather than it being attached to a tag or packaging.

""I have never seen anything like this"" one commented.

'How creepy"" another said.

Truth behind chip in underwear

Strategic supply chain management lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney Dr Moira Scerri told Yahoo News Australia there were two types of RFID tags.

""One of the tags has information stored on it about the product like a barcode and the other one has a small battery on it – a transponder – that can read and respond"" she said.

""A lot of companies have been using them – in supermarkets they are on a lot of razor blades and anything that is of high risk of theft.

""It's also used in the supply chain for track and trace capabilities so you always know where the good is.""

In regards to concerns a person's location could be identified Dr Scerri said if the chip did contain a transponder the item could be tracked if it was still sewn into the garment while you were wearing it.

""Could if be used for tracking people if they are wearing that underwear yes it could but there are other ways people can be tracked like through their phones"" she said.

""I don't think it would be a privacy issue it's more [companies] would use it for the supply chain as they move to e-commerce – and that makes sense – if you do a lot of e-commerce you want to know where your goods are at any time.""

RFID technology could become more common

Dr Scerri added the RFID technology was expensive and it cost about $1 chip but expected them to become more commonplace in the future if the price drops.

""It definitely has its uses and it hasn't taken off as quickly as some people would have thought because of the cost"" she said.

""They are becoming more and more common but because of the cost we haven't seen mass adoption – I think everyone is waiting for the cost to come down and to work out who is going to pay for them whether that be the retailer supplier or distributor.""

SHEIN did not confirm to Yahoo News Australia what the item was sewn into the underwear but rubbished claims it was an RFID tag.

""SHEIN does not use any RFID or microchip tags in our product. Any assumption or accusation that the brand tracks its customers is absolutely false"" a spokesperson said.

Yet a lot of those hall-of-famers might end up staying offshore.

The country has targeted a wish list of companies from Europe Japan South Korea and Taiwan. It includes Taiwanese majors Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company VIA Technologies and United Microelectronics Corporation. US giants Intel Micron Technology NXP Semiconductors and Texas Instruments are on the list along with European chipmaker Infineon and Fuji Electric and Panasonic of Japan.

India’s recruitment comes after governments across the world have started subsidising construction of semiconductor plants a way to ease chip shortages that are hobbling the automotive and electronics industries and highlighting the world’s dependence on Taiwan for supplies.

India wants to establish reliable suppliers for its own formidable electronics and telecom industry so it cuts dependence on China which today supplies 65% of the country’s $50 billion annual semiconductor consumption.

The proposal is simple on paper: make in India and get $1 billion in cash incentives.

The Indian government is also ready to offer manufacturers assurances by buying the chips and mandating that certain industries buy made-in-India chips from Indian plants. India-based chip makers would be tagged as “trusted sources”.

Not convinced

But even if the offer looks compelling global chips makers are reluctant.

In Taiwan at least seven local semiconductor companies have met the island’s deputy economic affairs minister Shen Jong-chin twice to understand how they might invest in India but they reached no conclusion.

“In terms of the fab location selection there are many factors to consider in order to fulfil our customer’s needs” a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) spokesperson told Asia Times Financial. “TSMC does not rule out any possibility but there is no concrete plan to set up fabs in India at this time.” TSMC is the world’s largest contract chipmaker.

Fellow Taiwanese chipmaker United Microelectronics Corp said the company is “open to evaluating all regions for projects provided that the opportunity fits with the company’s ROI objectives.”

But company spokesman Richard Yu added that the company “generally prefers regions closer to Taiwan to ease logistics and management while still providing manufacturing risk mitigation through geographic diversity.” The company better known as UMC has factories now in Taiwan China Japan and Singapore.

Inadequate facilities

India is not always an easy place for setting up a chip fabrication plant.

Experts say semiconductor manufacturing (fab) is a complex techno-commercial operation that requires large investments business and operational ability. They say it requires grasping all the right ingredients such as the market private investment infrastructure and technology itself.

Putting all that together is a tall order.

“India lacks infrastructure that foreign factories expect and has an incomplete semiconductor supply chain – meaning higher shipping costs” Taiwan-based boutique market analysis firm Isaiah Research told ATF.

The biggest hurdles are the country’s constantly changing rules and policies as well as infrastructural bottlenecks some analysts believe.

“Fluctuation in India’s laws make business people unsure” Cheng Kai-an an industry analyst with Taipei-based Market Intelligence & Consulting Institute told ATF adding that Taiwanese chipmakers have particularly found India’s electricity and water supplies unstable.

Crush to get chips

Yet the country needs chipset manufacturers – and lots of them. The global semiconductor shortage and geopolitical tensions with China are not only beginning to hurt the country’s manufacturing but those factors also heighten India’s need for attaining self-sufficiency in the semiconductor supply chain.

India’s semiconductor consumption which was already facing a demand-supply crisis following delays from China after the Indo-China border clash last year is now facing massive supply chain issues according to a recent report by professional services firm EY.

The global semiconductor industry relies on a few global players for high-end chips – which led to the shortage following pandemic-era demand for devices to support telework and home study. Automotive chip orders have added to that demand. China and Taiwan own a significant portion of the semiconductor manufacturing market in the world the EY report says.

Consequently “fabs assume significance in view of the fact that India is poised to increase its share in global manufacturing of mobile phones IT hardware automotive electronics industrial electronics medical electronics IoT and other devices in the near future as it aspires to have $400 billion of electronics manufacturing by the year 2025” the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said when inviting investors from the target list.

For foreign chipmakers India offers a suite of incentives called the Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors to run over eight years. India should attract investors with its “cost-effective” skilled labour “fast improving” infrastructure and a domestic electronic components market that’s on track to reach $200bn by 2025 about 10 times the amount of 2019 the Indian National Investment Promotion & Facilitation Agency says.

India’s bid could be a big attention-grabber for private and foreign fab investors say experts.

“The biggest strength India has today is the market for electronics products and domestic manufacturing” Satya Gupta the chairman of India Electronics and Semiconductor Association a trade group with more than 300 members told ATF.

Domestic manufacturing of electronics products has potential to grow $400 billon — of which $250 billion would be consumed locally and $150 billion exported Gupta says. That growth “creates a good demand for semiconductors products and makes the business case of Fabs stronger” the chairman added.

India’s intent and efforts work in its favour too others say.

While India has already announced various incentive schemes at the national level many state governments are ready and eager to provide incentives and infrastructure for electronics and semiconductor manufacturing.

“Today India is the second largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world. Few years ago no one would have imagined that. The same way semiconductor manufacturing can happen in India” Venkata Simhadri the CEO of MosChip an Indian fabless semiconductor company told ATF.

“But it needs lot more support and commitment from the government and the industry.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL2Jpei9hcmNoaXZlcy8yMDIxLzA0LzE3LzIwMDM3NTU4MjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citibank seeks to reassure customers,"Citibank seeks to reassure customers

RETAIL BANKING EXIT: Clients are concerned whether their rights would be protected while employees were caught by surprise as the bank had just upgraded its services

By Kao Shih-ching / Staff reporter





Citibank Taiwan Ltd (花旗台灣) yesterday said that credit card clients could continue using their cards as operations would continue normally until it sells its consumer banking business.

As of February the bank had 2.86 million credit cards in circulation in Taiwan of which 2.17 million had been used in the past six months ranking it sixth among all banks data from the Financial Supervisory Commission showed.

Credit card spending by Citibank clients totaled NT$15.66 billion (US$552.6 million) in February also ranking sixth among banks in Taiwan. Citibank was the only foreign bank that made it into the top six.

Customers should not be concerned about using their Citi cards as the bank would be operating normally until it finds a buyer for its consumer banking business with no timeline set at the moment the bank said.

Those who have taken personal loans mortgages or other types of loans from Citibank should continue paying their debt it said.

The announcement on Thursday by Citigroup Inc the bank’s parent company that it would exit the retail banking business in 13 markets — including Taiwan — has raised concern among Taiwanese consumers with many wondering whether their rights would be protected.

Some Citi credit card holders told the Taipei Times that they were not clear if there is a deadline for redeeming their cash rewards or how long other types of rewards such as a 40 percent discount on movie tickets would last.

The Financial Supervisory Commission which on Thursday confirmed that Citibank Taiwan is seeking a buyer for its consumer banking business yesterday said it would ask the buyer to ensure that consumers’ rights are protected.

Citibank Taiwan held a videoconference yesterday morning to try to reassure its employees saying that its decision would not affect them “immediately.”

However some staff members speaking on the condition of anonymity told the Taipei Times that they felt confused and unprepared.

The bank had just in December last year revamped its three credit cards by offering better rewards and improved its digital banking app to attract new customers they said.

That did not suggest that it would be closing its consumer banking business in less than five months they said.

Citibank Taiwan actually planned to expand its local investment and recruit more talent at the beginning of this year people familiar with the matter said.

Meanwhile DBS Bank Taiwan (星展銀行) yesterday said that it would not comment on market speculation that it would acquire Citibank Taiwan’s consumer banking operation.

Citibank Taiwan reported a pretax profit of US$338 million for last year ranking first among all foreign banks in the nation company data showed.

Its return on assets and return on equity stood at 1.14 percent and 9.18 percent respectively last year higher than the market averages the data showed.",,,,,,,,,

Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 review: Steps in the right direction MSRP $1800.00 Score Details “Microsoft's Surface Laptop 4 is easily the best in the line so far thanks to huge advances in performance.” Pros AMD chips widely available in configurations

Thinnest 15-inch laptop

Superb build quality

Great typing experience

Long-lasting battery life Cons Older AMD chips hold back performance

Thick bezels poor webcam

Well Microsoft did it. It finally fixed the Surface Laptop 4.

The previous model was plagued by poor performance and a lack of solid configurations to choose from. For the 15-inch model in particular that made it hard to recommend as a good laptop.

But with the Surface Laptop 4 Microsoft has resolved those issues thanks in part to the incredible performance and battery life of some new AMD processors. I checked out the 15-inch Surface Laptop 4 which included an eight-core Ryzen 7 processor 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. That added up to $1800 which finally feels like a reasonable cost for what the Surface Laptop 4 offers.

Video Review

Jump to: Design | Performance | Battery Life | Display and Speakers | Keyboard and Touchpad | Our Take

Design

There are many things to adore about the design of the Surface Laptop — even in 2021. All of those things are still intact with the Surface Laptop 4 which leaves the chassis relatively unchanged.

It’s still as remarkably thin as ever at just 0.58 inches for the 15-inch model. That thinness is really noticeable in the palm rests which are barely raised off the table. That’s especially true if you’re used to thicker laptops in this category such as the Dell XPS 15 (0.71 inches thick) or MacBook Pro 16-inch (0.64 inches thick).

Of course those laptops have larger chassis to support the extra performance you can configure. Because the Surface Laptop 4 doesn’t support discrete graphics or 45-watt processors Microsoft’s able to go razor-thin. It’s still an accomplishment though — the similarly configured LG Gram 16 for example is still a larger 0.66 inches thick. That makes the Surface Laptop 4 the slimmest 15-inch laptop you can buy.

The tiny stature of the chassis makes its build quality that much more impressive. You won’t find the bend or flex that’s common in laptops this thin. The lid is rigid the hinge opens with one finger and there isn’t too much screen wobble either. It’s a superbly manufactured device worthy of the Surface brand.

I also like what the ultrathin design does to emphasize the screen. The Surface Laptop 4 is one of the few 15-inch laptops that offer a 3:2 screen — and it’s glorious. The bezels are larger than I’d like but in the 15-inch form factor they’re less egregious.

Ports include a USB-C 3.1 USB-A a headphone jack and the magnetized Surface Connect. Microsoft continues to ignore the existence of Thunderbolt 4 which means the USB-C port isn’t as fast as it is on other laptops. The docking capabilities of the Surface Connect port are great though it’s all proprietary.

Performance

The new components are what makes the Surface Laptop 4 what it is. It now comes with a wide selection of Intel and AMD processors. AMD’s Ryzen processors debuted in the Surface Laptop 3 but they were a year behind with Ryzen 3000 chips. Performance was disappointing especially in the context of a large 15-inch laptop. It made it very hard to compete with rivals like the XPS 15 or MacBook Pro 16-inch. Microsoft’s first embrace of AMD didn’t go over all that well.

The Surface Laptop 4 does two important things to fix this problem. First it makes Ryzen processors available in both the 13.5-inch and 15-inch sizes. The smaller size is limited to the six-core Ryzen 5 while the 15-inch model exclusively offers the eight-core Ryzen 7. Those extra cores add a lot of performance potential to the Surface Laptop 4 especially in the 15-inch model which needs all the power Microsoft and AMD can squeeze into it.

The Surface Laptop 4 is pretty powerful thanks to that Ryzen processor.

These are still a year behind though they use Ryzen 4000 processors. It feels a bit more forgivable given the current drought in chip supplies. More importantly AMD made its biggest generational performance leap with Ryzen 4000 so the Surface Laptop 4 benefits from those gains.

And that definitely proved true in my testing. Those four extra cores mean huge improvements in multi-core performance. That was obvious in benchmarks like Geekbench and Cinebench. In anything that only relies on the CPU like video encoding in Handbrake the Surface Laptop 4 is pretty powerful thanks to that Ryzen processor. It also performed quite well in the photo editing test in PCMark 10 which makes them a half-decent option for photographers and that’s not something I could have said about the previous model.

Geekbench (single/multi) Cinebench R23 (single/multi) PCMark 10 3DMark Time Spy Surface Laptop 4 15 1016 / 6658 1137 / 5881 4849 1177 LG Gram 16 1573 / 5454 1394 / 4137 4827 1390 Lenovo Yoga 9i 15 (Core i7-10750H) 1532 / 5415 1141 / 6400 4800 3487 MacBook Air (M1) 1727 / 7585 1479 / 6680 n/a n/a Asus ZenBook 13 OLED (Ryzen 7 5800U) 1423 / 6758 1171 / 7824 6034 1342 Surface Laptop 3 15 900 / 3056 722 / 2407 n/a 835

Based on my testing the thinness of the Surface Laptop 4 still holds it back. Less thickness means less room for airflow. Outside of the Surface Book line this is true of all of the Surface products. But because of its size a lot of potential buyers might get fooled into thinking this is a serious workstation. It’s certainly not — there will always be tasks the Surface Laptop 4 isn’t fit for such as video editing.

I benchmarked the Surface Laptop 4 in PugetBench for Premiere Pro which tests everything from 4K playback to video encoding. It’s sad to say but the 15-inch Surface Laptop 4 pales in comparison to the M1 MacBook Air. It’s not even close — and that’s a far cheaper laptop. The graphics are the culprit here which can greatly speed up tasks in Premiere.

It is possible to play games but it ain’t pretty.

To be fair the Radeon graphics are a massive improvement over the Vega 9 graphics I tested in the Surface Laptop 3. They performed over 30% faster in 3DMark Time Spy. If Microsoft had gone with Ryzen 5000 the graphics performance would be more up to par with the Intel models.

Because of the lack of a graphics card the Surface Laptop 4 is really not something you want to game on. I tried out Civilization VI and Fortnite and the results were meager. You won’t want to play any game at full resolution but if you drop the settings in Civilization VI to Medium you can get some playable frame rates out of it. I wouldn’t bother with a game like Fortnite. I had to drop the pixel resolution to 1620 x 1080p and the 3D resolution down to 70% to reach 60 frames per second (fps). It is possible to play but it ain’t pretty.

Battery life

Aside from performance battery life is the most important advancement Microsoft has made with the Surface Laptop 4. Microsoft claims you’ll get 17-and-a-half hours with this configuration but I never got quite that much. I did however get 13-and-a-half hours in my test which runs through a series of websites until the battery dies.

That’s really impressive especially for a laptop of this size. It’s close to four hours more than the last iteration — which puts it in the league of laptops like the LG Gram 16 and many other laptops with 1080p screens.

This might be the first Surface product that exceeded my expectations in terms of battery life which is a good sign for Microsoft. It’s the one case where the lack of a bunch of power-hungry components is a benefit.

It should be noted that Microsoft says you can get a couple hours more with the 13.5-inch AMD model while the Intel models will be around an hour less.

Display and speakers

The Surface Laptop 4 features a gorgeous 2256 x 1504 pixel resolution that’s sharp bright (378 nits) and color-accurate. I appreciate that Microsoft only sells one resolution per size meaning you don’t have to bother picking between a 1080p and 4K model both of which have weak spots. It’s the MacBook approach and it ensures that you get a sharp screen no matter what.

I should note that the color saturation isn’t quite up to par with competitors which again reinforces the target demographic for this laptop which isn’t creative professionals. The screen hits 97% of the sRGB color space but only 73% of AdobeRGB. Microsoft offers an sRGB color mode found in the display settings but it didn’t improve the color saturation.

The speakers are located under the keyboard where they are pointed upward. I prefer this location t0 the bottom of the chassis but the sound isn’t as clear as laptops that position them next to the keyboard instead such as the Dell XPS 15 and MacBook Pro. The sound itself has a more full-bodied audio profile than many other laptops with even a slight hint of bass. The addition of Dolby Atmos this time around adds some much-needed stereo separation which helps give the Surface Laptop 4 a decent music-listening and show-watching experience.

Keyboard and touchpad

The Surface Laptop 4 has an excellent keyboard and touchpad. It’s a spacious layout and the keys have a long 1.3mm travel. It makes for a very comfortable typing experience. The keys do have very even and consistent white backlighting but with only three levels of brightness control.

I also have lots of good things to say about the glass touchpad which tracks smoothly and offers plenty of space for multi-finger gestures. Palm rejection is great as well making me wish Microsoft used a larger touchpad in the 15-inch model. It would fill the empty space of the palm rests better as we’ve seen in many other laptops as of late.

The laptop doesn’t include a fingerprint reader instead relying solely on the IR camera for secure logins. I like when laptops offer both choices but Windows Hello is lightning fast on the Surface Laptop 4.

The webcam could have used an update though. It’s only 720p which is still the common spec in laptops unfortunately. We’re seeing some new laptops move to 1080p in 2021 and I would have loved for Microsoft to have been at the forefront of that trend to support people working from home.

Our take

The Surface Laptop 4 isn’t perfect. The chassis could still use some modernization and I wish Microsoft had used Ryzen 5000. But both the 13.5 and 15-inch are now much better work laptops because of the improved performance and battery life. The Surface Laptop 4 has turned the corner.

Are there any alternatives?

The LG Gram 16 takes a similar approach to a large ultrathin laptop that isn’t geared toward content creators.

It’s hard not to recommend the Dell XPS 15 which has options for integrated or discrete graphics. You’ll find a couple of cheaper options than the Surface Laptop 4 as well but they won’t have the sharp 3:2 screen.

How long will it last?

The Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 should last you at least four or five years so long as you don’t get envious when the chassis inevitably gets redesigned.

Should you buy it?

Yes. The changes Microsoft has made to this design in its fourth iteration make it a great option.

Those with a paid account have access to a variety of functions that make it easier to work as part of a virtual team.

All accounts have access to the essentials though presentations to large groups requires a premium account. During these meetings you can present anything from PowerPoint presentations to charts and quarterly goals in a Word document so long as you have access to the needed permissions to use presentation mode.

Presenter View also gives you granular control over who can access what and when. If you don’t want colleagues skipping ahead in your presentation for example you can freeze or lock it so that they can’t get a peek at future slides or pages in a Word document. Or you can just upload the file to specific channels keeping everyone outside the meeting group from accessing it.

Here’s how to get started with Presenter View on Microsoft Teams.

1) In a Team meeting click the Share tray icon to open the presentation menu.

In January we reported on a new Windows 10 vulnerability discovered by Jonas Lykkegård that allows any user or program even those with low privileges to mark an NTFS drive as corrupted simply by accessing the special ​folder.

What is particularly concerning is how easy it is easy to trigger the bug. By simply changing to the folder in a command prompt accessing it from the Run: field opening it from File Explorer Windows 10 would mark the drive as dirty and prompt you to reboot your computer and run chkdsk as shown below.

​

Accessing an NTFS path triggers a corruption warning

To make matters worse threat actors and pranksters began distributing fake tools malicious shortcuts or malware [1 2 3 4] on Discord and social media that when executed would access the folder and trigger the bug.

Threat actors could also use the bug to force a crash of a breached system to hide their activities.

While the error generated by the bug stated the drive was corrupted Microsoft clarified that volume was only marked as dirty and a reboot and chkdsk would quickly mark it as clean.

Unfortunately in one of our and other people's tests chkdsk did not fix the issue and Windows 10 refused to boot again.

Microsoft fixes the NTFS corruption bug

In February Microsoft quietly started testing the fix within Windows Insider builds. This week as part of the April 2021 Patch Tuesday Microsoft has finally fixed the vulnerability in all supported versions of Windows 10.

Microsoft has classified this bug as a DDoS vulnerability and is tracking it as CVE-2021-28312 with the title 'Windows NTFS Denial of Service Vulnerability.'

After installing this week's Patch Tuesday updates BleepingComputer can confirm that the bug no longer works as it will now just display an error stating that ""The directory name is invalid"" as shown below.

Accessing the path no longer marks a drive as corrupted

BleepingComputer strongly recommends that all Windows users install the latest Patch Tuesday security updates. Not only for this vulnerability but the 107 other vulnerabilities fixed this month."

UCSF doctor explains,"""That is what we want it to do.""

Here's why women and younger people are having more side effects to Pfizer or Moderna vaccine

A University of California San Francisco expert says these side effects after the second COVID-19 shot are normal because the immune response to the second shot is stronger.

A University of California San Francisco expert says these side effects after the second COVID-19 shot are normal because the immune response to the second shot is stronger.

SAN FRANCISCO -- For 24 hours these were the side effects Irma Duran went through after her second Pfizer shot.

""I had my shot at 10:30 in the morning and then at midnight that's when I woke up. I had a high fever and my bones... It felt like sand paper. Like someone was sanding my bones"" said Duran.

A University of California San Francisco expert says these side effects after the second COVID-19 shot are normal because the immune response to the second shot is stronger.

""It's the spike protein that the mRNA is tricking the cells intro producing. That is what is being detected. That is what we want it to do. This is all good stuff"" said George Rutherford UCSF's Professor and Epidemiology & Biostatistics.

In this CDC report data shows that out of 13.7 million Americans vaccinated during December and January of 2021 side effects were higher among women.

""78.7% reports were submitted for adverse events in women. Headache (22.4%) fatigue (16.5%) and dizziness (16.5%) were the most frequently reported symptoms after vaccination with either vaccine. Sixty-two reports of anaphylaxis have been confirmed 46 (74.2%) after receipt of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 16 (25.8%) after receipt of the Moderna vaccine.""

Luz Pena: ""Why it is that women and young adults are having more reactions to the second shot of the Moderna or the Pfizer vaccine?""

Dr. Rutherford: ""Women should have stronger immune responses because they have to protect pregnancies. They have to live to have babies. So it probably has to do with sex hormones. I can't tell you the exact biochemical mechanism but it makes perfect sense when you think about it in that larger context"" and added ""We also know that the immune system ages and collects problems as you get older but it's not at all surprising to me that the reactions are more common in younger people than older people.""

Now let's be clear these side effects are mild and tend to last between two to three days. They are headaches body aches and fever in some cases.

Should people be concerned if they don't have side effects to either of the vaccines?

""No. There is nothing wrong with them. They just have a better regulated immune system that can get them through this without causing a lot of unnecessary symptoms. If you don't feel these symptoms there is no reason for you to go get an antibody test"" said Dr. Rutherford.

San Francisco resident Alejandro Galicia 34 felt the side effects of the first Moderna shot. He was hospitalized a year ago with COVID-19 and was given a 50% chance of survival. He puts the body aches after his first shot in perspective.

""Mentally it brings you back to having a fever and it's just sort of psychological but then you tell yourself it's nothing compared to COVID"" said Galicia Diaz.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXByb2dyZXNzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ItYy1oZWFsdGgtbWluaXN0ZXItc2F5cy1kZWxheS1pbi1tb2Rlcm5hLXZhY2NpbmUtZGlzYXBwb2ludGluZy0xOTE1NDEw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,B.C. health minister says delay in Moderna vaccine 'disappointing',"‘The sooner we get vaccines in people’s arms the better and inconsistency in delivery is a consistent problem. This is simply a reality and not an issue of blame’ Adrian Dix said Friday

British Columbia’s health minister says news that Moderna will be delaying shipments of its COVID-19 vaccine is “disappointing.”

“The sooner we get vaccines in people’s arms the better and inconsistency in delivery is a consistent problem. This is simply a reality and not an issue of blame” Adrian Dix said in a statement Friday.

The federal government has announced Canada’s vaccine supply from Moderna will be slashed in half through the rest of April.

Dix said Ottawa’s offer to send more of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in May and June to compensate is appreciated but increased deliveries this month would be more helpful.

The delays in shipping will force B.C. to ensure it is able to quickly shift vaccine supplies he said.

The announcement of a delay in Moderna vaccine shipments came as Premier John Horgan received his first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.

More than 1.28 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in B.C. so far.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Dix said in a joint statement that people need to be careful when meeting up with others outdoors.

“Be purposeful about who you are seeing and where you are going and stick with the same close contacts” they said.

The pair urged people to avoid travelling out of their neighbourhoods and to follow pandemic restrictions.

Researchers used an ongoing study called the Norwegian Mother Father and Child Cohort Study and examined questions pertaining to side effects observed in those who had received the AstraZeneca vaccine throughout Europe.

Participants were asked through questionnaires regarding potential side effects after their COVID-19 vaccinations.

These side effects included skin bleeding nose bleeds and bleedings in the gum known as gingival bleeding.

Ms Hui who is also a cross country runner said she also felt fatigued and had headaches for about two days after the jab.

But when her grandmother retiree Margaret Choong 72 received her first dose of the Moderna vaccine last month all she felt was a little pain at the injection site on her arm.

Ms Choong's two sisters aged 76 and 62 who were vaccinated on the same day were also generally well after the jab although her elder sister felt a little tired.

Their experiences reflect the results of clinical trials for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines which showed that younger adults like Ms Hui tend to report more frequent and severe side effects than older people after their jabs.

In Pfizer's trials those aged 18 to 55 reported experiencing side effects such as fever fatigue headaches and pain at the injection site more frequently than those aged 56 and above.

A similar trend was observed for the Moderna vaccine with those aged 18 to 64 reporting side effects more frequently compared to those aged 65 and above.

In both trials side effects were also more commonly reported after the second dose.

For Ms Hui the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine had caused her to develop a fever of 37.7 deg C a splitting headache and nausea. She felt so tired she could not do anything for three days.

She said: ""On the night after my second dose I woke up every hour because I was so uncomfortable.

""Despite the side effects I'm grateful and relieved I got to be vaccinated quite early on.""

Her grandmother said: ""I was most worried about my elder sister because she isn't in good health but I was so happy and relieved that she was fine after the jab.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGl6aWUuaXQvZW4vcGVyY2hlLWFzdHJhemVuZWNhLWNvc3RhLWRpLW1lbm8tcmlzcGV0dG8tYS1wZml6ZXItZS1tb2Rlcm5hL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGl6aWUuaXQvZW4vcGVyY2hlLWFzdHJhemVuZWNhLWNvc3RhLWRpLW1lbm8tcmlzcGV0dG8tYS1wZml6ZXItZS1tb2Rlcm5hL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why does AstraZeneca cost less than Pfizer and Moderna?,"Why does the vaccine from the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca cost less than those developed by Pfizer and Moderna?

While the price of the Pfizer vaccine will increase by 60% compared to the current price reaching €1950 the one developed by AstraZeneca costs far less (no more than €280): why this difference?

Because Astraeneca costs less

The first factor to consider is the conservation method. While Pfizer's serum requires temperatures below 70 degrees (now it seems that it can even resist minus 20 which is still a high figure) Oxford's can also be stored in a normal refrigerator. This therefore allows you to reduce management costs and make the second vaccine easier to handle.

The second reason concerns a factor linked to innovation. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines they are the first in the world to have been made with messenger RNA technique and for this reason they cost more than an AstraZeneca which is based on the already known technique of the adenovirus viral vector. Looking at the prices in detail we note that while the latter costs on average €178 per dose Pfizer's currently has a price of €12 per dose and Moderna's $18.

The difference in costs also depends on a strategy game between different pharmaceutical companies. The European Commission would have chosen to start its negotiations on doses for 2022/23 with Pfizer-BionTech: by increasing demand the company also decided to increase the price."

They’re good in that many residents make an effort to recycle parts of their trash instead of having it all end up in a cell at the county landfill. They’re bad in that sometimes they dispose of things that aren’t recyclable or at least aren’t clean causing more problems than if they just threw those things in the trash in the first place.

In 2020 Chautauqua County collected nearly 3500 tons of recyclable materials. That doesn’t include recycling collected by private contractors who take their recyclable materials elsewhere. The breakdown is as follows (in tons):

¯ cardboard: 779.24

¯ paper: 579.02

¯ scrap metal: 520.19

¯ glass: 512.37

¯ tires: 382

¯ single stream: 249.92

¯ electronics: 209.11

¯ plastic: 205.80

¯ metal cans: 37.40

SCRAP METAL

Tracy Pierce is an analyst for the county’s Division of Solid Waste. Pierce notes that in order for an item to be recycled there must be a buyer who wants that product. “Every recycling commodity we deal with becomes a commodity and it has a spot market. The spot market for us is Buffalo. In Buffalo there’s a bunch of buyers a bunch of brokers” he said.

Number 2 scrap which is unsorted metal is collected by Weitsman in Jamestown at the county transfer stations. The company pays the county a percentage based on the Buffalo spot market price. It can be sorted with a magnet to separate the ferrous metals which contain iron and the non-ferrous metal. “This stuff moves all the time” Pierce said.

Pierce discussed recycling during an interview at the Webster Road transfer station in the town of Pomfret. That day there was a bicycle there with the rubber tires still on it. To recycle that bicycle it will be run through a shredder. Anything that is not metal such as the tires becomes residue and is discarded in a landfill.

METAL CANS

The county collects pie tins aluminum cans clean tin foil and tin cans. Pierce said it’s important that the cans be cleaned and labels removed before turning in. “When we send this it ends up being with contamination that has to be removed. That causes the scrap recycler a disposal fee and now they have to get rid of it” he said.

Pierce says New York state is more efficient with recycling cans of soda pop or Arizona iced tea (look on the top to see if there’s a deposit). About 25 years ago aluminum was recycled every 90 days. Today it’s every 60 days which means theoretically you could be drinking out of the same can six times a year.

CARDBOARD

Chautauqua County collects corrugated cardboard as well as flat cardboard like empty tissue or cereal boxes. The corrugated cardboard has the most value but Chautauqua County has been collecting both kinds since former County Executive Greg Edwards made the change.

“One of the inefficiencies nationwide and internationally is separating (the types of cardboard)” Pierce said.

However cardboard is almost always able to be recycled. The only time it’s not is when it becomes contaminated from food particles like pizza boxes that come from takeout. That’s because the food attracts bugs rats and other animals. And once animals get into the recycled materials it needs to be thrown away.

Another issue with cardboard is with Amazon and shipping packages. The labels should be removed and the packing needs to be discarded. Packing plastic can actually be recycled with plastic bags that are accepted at large retailers like grocery stores Walmart and Home Depot.

PLASTICS

Used plastic is the most difficult item to recycle and to sell not only locally but nationwide. Chautauqua County collects seven different types of plastics. Those include jars milk jugs and detergents shampoo margarine and food containers and yogurt containers. But often people throw all sorts of items that have plastic in them but don’t qualify for recycling.

“All of this should be food containers” Pierce said while pointing to the bin that residents place their plastic in for recycling. “No toys no potting goods no racks from the nursery. … the reason why food is the common theme here is it’s a higher quality plastic.”

Pierce said motor oil bottles pesticides bleach bottles window wipers all should be thrown away. Even an unwashed laundry detergent bottle can contaminate recyclables so please rinse it. “Keep it clean and dry” he said.

Certain types of plastics can be turned into coats or carpets. However not all plastics are used for the same purpose so the plastic needs to be separated by resin type manually. The plastic collected through deposit program in NY has the greatest demand because it is clean separated.

Demand for the plastics increases with demand from consumers and the rise in energy prices.

“If there’s no demand on the other end it just gets piled up” said Pierce. “Plastic is the least efficient.”

In fact last year for a short time some of the plastic collected by Chautauqua County had to be placed in the landfill because they couldn’t find a company to take it. “When we’ve been lucky we’ve had our vendors say we’ll take some plastic” he said.

SINGLE STREAM

In the city of Dunkirk residents have all their recyclables collected at once. This is known as “single stream” recycling. Dunkirk is the only municipality in the county that uses single stream recycling.

In 2020 Republic Services sold its recyclable material recovery facility in Kenmore to Modern Disposal and Modern closed that facility. Now they sort recyclables at their Buffalo plant. Currently Modern is the only recyclable material recovery facility in the region that processes single stream and plastic within reach. They still accept Dunkirk’s single stream collection however because they have so much recycling they won’t accept any new contracts.

PAPER

Around Chautauqua County are “paper retriever” collection bins. They are at the county landfill but also at schools churches and other not-for-profit locations. Once the bins are filled depending on the market they are collected and the local user is given $20 a load. Right now the economy isn’t as strong so the county isn’t making money off its paper however the county doesn’t have to pay to get rid of it which includes newspapers magazines “junk” mail cards telephone books envelopes and office and school paper.

That’s because of the government. According to Pierce the U.S. government and other branches of government are the biggest consumer of recycled paper. Because the federal state and lower levels of government require their paper to be recycled there’s a strong demand for paper even when the economy is weak.

According to Pierce paper can be recycled up to seven times. After that it breaks down too much and is used to make toilet paper or paper towels.

Pierce said most of the paper recyclables from Chautauqua County goes to the Midwest Syracuse Buffalo or Canada.

GLASS

Late last year the Jamestown BPU decided to eliminate collecting glass from its customers.

At the time Dave Leathers BPU general manger told The Post-Journal there are two reasons why BPU officials wanted to are looking to remove glass from the recycling program. He said the first is it’s an expense to the solid waste division because it costs money to pick up the glass recycling and then transport it for disposal. The second reason is that even with a spread out pickup time which is usually 8 to 10 weeks apart customer participation is low.

The change was approved by the Jamestown City Council.

Jamestown area residents that still want to recycle glass can take it to the Falconer transfer station.

Technically the colored glass and clear glass are not recycled but are broken down and used by the county’s DPW department at the landfill in place of stone. “Rather than go and mine stone out of nature we’re using the glass” said Pierce. “We’re very fortunate to have it.”

Glass with deposits on them are the cleanest glass and sought by recyclers. However glass at the landfill is often contaminated by light bulbs window glass and ovenware. That glass can’t be melted down at high temperatures. Because of this recycling companies don’t want it.

There’s been talk at the state level to put deposits on wine and liquor bottles. Should that happen Pierce believes the available glass for recycling will drop substantially.

ELECTRONICS

A few years ago Chautauqua County used to collect TVs computers and other electronics for free. The county no longer does that and instead charges a fee for every item residents dispose. That change is because the county must pay to get rid of the electronics.

In 2015 New York state enacted legislation making it illegal for electronics to be placed in landfills. That doesn’t mean individuals don’t try to sneak them into the landfill however they’re breaking the law and can face significant fines.

“According to the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) 90% of the toxic metals in the landfill comes from electronics” Pierce said.

For electronics Pierce noted there are companies that take old TVs to their plants manually dissemble them remove the precious metals and send the unusable parts to a landfill. Right now the county is using a company in Victor NY to disassemble the electronics.

TIRES

Vendors are required to take old tires when customers buy new tires which Pierce encourages residents to do. The county does accept tires for a fee. The county bales tires and uses them in the landfill but they collect far more tires than they need so they ask residents to have the business where they buy news ones dispose of them.

WHAT CAN CITIZENS DO

The first thing Pierce wants to see residents to do is not contaminate recyclables with things that can’t be recycled. That only generates more waste and can cause items that would be recycled to end up in the landfill.

There are a number of small things as well.

Small propane tanks can be recycled with scrap metal although the county asks that residents place the blue cap on the tank after disposing it to help distinguish it from a grenade. They can also be disposed of at hazardous waste collections the county occasionally hosts.

Another problem item is old wires and sockets from home renovations. They should be taken to a metal recycling facility instead of thrown in the trash. That’s because the trucks at the landfill drive over them and the tires are popped.

Batteries can be thrown in the trash unless they’re rechargeable or Lithium-ion. In that case they can be brought to the store where they were purchased. The same is true with fluorescent light bulbs.

New York has banned plastic bags from most retail stores. Even so many people have lots of plastic bags around their house and throw them away. Pierce says to put trash in the bags; don’t throw a “bag of bags” in the trash because they can start to blow around. “We compact the trash. When the compactor drives over the trash bag it breaks and those bags just go ‘poof’ when the wind blows. There’s nothing in them” he said. He did note that they’re starting to see fewer bags in the landfill.

Pierce was working for the county when New York added deposits to water bottles. The number of water bottles that end up in the landfill dropped significantly. He writes to state officials every two years asking for legislation to be enacted to cover bottles like Gatorade energy drinks etc. He would like to see others ask for this legislation to pressure state to make a change.

Two other points Pierce suggests have to do with how we shop.

Pierce notes that shopping on line requires greater consumption of packaging than mall shopping. According to a study by Simon Properties (former owner of Chautauqua Mall) less packaging material is used to stock retail stores than shopping on-line; and the average shopper visits more than one store and buys six to 10 items. The efficiency of mall shopping is also greater because most mall shoppers go with family and friends. Plus nobody leaves the store with items that don’t fit thus there is a reduced occurrence of returned items which reduces fuel consumption.

Finally Pierce suggests residents try purchase more items made from recycled materials and increase production through consumer demand. For example Mohawk Industries a large flooring manufacturer has an entire carpet brand that is made from recycling food containers. Patagonia makes clothing from recycled plastic. If more consumers purchased materials made from recycled plastics the need for recycled plastic will increase and less plastic will end up in landfills.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cali-Squeeze already has proven itself in chain retail where it’s grown the last two years by +77% (2019) and +54% (2020). It represents half of SLO’s sales tracked by IRI in convenience grocery liquor and other chain stores. It sold about $508000 last year the same as BrewDog's Punk IPA and New Belgium's Old Tuffy Premium Lager in the same stores.

Cali-Squeeze is available in three flavors: Mango Blood Orange and Tropical P.O.G. According to Brewbound SLO Brewing produced 8000 barrels of Cali-Squeeze beer last year roughly equivalent to the total production for breweries including Crooked Stave Artisan Beer Project and Payette Brewing Co. in 2019 the most recent year of data. The swap frees up SLO Brewing to focus on its non-beer products such as Tio Rodrigo canned micheladas Porch Pounder canned wine and Rod & Hammer's SLO Stills whiskey.

WHY IT MATTERS

The Cali-Squeeze buy makes sense for Firestone Walker a company that’s sat on the sidelines as fruit beer sales accelerated during the pandemic. Fruit beer grew IRI sales volume by +36.3% last year twice as much as #2 IPA which increased +18.7% (although on a much larger base of volume). Fruit beer added $20 million more in sales than craft Lagers. They communicate clear flavor expectations a factor that’s also driven sales of non-beer products like ranch water hard seltzer and ready-to-drink cocktails.

Adding a plug-and-play fruit beer line to its portfolio finally gives Firestone Walker an offering in this category which was gaining steam even before the pandemic. Fruit beer was one of the few styles to show volume growth in 2019 (+3.8% while Pale Ale was -1.6% and Wheat beer was -5.3%). Fruit beers sold $70.7 million in Nielsen-tracked groceries drug stores and liquors stores over the 52-week period ending April 13 more than a +10% increase from the same period a year ago.

Despite fruit beers’ growth they’ve been a hole in Firestone Walker’s lineup. In California the U.S.’s largest beer market that space potentially leaves millions of dollars in sales on the table. (California-based Golden Road Brewing’s Fruit Cart series of fruit beers makes up over half that brewery’s sales in chain retail stores netting almost $30 million in sales last year.) Cali-Squeeze is a ready-made gap-filler.

David Walker co-founder of Firestone Walker hints that Cali-Squeeze is just the first in what could be a range of fruit beers from Firestone broadly referred to as “Fruits with Benefits.” Asked explicitly whether there will be future releases in that line Walker says it’s too early to say.

“SLO Brew has done an amazing job of focusing boldly on consumer trends and fruit-forward beers ergo our desire to call these beers ‘Fruits with Benefits’” Walker says. “This new brewing platform allows us to experiment in a way that doesn’t impact our traditional beer programs.”

Currently just two beers make up the majority of Firestone Walker’s chain retail sales: 805 Blonde Ale and Mind Haze IPA which together account for 78% of the brewery’s sales year-to-date. The company has laser-focused on these brands expanding their core range by adding spin-offs including 805 Cerveza a Mexican Lager version of 805 and Double Mind Haze IPA a 8.3% ABV version of Mind Haze.

This streamlining has its upsides—805 has grown dollar sales in chain retail 78% since 2017 to $19.6 million—but it comes with opportunity cost. Firestone Walker beers that aren’t 805 or Mind Haze are roughly interchangeable in sales dollars. The brewery’s Luponic Distortion rotating IPA has declined in IRI-tracked sales the past three years; new 100-calorie Flyjack simply replaced Easy Jack in the brewery’s lineup and may not have a long lifespan in the portfolio.

There’s no clear number-three brand but the full Cali-Squeeze line could easily become it.

Cali-Squeeze also represents something of a test case for Firestone Walker inching the brewery closer to non-traditional beer beverages like hard seltzer which it has so far avoided. Hard seltzer is a $4 billion market in the U.S. and Firestone Walker’s peers like Stone Brewing and the CANarchy Brewery Collective are invested. Stone earlier this month announced its line of Buenavida Hard Seltzer and CANarchy has leaned in hard with its Wild Basin Boozy Sparkling Water line which sold $4.6 million in chain retail last year.

SLO Brewing produces a line of Cali-Squeeze hard seltzers which are not included in the deal with Firestone Walker but Firestone Walker tells Brewbound it is evaluating the possibility of later acquiring these seltzers. Pressed on the likelihood of that Walker tells GBH the seltzer line is still “very young” but it’s not Firestone Walker’s intention to brew them.

Of course that’s for now as breweries increasingly position themselves as beverage companies. Kansas City’s Boulevard Brewing also owned by Duvel USA has jumped head-first into non-beer products in recent years including Quirk Spiked & Sparkling seltzer and Fling canned cocktails. Boulevard calls itself “Boulevard Beverage Company” on the Quirk section of its website and Molson Coors officially adopted Molson Coors Beverage Company as its name in 2019. These moves into non-beer products come as the beer industry as a whole is struggling to compete against spirits and has watched its share of the alcohol market decline for two decades.

As the larger alcohol market changes dramatically traditional beer programs are on the defensive from non-beer heavily flavored products. Firestone Walker may be hedging its bets.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Natalie Kostelni for the Philadelphia Business Journal reports on the brand’s extension into both Northeast Philadelphia and King of Prussia.

The Northeast Topgolf is being built on 27 acres of the former Nabisco and Mondelez International factories on Roosevelt Boulevard. The Montgomery County edition will tee off from the 50-acre former American Baptist Churches USA headquarters on Gulph Road.

Infrastructure improvements preparing both sites were slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic like a ball on a wet green. But they’re now picking up momentum.

In the Northeast that work included road-widening efforts to ease traffic flow. Signal lights and a turn lane were added as safety measures. Price tag thus far? $2 million. The Montgomery County pad which sold for $24 million last year is looking at a summer restart of construction prep.

Topgolf originated from the timeless golf question “Who hit it closer?” Originally called “Target Oriented Practice Golf” the founders of Topgolf used proprietary radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology and dartboard-style targets to answer this question and the first Topgolf venue was created in Watford U.K. in 2000. It now has 58 venues across the U.S.

American culture and influence has spread globally since early in the last century in part thanks to Hollywood. Be it Coca Cola Nike or rap music people worldwide have adopted everything American — well almost. For different reasons some products simply can’t get a foothold outside the U.S.

Those reasons can include differences in culture and tastes. An obvious example is the American notion that bigger is better leading to bigger cars bigger portions and warehouse stores — none of which have been fully embraced by most of the rest of the world.

Taste differences also contribute to non-Americans’ dislike of some very American foods. Even American staples such as the peanut butter and jelly sandwich or American cheese tend to raise an eyebrow elsewhere on the planet.

Then there are trade reasons such as banned substances tariffs sanctions or other more technical factors that prevent non-Americans from experiencing popular American products. Some of these products are currently made entirely or primarily in the United States which can help explain why these products are popular in the states but hard to find elsewhere. These are some other surprising products still made in America.

These are popular products that are much harder to find abroad than in the United States.

Up until 2020 Mountain Dew contained brominated vegetable oil (BVO) a substance that is banned in the European Union and a few other countries due to possible health risks when consumed in large quantities. Over a decade ago more sodas contained this additive which is used to bind the flavors and other ingredients so they don’t separate. Beverage companies including PepsiCo (the maker of Mountain Dew) said they would phase out BVO use with Mountain Dew one of the last remaining to use it. Now that the beverage is also free and clear of BVO perhaps new markets worldwide will open to it.

Today with the health food craze and all the other “butters” available — cashew almond or any nut — peanut butter is not as scoffed at as before though it is still nowhere as beloved as in the U.S. Peanut butter combo flavors remain a mostly American phenomena. The main one being of course peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

Girl Scout cookies What started as a local fundraiser for one troop in Oklahoma over a century ago became over the years a nationally organized sale to raise funds for the Girl Scouts of the USA. Today the GSUSA sells some $800 million worth of cookies about 200 million boxes a year. While the GSUSA is part of an international organization Girl Scout cookies are uniquely American and not easily available outside the U.S. So next time you visit a friend overseas and want to bring something that represents American culture there’s nothing better than Girl Scouts cookies.

It simply can’t be found in most countries outside the U.S. and is often dismissed as a lower-quality processed product that many foodies would not even call cheese. American cheese is made using a unique process that gives it a creamy smooth quality. It can range in color from orange to white and be sold individually wrapped sliced or as a block. It may not be the best cheese but many Americans wouldn’t dream of putting anything else on their burgers.

Southern-style biscuits Southern-style biscuits are usually served with a meal and not just in the South but good luck getting them anywhere outside the U.S. You’ll just confuse most people abroad if you try to if you try to order biscuits and gravy for breakfast particularly the English for whom the word means cookie. A scone with butter and jam would be better understood. The ingredients list is short — usually consisting of flour butter/shortening milk/buttermilk baking powder and salt.

So while you can find most crackers and snacks outside the U.S. — even if sometimes the flavor profiles are different (prawn cocktail Pringles in Europe and sweet basil Lay’s chips in Thailand) — finding Cheez-Its crackers is generally a no go. It’s no secret Americans love their cheese and these crackers made by Kellogg are but one example.

While non-Americans might be able to wrap their heads around individually wrapped slices of American cheese squeeze cheese is something else altogether.

Garbage disposals While the debate regarding their environmental impact has not reached a definite conclusion one thing is certain — garbage disposals have not been adopted to a large extent outside the U.S. Perhaps yet again Americans’ love of convenience is the reason for their wide adoption in America. Regardless Europeans and other non-Americans are often baffled by the devices.

Wonder bread You’d think something as mundane as bread wouldn’t be such a curious product but that’s exactly what Wonder Bread — or other similarly soft white sliced bread — is to non-Americans. It is too sweet and too soft to those who didn’t grow up on white bread sandwiches.

The country’s vast landmass lends itself to road trips like nowhere else — there are no borders the language is the same and while the views might change many of the basic comforts and commodities remain the same. And what’s more iconic than the aluminum Airstream trailer? This type of RV (recreational vehicle) made by Thor Industries in Jackson Center Ohio was first manufactured a century ago. Though Airstream introduced several models for the European market — they tend to be smaller — it remains an iconic American product.

Kraft Mac & Cheese If you’ve prepared your pantry for a coronavirus lockdown no doubt you stocked up with several blue boxes of Kraft Mac & Cheese — regardless of your feelings about the product. It is after all a convenient nonperishable food. It was introduced during similarly troubled times — the Great Depression — with the aim of combining nonperishable noodles with a processed cheese product (there’s that “cheese product” again). This North American (U.S. and Canada) staple has since expanded to other countries.

Mailboxes Not something you’d think about but if you travel in Europe you won’t see many of the curbside mailboxes you’re so used to seeing in front of American houses. For some reason they never caught on there. It is more common abroad to have slots in the doors through which the mail is dropped wall boxes or centralized mail stations. Such stations are becoming more common in the U.S. too as they are preferred by the USPS.

Red Solo cups According to the Smithsonian “If you’ve ever cleaned up after a kegger or done drink duty at an office party you’ve seen them — the red Solo cups that are Americans’ receptacle of choice for beverages both alcoholic and non.” And non-Americans too consider the red Solo cup an American symbol. Though Solo Company was acquired by Dart in 2012 it continues to manufacture the iconic red cups under the Solo brand.

Here though there might be another reason. This sweet non-alcoholic North American soda beverage was traditionally made using the root bark of the sassafras tree as the primary flavor. And that tree used to grow only in North America. Though today this flavor ingredient is no longer used and other ingredients are used to mimic the flavor root beer has mostly failed to find fans outside the U.S.

While baseball has its fans outside the U.S. and certainly basketball and hockey do too football has failed to catch on internationally. And if no one’s playing football elsewhere why should they buy footballs particularly the handmade Wilson footballs? While rugby balls are quite similar in size and weight to footballs they are not the same. Mainly the ends differ — rugby balls have flatter ends while footballs end in points.

The case study published in BMJ Case Reports on Thursday explains the unusual case of a U.K. man who was first admitted to hospital with shortness of breath and a swelling in the abdomen.

After he was inspected by doctors he was quickly found to be experiencing kidney failure and was unable to fully empty his bladder the case study says. When doctors investigated further they found that in both of his kidneys urine was unable to drain into the bladder.

While it was apparent that he was in need of surgery what was less apparent was the cause of his condition. He told doctors that he had been experiencing progressively shorter breath over the past four months as well as weight loss and a general feeling of unwellness.

He also had felt so ill over the last three months that it had disrupted his university studies.

“There was no significant past medical history and family history was not suspicious for cardiomyopathy or sudden cardiac death” the case report stated. “He was an ex-smoker having stopped three years earlier.”

He also did not consume alcohol or use drugs he told doctors.

However he explained that he did consume energy drinks on the regular. Specifically he had been downing “an average of four 500 mL cans per day for approximately two years.”

The drinks had around 160 mg of caffeine each.

“Retrospectively the patient recalls occasional symptoms of dyspepsia tremor and a racing heartbeat but without seeking medical review” the case study stated.

In a statement provided with the case study the patient who is not identified by name wrote that when he was not consuming these energy drinks he would suffer “from severe migraine headaches.”

The situation worsened after doctors attempted to treat the issues with his kidneys. When there was little improvement in his renal function doctors examined him further and discovered he was “in decompensated cardiac failure” which means some change in his heart was interfering with its ability to pump or accept blood. Fluids were also building up in his knees and abdomen.

A chest X-ray showed that his heart was enlarged and an ultrasound found both his kidneys and liver were enlarged as well.

According to the case study the situation was dire and he was taken to the ICU of another hospital to receive more specialized care.

The patient stated that “the experience was extremely traumatizing” partly because he was suffering from delirium and memory issues meaning he would wake in the ICU with no idea why he was there.

Doctors theorized that he had been experiencing low cardiac output for months.

“Given the history of chronic energy drink consumption lack of significant past medical or family history cardiac imaging findings and improvement with ceasing intake energy drink-induced cardiotoxicity was felt to be the most likely cause” the case report stated.

The 21-year-old was eventually discharged from hospital 58 days after he originally came in with his mysterious symptoms. Although he is on the mend now he will have to have ongoing cardiology renal and urology follow-ups and doctors suspect he may require “future bladder reconstruction” and possible a kidney transplant at some point.

He is now avoiding energy drinks the case report stated something doctors believe is contributing to his improved heart function.

This is far from the only example of a person landing in hospital after consuming too many energy drinks but research on the topic still remains scarce. The case report mentioned two other cases of people in their 20s who experienced heart failure or damage following chronic consumption of these drinks.

“I think there should be more awareness about energy drink and the effect of their contents” the patient stated in the report. “I believe they are very addictive and far too accessible to young children. I think warning labels similar to smoking should be made to illustrate the potential dangers of the ingredients in energy drink.”

Why drinking too many energy drinks can cause heart problems is still not fully understood but doctors believe the high level of caffeine in energy drinks could play a role.

“Energy drinks are also known to increase blood pressure” the case report added saying that this could lead to issues with blood travel through the body potentially contributing to heart failure.

“Further research is needed to identify susceptibility factors the safe amount of energy drink consumption and underlying mechanisms of toxicity” the case study said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy9kb250LWp1ZGdlLWEtc3RvY2stYnktaXRzLXByaWNlLXRoYXRzLW9uZS1vZi10aWxsaW5naGFzdHMtc3RvY2stcGlja2luZy1zZWNyZXRzL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgyMTE1NTUyLmNtc9IBnAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy9kb250LWp1ZGdlLWEtc3RvY2stYnktaXRzLXByaWNlLXRoYXRzLW9uZS1vZi10aWxsaW5naGFzdHMtc3RvY2stcGlja2luZy1zZWNyZXRzL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MjExNTU1Mi5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Don’t judge a stock by its price!

Invest in businesses that provide a long-term competitive advantage









Legendary fund manager Joel ­Tillinghast says the best strategy for equity investors to achieve long-term success is to avoid big mistakes and discover companies that have been overlooked by most and yet have a high likelihood of delivering solid long-term gains.Tillinghast says if an investor wants to achieve great long-term portfolio performance she need not choose the most exciting stocks nor does she need to be bold and daring in such a pursuit.“A small mistake is generally easier to repair. Thinking small not only reduces the severity and frequency of errors but also puts you in a better frame of mind to expect to fix them” he says in his bookJoel Tillinghast is the vice-president and portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments and has managed the Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund since its inception.The effectiveness of Tillinghast’s strategy can be gauged from the exceptional performance put up by the fund that he manages.­Tillinghast is often counted among the legendary investors for his prudent and disciplined approach to investing which is particularly useful in today’s market where most stocks are considered overvalued and a few large companies seem to draw all the attention.Known for his photographic memory and encyclopedic knowledge Tillinghast spent four years as a financial futures research analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert in Chicago before joining Fidelity in 1986.He was always attracted to numbers since he was a child and used to go through a stock analysis newsletter called Value Line Investment Survey which his grandparents had subscribed to.“I would read through them pages and pages of numbers. They intrigued me” says he.After graduation his first job was of an equity analyst at Value Line Investment Survey which was where he always wanted to work since his childhood.At a very young age Tillinghast convinced his parents to open a brokerage account where he held stocks of Central Main Power a dividend-paying utility company and Beckman Instruments a company that made laboratory instruments which fascinated him because his dad was a biochemist who used Beckman’s products.Tillinghast used to cut his neighbours’ lawn sell vegetables from his garden and do some other things to earn money so that he could invest in the stock market.Tillinghast says if one sees stock-picking as a great game of skill and the stock market as a fascinating puzzle then she should definitely invest in stocks. But if one is not too interested in doing in-depth investment research and feels the stock market is only a game of chance then she should invest in an index fund.“Index investors believe they are rewarded for taking the overall market risk while value investors think they are paid for doing the opposite when others behave badly. If you aren’t interested in the question of what good or bad behaviour might be you won’t see it as a source of profit. It isn’t always either/or. Some people find that owning an index fund and an actively-managed fund and individual securities works well for them” he says.Tillinghast lists out four elements of value: (1) profitability or income (2) life span (3) growth and (4) certainty.He lists out a few broad pointers on how to pick good stocks without taking a lot of risk.Tillinghast says investors should look for companies that dominate market niche and have low levels of debt. He feels investors should look for a distinctive brand that consumers trust and seek out and a business model that isn’t buffeted by the ups and downs of the economy.He says if investors can filter out companies by keeping these points in mind then it can get easier for them to forecast a company’s profitability without being dangerously wrong.Giving an example Tillinghast says he started investing in a California company now called Monster Beverage almost two decades ago and paid an average of eight cents per share (adjusted for splits). After years it trades at over $85 a share.“This company made energy drinks sodas and juices using unusual ingredients such as guarana seed extract and ginseng which have powerful mood-boosting effects. It was a simple but outstanding concept. Energy drinks are an example of a product that has a long runway of growth ahead” says he.Tillinghast says investors should avoid industries that are headed for obsolescence or that have commodity-like products with little differences from one another and price becomes the only basis for competition.Tillinghast says one should look for companies that pay high dividends and should also make sure that they are favouring stocks with low P/Es in stable industries.“Look for earnings in excess of dividends ample free cash flow and stable proportions of debt and equity. Also look for companies in which the number of outstanding shares isn’t rising rapidly. “To put a finer point on the income stocks to skip reverse those criteria. I wouldn’t buy a stock for its dividend if the payout wasn’t well covered by earnings and free cash flow” he says.Tillinghast says his fund typically keeps at least 80% of its assets in low-priced stocks. He feels investors should maintain discipline while investing and look for bargain-priced smallcap and midcap stocks.“Focusing on low-priced stocks is often a good way to find companies that are either too small for Wall Street analysts and big institutions to pay attention to or whose prices are temporarily depressed due to short-term problems. Of course a low price alone doesn’t mean a stock is worth ­buying. There are plenty of low-priced stocks that I would never touch” says he.Tillinghast believes investors should not sell a stock just because its value is appreciating beyond a specific defined target. He feels if a stock has long-term growth potential then investors should keep holding on to it. “I hold my winners as long as their long-term growth potential looks ­attractive” says he.Tillinghast says it is essential for investors to understand a company very well before planning to invest in it. If one is not sure whether a company will be able to make money in the long run then it is best to avoid investing in it. “You have to understand a company enough to be able to forecast with confidence how the business will make money in the next decade” says he.Sometimes there are companies that become very popular and attractive among investors and everyone gets tempted to invest in them leading to a suspension of the normal investing criteria.But Tillinghast believes investors should stay away from these kind of stocks as they may be popular right now but are likely to have limited potential for long-term profitability.He says popular companies are not able to sustain their competitive advantage as other competitors try to copy and replicate their competitive edge. “As a value investor what really scares me is that if one believes in the hype a stock will be overpriced. Nearly all the companies on the lists of major accounting debacles had stocks trading at demanding multiples” says he.Tillinghast says glamorous and hyped stocks are more likely to be scams because they are usually overpriced and are prone to raising capital constantly. So it is best to avoid them.“Intricate corporate structures make analysis difficult even if nothing bad is going on. To spot bad guys look for the fraud triangle: pressure opportunity and rationalisation. By avoiding the bad-guy stocks — and it’s a short list — I slash the possibility of a disastrous outcome but scarcely reduce my opportunity set” says he.Tillinghast says in order to achieve success one needs to stay focused on facts and actions that matter most and avoid believing in the constant market chatter and trust their research.He says investors should choose the format for investing wisely. Everything begins with decisions in investing.“We’re dealing with an unknown future and the facts are not in evidence. So as social animals we seek other opinions which can be wrong sometimes dramatically. As individuals the best one can do is make decisions mindfully using our systems to think slowly and aiming for fewer but better choices. Most directly this means avoiding excessive turnover and trying to invest based on ‘What’s it worth?’ rather than ‘What happens next?’ It also means choosing a format for investing that works for you —whether stocks index funds actively-managed funds or something else altogether” says he.Investors should consider shares as partial interests in enterprises and not just numbers on a screen. “Training our minds on businesses rather than stock prices moves us in the right direction. We’re not equally equipped to analyse every security or industry but if we focus on spots where we are conversant we’ll be more certain that we’ve put together the evidence properly” says he.Tillinghast feels decisions play a key role in deciding whether investors are able to achieve success in the long run. Hence they should take every investment decision – big or small – very carefully.“In all businesses profits and losses stem from a collage of decisions big and trivial made in the sometimes distant past often by people who are no longer around. Dumb luck can be as influential as good judgment” says he.Big Money Thinks Small: Biases Blind Spots and Smarter Investing",,,,,,,,,

Morgan Stanley was one of several banks that had exposure to Archegos which defaulted on margin calls late last month and triggered a fire sale of stocks across Wall Street.

Morgan Stanley lost $644 million by selling stocks it held related to Archegos’ positions and another $267 million trying to “derisk” them Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said on a call with analysts.

“I regard that decision as necessary and money well spent” he said.

The bank did not disclose losses right away because they were not deemed material in the context of its overall results he added.

Morgan Stanley is not alone in nursing losses as a prime broker for Archegos. Switzerland’s Credit Suisse Group AG and Japan’s Nomura Holdings Inc. bore the brunt having lost $4.7 billion and $2 billion respectively.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo & Co. also handled Archegos positions but exited them without losses.

Morgan Stanley did not realize that Archegos had similar concentrated positions at several banks across Wall Street Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said. As such the collateral requirements it imposed were only reflecting Archegos’s particular risks at Morgan Stanley not the risks across the fund’s broader portfolio.

Morgan Stanley has reviewed its prime brokerage business for similar problems but not found any Pruzan said. The bank is looking more broadly at its method for stress testing and will recalibrate positions with clients as necessary.

“We are never happy when we take a loss” he said. “But the event is over ... and we will learn from the experience.”

The Archegos saga is likely to have regulatory repercussions however with a slew of US watchdogs as well as the Senate Banking Committee all probing the incident to better understand why some banks were so exposed to a single client.

Gorman appeared exasperated at times during the call as he faced repeated questions from analysts about Archegos distracting from the bank’s otherwise stellar performance. Morgan Stanley’s shares were down 1 percent.

“It’s not a financial event in the grand scheme of things but it will likely raise concerns” Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a note to clients.

Although Morgan Stanley’s Archegos loss dominated the discussion on Friday its first quarter profit comfortably beat expectations. Its report wrapped up a robust quarter for the biggest US banks which benefited from reserve releases and record capital markets activity.

A spike in trading partly driven by a Reddit-fueled trading frenzy in “meme” stocks like GameStop Corp drove a 66 percent jump in revenue at Morgan Stanley’s institutional securities business.

Unlike rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs lack big consumer lending units which has limited their exposure to loan problems during the pandemic and allowed them to focus on investment banking and trading.

Morgan Stanley’s profit rose to $3.98 billion or $2.19 per share in the quarter ended March 31 from $1.59 billion or $1.01 per share a year ago.

Analysts were looking for a profit of $1.70 per share according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Leading stock indexes continued their winning streak with S&P 500 maintaining the uptrend for the fourth week in a row and hitting a new high.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 34000-mark for the first time adding around 150 points in the last session. The sentiment was buoyed by encouraging retail sales data and reports of jobless claims falling.

The first-quarter earnings season got off to a good start with banking giants JPMorgan Chase Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs unveiling their latest financial data mid-week. They were joined by software firm Infosys on Wednesday.

The spotlight stayed on financial services Thursday also when the closely followed reports of Citigroup and Bank of America came out. Delta Air Lines and soft-drink behemoth PepsiCo released earnings on the same day. The first phase of bank earnings concluded on Friday with Morgan Stanley’s blockbuster Q1 report.

The other major companies that can elicit investor interest include Halliburton Verizon Communications Chipotle Mexican Grill and Kinder Morgan – the companies will report earnings on April 21. The next day it is the turn of American Airlines and Southwest Airlines as well as tech firms AT&T and Intel. American Express is probably the only big player to report on April 23.

The market was abuzz with the news of Microsoft’s $20-billion buyout of cloud software company Nuance Communications. In another important deal in the cloud space Datadog completed the acquisition of the SaaS-based security platform Sqreen.

Bitcoin tumbled to its biggest single-day drop since February over Saturday just days after reaching a record high Bloomberg reported.

Bitcoin fell 10.8% in the 24 hours to Saturday 7am ET from $61396 to $54750. At one point it reached a low of $51300 after it dropped more than $7000 in a single hour before partially recovering.

Several online outlets attributed the drop to speculation the US Treasury may take action against money laundering conducted through digital assets per Bloomberg and Coinbase.

Airbnb will need millions of new hosts to meet demand as the world exits the pandemic CEO Brian Chesky told CNBC on Friday.

""To meet the demand over the coming years we're going to need millions more hosts"" Chesky told the network's Deirdre Bosa on air.

As the world tiptoes out of the pandemic travelers are taking their first steps towards normal vacation routines. Many are wondering if Airbnb accommodations and hotels are safe.

Chesky said on Friday that Airbnb expected the industry to roar back.

He told CNBC: ""I think that we probably will have a high-class problem where there will probably be more guests coming to Airbnb than we'll have hosts for because ... we think there's going to be a travel rebound coming that's unlike anything we've ever seen.""

Airbnb lists 4 million hosts at present. As of the end of last year they had about 5.6 million active listings in more than 220 countries and regions according to the San Francisco company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Chesky's positive outlook echoed past statements and filings from the company. In a late February filing the company said its listings had remained steady at 5.6 million for the entirety of 2020 despite a decline in bookings because of the pandemic.

The company said: ""While we believe that travel will change as a result of COVID-19 the adaptability of our business suggests that we are well-positioned to serve this dynamic market as it continues to evolve and recover.""

After a blockbuster December IPO the company in February beat Wall Street's Q4 expectations. But its $859 million in revenue was down 22% from the $1.1 billion reported in the same year-earlier period.

Airbnb was ""primed for recovery"" wrote Brian Nowak a Morgan Stanley analyst in a note sent to clients earlier this year.

Nowak said he expected Airbnb to be the ""only player growing"" in the first quarter versus its competitors including Expedia and Booking Holdings.

""Similar to '20 when people are returning to travel they are choosing local (in country/close to home driving over flying) and more rural locations…which gives an edge to alternative accommodations"" Nowak said."

The housing market demand is being fueled by the demand of millions of Americans who continue to work from home and seek larger accommodations.

Mosaic a construction technology company is addressing the state’s housing shortage in partnership with one of Arizona’s most forward-thinking builders as well as a premier land developer by offering innovative sustainable designs with improved efficiencies while also reducing construction waste.

READ ALSO: Here’s the outlook for land and housing in 2021

According to the Arizona Association of Realtors between March 2020 and March 2021 the number of active listings statewide fell 53 percent while sales rose by just over 10 percent. The sharp decline in listings meant just over one month’s worth of inventory at current sales levels or falling nearly 55 percent and prompting sales prices to rise by nearly 12 percent.

In general because a balanced market between buyers and sellers is generally considered closer to six months this inventory shortage is putting more pressure on homebuilders to add more supply while also maintaining quality standards. That’s where Mosaic fits in.

In Prescott Valley Mosaic serves as the general contractor and oversees the entire building process for 350 new homes at Jasper by Mandalay Homes a collection of single-family net-zero energy homes at the base of the area’s picturesque Glassford Hill. Currently offering 11 different floor plans homes at Jasper will range from approximately 1231 to 2531 square feet.

“Mandalay was approaching the limits of building materials and product innovation and we’ve been searching for a company like Mosaic to catalyze the next step” said Dave Everson owner and founder of Mandalay Homes. “Mosaic has reduced our framing time increased our control over the construction process and has operated with admirable attention to quality.”

In an analysis by the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) of U.S. Census Bureau data the nation’s builders pulled 17 percent more permits in January and February 2021 versus the same months of 2020. In Arizona the year-over-year increase was even more rapid at 26 percent suggesting that the state’s builders are betting that the strong demand for new homes is part of a longer-term trend. According to PropertyShark the Phoenix metro area reported the third-highest gains in the median home sale price between 2009 and 2019 with many buyers applying these gains towards larger homes.

Reports released today by the Commerce Department indicate U.S. housing starts surged 19.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.739 million units last month the highest level since June 2006. A combination of increasing COVID-19 vaccinations warmer weather and continued fiscal stimulus are driving the economy with growth this year by economists expected to be the strongest in nearly four decades.

In Flagstaff Mosaic is also working with Mandalay Homes as the general contractor and architect for Adora at Timber Sky a collection of 35 single-family homes ranging from approximately 1650 to 1850 square feet. Nationally recognized as an industry leader in energy conservation indoor air quality and water sustainability Mandalay Homes has earned the Indoor airPLUS Leader Award six years in a row for its Indoor airPLUS homes.

Developed by Vintage Partners the Timber Sky master plan is one of only 11 ‘dark sky’ communities in the world allowing residents and visitors to take full advantage of northern Arizona’s clear skies for stargazing.

Elsewhere in Flagstaff Mosaic is acting as the general contractor architect and site planner for Vintage Partners to create the 200-home Sky Cottages community. This unique single-family build-to-rent (BTR) neighborhood is based on three core principles: Sustainable energy efficiency shared amenities and spaces and multi-modal transportation options.

Located on 20 acres adjacent to the Timber Sky master-planned community the residences will include their own front door to the outside instead of a common hallway. In addition many homes will also feature private yards or patios. Interior spaces will range from approximately 750 to 1250 square feet feature all-electric appliances and at least 20 homes will be constructed with solar panels.

“Mosaic has created immense value for us in the Flagstaff Arizona market” said Walter Crutchfield Managing Partner at Vintage Investment Partners. “Not only have their home designs improved our design guidelines but the way they’re building the homes will raise the bar for innovation in developments around the country.”

In order to accomplish this Mosaic brings an extensive range of experience and the power of their proprietary software to make homebuilding scalable. Their end-to-end homebuilding software platform delivers value throughout the entire homebuilding process from design through construction and even extending into warranty calls.

“Our mission is to build places people love and make them widely available” said Salman Ahmad CEO and co-founder of Mosaic. “We have developed software technologies that make construction more efficient and scalable. With every home Mosaic builds we are expanding an ecosystem of like-minded partners eager to improve our communities. By scripting and automating the construction process we are able to build in a way that is more dynamic allowing us to build more diverse and unique homes anywhere in the world.”

The Mosaic team combines construction technology real estate development academic and business expertise. Members hail from Google Microsoft Palantir MIT Harvard and Stanford bringing the power of software to construction. Since 2017 they have provided construction management and related services to developers and homebuilders in Arizona.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Value investing is in the spotlight but not all value strategies are created equal. Benefiting from the recent value rally has likely been driven by your choice of value factor.

Let’s dig into how the various value factors have performed over recent and longer-term periods.

Every value factor has performed well since September 2020 but price-to-book and shareholder yield are the leaders of the value factor pack. The least expensive quintiles of the Russell 1000 Index as measured by price-to-book and shareholder yield have returned 42.8% and 38.2% respectively.1

More interesting is the performance differential between the least and most expensive quintiles of the market. The median outperformance of the inexpensive versus expensive quintiles across factors is 26%.2 The clear outlier of the group is price-to-book with 37.8% of value outperformance.3 This is a very notable shift in dynamic for price-to-book which was in the hot seat for many years as critics questioned its efficacy as a value factor with good reason.

Despite these recent value factor trends it would be remiss to neglect the past. In the last 10 years shareholder yield was the only value factor that “worked”—meaning it was the only effective way to screen the Russell 1000 Index for the least expensive stocks and outperform not only the expensive stocks but also the benchmark index itself.

Over this same period price-to-book was the least effective of the group with the most expensive quintile outperforming the least expensive by 8.7% annualized.

Please see Glossary for definitions of terms and indexes referenced.

The consistency of shareholder yield in the recent value upturn and over the last 10 years is an important differentiator. At WisdomTree we view shareholder yield as an effective value factor for both short-term tactical value investors and long-term strategic value investors.

Our Shareholder Yield Strategy—QSY

Since the value tide started turning in September 2020 our WisdomTree Quality Shareholder Yield Fund (QSY) has outperformed the Morningstar U.S. Fund Large Value category average by 990bps and the Russell 1000 Value Index by 776bps.4

For standardized performance of QSY please click here.

QSY is a quantitative active strategy that combines a methodical approach to ranking stocks on their shareholder yield and quality scores with the added ability to apply discretion where risks or opportunities to the quantitative model arise.

We recently rebalanced QSY to update the holdings for some notable repurchase activity taking place. Most importantly we added Berkshire Hathaway to QSY which repurchased 5% of its shares outstanding in calendar year 2020.5 In dollar amount and yield terms Berkshire repurchased $24.7 billion in shares relative to its approximately $580 billion market cap equating to a 4.2% shareholder yield.

Although repurchases are a recent development at Berkshire Chair and CEO Warren Buffett discussed the benefits of price-sensitive repurchases: “The math of repurchases grinds away slowly but can be powerful over time. The process offers a simple way for investors to own an ever-expanding portion of exceptional businesses.6“

In Buffett’s view prudently managed repurchase programs allow investors to increase their ownership in a given company without spending a single dollar of their own money.

QSY incorporates Buffett’s principles of investing on buybacks as well as his emphasis on investing in high-quality businesses at reasonable valuations. This is readily apparent in QSY’s fundamental characteristics. Relative to the Russell 1000 and S&P 500 benchmark indexes QSY boasts lower valuations on both shareholder yield and price-to-earnings with higher or top-tier quality metrics including return on assets return on equity and forward earnings growth expectations.

Please see Glossary for definitions of terms and indexes referenced.

The combination of a well-executed high-conviction buyback program with a consistent cash dividend has the potential to drive excess returns for investors across value factor cycles.

We suggest QSY as a potential solution for investors seeking exposure to large- to mid-cap U.S. companies exhibiting high-quality characteristics while returning significant amounts of capital to their shareholders.

Indeed Macy's lost $4.8 billion before taxes under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in fiscal 2020. Even after removing various one-time charges it posted an adjusted net loss of $688 million.

Nevertheless Macy's stock has come roaring back roughly tripling since April 2020. In fact while the stock remains well below its 2018 highs it has recovered all the way to where it stood in early 2020 (before the pandemic).

Considering the pandemic's impact on Macy's business and the long-term pressure department stores have faced over the past decade it would be natural to assume that Macy's stock is now overvalued. However that isn't necessarily true. Let's take a look.

Sales are starting to recover

Macy's sales plunged 29% year over year to $17.3 billion last year. However the worst damage occurred in the first half of the year particularly the first quarter when sales plummeted 45% year over year. By the fourth quarter sales were down less than 20% year over year.

In conjunction with its Q4earnings callin late February management predicted that sales would come in between $4.19 billion and $4.29 billion this quarter. This guidance implied that sales would be down 22% to 24% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019: weaker than the company's Q4 performance.

Fortunately business trends have surpassed management's expectations. Sales at department stores jumped 13% last month relative to February according to the Census Bureau's March retail sales report. During a recent TV appearance CEO Jeff Gennette said the company's most loyal customers -- those who hold its store-branded credit card -- were starting to spend more. And at an investor conference last week Macy's CFO Adrian Mitchell confirmed that sales trends had improved compared to the fourth quarter.

As more Americans receive their COVID-19 vaccinations over the next few months and the U.S. economy reopens demand and store traffic should continue to improve. Management hopes that sales will eventually surpass the company's 2019 result of $24.6 billion. This target assumes that digital sales will reach $10 billion within three years up from around $7.6 billion last year while in-store sales will make a partial recovery.

Cost cuts bolster earnings potential

Even if Macy's can't quite get sales back to 2019 levels the company could emerge from the pandemic as a more profitable business. Last year Macy's identified $2.1 billion of annual savings that it expects to realize by 2022 mainly from slashing overhead reducing store-related costs and using technological improvements to boost gross margin.

Macy's will need to use some of that savings to offset other profitability headwinds and some to invest in growth initiatives. Still a meaningful amount should drop to the bottom line.

To be sure earnings will remain depressed in 2021. Initial guidance calls for earnings per share between $0.40 and $0.90 down from $2.91 in fiscal 2019. However like the department store giant's initial Q1 sales forecast that projection is probably very conservative. And EPS could leap higher in fiscal 2022 assuming the economy reopens fully by the end of this year.

The balance sheet is surprisingly solid

Despite posting a big loss last year Macy's actually generated positive free cash flow. As a result it ended fiscal 2020 with $1.7 billion of cash on hand: up by $1 billion year over year.

Once the business environment stabilizes Macy's will be able to use its excess cash to pay down debt. It also expects to receive a $520 million income tax refund in the first half of 2022 adding to its debt reduction potential. By the end of next year the company will likely have less debt than it had prior to the pandemic making Macy's stock a less risky investment.

Has Macy's learned its lesson?

While the COVID-19 pandemic decimated business in the short term it forced management to tackle the retailer's weaknesses with greater urgency. For example in addition to the deep cost cuts referenced above Macy's learned how to operate with dramatically lower inventory during fiscal 2020. Operating with lean inventory frees up working capital and supports gross margin by reducing the need for clearance discounts.

The pandemic also drove some competitors out of business while forcing others to shrink dramatically in bankruptcy. That could allow the department store chain to gain market share particularly as demand for dressy apparel rebounds over the next few years.

Between its cost cuts digital sales growth and improved inventory management Macy's has a decent chance of emerging from the pandemic with higher margins than it had in 2019. If that happens Macy's stock could continue rising -- even though it has already recovered all of its pandemic-related losses.

Look No Further than 'AMOM',"It's not just the future. Investors can use artificial intelligence in their portfolios with assets like the QRAFT AI Enhanced U.S. Large Cap Momentum ETF (AMOM).

AMOM is an actively-managed exchange traded fund that aims to provide investors with long-term capital appreciation by utilizing a proprietary artificial intelligence system to select large-capitalization U.S. stocks to be held in the portfolio. The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets plus the amounts of any borrowings for investment purposes in securities of U.S.-listed large-capitalization companies.

Just like a sailboat needs wind to move traders need momentum in order to play price action. That's the impetus for AMOM's methodology which focuses on equities exhibiting strong momentum.

As such AMOM seeks to hold stocks with exposure to the momentum factor. The fund utilizes artificial intelligence to determine how a company’s momentum over a certain period would change and/or affect the company’s performance over time and recommends a weighting of such company based on its potential for maximum return as compared to other companies.

In addition AMOM offers factor exposure and may be appropriate for investors seeking exposure to the momentum factor. Finally since AMOM functions as an investment strategy based on cutting-edge technology QRFT may be appropriate as an alternatives allocation.

Amazon Tops AMOM's Momentum Mix

A look at AMOM's top holdings doesn't show a one-sided skew towards big tech highlighting the fund's momentum mix in various sectors. The largest holding at the time of writing is Amazon at 8.37%.

The online retail giant will actually be reporting its first quarter earnings results on April 29. As such AMOM will be one to watch should Amazon deliver blockbuster earnings.

Early indications are optimistic.

""Most investors will probably be feeling optimistic about the e-commerce and technology giant's report"" a Motley Fool article published in Nasdaq noted. ""The company has a solid recent track record of easily beating -- often crushing -- its own guidance and Wall Street's consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines.""

""In the last three quarters of 2020 Amazon's earnings exceeded analysts' expectations by a whopping 606% (second quarter) 67% (third quarter) and 95% (fourth quarter)"" the article added.

Does it succeed?,"What’s Who Killed Sara?

Who Killed Sara? a.k.a. ¿Quién Mató a Sara? is a Spanish-language television series from Netflix that’s been hanging out in their top ten for the past couple of weeks. Created by Chilean screenwriter José Ignacio Valenzuela it’s a show that attempts to combine the “dead girl with secrets” mysteries of Twin Peaks with the “rich people being awful” fun of Succession. It is not however an attempt to capture Twin Peaks’ surrealism or Succession’s satire. Who Killed Sara is light frothy deeply committed to on-screen nudity and really only has one question on its mind: Who killed Sara?

Who killed Sara?

Ten episodes in and we don’t know for sure! The Sara in question is Sara Guzmán (Ximenia Lamadrid) a young woman who is killed in what initially seems to be a parasailing accident in the early-aughts flashback sequence that opens the series. Sara’s brother Alex (Manolo Cardona in the present-day Leo Deluglio in flashbacks) tells police he was the person who strapped Sara into the parachute so when they discover that her harness had been sabotaged he’s convicted of murder and sentenced to thirty years in prison.

So Alex killed Sara.

No! Alex was lying about the parachute! The boat towing Sara’s parachute belonged to the wealthy and powerful Lazcano family and the patriarch César (Ginés García Millán) was afraid his children would be caught up in a scandal. César convinces Alex to take the blame before evidence of foul play surfaces promising him he’ll serve a few weeks for involuntary negligence tops. The Lazcanos have money from their casino empire the Guzmáns do not and in exchange for Alex’s lie César vows to pay for lifesaving medical treatment for Alex’s terminally ill mother and support him financially after he’s released. Once Sara’s death turns into a murder investigation however the Lazcanos cut Alex loose. Eighteen years later Alex gets out of prison and begins seeking revenge. Unless the show is gearing up for a Fight-Club-style multiple-personality plot Alex is the one person who didn’t kill Sara.

Why did the police think Alex would have murdered his sister?

Their theory was that Alex was mad at Sara because she was pregnant with her boyfriend Rodolfo Lazcano’s child. That’s fine as far as it goes but a lot of other characters had more pressing reasons to want Sara Guzmán dead.

Like what?

I’m glad you asked! Here are a few other suspects and their motives.

• Rodolfo Lazcano the heir to the Lazcano casino empire who actually strapped Sara into her parachute might have discovered that Sara’s baby wasn’t his. Although we don’t know yet for sure whose child she was carrying Sara had slept with at least one other person: Rodolfo’s father César.

• José María “Chema” Lazcano Rodolfo’s older brother knew that Sara had discovered he was gay. In the series’ present-day scenes Chema is out to his family but as a teenager he wasn’t. Sara who once walked in on Chema masturbating while secretly videotaping Alex in the shower threatened to tell César about his son’s sexuality shortly before her death.

• Sergio César’s business partner oversees the casino’s secret brothel and occasionally enjoys videotaping himself beating women to death. Sara discovered one of Sergio’s snuff films giving him more than enough reason to put her out of the picture.

• César Lazcano had more reasons to want Sara dead than almost anyone else in the series. He would not have wanted his family to discover he had slept with his son’s girlfriend. He wouldn’t want Sara to have his child. And he definitely would not have wanted his casino’s brothel or his business partner’s hobbies to become public.

• Mariana Lazcano the family matriarch had most of the same reasons César did—it’s not clear how much she knows about the family sideline in human trafficking—plus she’s not happy with Sara for sleeping with her husband and doesn’t want her to join the Lazcano family.

• Elroy Mariana’s personal assistant is in love with Sara and hurt and angry that she referred to him as “the help” when he tried to kiss her.

These people sound like a nest of vipers.

Well they’re rich. I haven’t even gotten into the big game hunting or the time César got Rodolfo’s wife pregnant or the way Chema gets iced out of the family business over his sexuality or the cilice Mariana wears on her thigh or who tried to kill Sara.

Who tried to kill Sara?

Yeah although we don’t know who actually cut Sara’s harness we know that Mariana and Elroy planned to kill her that way. Mariana knows that Elroy murdered both of his parents—in separate incidents!—as a very young boy and has been using that information to blackmail him ever since the Lazcano family pulled him out of an orphanage. (She’s also been molesting him since he was a kid; the show does not miss any opportunities to be sordid.) Before Sara’s final boat ride Mariana encourages her to go parasailing pregnant or not and orders Elroy to cut the harness and keep the Lazcano boys away from the parachute. Elroy later tells Mariana that he couldn’t bring himself to cut the harness but he’s either lying or someone else carried out their plan for the murder. Although we still don’t know who killed Sara we do know that Mariana killed Elroy after Elroy’s failed public suicide attempt so he won’t be talking.

That is extremely sordid. Are there any other suspects?

Well there’s Sara herself! Who Killed Sara takes some of its cues from Twin Peaks so just like Laura Palmer Sara Guzmán kept two separate diaries. Her secret diary hidden in the wall of her bedroom for Alex to discover in the season finale is considerably less cheerful than her public one full of disturbing sketches and crayon scrawls repeating phrases like “I want to die” and “I am many Saras.” There’s also a map to the shallow grave in the yard where she buried the body!

Wait what?

Yeah as Alex discovers there’s a skeleton in the Guzmán family backyard with a silver dollar-sized hole in its forehead and Sara knew it was there. As a flashback reveals Don César seems to have shot the skull’s owner in the head but we don’t yet know who it was what his or her connection to Sara was or how the body ended up at the Guzmán home. We know that Sara was very concerned about her own mental health—she wrote “Am I like him? Am I crazy?” on one of her secret diary pages—so given the show’s obsession with paternity Don César’s habit of getting people inconveniently pregnant and the fact that we don’t yet know much about Alex and Sara’s mom there are probably a lot more secrets to unravel before we can say with any certainty who killed Sara who Sara killed and so on and so forth.

When can television audiences expect to learn more about the depravity of the Lazcano family the trail of bodies they leave in their wake Sara Guzmán’s possible complicity in their schemes and the many many subplots you didn’t have time to mention here like Chema and Lorenzo’s search for a surrogate or César’s affair with Rodolfo’s wife or the murder of Flor Sanchez?

The second season of Who Killed Sara? hits Netflix on May 19.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZXcuY29tL21vdmllcy9uZXRmbGl4LXdoeS1kaWQteW91LWtpbGwtbWUtc2hvY2tpbmctbW9tZW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The most shocking moments from Netflix's hit new true-crime documentary 'Why Did You Kill Me?',"The hit new Netflix documentary Why Did You Kill Me? explores Crystal Theobald's tragic death and the extraordinary efforts her family made to ensure those involved in the 24-year-old's murder were held accountable.

Gang-related deaths in Riverside Calif. are all too common but what stood out from Theobald's case is how her mother Belinda Lane sought information about her killer through MySpace. Thanks to Lane's non-police-sanctioned investigation she found justice for her daughter who left two young children behind.

Why Did You Kill Me. Netflix

Here are the documentary's most shocking moments.

Mistaken Identity

Eight members of the local gang known as 5150 were on the prowl on Feb. 24 2006 searching for a white SUV with members of rival gang MD-17 who allegedly shot at them earlier that day. Theobald her boyfriend Juan Patlan and her brother Justin Theobald were inside Justin's white SUV when they were ambushed by the 5150 members around 8:40 p.m. She succumbed to her injuries two days later.

Catfishing a killer

In response to Theobald's murder her cousin Jaimie McIntyre (14 at the time) launched a MySpace profile using photos of Theobald and a fake name in hopes of befriending anyone who could help unravel the events of that fateful night. Through her attempts she connected with William ""Joker"" Sotelo a known 5150 member who later revealed himself as the owner of a white Ford Escalade.

Lane shared the intel with local law enforcement who brought in Sotelo for questioning. He admitted to owning and driving the vehicle that shot up Theobald's vehicle on the night in question. He also gave officers the name of gangmate Julio ""Lil Huero"" Heredia the 17-year-old who it is later revealed accidentally killed Theobald after shooting at her car which he mistook for that of a rival gang member.

McIntyre struggled with having to impersonate her beloved cousin on social media and eventually handed the passwords along to Lane who pushed the unsanctioned investigation forward. ""Making someone fall in love with someone who is dead is not a good feeling inside"" McIntyre shared in the documentary through tears.

Netflix

A mother's struggle

Lane was battling demons of her own before her daughter's untimely death which she was able to beat in the wake of the tragedy. She revealed she was a regular meth user and also sold the drug which Theobald asked her repeatedly to give up.

Investigating the murder gave Lane a renewed sense of purpose eventually taking over the MySpace account from McIntyre. When information stalled she became depressed and frustrated which led her to be more inquisitive with the gang members on social media. Armed with new information she hit the road documenting whatever she could including photos of cars and their license plates.

She became obsessed with the case which took her down a dark and dangerous path. Through the social media platform Lane sought revenge against the 5150 by contacting a third gang known as Casa Blanca intending to start a war between the two gangs. Police asked Lane to stop instigating after a number of white SUVs were shot up or set on fire in the area.

In a final ditch effort at revenge Lane sent around a fake invitation for an end-of-the-world party leading to an uninhabited road so she could kill them herself.

""Oh I was going to shoot them"" Lane confessed in the documentary. ""They were mine. I was going to shoot them myself. I had a plan and I had a gun.""

Her surviving sons did not allow her to follow through with her plans. Shortly thereafter she ended contact with Sotelo and she ended her investigation.

Netflix

Busted

After Lane revealed to Sotelo the woman in the MySpace photo was deceased and her suspicions he played a role he went into hiding. Law enforcement worked other angles for answers including interviews with 5150 members brothers Manuel and William Lemus whose testimony helped convict Heredia of the murder. Neither was ever criminally charged in exchange for their cooperation.

Where are they now?

Heredia was convicted in 2011 of seven criminal offenses including the first-degree murder of Theobald attempted murder of her brother Justin and her boyfriend among other charges. On the murder count Heredia was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole plus 25 years to life for death by firearm. His life was spared thanks to Lane.

He is currently serving his sentence at the California State Prison in Sacramento.

Sotelo was captured a decade after he went into hiding after Lane received an anonymous tip about his whereabouts in Mexico where he was living with his wife and four children. He pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in early 2020 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison.

The now 33-year-old is incarcerated at the Centinela State Prison and will be eligible for parole in May 2030.

""Sports should not be used for politics nor to whitewash atrocities. Jamal was brutally murdered and it would be shameful if the man who stands accused of ordering it were allowed to benefit from this famous and profitable boxing match.

A man who lived at the unit where NRL star Jack de Belin allegedly raped a teenager alongside friend Callan Sinclair has admitted he lied to police about what he saw that night because he didn't want to reveal the footballer was cheating on his girlfriend.

Troy Martin has told the men's District Court trial he deliberately misled police by telling them he slept through the incident at the north Wollongong townhouse he shared with Mr de Belin's cousin Jake Lewis.

He told the court he actually woke to ""murmurs"" inside the home before walking to Mr Lewis's bedroom where he saw a nude Mr de Belin at the foot of a bed the naked woman lying on her back and Mr Sinclair standing nearby fully clothed.

St George Illawarra Dragons forward Mr de Belin and Mr Sinclair stand accused of sexually assaulting the woman then 19 after the trio met at Wollongong's popular Mr Crown bar during a Christmas pub crawl in December 2018.

Their trial has been told of allegations from the woman that she felt ""dead inside"" and was crying as the men swapped positions forcing vaginal oral and anal sex on her at a unit on Gipps Street.

Mr de Belin 30 and Mr Sinclair 23 have both pleaded not guilty to five counts of aggravated sexual assault and maintain the encounter with the woman was consensual.

On day six of their trial witness Mr Martin was asked by Mr de Belin's barrister David Campbell SC why he lied when interviewed by police on the night of the incident with the court hearing officers had told him they were investigating a ""serious matter"".

""Once (I was) driving to the police station I realised I didn't want to be involved in whatever happened … so I tried to say as little as possible to protect myself"" he said.

""And obviously seeing Jack and knowing that Jack had a partner I really didn't want to be the person who was going to tell everyone that he was cheating on his partner at the time.""

Earlier Mr Martin told the court he woke at about 1.30am on December 9 2018 to voices and realised they were coming from inside the home.

He walked down a flight of stairs and saw the trio through an open bedroom door. The woman said ""who's that?"" before Mr de Belin closed the door the court was told.

The trial had previously heard evidence from the woman that she denied seeing or hearing anyone else at the unit on the night of the incident.

Mr Martin said after looking inside the room for a few seconds he proceeded to a nearby bathroom where Mr de Belin popped his head around the corner of the bathroom door to say: ""Sorry mate just borrowing your house. Didn't realise anyone was there.""

Mr Martin said he did not hear any screams or the woman saying ""No"".

The court was told Mr Lewis was out of town on the night and there was an arrangement at the Gipps Street home where family and friends were welcome to let themselves in via a garage door.

Mr Martin agreed when asked point blank by crown prosecutor David Scully if he had lied when he originally told police he woke briefly to some noises but went back to sleep without investigating.

Mr Scully also put to Mr Martin that his story about Mr de Belin leaving the bedroom to talk just as he was about to have sex with the woman was ""complete fiction"".

""I suggest to you that you are deliberately lying to this jury about this whole scenario about Mr de Belin coming out of the bedroom naked and having a chat with you"" Mr Scully said.

Mr Martin replied: ""I disagree.""

Mr de Belin's cousin Mr Lewis told the court that when he returned from a trip on Monday December 10 2018 Mr Martin recounted seeing the group in his bedroom.

Mr Matin said on the Sunday he received a text message from his cousin: ""PS I broke into your house last night and Trog was there aha whoops.""

The court was told ""Trog"" was a nickname given to Mr Martin.

Later on Wednesday Thomas Strong a friend of Mr Sinclair who also knew the woman gave evidence of seeing them in an Uber with Mr de Belin after the alleged rape.

The court was told Mr Sinclair called out to Mr Strong who wandered over to say hello to the group with a pie in his hand and Mr de Belin took a bite out of the baked good.

When he returned home Mr Strong received a Snapchat message from the woman stating ""those guys who just saw me with f***ing abused me sexually"".

Mr Strong said he offered to call an Uber for the woman to come and stay at his house but received no response.

The next day he called Mr Sinclair who the court heard was ""shocked"" and ""in disbelief"" at the message.

The jury was also played audio of evidence given by tuktuk driver Gary Port at the men's previous trial in November that could not be concluded.

Mr Port said he picked up who he now knew to be Mr de Belin Mr Sinclair and the woman at the end of Crown Street mall in the early hours of December 9 2018.

He said Mr de Belin – who he referred to as the ""gentleman with the Akubra"" – repeated ""You'll have to trust me"" when asked several times for a drop-off address.

Mr Port the lack of a clear answer caused him to ""become alerted"".

The driver said Mr de Belin directed him to a steep hill that he refused to peddle up and the trio hopped out with the footballer handing him a $50 note.

Mr Port said after hopping out of the tuktuk Mr de Belin said to the group ""we're going up the hill"" which drew protest from the woman.

""I heard the girl distinctly what she said … 'like f**k are we'"" he said.

The court has heard evidence from the woman that she was reluctant to go inside the townhouse where she was allegedly raped. She claimed she only did so to use the toilet.

After being paid Mr Port said he left straight away and at the time had no idea who Mr de Belin was: ""wouldn't have if I fell over him"".

He had a memory of the woman on the back flashing passing cars while on the journey but said he couldn't be sure whether that incident occurred during a different fare.

The trial before Judge Nicole Noman continues."

The 24-year-old pop star placed fifth in his 50-metre heat and only narrowly missed advancing to Sunday's final by 0.02 seconds.

Hopeful: Cody Simpson 24 - who missed advancing to Australian Swimming Championships by 0.02 seconds- has said that he is 'just dusting himself off' having just left quarantine

'I probably would have liked to have gone a little quicker but it was the first race back in a long time and I’ve only just come out of quarantine' he said.

Cody continued: 'Two weeks out of the water sets you back quite a while but I had to get through the quarantine at some point.'

'I just wanted to get up and at least do the 50m to dust myself off.'

Cody's disappointment was written all over his face after he left the pool following the race.

Presented by Sky News Host and The Australian’s Associate Editor Chris Kenny the one-hour special investigation examines the extraordinary parallel lives of two former Australian Prime Ministers – Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull.

Once enemies and aggressive rivals Rudd and Turnbull saw each other as the main barrier to each other’s destiny as their naked ambitions defined one of the most turbulent times in Australian politics.

Now they're united in bitterness as the most unlikely of allies. They have thrust themselves back into the spotlight with an extraordinary campaign to try to save their legacies by shifting the blame of their demise onto the media in particular News Corp media organisations.

Sky News investigates the real story behind their success and ultimate failures.

A former chief of staff to Malcolm Turnbull Chris Kenny explores every aspect of the former Prime Ministers’ lives probing the shared narrative that binds the two. From boys suffering loss to leaders of their country they were both shaped by childhood trauma rose rapidly in brilliant pre-politics careers and married strong women before leading their parties and their nation. They shaped a tumultuous period that might have forever changed Australia’s political paradigm.

The documentary hears from people who know these men well and have seen them in close quarters. Interviewees include Kevin Rudd’s brother and Canberra lobbyist Greg Rudd former Labor party leader Mark Latham former Liberal party minister Sharman Stone former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie political commentator Tom Switzer former Liberal senator Nick Minchin veteran cartoonist Warren Brown former editor in chief of The Australian Chris Mitchell and Sky News Anchor and former Turnbull staffer Peta Credlin.

Chris Kenny said: “I have known and watched these men for all of their federal political careers and the parallels between them are extraordinary; they share similar talents and skills were embraced as Messiah figures by the public and their parties and brought themselves undone with the same fatal flaws. A key question remains about what influence these brilliant but bristling former Prime Ministers will have on our nation.”

Watch 'Men In The Mirror: Rudd & Turnbull' on Sunday 2 May at 8pm AEST on Sky News on Foxtel and Sky News on WIN or listen on Sky News on iHeartRadio."

The sportswear giant has filed plans with the city indicating it intends to build a Nike Live store at 1520 W Swann Ave. in Hyde Park Village. The building was formerly occupied by an LA Fitness gym.

Nike Live stores are membership-driven boutiques built around consumer data and customized service with rotating merchandise and member perks and exclusive experiences. In 2018 the industry publication Retail Dive awarded Nike Live its Store Concept of the Year. Nike has said it plans to open 30 Nike Live stores during the first half of this year and even more going forward.

“Nike Live is the result of a singular vision: to design the most locally-relevant experience out there leveraging digital with personal service” Cathy Sparks the vice president and general manager of Global Nike Direct Stores and Services said in 2019.

According to architectural plans the 4652-square-foot Tampa store would feature a facade of glass decorated with oversized images of athletes in action along with a separate “dressing lounge” with two rooms for trying on clothes.

The athletic mainstay’s latest iteration sees the Air Max 90 NRG in an entirely new “Venn Diagram” iteration.

With spring in full swing neon colors are pretty much expected when it comes to new footwear releases. A newly-released Nike Air Max 270‘s take on this seasonal trend involved letting tropical brights contrast a black base for a more subdued yet still fun look.

Breathable mesh uppers of the model flaunt an all-black makeup including the tongue and laces. This black is sharply contrasted by the Green Strike applied to the lace loops Air unit and midsole element. The Air unit and midsole element form a two-piece midsole that delivers a smooth transition during every step the wearer takes. To further enforce a tropical theme the sockliner heel loop and branded overlays introduce Aquamarine to the mix. Another neon shade which appears to be hot pink decorates the Air logo on the heel and a part of the outsole as the final touch of color.

The Nike Refurbished program the culmination of nearly two years of “extensive research” arrived at eight outlet stores nationwide with plans to continue adding locations throughout the year.

This program is just one part of Nike’s larger sustainability strategy. This summer the company plans to release a range of eco-friendly shoes that center some of its other green initiatives namely using recycled content.

The latest summer offerings in Nike’s Move to Zero journey will include what the company calls one of its “most sustainable shoes to date.” The Air VaporMax 2021 made with at least 55 percent recycled content by weight features a full-length VaporMax Nike Air unit made with about 75 percent recycled materials TPU on the heel clip and toe tip containing about 60 percent recycled materials and an outsole incorporating Nike’s recycled Grind material.

The Plant Cork Pack draws its inspiration from the natural world. Each shoe is made with about 20 percent recycled content. Specifically the outsoles of the Air Force 1 Blazer and Daybreak include 9 percent recycled cork—partially sourced from the wine industry—infused in the rubber.

Nike’s summer lineup includes a Blazer with a cork-infused outsole. Nike

Nike is also building off its learnings from Space Hippie with the Nike Crater Impact a new silhouette made with about 25 percent recycled material by weight combining efficient overlays stitched curves and an embroidered Swoosh to help avoid waste. The soft Crater Foam midsole combines about 10 percent Nike Grind with a blend of foams.

The company will also release new colors of Cosmic Unity its first performance shoe made with at least 25 percent recycled material by weight. Two other performance silhouettes—the Air Zoom SuperRep 2 Next Nature and the Nike Victory G Lite—will also take on sustainability with both made using at least 20 percent recycled material by weight.

Nike’s chief sustainability officer Noel Kinder discussed Nike’s carbon footprint Tuesday in a post on the company’s website acknowledging it has fallen short on some of its sustainability goals including when it comes to carbon reduction.

“So we’re changing our approach” Kinder wrote. “Through our 2025 carbon targets we’re stepping up with more clarity and precision. Across the company our teams are pulling together with surgical focus on our biggest challenges—and our biggest opportunities: sustainable materials renewable energy and energy efficiency.”

Over the next five years Kinder said Nike plans to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 0.5 million tons by increasing its use of environmentally preferred materials to 50 percent of all key materials. Materials Kinder noted account for 70 percent of Nike’s carbon footprint.

“We’re rising to the challenge by accelerating research and development around sustainable materials and exploring opportunities to bring low-carbon alternatives to market at scale” Kinder added.

Other five-year goals include driving a 70 percent absolute reduction of greenhouse gas emissions across owned and operated facilities through 100 percent renewable electricity and fleet electrification as well as keeping greenhouse gas emissions from key suppliers’ operations at or below 2020 levels while maintaining business growth.

Nike’s latest sneaker releases

Meanwhile Nike dropped the KD14 the latest iteration of Kevin Durant’s signature franchise last week. The Brooklyn Nets star’s varied line—past silhouettes include sleek football boot-like low tops plush sock racers and ‘90s-style power mids—brings back an over-the-laces strap for the first time since the KD7.

“It’s been a while since we incorporated the strap which excites me” Durant said in a statement. “My other favorite part about the shoe is the cushioning which helps me feel low to the ground and still helps give me some of that energy back.”

The KD14 released in a black-and-white colorway internationally Saturday and in North America Wednesday. A white-and-lime green “Cyber” colorway debuted Sunday in Greater China.

The Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 38 meanwhile began its worldwide rollout Thursday.

The running shoe introduces several updates to the Pegasus 37 including a roomier toe box; a midfoot webbing system that allows wearers to lace up to a personalized fit; a new soft and breathable sandwich mesh material; and extra foam in the tongue.

The sneaker keeps several features from its predecessor including full-length Nike React foam and a forefoot Zoom Air Unit. Nike will again offer a FlyEase version with a zippered entry and no-tie lacing allowing the wearer to secure the shoe with only one hand. The Nike By You Builder will let consumers design their own Pegasus 38—traditional or FlyEase—by adjusting arch height traction material laces and methods of entry.

The Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 38 released to Nike Members Thursday in Europe. It is slated to arrive in North America April 22 and globally April 29.

Nike updates WNBA collection

With the WNBA headed into its 25th season next month Nike unveiled the basketball league’s all-new uniform system last week. The lineup includes three iterations for each of the organization’s 12 teams: the WNBA Nike Heroine Edition a standard white uniform; the WNBA Nike Explorer Edition a bolder option that “seeks out the creative margins of team identity” using a combination of secondary team colors; and the WNBA Nike Rebel Edition a specialty uniform that “represents inspiring themes of female empowerment from [teams’] cities and their communities.”

Nike’s new WNBA jersey collection includes three iterations: the WNBA Nike Explorer Edition the WNBA Nike Rebel Edition and the WNBA Nike Heroine Edition Nike

The new WNBA Nike uniforms feature several updates born from athlete feedback. Changes include more room in the game shorts’ thighs and glutes and across the game jersey’s chest. The jerseys offer three neckline options: a round-neck a V-neck and a new “Victory” neckline exclusive to the WNBA. The uniforms also debut Nike Dri-Fit ADV technology—an engineered knit material designed to enable more freedom of movement and comfort—in a professional league uniform.

“When our team met with our athletes their feedback was very clear” Tania Flynn Nike vice president of women’s apparel design said in a statement. “They wanted a uniform that fits them not one they have to fit into. They wanted a connection to their team and fans but also wanted to express their personal style. And they wanted us to tell their story. The new uniforms obsess all of those details for the world’s best players technically and creatively.”

Nike also unveiled the WNBA Team 13 collection for fans. The line includes popular pieces such as the Nike WNBA pullover hoodie as well as a new knit game jacket and pant a reversible vest and coveralls.

The WNBA Nike Rebel Edition Uniforms became available exclusively to Nike Members last week on the company’s website and app. The WNBA Nike Explorer Edition and the WNBA Team 13 collection dropped Wednesday."

Those hopes were on full display Tuesday during a hearing by the House Democratic Policy Committee with the optimistic title: “Back on Track – Investing in Passenger Rail.”

Increased federal funding “would be major” Jennie Granger PennDOT’s deputy secretary for multi-modal transportation told the committee.

Federal funding would help bring “the Amtrak and SEPTA systems into a state of good repair and could provide capital to start new service” she said.

Up until now “dollars have been scarce” Granger said. “We’re Looking for strategic investment in passenger rail that benefits all Pennsylvanians.”

Route 422 is Full

State Rep. Joe Ciresi D-146th Dist. who chaired the hearing has his eyes on the Pennsylvanians who live in the Schuylkill River Valley and spend too much of their lives sitting in traffic on Route 422.

Ciresi said highways cannot grow to accommodate the traffic that’s coming.

“Frankly on Route 422 we don’t have the capacity even just in Montgomery County where we still have tens of thousands of acres to build houses on” said Ciresi.

“Population is going to go somewhere and most will go out not up” said Jim Matthews CEO of the national Rail Passengers Association. “You can’t just keep building roads.”

“The key is to move people not vehicles” he said of the nation’s transportation goals.

Ciresi has advocated often for some way to resume rail service to help reduce the legendary traffic congestion along the length of Route 422 between Reading and King of Prussia.

Most recently he spearheaded a study funded by the Pottstown Area Health and Wellness Foundation and undertaken by two Australian professors on the efficacy of a combination of “trackless trams” and commuter rail as a way to ease congestion on the perennially congested highway.

And that is far from the only possibility.

Several initiatives looking to return the passenger rail service along the Schuylkill that ended in 1981 have been raised over the years.

Nearly 20 years ago the Schuylkill Valley Metro effort aimed to establish a 62-mile long commuter railway through 51 municipalities with 34 stations including Oaks Linfield Phoenixville Lower Pottsgrove Pottstown Douglassville and Exeter.

Trains were envisioned to run every 15 minutes during peak hours and every 30 minutes during off-peak hours with a weekday ridership at 49500.

The cost of that over-ambitious proposal ballooned over the years to more than $2 billion and the project died an ugly death when a toll on route 422 was proposed as the only way to fund the effort.

But the dream did not die.

Renewed Interest

John P. Weidenhammer chairman of Berks Alliance conceded “there have been lots of studies but none seem to have gained traction.”

But Biden’s infrastructure plan if passed by Congress just may be the game-changer he said.

“What’s changed? The economics have changed. The technology has changed and the environment need and approach have changed” Weidenhammer said.

The Berks Alliance sponsored one of the more recent studies undertaken by Transportation Economics & Management Systems Inc. looking at returning passenger rail between Reading and Philadelphia.

That study has estimated the cost of restoring passenger service along the Schuylkill using existing tracks owned by the Norfolk-Southern freight line with 10 trains per day would cost $365 million in capital investment.

A similar study by PennDOT put the cost between $616 million and $818 million he said noting that the study also included infrastructure upgrades and repairs.

Recent studies show rail connection between Phoenixville Pottstown and Reading could support 3000 to 6400 riders per day said Jody Holton assistant general manager of planning at SEPTA and former director of the Montgomery County Planning Commission.

West Chester has also begun to push for a return for passenger rail services as has Perkasie in Bucks County said Holton.

Increased Property Values

Another effort to restore commuter rail only as far as Phoenixville has also been under consideration for nearly two years and estimated capital costs at $130 million.

That study uses the projected increase in property values near a Phoenixville station as the economic engine to fund paying the costs of the new infrastructure needed.

That is the successful approach of the new “Bright Line” rail line built in southern Florida in 2018 linking Miami West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale – and currently constructing an expansion to Orlando – said Brian Pitzer CEO of the advocacy group All Aboard Erie.

The Bright Line is “is looked at in terms of the increase in real estate value that’s part of the economic benefit” said Pitzer.

Holton agreed noting SEPTA data shows living within 1.5 miles of one of their regional rail stations adds 11 percent to a home’s value.

AMTRAK Steps Up

But perhaps the proposal now generating the most buzz is by a national player in the rail travel game – AMTRAK.

According to an outline released by The White House Biden has proposed $85 billion for public transit and another $80 billion for AMTRAK upgrades deferred maintenance and route expansions.

Some of that work is already underway said Granger.

New stations along AMTRAK’s Keystone Service line between Philadelphia and Harrisburg are being built in places like Coatesville where a $1 million grant will also help to pay for a new 480-car parking garage.

The Coatesville facility will also feature bus transportation integration covered waiting shelters bike racks lighting wayfinding signs and nearly 500 parking spaces to support SEPTA Amtrak and Link and Kraft Bus transportation services.

Another new AMTRAK station will come online soon in Middletown she added.

“We’re improving infrastructure that has not been touched since World War II” said Granger.

“Amtrak has a bold vision to bring energy-efficient world-class intercity rail service to up to 160 new communities across the nation” AMTRAK CEO Bill Flynn said in an announcement in the wake of the release of Biden’s proposal.

One of the 30 new routes AMTRAK has proposed in its 2035 Vision plan would run passenger rail between Reading and Philadelphia.

“These are seismic shifts in how we invest in passenger trains” Matthews told the committee. The Biden infrastructure plan could improve AMTRAK rail system and “close the massive deficit between passenger rail and other transportation modes.”

Sharing the Tracks?

No proposal to restore passenger rail service along the Schuylkill can ignore the 62-mile-long elephant in the room – the tracks there are owned by Norfolk-Southern.

And as anyone who was sat at a crossing while a mile-long train goes by knows those tracks are busy with freight traffic.

Rudy Husband a regional vice president for Norfolk Southern who has spent more than 30 years in the rail industry focused mostly in Pennsylvania was among those testifying Tuesday.

Husband told the committee that while the freight carrier recognizes the value of passenger rail it has to prioritize its freight rail customers.

Like Weidenhammer Husband agreed there have been plenty of studies to return passenger rail to the region all of which necessarily have included a seat at the table for Norfolk-Southern.

But “studies have a limited lifespan because things change” Husband testified adding that is why getting funding quickly is vital. “Otherwise all this is just an academic exercise” Husband said.

The national freight giant is “open to cooperating providing the passenger sponsor accepts Norfolk-Southern’s evaluation of impacts on the freight system” he said.

None of the studies proposed for the Schuylkill Valley “are developed to the point where we can evaluate them” said Husband. “In the end it comes down to money.”

He reminded the committee that similar to how passenger rail takes cars off the highway freight rail does the same for trucks.

One multi-modal shipping container that fits on ships as well as rail cars carries the same amount of cargo as 200 trucks he said.

But Norfolk-Southern also has a rarely recognized obligation toward passenger rail service said Matthews.

“AMTRAK was created to bail out freight railroads’ passenger lines. A lot of people forget that” he said noting that “today AMTRAK is providing pensions to people who never wore an AMTRAK uniform.”

And Norfolk-Southern has shared track elsewhere.

Mark Spada president of Western Pennsylvanians for Passenger Rail told the committee that the freight carrier shares track with a new passenger line between Roanoke and Lynchburg Virginia and that “ridership has already exceeded expectations.”

Fix It First

One aspect of rail travel in Pennsylvania that cannot be ignored is the cost of maintenance and upkeep and of replacing aging infrastructure.

According to the White House “the Department of Transportation estimates a repair backlog of over $105 billion representing more than 24000 buses 5000 rail cars 200 stations and thousands of miles of track signals and power systems in need of replacement. This translates to service delays and disruptions that leave riders stranded and discourage transit use.”

This is particularly true in Southeast Pennsylvania said Holton.

SEPTA’s rolling stock was “built when Nixon was president. If it’s not replaced by 2030 we will be forced to close 100 stations and four routes” she said.

“SEPTA is at a crossroads. To help support the region’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and ensure the system is viable for future generations we need to make significant investments now” said SEPTA general manager and former Montgomery County commissioner Leslie Richards.

“This will enable SEPTA to meet pressing state of good repair needs and move forward on our projects of regional significance such as King of Prussia Rail the modernization of our trolley system and replacing one of the nation’s oldest rail fleets” she said.

Further SEPTA estimates it has a $4 billion backlog in maintenance and repairs Holton said.

Part of the reason for this is that SEPTA gets by on half the capital investment enjoyed by similar systems in Boston and New York she said.

“Funding is hard not least because it usually crosses several jurisdictions” Holton said. For example she said if Pennsylvania acts quickly it can “piggyback” on a major capital purchase of new rail cars planned by NJ Transit at a savings but still with a price tag of $1 billion over several years.

“We need sustainable bondable capital funding” said Holton. “It’s important we commit to that investment.”

According to the White House “this investment will double federal funding for public transit spend down the repair backlog and bring bus rapid transit and rail service to communities and neighborhoods across the country.”

‘Investment’ Not ‘Cost

Too often rail travel is “looked at as a cost issue rather than an investment issue” observed state Rep. Kevin Boyle D-172nd Dist. “Philadelphia could be a keystone of the northeast economy with bullet trains to New York City and Washington D.C. if we had high-speed bullet trains.”

Currently growth in the U.S. is primarily benefitting big cities “and small towns are being left behind” said Boyle. High-speed rail would connect those towns to those cities and help revive their economies.

Matthews agreed saying “it’s so hard to get people to look at these as investments. I hate to use the word ‘subsidy’ because it suggests you don’t get pay-off.”

“But it’s not a question about whether trains make money. It’s a question of who trains make money for” says Matthews.

“The pay-off is bigger for small towns than for big cities. We have to look at rail systems as the economic benefit they are” said Matthews. “We don’t question if the National Weather Service makes money. These are the things we pay for so we can have a functioning society as a country.”

His organization is working to create a national intercity passenger rail trust fund to provide the kind of reliable funding Holton said is also necessary for regional rail.

“Unlike highways and transit (intercity) rail lacks a multi-year funding stream to address deferred maintenance enhance existing corridors and build new lines in high-potential locations” according to the information issued by The White House.

“There are currently projects just waiting to be funded that will give millions more Americans reliable and fast inter-city train service. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $80 billion to address Amtrak’s repair backlog; modernize the high traffic Northeast Corridor; improve existing corridors and connect new city pairs” The White House statement said.

Ciresi said state legislators and citizens should work with federal lawmakers “to make sure this bill gets over the finish line.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvZmVsaXgtc2lsbGEtY291c2luLWl0dC1vbi10aGUtYWRkYW1zLWZhbWlseS1kZWFkLWF0LTg0L2FydGljbGVfODA4MmY3NDgtYjVlYi01ZjFmLTk3YTUtM2YxNmNhM2JkOTkzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Felix Silla Cousin Itt on 'The Addams Family' dead at 84,"Memphis TN (38111)

Following a strong showing this weekend at the RBC Heritage in Hilton Head it’s obvious Varner’s confidence was well founded.

Varner finished 15-under par this weekend at Hilton Head’s Harbor Town Golf Links good enough for the local PGA Tour pro to tie for second at the RBC Heritage. The finish is a career best for the former Forestview star who left $631900 richer as a result of the performance.

He followed an opening round 5-under 66 with a 3-under 68 2-under 69 and another 5-under 66 to finish 15-under. Though starting with a bogey to start his final day in Hilton Head he steered clear of trouble the rest of the round.

Varner and Emiliano Grillo wound up four shots behind 2021 RBC Heritage champion Stewart Cink. The Forestview product's previous career best came at the 2019 Northern Trust at Liberty National Golf Club in New Jersey where an overall 270 was good for him to tie for third.

The Gastonia native’s finish has moved him to No. 50 in the FedExCup rankings. This season he has earned $1.3 million.

Rickie Fowler has not been in good form lately. The slump has been extending in unfortunate ways for the five-time PGA Tour champion. Fowler recently failed to qualify for the 2021 Masters and ended his streak of 43 consecutive major appearances spanning from the 2010 U.S. Open. Furthermore Fowler is currently out of contention to compete in the 2021 FedEx Cup playoffs!

The three-tournament schedule of the FedEx Cup playoffs ultimately concludes with the Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club Atlanta. Bryson DeChambeau currently leads the pack in the FedEx Cup standings and he’s got Justin Thomas behind him while Stewart Cink is enjoying his late-career-renaissance in the third spot.

The first stop on the FedEx Cup playoffs is at The Northern Trust which will take place at the Liberty National Golf Club New Jersey from August 16-22. The top 125 players on the FedEx Cup standings qualify for the event and Rickie Fowler isn’t a part of the lot.

Rickie Fowler could miss the FedEx Cup playoffs for the first time in 11 years

Rickie Fowler has enjoyed several memorable moments in his career and is currently enduring a challenging phase. Fowler recently dropped below the Top 100 of the World Golf Rankings for the first time in 11 years. Now he’s on the verge of facing yet another setback to his confidence.

Rickie Fowler is currently 128th on the FedEx Cup standings with 208.603 official points. He definitely needs more to qualify for The Northern Trust which begins in August. Fowler needs to climb three more spots to punch a ticket to the first leg of the 2021 FedEx Cup playoffs to extend his consecutive streak to 12!

But it’s easier said than done. Fowler has generally been a serious competitor at the FedEx Cup playoffs and he finished tied for 49th place at the 2020 Northern Trust. It is crucial that Rickie Fowler finds his form in the upcoming PGA Tour events.

The 2020-21 PGA Tour schedule is a busy one and Rickie Fowler should aim for consistent top 10 finishes at tournaments. On the contrary Fowler achieved zero top-ten finishes in the last ten starts.

It is just about Fowler building up his confidence and getting his rhythm back. The California native has largely been troubled by various factors but he continues to fight for the breakthrough victory.

Rickie Fowler needs to get into the top 125 in the FedEx Cup standings to qualify for the first leg of the playoffs. The requirement is simple: Fowler needs to gain points in the events that stand in between the playoffs which includes the three remaining majors.

Q. Can you tell us something about your background?

A. I'm 41 married with a four-year-old son. I grew up in rural north Antrim although our family home parish is Christ Church Londonderry. Dad is a retired painter and decorator. Mum is a housekeeper in a nursing home. My sister Laura is a nursery teacher in Lincoln.

After Dalriada school I studied languages at Edinburgh University then trained as a teacher at the University of Ulster. I did some missionary work in Bolivia and taught in Dublin before settling in Derry. In 2012 I started ministerial training and was ordained in 2016.

Q. How did you come to faith?

A. I can't remember not believing. I once accompanied my father to Billy parish church where he painted the sanctuary walls midnight blue with gold paint for the stars. There was a sort of holiness about the place. My parents joined a gospel hall when I was five. It was like my childhood faith no longer counted because I couldn't say I'd been saved at a particular moment. Home became very religious although we had a fair amount of latitude - a TV for example. Friends at school helped me navigate teenage life as a Christian and to see a wider world out there.

Q. Have you ever had a crisis about faith?

A. I've seen the effects of fundamentalist religion where questions are discouraged and doubts suppressed. Twelve years ago that was me. I returned from missionary work in Bolivia with depression not sure how much of what I'd been teaching I honestly believed in. I found Christ Church in Derry where I could work through my questions and doubts. I still don't have all the answers but I have a more honest resilient faith.

Q. Have you ever been angry with God and if so why?

A. Yes when I had depression. I thought ""Why me?"" as if it was something that only happened to other people. Looking back it was the making of my faith and a milestone in my call to ministry in Ireland.

Q. Do you ever get criticised for your faith and are you able to live with that criticism?

A. Yes too conservative too liberal too churchy too worldly too staunch too wishy-washy - it depends who you ask. I'm developing a thicker skin and so long as I'm following in the way of Jesus that's all I really need to focus on.

Q. Are you ever ashamed of your own Church or denomination?

A. Yes we've fallen spectacularly short on occasion. But more often I'm inspired by faithful people loving God and neighbour.

Q. Are you afraid to die or can you look beyond death?

A. I'm not afraid of death although I don't relish the thought of dying. God is the same this side and beyond. I love the words in our communion service that Jesus ""opened wide his arms on the cross"" with ""love stronger than death"". I have a healthy fear of God. He's not to be messed with. But I trust him - God is love and Christ has conquered hell.

Q. Do you believe in a resurrection?

A. Yes. Tom Wright has helped me here. It's not so much about ""going to Heaven when we die"" but a radical new creation a marriage of Heaven and Earth. Jesus talks a lot in terms of a wedding banquet which sounds really joyous.

Q. What about people of other denominations and faiths?

A. God is nobody's uncle - He's our father and His children are my brothers and sisters whether Protestant Catholic or dissenter. In Northern Ireland we compare the best of our own ideals with the worst caricatures of others. That's only possible because we live so separately. As for other faiths St Francis set out 800 years ago to convert the Sultan of Egypt. The Sultan remained Muslim but the two men became examples of hospitality and friendship.

Q. Would you be comfortable in trying to learn from other people?

A. Jesus is the full revelation of God and I'm committed to Him. As regards other Christian traditions I'm a bit of a spiritual magpie. There's plenty I can learn from my Muslim and humanist neighbours. I try proactively to follow people with different views.

Q. Are the Churches here fulfilling their mission?

A. Yes and no. Many faithful servants care deeply for their people and serve their wider communities. But to be like the early Church we have to be communities of radical welcome where there's space for everyone: not just people ""like me"" but Irish speakers and Lambeg drummers Goths the homeless gay couples all sorts of people filling the same pews. Celebrations of divine love and inclusion like Jesus's infamous dinner parties.

Q. Why are so many turning their backs on organised religion?

A. Life is so busy God gets squeezed out. People might have experienced lukewarm Christianity growing up and been underwhelmed.

Q. Has religion helped or hindered Northern Ireland?

A. During the Troubles Belfast had the highest concentration of churches anywhere yet we were shooting one another. However there are shining examples like Gordon Wilson and the cross-community work of my erstwhile mentor Dean Kenny Hall in Enniskillen. God is more concerned about us forgiving reconciling and loving than which flag flies at City Hall.

Q. What is your favourite film book and music?

A. On TV The West Wing which reminds me that progress takes time and leadership means bringing people along with you. Music? Karl Jenkins' Benedictus. Book? Any Kazuo Ishiguru novel.

Q. Where do you feel closest to God?

A. Strangely hospitals feel like holy ground. When I walk onto the ward to visit the sick God is already there.

Q. What inscription would you like on your gravestone?

A. Safe in the arms of Jesus.

Q. Have you any major regrets?

A. Taking so long to heed the call to ordained ministry but God makes up for lost years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5vcnRoZXJuZWNoby5jby51ay9uZXdzLzE5MjQxNTUxLmVzbWUtY2hvcHMtMjItaW5jaGVzLWhhaXItb2ZmLXByaW5jZXNzLXRydXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Esme chops 22 inches of her hair off for Little Princess Trust,"Esme Kay who attends Hurworth School in Darlington decided to have her long hair cut off to raise funds for the Little Princess Trust and enable them to make a wig from it.

The real hair wigs are given to children with cancer or other conditions who have lost their hair whilst undergoing chemotherapy.

Esme said she was glad she has donated her hair.

She said: ""I just want to someone to be happy.""

Her mam Rowan said: ""If you don't have hair it makes you feel that you stand out and singles children out not that there's something wrong with you but it's nice to feel the same. She's always had long hair everyone calls her Rapunzel. She got to the age where she just wanted to give it someone who doesn't have any hair - alopecia or cancer so that they feel the same as everyone else she just wants someone to feel how she feels.""

To date Esme has raised £600 it costs £550 to make one wig for a child or young person.

Esme has always had long hair donating her hair will help restore a child's confidence and identity the trust said.

It was the first time except for the occasional trim that Esme has had a haircut.

Paul David hairdressers in Duke Street cut Esme's hair for her.

The Igbo apex socio-cultural group Ohanaeze Ndigbo has described northern Nigeria as one of the safest places for Igbos to live in and do their trades.

The chairman of the group in the 19 northern states Augustine Amaechi on Friday in Abuja stated that the region has accommodated Igbos beyond measures saying that accounted for their prosperity.

Amaechi while acknowledging that there have been some skirmishes with their host communities noted that it is unavoidable as “it is expected in a developing economy.”

On the call for secession in the South East he said the agitation was due to lack of jobs and employment in the region; stressing that since Igbos are traders they need the North to maintain their financial strength.

“Our elders are saying that even if the youth are agitating and angry we need a restructure of Nigeria and not a division of Nigeria because you can’t sell what you produce in your village to make big sales like in Alaba Market in Lagos.”

On his part the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo George Obiozor stated that Igbo nation is not at war with anybody.

“All we want is to be treated equally with other people. It is time for us to speak truth to power. We need peace and unity and they can’t be gotten through propaganda and transparency must be followed.”"
NOC,Northrop Grumman,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZWFydGhza3kub3JnL3NwYWNlL25vcnRocm9wLWdydW1tYW4tbWV2LW1ydi1zYXRlbGxpdGUtbGlmZS1leHRlbnNpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For the 2nd time Northrop Grumman catches a satellite in Earth orbit | Space,"Last week the American aerospace company Northrop Grumman and its subsidiary SpaceLogistics announced a successful test of a newly developed robotic satellite-servicing spacecraft called Mission Extension Vehicle 2 (MEV-2). The robot craft successfully docked with a commercial communications satellite Intelsat 10-02 on April 12 2021. The MEV is designed to attach itself to aging satellites and to help prolong their operations in space. Newly released images (above and below) are from the perspective of the MEV’s wide-field infrared camera on approach to the satellite shortly before docking. Joe Anderson the director of mission extension services at Northrop Grumman said in a webinar following the docking:

This is the first time humans have seen this satellite since it launched in June of 2004.

In a statement Northrop Grumman explained that – under the terms of Intelsat’s satellite life-extension servicing contract – the MEV-2 will provide five years of service to Intelsat 10-02 before undocking and moving on to provide services for a new mission.

MEV-2 launched in August 2020 on an Ariane 5 rocket and follows in the footsteps of its predecessor MEV-1 which had connected to a different Intelsat satellite in February 2020.

At that time with MEV-1 the team behind the spacecraft had the servicing spacecraft dock with Intelsat 901 in what Anderson described as “the geo-graveyard orbit.” That’s about 186 miles (300 km) above geosynchronous orbit which is 22236 miles (35786 km) above Earth’s equator. After docking MEV-1 and its captured satellite moved into a higher orbit. They did this “out of a self-imposed abundance of caution” Anderson said as this mission was the first of its kind for the company. Following the success of MEV-1’s mission Northrop and SpaceLogistics (a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman) were able to dock MEV-2 directly in geosynchronous orbit. Tom Wilson vice president of strategic space systems at Northrop and president of SpaceLogistics said:

With the docking of MEV-1 last February we made history; we created an entirely new market in orbit. We are now the only provider of life extension services for satellites operating not just one but two mission extension vehicles … with these capabilities we can enable entirely new classes of missions.

Northrop Grumman’s MEVs are the company’s first line of robotic satellite-servicing spacecraft but more are planned. At the end of the current five-year contract related to Intelsat 10-02 the MEV will be available to move to another satellite and dock. Both MEV-1 and MEV-2 are capable of working with multiple satellites in their lifetimes: repairing changing assembling and inspecting them in orbit.

In 2024 Northrop Grumman intends to take its satellite life-extension capabilities a step further by launching Mission Extension Pods which the company is currently developing. Unlike the MEVs these Pods are expected to be installed on both commercial and government satellites using Northrop’s Mission Robotic Vehicle (MRV).

These upgrades and new technologies come from a robotic servicing mission award granted last year to Grumman by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Going forward Northrop Grumman projects that starting in 2025 they will begin refueling satellites in orbit and removing nearby debris from considerably high-value satellites. They’ll remove this debris or space junk from orbit also using the MRV’s robotic arms. Anderson told Space.com during the webinar:

Right now we’re focusing on exploring how we can use the capabilities that the mission robotic vehicle will provide with its robotic arm capabilities perhaps some new tools that we might incorporate onto the end of that robotic arm to be able to rendezvous with and then capture a body that needs removal from GEO [geosynchronous] orbit.

And then starting in 2030 the company has shared plans to begin assembling and manufacturing technology in orbit too. They hope that this will allow them to overcome Anderson said:

… the burdens on spacecraft design that rocket launches impose resulting in new and exciting possibilities in space. If you design a satellite that was manufactured in orbit … we estimate that maybe 80% of the mass of a satellite being launched is there to support the launch loads so that’s a significant component to how spacecraft are designed today… So if we can design satellites that are manufactured assembled in orbit can completely change the economics of those assets.

Following the success of these life-extending space robots Wilson added the ultimate stage of assembling and manufacturing in space will be

… where the real change comes.

Bottom line: The American aerospace company Northrop Grumman and its subsidiary SpaceLogistics are testing a new line of satellite-serving spacecraft designed to prolong satellites’ lives. So far two Mission Extension Vehicles (MEV-1 and MEV-2) have docked successfully with satellites most recently on April 12 2021.

“Stargazer” is an L-1011 commercial transport aircraft formerly with Air Canada modified to serve as the launch platform for Orbital’s air-launched Pegasus rocket as well as a platform for airborne research projects. The foundation for Orbital Sciences Corporation was laid in 1980. This L-1011 aircraft was purchased in 1992 modified to carry the Pegasus rocket and began work in the commercial space industry in June 1994.

Lockheed Aircraft Company manufactured 250 L-1011 Tri-Stars in Palmdale Calif. from 1968 to 1984.

The ‘Stargazer’ L-1011 has been used to launch numerous Pegasus rockets as well as the captive carry flights of the X-34 reusable launch vehicle demonstrator. As of October 2019 44 rockets (containing 95 satellites) have been launched from it using the Pegasus-H and Pegasus-XL configurations.







Launching Satellites into Low Earth Orbit

The three-stage Pegasus is used to deploy small satellites weighing up to 1000 pounds into low-Earth orbit. Pegasus is carried aloft by the ‘Stargazer’ L-1011 aircraft to approximately 40000 feet over open ocean where it is released and free-falls five seconds before igniting its first stage rocket motor. With its unique delta-shaped wing Pegasus typically delivers satellites into low-Earth orbit in a little over 10 minutes.

This patented air-launch system provides customers with unparalleled flexibility to operate from virtually anywhere on Earth with minimal ground support requirements. Pegasus launches have been conducted from six separate sites in the U.S. Europe and the Marshall Islands the first time a space launch vehicle has demonstrated such operational flexibility.







Scaled Composites Manufactures Pegasus Control Surfaces in Mojave

Wings and control surfaces for the Pegasus air-launch system are manufactured at Scaled Composites in Mojave Calif. Pegasus has been providing launch services for technology demonstrations scientific investigation and communications missions since 1990 with numerous missions launched from the L-1011 “Stargazer” carrier aircraft that is based at Mojave Air and Space Port.





Orbital Sciences Move to Mojave

‘Stargazer’ was previously based at Meadows Field in Bakersfield but was plagued with winter fog conditions. I remember inviting Marty Mosier and Mark Gamache (Orbital employees at the time) to speak at Bakersfield Council Navy League in 1998 and during that time I invited them to bring their L-1011 to Mojave Airport. I described our clear blue skies long beautiful runways and friendly management. Next thing I knew they were on the phone to Airport General Manager Dan Sabovich. One thing led to another and now they call Mojave Airport home.







Double Keel Structure

The Lockheed L-1011 has an unusual double keel structure that the vertical fin of the Pegasus XL fits between. The fin goes in the space formerly occupied by the lower deck galley. The rest of the vehicle is carried entirely below the fuselage of the ‘Stargazer.’

There is an interesting story relayed by L-1011 crew on how this aircraft received the name ‘Stargazer.’ It is a tribute to the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation fictional starship the USS Stargazer.





Cygnus Spacecraft

The Antares rocket with the Cygnus spacecraft was launched from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia by ‘Stargazer.’ This was part of NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program to deliver cargo to the International Space Station. Orbital performed eight cargo missions to the ISS. The maiden flight of Cygnus spacecraft was completed Sept. 2013. The cargo included student experiments food and clothing.

Cygnus approaches the International Space Station and is grappled by the crew using the station’s robotic arm. It is then installed on the bottom side of the station’s Harmony node. After delivering cargo to the station Cygnus destructively reenters Earth’s atmosphere.







Orbital Sciences merges with Alliant Techsystems (ATK)

In 2015 ‘Stargazer’ was re-painted to reflect Orbital Sciences’ merger with Alliant Techsystems (ATK). The Orbital ATK mission is cost effective insertion of small satellites into low Earth orbit.





CYGNSS (Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System)

The constellation of eight Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) spacecraft that was launched by the Pegasus rocket on Dec. 15 2016 to measure the winds inside hurricanes giving scientists insight into their formation intensification and life cycle.







L-1011 ‘Stargazer’ presentation at Plane Crazy

At a Plane Crazy Saturday event in January 2017 Ed Dunlap manager L-1011 Ground and Flight Operations described some issues that delayed the first intended launch. Ever the optimist he said that he believed there was a reason that all didn’t go as planned and actually saved the entire mission.

While he and his crew were battling some mechanical problems with the aircraft NASA decided to recheck the payload of satellites and found some complications that they were able to remedy. Had that glitch not been found the satellites would not have launched correctly and the whole mission would have been a failure.

Solid-fueled rocket motors for the Pegasus mission arrived at Orbital ATK’s Vandenberg processing facility. Don Walter Orbital ATK’s Chief Pilot for the company’s Pegasus Air Launch Program Ed Dunlap and crew then flew the ‘Stargazer’ from Mojave to Vandenberg to mate the Pegasus underneath the aircraft. They then flew to Cape Canaveral for a launch over the Atlantic Ocean.

So many details so many years of engineering and design and everything had to work perfectly and it did.







Northrop Grumman acquires Orbital ATK

According to Wikipedia ‘Stargazer’ appeared in Northrop Grumman livery in 2018 following their acquisition of Orbital ATK. ’Stargazer’ launched the Ionospheric Connection Explorer on Oct. 11 2019. The launch was originally scheduled for June 2017 but was scrubbed when an anomalous piece of vehicle data was observed during a ferry flight. The data was related to the rudder position of the Pegasus XL rocket and was observed during a routine in-flight vehicle checklist. The launch was delayed multiple times throughout 2017 2018 and 2019 finally occurring Oct. 11 2019.

‘Stargazer’ is off on another mission and departed Mojave Air and Space Port last week. Ed Dunlap reported in an email to me “How long we keep Stargazer flying depends on potential launch contracts and component support. We are estimating through 2023.”

‘Stargazer’ is the last flying L-1011 in the world.

“The unarmed RQ-4B Global Hawk will provide Japan with on-demand intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance information supporting the Japan Air Self-Defense Force’s missions of protecting borders monitoring threats and providing humanitarian assistance in times of need” said Jane Bishop vice president and general manager autonomous systems Northrop Grumman. “This successful first flight is a significant milestone in delivering Global Hawk to our Japanese allies.”

Global Hawk is the only high-altitude long-endurance unmanned air vehicle (UAV) to deliver near real-time on demand data around the clock. Once fielded Global Hawk will integrate with other Japanese intelligence assets including ground-based command and control units. The capability will provide solutions to monitor and deter regional threats to ensure Japan has a highly effective national security posture well into the future.

Northrop Grumman’s family of autonomous HALE systems including Global Hawk are a critical component of networked global ISR collection for allied nations and mutual defense organizations around the world. Global Hawk collects ISR data that enables decision-makers to act with the right information at the right time. When Japan’s Global Hawk fleet is fully operational it will be part of a growing list of allied nations operating high-altitude long-endurance UAVs. The United States Australia NATO and Korea will all be operating versions of this vital national surveillance asset.

Northrop Grumman solves the toughest problems in space aeronautics defense and cyberspace to meet the ever-evolving needs of our customers worldwide. Our 97000 employees define possible every day using science technology and engineering to create and deliver advanced systems products and services.

The RQ-4A/B Global Hawk Unmanned Aircraft System (RQ-4A/B Global Hawk) is a high altitude long-endurance Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) with an integrated sensor suite and ground segment that provides Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities to joint warfighters. The drone is in service with South Korea Japan NATO and United States.

Currently the RQ-4A/B Global Hawk is available in Block 20 30 and 40 aircraft which are larger than Block 10 aircraft and capable of carrying up to a 3000-pound (lb) payload. All Block 10 aircraft have either been retired or transferred to the Navy or National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Block 20 was designed to be Image Intelligence only and carries an Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS) that is designed for increased performance range and location accuracy over the Block 10 payload.

The operational Block 20 aircraft have been converted to the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) configuration which provides airborne communications relay and gateway that allows real-time information exchanges between different tactical data link systems and provides decision-makers with critical information.

Block 30 carries the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload that brings Signals Intelligence capability with the EISS. Block 40 incorporates the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program Radar as its only sensor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvZmlyZWJpcmQtc2Vuc29yLWRyb25lLWZsaWVzLTkwMDAtbWlsZXMtYWNyb3NzLXVzLXdpdGgtcGlsb3RzLW9uLWJvYXJkLTE1OTUyMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Firebird Sensor Drone Flies 9000 Miles Across U.S. With Pilots On Board,"Generally speaking the word drone kind of leaves humans out of the equation. Sure pilots are most of the time needed to get these things to where they’re needed but drones usually do not allow them to climb on board. Except for the Northrop Grumman Firebird.

Officially described as a multi-sensor aircraft the machine can fly both while controlled from the ground or with pilots manning its actual controls. Thanks to a clever design the front end of the drone can be swapped to accommodate either the hardware needed for ground control or a cockpit for pilots.The switch between the two can be performed according to the company behind this winged machine in under two hours.In an attempt to prove the thing’s prowess Northrop Grumman just ended last month an aerial tour of the United States with a crewed Firebird. The plane traveled for about 9000 miles (14480 km) zigzagging across the nation’s states and performing a number of stops until it came to a halt in Key West Florida.Once there the Firebird was used to perform a number of operations that involved the use of high-definition EO/IR sensors multi-spectral sensors and an AIS receiver.“Our flights showcased one of its key differentiators – the ability to position the system in a manned configuration then convert to autonomous operations for persistent ISR in under two hours” said in a statement Jane Bishop vice president and general manager autonomous systems Northrop Grumman.“At each stop plane-side briefings provided customers the opportunity to see first-hand the operational versatility of the platform its large sensor bay and rapid configurability for changing mission needs.”The Firebird first flew about a decade ago. It’s main role is to conduct Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions and it can do so for 30 hours at a time and from an altitude of 25000 feet (7.6 km).According to its maker the type of sensors required for its missions can be swapped in just 30 minutes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXZpYXRpb25pc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMTcvZmlyc3QtZmxpZ2h0LW9mLWphcGFucy1ycS00Yi1nbG9iYWwtaGF3ay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First Flight of Japan's RQ-4B Global Hawk,"The first Northrop Grumman RQ-4B Global Hawk drone for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force has carried out its maiden flight.

On Apr. 15 2021 the first RQ-4B Global Hawk UAV (Unmanned Air Vehicle) destined to the JASDF (Japan Air Self-Defense Force) successfully completed its first flight from Northrop Grumman plant at Palmdale California.

“The unarmed RQ-4B Global Hawk will provide Japan with on-demand intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance information supporting the Japan Air Self-Defense Force’s missions of protecting borders monitoring threats and providing humanitarian assistance in times of need” said Jane Bishop vice president and general manager autonomous systems Northrop Grumman in a public release. “This successful first flight is a significant milestone in delivering Global Hawk to our Japanese allies.”

Japan’s decision to procure dates back to November 2014 when the Japanese MOD officially selected the RQ-4 over the General Atomics Guardian-ER. The U.S. Department of State approved the potential sale of three RQ-4 Block 30 (I) Global Hawk and associated equipment including three Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suites and 16 navigation systems worth up to 1.2B USD. The contract worth 489.9M USD was eventually awarded to NG by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Ohio in 2018 and will deliver three RQ-4 Global Hawks two ground control stations spare parts and related services by September 2022.

“Once fielded Global Hawk will integrate with other Japanese intelligence assets including ground-based command and control units. The capability will provide solutions to monitor and deter regional threats to ensure Japan has a highly effective national security posture well into the future” Northrop Grumman says.

The RQ-4 Global Hawk is a HALE (high-altitude long-endurance) RPA (remotely piloted aircraft) with an integrated sensor suite that provides global all-weather day or night intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capability.

The Global Hawk provides persistent near-real-time coverage using imagery intelligence (IMINT) signals intelligence (SIGINT) and moving target indicator (MTI) sensors. RQ-4s carry out ISR (Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance) missions in various hotspots across the world. As we write this article a U.S. Air Force Global Hawk from NAS Sigonella Italy can be tracked online as it performs yet another RQ-4 sortie near Crimea over Ukraine and the Donbass area.

“Block 30 [the one destined to Japan] is a multi-intelligence platform that simultaneously carries electro-optical infrared synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and high and low band SIGINT sensors” says the USAF website. “Block 30 Initial Operating Capability (IOC) was declared in August 2011. Eighteen Block 30s are currently fielded supporting every geographic combatant command as well as combat missions in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom/ New Dawn. Block 30s also supported Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya and humanitarian relief efforts during Operation Tomodachi in Japan. Block 40 carries the Radar Technology Insertion Program (RTIP) active electronically scanned array radar which provides MTI and SAR data.”"

When this happens our response is usually to make a strong cup of coffee or grab an energy drink. Often doing so can lead to a ‘crash’ when the effect wears off or you find yourself sat up half the night unable to sleep due to the caffeine.

Last month I was given the opportunity to sample a variety of flavours of Beyond NRG – a new sugar-free energy drink aimed at gamers. The pack I received for this review contained a Vortex Shaker a 20 sachet box of mixed flavours plus one of their limited edition Mortal Kombat – Fatality tubs. The 400g tub I received was the Blue Raspberry Lemonade flavour which contains 40 servings.

Making a drink is as simple as filling a shaker with around 400ml of water adding a sachet or scoop of power and then shaking for around 15 seconds. If you’re lucky enough to have a Vortex Shaker then you add the water press a button to activate the shaker and tip your powder in. The Vortex Shaker is completely unnecessary but it’s a fantastic gimmick and great for showing off to friends and family.

Flavours & Taste

I’ve had the opportunity to try all the flavours these are:

Blue Raspberry Lemonade

Honeydew Melon Grape & Raspberry

Mango Pineapple & Blood Orange

Strawberry Watermelon & Lime

Wild Forest Fruits

Of these five flavours I must admit I’ve had a hard time choosing my favourite as they are all delicious and very refreshing. After much thought I think the Blue Raspberry Lemonade is the one I’ve enjoyed drinking the most. The nice thing is that you can purchase sachets individually or create your own mixed box before committing to a large batch of one flavour.

While Beyond NRG is effectively a drink they prefer to refer to it as an energy supplement created for gaming and esports. Much of this is thanks to their nootropic stack which is focused on improving blood flow enhancing cognitive function reducing stress and relieving anxiety.

The ingredients in Beyond NRG fit into three categories – Energy Vitamins & Minerals and Nootropics. I’ve detailed these below with the descriptions taken from the Beyond NRG website.

Verdict

Beyond NRG is packed with ingredients designed to help gamers focus on the task at hand. It’s easy to mix a drink and tastes great but does it actually help? From my experience over the past month I’d say that you definitely feel the effects of Beyond NRG within minutes. I’ve noticed that each time I’ve had a sachet that I feel more alert and focused. The effects seem to last for a couple of hours plenty long enough for a gaming session. Best of all I haven’t noticed an instant crash when it wears off which I’m guessing is thanks to the coffeine and lack of sugar.

Beyond NRG isn’t going to make you better at the games you play but it doesn’t make that claim. What it does give you is a refreshing drink and the energy and focus needed to put in the hours of practice to get better. If you currently reach for the coffee or energy drinks when gaming then you might want to give Beyond NRG a try. I know when my samples run out I’ll be looking into buying myself some more.

Beyond NRG is available online and comes in tubs or sachets – starting at £1.50 for a single sachet £23.99 for a Build-Your-Own Box (20 x sachets) or £34.99 for a 40 serving tub.

This interview below was delivered to the inbox of Leadership Brief subscribers on Sunday morning April 18 to receive weekly emails of conversations with the world’s top CEOs and business decisionmakers click here.)

It’s not altogether surprising that a company earning billions of dollars a year making the chips that power today’s hyperrealistic video games has a business plan inspired by a science-fiction novel. Jensen Huang the CEO of Nvidia the nation’s most valuable semiconductor company with a stock price of $645 a share and a market cap of $400 billion is out to create the metaverse what Huang describes “a virtual world that is a digital twin of ours.” Huang credits author Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash filled with collectives of shared 3-D spaces and virtually enhanced physical spaces that are extensions of the Internet for conjuring the metaverse. This is already playing out with the massively popular online games like Fortnite and Minecraft where users create richly imagined virtual worlds. Now the concept is being put to work by Nvidia and others. Partnering with Nvidia BMW is using a virtual digital twin of a factory in Regensburg Germany to virtually plan new workflows before deploying the changes in real time in their physical factory. The metaverse says Huang “is where we will create the future” and transform how the world’s biggest industries operate.

From their roots in the gaming industry Nvidia chips are now an important component of many of the world’s most powerful computers powering AI drug discovery and the coming generation of autonomous vehicles.

Huang joined TIME for a video conversation this week to talk about the chip shortage the future of the car industry and his belief in the goodness of human nature.

(This interview with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been condensed and edited for clarity. Note: Some of Huang’s comments below are from a keynote speech he gave earlier this week and the press conference that followed.)

You describe the latest iteration of AI as “the modern Big Bang.” Can you share your view of the transforming potential of AI?

AI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans’ fundamental technology is intelligence. We’re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that’s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself and it writes software that no humans can. It’s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light and because of computers we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We’re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture to food production to health care to manufacturing to logistics to customer care to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We’re in this new world where over the next 10 years we’re going to see the automation of automation.

Not to make any value judgments about the importance of video games but do you find it ironic that a company that has its roots in entertainment is now providing vitally important computing power for drug discovery basic research and reinventing manufacturing?

No not at all. It’s actually the opposite. We always started as a computing company. It just turned out that our first killer app was video games. At the time video games was a zero billion-dollar market and we postulated that this new industry called video games with 3-D graphics that are really rich and beautiful was going to be one of the largest technology industries in the world. The condition is extremely rare that a market is simultaneously large and technologically demanding. It is usually the case that the markets that require really powerful computers are very small in size whether it’s climate simulation or molecular-dynamics drug discovery. The markets are so small it can’t afford very large investments. That’s why you don’t see a company that was founded to do climate research. Video games were one of the best strategic decisions we ever made.

AI is a watershed moment for the world.

What’s your philosophy regarding entering new markets?

Our primary preference is that we don’t build something. If somebody else is building it we’re delighted to use it. That allows us to spare our critical resources in the company and focus on advancing the industry in a way that is rather unique and advance the industry in a way that nobody else does.

Why are recommendation algorithms so hard and so important?

Recommender systems are the most important AI system of our time the most important machine-learning pipeline in the world today. It is the engine for search ads online shopping music books movies user-generated content news. They are processing hundreds of petabytes of data and moving toward terabytes. One of the most important things that intelligent people do is make recommendations. Recommender systems predict your needs and preferences from past interactions with you your explicit preferences and learned preferences using methods called collaborative and content filtering. Trillions of items to be recommended to billions of people.

How has the chip shortage affected the car industry?

One of the dynamics that COVID exposed is a weakness in the supply chain of the automotive industry which has too many components built into cars. When it shut down abruptly because of COVID the recovery process—the restart process—was far more complicated than anybody imagined. It is very clear that the car has to be rearchitected and instead of thousands of components it really wants to be a few centralized components because you could keep your eyes on four things a lot better than you can keep an eye on 1000 things or 10000 things coming from different places.

We're going to see the automation of automation.

Beyond the chip shortage you work closely with major car companies: How will AI impact the automotive industry?

The car industry could start thinking about their cars not as vehicles that they sell but as part of their fleet and their installed base. They could provide software services over the course of the 15 20 years that these cars are on the road. So the business model is transformed.

How important is the advent and the adaptation of digital twins for manufacturing business and society at large?

In the future the digital world or the virtual world will be thousands of times bigger than the physical world. There will be a new New York City. There’ll be a new Shanghai. Every single factory and every single building will have a digital twin that will simulate and track the physical version of it. Always. By doing so engineers and software programmers could simulate new software that will ultimately run in the physical version of the car the physical version of the robot the physical version of the airport the physical version of the building. All of the software that’s going to be running in these physical things will be simulated in the digital twin first and then it will be downloaded into the physical version. And as a result the product keeps getting better at an exponential rate.

The second thing is you’re going to be able to go in and out of the two worlds through wormholes. We’ll go into the virtual world using virtual reality and the objects in the virtual world in the digital world will come into the physical world using augmented reality. So what’s going to happen is pieces of the digital world will be temporarily or even semipermanently augmenting our physical world. It’s ultimately about the fusion of the virtual world and the physical world.

Do you worry about bad actors getting their hands on all this powerful technology and using it to sow chaos perpetrate evil and disrupt this utopian vision of the future?

The best way is to democratize the technology in order to enable all society which is vastly good—and to put great technology in their hands so that they could use the same technology—and ideally superior technology—to stay safe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA4MC10aS1pcy1yZWFsLWFuZC1pdHMtYWxyZWFkeS1zaGlwcGluZy10by10aGUtdXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is real — and it's already shipping to the US,"The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti doesn’t officially exist yet but it looks like that’s going to change very soon indeed if a photo snapped by Facebook user Lok LOK is legitimate.

The picture embedded below shows a palette of MSI GPUs being shipped to Los Angeles and one of the boxes has a particularly enticing label: “GEFORCE RTX 3080 TI VENTUS 3X 12GB OC.”

(Image credit: Lok LOK/Facebook)

Other pictures show a stash of GeForce RTX 3090 stock in the shipment as well as Radeon RX 580 Armor 8G OC and GT 710 2GD3 LP GPUs. The latter two are considerably less powerful than the super-popular RTX 30 GPUs but with all graphics cards in short supply and going for such inflated prices any kind of extra inventory is welcome.

If the image is all that it seems and not some kind of elaborate prank then it all but confirms the recent reports that Nvidia has reduced the power of the RTX 3080 Ti. The card was originally said to have 20GB RAM but both the EEC filing for Gigabyte’s version of the card and now this MSI shipment clearly say it’ll have ‘just’ the 12GB.

To be clear that won’t make the card a slouch in any sense. The latest rumors point to a card with 10240 CUDA cores 80 RT cores and 320 Tensor cores. The 12GB memory even if it is less than originally hoped for will likely be GDDR6X clocked at 19 Gbps. In short it should offer pretty incredible performance somewhere between the $499 base RTX 3080 and $1499 RTX 3090. Rumor has it that the RTX 3080 Ti will launch at around $999 in order to compete with AMD’s Radeon 6900XT.

Of course the above RRPs are all somewhat wishful thinking at this point. Demand is such that cards are selling out almost as soon as they are available and the second-hand market is awash with GPUs selling for vastly inflated prices. Even last-generation RTX 20 cards are going for alarmingly high prices in part due to their appeal to cryptocurrency miners.

While Nvidia has admitted that supply problems are likely to continue for the foreseeable future it’s rumored that the company will at least be taking steps to make the RTX 3080 Ti less appealing to cryptominers by introducing a hash rate limiter as found on the recent RTX 3060. Assuming it can’t be sidestepped — and the 3060’s could — that will be a welcome move for those looking to use their graphics cards for their intended gaming purpose.

While not officially announced previous rumors have pointed to a May launch for the RTX 3080 Ti. If the cards are part of a shipment already bound for LA that prediction just became a lot more likely.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwODAtdGktbGF1bmNoLTk5OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Allegedly Launches At $999 If You Can Find One,"Several of NVIDIA's hardware partners have seemingly tipped the pending launch of a new Ampere SKU for gaming the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. Perhaps the strongest bit of evidence is a recently leaked photo of a pallet of supposed MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Ventus 3X OC graphics cards being prepped for shipment from China to the United States. Following up on that leak it's said the new SKU will launch at $999 (MSRP).

Obviously there's little-to-no chance you will actually be able to buy one at MSRP if and when the new part launches at least not right away—the GeForce RTX 30 series is always out of stock . Save for a few lucky folk who beat the bots and miners to the punch the ongoing shortage of silicon including GPUs is very likely to render this a paper launch. Be that as it may cards do still carry MSRPs and here's how the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti allegedly fits within the pricing hierarchy of modern generation GPUs...

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090: $1499

$1499 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: $999 (Leaked MSRP)



AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT: $999

$999 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080: $699

$699 AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT: $649

$649 AMD Radeon RX 6800: $579

$579 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070: $499

$499 AMD Radeon RX 6700: $479

$479 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti: $399

$399 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060: $329

It is a smart launch assuming NVIDIA positions the card as rumored pricing it equivalently to AMD's Radeon RX 6900 XT . It will presumably offer better performance for the same money in both rasterized rendering and real-time ray-traced visuals. At the same time NVIDIA risks cutting into sales of the GeForce RTX 3090 though there are two reasons why the company might not be worried about that happening.





For one NVIDIA is selling every GPU it can source. That will probably be the case throughout 2021 and manufacturing partner TSMC even suggested the silicon shortage in general (not just of GPUs) could last throughout next year and even into part of 2023 as well.







Source: Lok LOK (via Facebook)







Secondly it appears NVIDIA revised the originally intended specifications for the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti which in turn will create a bigger gap in performance between it and the GeForce RTX 3090. We mentioned this as a possibility when writing about the leaked photo of MSI-brand cards bound for the US and according to HKEPC which is hearing the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will cost $999  that's precisely what happened.







According to the Chinese-language news site the original plan was for the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti to essentially be a slightly cut down version of the GeForce RTX 3090  with the same number of CUDA cores (10496) almost the same amount of GDDR6X memory (20GB versus 24GB) and the same memory bus (384-bit).





However it's said NVIDIA is not really feeling the competitive pressure from the Radeon RX 6900 XT AMD's flagship GPU so it downgraded the specifications to 10240 CUDA cores and 12GB of GDDR6X memory.





Is that really the case? Only NVIDIA truly knows but we can say that earlier GeForce RTX 3080 Ti leaks and rumors did have it pegged as having 10496 CUDA cores and 20GB of memory whereas more recent ones reflect the seemingly downgraded specifications. As always we'll have to wait and see what emerges.

Resizable BAR became part of the GPU performance conversation with the release of AMD's Radeon RX 6000 series. AMD was touting a new feature called Smart Access Memory or SAM but in reality AMD had just rebranded a PCI Express feature known as ""Resizable BAR"" that had gone unused for quite some time.

The way AMD promoted and implemented Resizable BAR on Radeon 6000 GPUs it required to be paired with a Ryzen 5000 series CPU and newer 500 series motherboard. AMD made it sound as if this was a new optimization they had developed and would be exclusive to their products but that's not the case. The claim was your AMD CPU/GPU combo could produce a performance uplift of 10% or greater in a number of games with SAM enabled creating some buzz but it was short lived after all.

Of course it's free performance and not something we often come by when testing new features. Enabling SAM boosts performance of the Radeon RX 6800 in Assassin's Creed Valhalla by 19% 18% in Hitman 2 14% in Borderlands 3 and 13% in Godfall those are some seriously impressive gains and you're sacrificing nothing to achieve them.

However a deeper dive into SAM revealed a number of instances where performance was reduced or in most other cases it made no difference at all. In the end when testing across a large sample of games we found that on average SAM brought a small 3% boost at 1440p.

The net gain is still welcome and it's possible resizable BAR could play a more consistent role in the future if developers design games with that capability in mind. Thus Nvidia has jump aboard the resizable BAR train and now GeForce RTX 30 GPUs support it.

There are 3 things you'll need to enable resizable BAR on your RTX 30 series GPU:

1) A supporting VBIOS is required. Anyone who purchased an RTX 3060 already has the required VBIOS but RTX 3060 Ti 3070 3080 and 3090 owners will need to update.

For this article we updated the VBIOS of the ROG Strix RTX 3080 OC and the process was simple. We navigated to Asus' support website went to Driver & Tools > BIOS & Firmware and downloaded the latest BIOS. We ran the tool and it took just a few moments to complete. After a reboot the VBIOS update was done.

2) You'll require a compatible motherboard that supports resizable BAR including its BIOS version. In our case the MSI X570 Unify running with a Ryzen 9 5950X was already updated as we used it to test the Radeon RX 6800 before.

3) The latest GeForce Game Ready driver. Support for resizable BAR was added with the March 30 release but at this point just use the most up to date driver and you'll be set.

Once those steps are complete you can verify if resizable BAR is working by opening the Nvidia control panel and entering the system information section. Under the details section you'll find ""resizable BAR"" and if it's working properly the status will simply read 'yes'.

Now something we found interesting about Nvidia's implementation is a claim they made in their announcement...

""In practice the performance benefits of Resizable BAR can vary substantially from game to game. In our testing we've found some titles benefit from a few percent up to 12%. However there are also titles that see a decrease in performance so Nvidia will be pre-testing titles and using game profiles to enable Resizable BAR only when it has a positive performance impact. That way you won't have to worry about bugs or performance decreases and won't have to rely on the community to benchmark each title and discover whether Resizable BAR is beneficial in the games you're playing.""

That sounds pretty great. Basically Nvidia's saying you can enjoy all the benefits of resizable BAR without any of the shortcomings. We saw performance regression of up to 7% in certain titles with the Radeon RX 6800. If true this will be a win for Nvidia and their resizable BAR implementation will be much better than AMD's.

As of writing the whitelist of supported games from Nvidia is fairly limited consisting of just 17 games. Now of those 17 games we've tested 12 along with 8 others that aren't currently officially supported so that could be quite interesting. So it's time we jump into the benchmark results. We're testing using the Ryzen 9 5950X on the MSI X570 Unify motherboard with 32GB of DDR4-3200 CL14 dual-rank dual-channel memory.

Benchmarks

Starting with Assassin's Creed Valhalla we find that at 1080p performance is boosted by 8% and 9% at 1440p some nice gains there. Not nearly as big as the gains we've seen from the Radeon GPUs in this title but still an extra ~8-9% is nothing to sneeze at. Unfortunately though where we need a performance boost the most at 4K we're looking at basically the same performance. Still overall a good result in this title.

Frame rates in Forza Horizon 4 are already excessively high with the RTX 3080 but assuming these margins roughly translate down the product stack then that's a good result.

At 1080p we're looking at an 11% performance boost 9% at 1440p and 6% at 4K which was nice to see.

We're looking at a mild performance uplift in Horizon Zero Dawn with resizable BAR enabled just 3% at 1080p 5% at 1440p and 4% at 4K. Not exactly something to get excited about but again it's a small performance boost for free so who's going to complain about that?

The gains in Borderlands 3 are also small: a 5% boost at 1080p 4% at 1440p and just 3% at 4K.

We see a reasonably strong 7% boost in Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p but then nothing at 1440p and 4K.

There were a number of titles like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order where performance went virtually unchanged. If we're to believe Nvidia's claims we could be looking at a situation where resizable BAR has been disabled to avoid a performance regression as this isn't a whitelisted game but more on that soon.

Wolfenstein Youngblood also isn't a whitelisted game and here we're seeing no change in performance with virtually identical frame rates with and without resizable BAR.

Shadow of the Tomb Raider is another game that didn't make the Nvidia whitelist and again we're seeing no change in performance with resizable BAR enabled though we're not sure that Nvidia's had a chance to test every single game just yet.

Far Cry New Dawn also isn't a whitelisted game but here we are seeing a performance regression with resizable BAR enabled at 1080p and 1440p so what's going on here?

Shouldn't resizable BAR be disabled in this instance? The performance regression isn't big but the 4% drop in frame rate at 1080p and 1440p was highly repeatable so clearly the feature isn't being disabled here. But let's move on to an even more troublesome set of results...

Watch Dogs Legion is a whitelisted game that's meant to benefit from resizable BAR and therefore see a performance improvement with it enabled. However the opposite is true with a rather substantial 10% performance reduction seen at 1080p and a 3% reduction at 1440p or a massive 16% reduction when looking at the 1% low result.

We could reproduce these results consistently and each time we saw a steep decline in 1% low performance with resizable BAR enabled in Watch Dogs Legion.

We're not alone in these findings either other tech media have also found the same poor performance with resizable BAR enabled on Nvidia GPUs and we've seen similar reports from users on forums and reddit.

This is quite odd given Nvidia claims a 9% performance uplift in Watch Dogs Legion using an RTX 3080 at 1440p with the Ryzen 9 5950X on an X570 motherboard with 32GB of RAM. It's possible there have been changes made since then that negatively impact performance it's hard to say as their results were published about 2 weeks ago.

The odd results didn't stop there. Death Stranding also saw a reduction in performance at 1080p and 1440p with resizable BAR enabled despite being a whitelisted title. We did see up to a 9% increase at 4K which was great to see but the implementation here is hardly flawless with up to a 9% reduction seen at 1080p and 8% at 1440p.

Performance Summary

Here's a look at the average performance seen across the 20 games tested. We'll also jump to a per game breakdown in a moment but I wanted to show this graph first as this is typical of how we evaluate the performance and value of GPUs.

We're looking at no improvement for the RTX 3080 at 1080p a 1% gain at 1440p if we round up and 2% gain at 4K. This compares less favorably than the 3% gain for the Radeon GPUs on average. So when taking gaming performance as a whole into consideration resizable BAR support does virtually nothing to change the picture.

Looking at the margins seen in each of the 20 games tested at 1080p and as you can see there are performance regressions. Nvidia claims that they use game profiles to enable Resizable BAR only when it has a positive performance impact but based on our findings that's not true. The Division 2 for example isn't a whitelisted game and therefore the game profile should automatically disable resizable BAR resulting in no performance change but we found the same issue with multiple titles.

Even at 1440p we're still seeing a number of instances where performance regresses beyond the margin of error and these findings were highly repeatable.

Without the performance drop the technology would only boost performance by 2% but again without the disadvantages there'd be no reason not to enable it by default.

Resizable BAR is a little more effective at 4K. The 1-2% drops seen in Far Cry New Dawn and Dirt 5 are insignificant while a few others stand to benefit if only slightly.

You might find this last graph interesting. In the games that we can make a direct comparison with our Radeon RX 6800 testing which is 18 of the 20 games just tested this is how the GeForce RTX 3080 and RX 6800 compare.

Where Nvidia saw a ~1% improvement on average AMD saw a 7% improvement with resizable BAR enabled in titles such as Assassin's Creed Valhalla Hitman 2 Borderlands 3 Godfall and a few others. Based on these results we AMD appears to have better implemented their resizable BAR support.

What We Learned

It's great to see Nvidia adding support for resizable BAR on their latest generation GeForce 30 series GPUs it's just a bit of a shame that it didn't work as well as we'd hoped. Likewise this would be an amazing feature for AMD to implement across more/all products if they can and it'd mean we'd be one step closer to testing with resizable BAR enabled by default.

It's worth noting that in order to enable/disable resizable BAR with a Radeon or GeForce graphics card you need to reboot the system enter the BIOS and toggle it on or off there. So that's not exactly a practical solution and we'd argue doing so means the performance gains are no longer free they come at the expense of your time and energy.

It was also interesting to see that at best the RTX 3080 saw up to a 9% performance improvement at 1440p in AC Valhalla and Forza Horizon 4 whereas the RX 6800 saw up to a 19% performance gain in Assassin's Creed Valhalla though we didn't test Forza Horizon 4 as it hadn't yet left the horrible Windows Store for Steam.

As it stands today resizable BAR appears to be more beneficial to the Radeon users who happen to have the full Ryzen 5000 combo though be aware it's not always going to result in positive performance. For GeForce owners it's only worth going to the trouble of enabling resizable bar for 2 or 3 games so it'll be up to you whether or not you bother but at least the option now exists and it could improve over time.

At the time almost a year ago ReSTIR (Reservoir-based Spatio-Temporal Importance Resampling) wasn't quite ready for game development purposes as its rendering cost was around 50ms for 3.4 million dynamic lights. That's way too much to be of any use for game developers as programmers need to find their entire rendering budget into 16.6 ms if they target 60 frames per second.

Fast forward to this week however and everything has changed with NVIDIA unveiling its game developer-ready RTX Direct Illumination technology at GTC 2021. In the RTXDI SDK ray tracing is combined with a dramatically more performant version of the ReSTIR algorithm paired with another deep learning algorithm ReGIR (Reservoir-based Grid Importance Resampling) which works as an initial sample generator for ReSTIR and can be applied to secondary surfaces whereas ReSTIR is reserved to primary surfaces.

RTX Direct Illumination promises to forego the so-called 'hero lights' phenomenon in games where only a few select light sources were actually casting shadows. This will enable much more realistic scenes. But what about performance? Well according to RTX UE4 Game Engine Evangelist Richard Cowgill with RTXDI it shouldn't really matter if you need dozens hundreds thousands or millions of lights; the cost is expected to be about the same. As a result the performance should essentially flatten and be more consistent particularly with NVIDIA DLSS enabled.

What's perhaps even more exciting is that RTX Direct Illumination provides tangible benefits to both artists and gamers. The former will have RTXDI telling the game's graphics renderer where to send rays with no need for manual input. The latter will finally get to interact with all of the lights in a scene since they are dynamic which may potentially improve gameplay as players cleverly find advantages by turning off or shooting any of the lights to cover a stealth approach for example.

As expected NVIDIA made it so RTX Direct Illumination is easily integrated with the existing RTX Global Illumination (RTXGI) SDK. Mixing the two should allow for scalable global illumination based on many many light sources.

The best part though is that all of this promising graphics technology won't be reserved just for GeForce RTX users. In fact Richard Cowgill confirmed that RTXDI and RTXGI are both entirely architecture-agnostic and will therefore work not only on AMD's Radeon RX 6000 Series GPUs but on ray-tracing capable consoles as well such as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X. Graphics APIs supported include DirectX Raytracing and Vulkan Ray Tracing.

Game developers interested in implementing RTX Direct Illumination will need a denoiser of course. While NVIDIA recommends their Real-Time Denoiser which comes with the ReLAX algorithm specifically designed for denoising raytraced specular and diffuse signals generated by RTX Direct Illumination devs are free to use another denoiser of their choice.

RTXDI has been made available as part of the NvRTX branch of Unreal Engine 4.26.1. There's no ETA yet for integration in the mainline Unreal Engine 4 branch.

During GTC 2021 NVIDIA also released an 'RTX Technology Showcase' tool to easily demonstrate the capabilities of RTX Direct Illumination RTX Global Illumination Deep Learning Super-Sampling and NVIDIA Real-Time Denoiser in an Unreal Engine environment.

The facility was forced to shut down in February due to a statewide blackout that resulted from severe winter weather.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFmaW5hbmNpYWwuY29tL2luZGlhcy1iaWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1iYWl0LXRvLWdsb2JhbC1jaGlwLW1ha2Vycy13aG8tbWlnaHQtdGFrZS1hLXBhc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India's billion-dollar bait to global chip makers who might take a pass,"(ATF) Stung by an acute shortage of semiconductors worldwide in the face of incessant demand for consumer electronics India is angling toward self-sufficiency by enticing the who’s who of global high-tech to set up chip factories. Yet a lot of those hall-of-famers might end up staying offshore.

The country has targeted a wish list of companies from Europe Japan South Korea and Taiwan. It includes Taiwanese majors Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company VIA Technologies and United Microelectronics Corporation. US giants Intel Micron Technology NXP Semiconductors and Texas Instruments are on the list along with European chipmaker Infineon and Fuji Electric and Panasonic of Japan.

India’s recruitment comes after governments across the world have started subsidising construction of semiconductor plants a way to ease chip shortages that are hobbling the automotive and electronics industries and highlighting the world’s dependence on Taiwan for supplies.

India wants to establish reliable suppliers for its own formidable electronics and telecom industry so it cuts dependence on China which today supplies 65% of the country’s $50 billion annual semiconductor consumption.

The proposal is simple on paper: make in India and get $1 billion in cash incentives.

The Indian government is also ready to offer manufacturers assurances by buying the chips and mandating that certain industries buy made-in-India chips from Indian plants. India-based chip makers would be tagged as “trusted sources”.

Not convinced

But even if the offer looks compelling global chips makers are reluctant.

In Taiwan at least seven local semiconductor companies have met the island’s deputy economic affairs minister Shen Jong-chin twice to understand how they might invest in India but they reached no conclusion.

“In terms of the fab location selection there are many factors to consider in order to fulfil our customer’s needs” a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) spokesperson told Asia Times Financial. “TSMC does not rule out any possibility but there is no concrete plan to set up fabs in India at this time.” TSMC is the world’s largest contract chipmaker.

Fellow Taiwanese chipmaker United Microelectronics Corp said the company is “open to evaluating all regions for projects provided that the opportunity fits with the company’s ROI objectives.”

But company spokesman Richard Yu added that the company “generally prefers regions closer to Taiwan to ease logistics and management while still providing manufacturing risk mitigation through geographic diversity.” The company better known as UMC has factories now in Taiwan China Japan and Singapore.

Inadequate facilities

India is not always an easy place for setting up a chip fabrication plant.

Experts say semiconductor manufacturing (fab) is a complex techno-commercial operation that requires large investments business and operational ability. They say it requires grasping all the right ingredients such as the market private investment infrastructure and technology itself.

Putting all that together is a tall order.

“India lacks infrastructure that foreign factories expect and has an incomplete semiconductor supply chain – meaning higher shipping costs” Taiwan-based boutique market analysis firm Isaiah Research told ATF.

The biggest hurdles are the country’s constantly changing rules and policies as well as infrastructural bottlenecks some analysts believe.

“Fluctuation in India’s laws make business people unsure” Cheng Kai-an an industry analyst with Taipei-based Market Intelligence & Consulting Institute told ATF adding that Taiwanese chipmakers have particularly found India’s electricity and water supplies unstable.

Crush to get chips

Yet the country needs chipset manufacturers – and lots of them. The global semiconductor shortage and geopolitical tensions with China are not only beginning to hurt the country’s manufacturing but those factors also heighten India’s need for attaining self-sufficiency in the semiconductor supply chain.

India’s semiconductor consumption which was already facing a demand-supply crisis following delays from China after the Indo-China border clash last year is now facing massive supply chain issues according to a recent report by professional services firm EY.

The global semiconductor industry relies on a few global players for high-end chips – which led to the shortage following pandemic-era demand for devices to support telework and home study. Automotive chip orders have added to that demand. China and Taiwan own a significant portion of the semiconductor manufacturing market in the world the EY report says.

Consequently “fabs assume significance in view of the fact that India is poised to increase its share in global manufacturing of mobile phones IT hardware automotive electronics industrial electronics medical electronics IoT and other devices in the near future as it aspires to have $400 billion of electronics manufacturing by the year 2025” the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said when inviting investors from the target list.

For foreign chipmakers India offers a suite of incentives called the Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors to run over eight years. India should attract investors with its “cost-effective” skilled labour “fast improving” infrastructure and a domestic electronic components market that’s on track to reach $200bn by 2025 about 10 times the amount of 2019 the Indian National Investment Promotion & Facilitation Agency says.

India’s bid could be a big attention-grabber for private and foreign fab investors say experts.

“The biggest strength India has today is the market for electronics products and domestic manufacturing” Satya Gupta the chairman of India Electronics and Semiconductor Association a trade group with more than 300 members told ATF.

Domestic manufacturing of electronics products has potential to grow $400 billon — of which $250 billion would be consumed locally and $150 billion exported Gupta says. That growth “creates a good demand for semiconductors products and makes the business case of Fabs stronger” the chairman added.

India’s intent and efforts work in its favour too others say.

While India has already announced various incentive schemes at the national level many state governments are ready and eager to provide incentives and infrastructure for electronics and semiconductor manufacturing.

“Today India is the second largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world. Few years ago no one would have imagined that. The same way semiconductor manufacturing can happen in India” Venkata Simhadri the CEO of MosChip an Indian fabless semiconductor company told ATF.

“But it needs lot more support and commitment from the government and the industry.”",,,,,,,,,

Morton led all but one of the 25 laps to capture the USRA B-Mod feature on a chilly Saturday night in the headliner of Lucas Oil Speedway's program.

Others Summit USRA Weekly Racing Series winners on the $uper $aver $pecial Night presented by Ozarks FOX were David Hendrix (Medieval USRA Stock Cars) and Tyler Davis (USRA Modifieds).

A total of 174 cars checked into the pits including a whopping 75 B-Mods on the cool-but-dry evening for Big Adventure Weekly Racing Series program No. 2 of 2021.

Morton of Springfield earned the win in the featured division and took home $750 courtesy of Clearlight Inn. He beat Dillon McCowan by two car lengths for his first feature win of the season—and nearly had two trips to victory lane after an impressive second-place run in his debut driving a ULMA Late Model.

""It's the first time I've ever been in one. I think with a little more experience I'd have won two tonight"" Morton said of the near-sweep.

Morton set the pace through four laps of the B-Mod feature before he and McCowan swapped the top spot on laps five and six before the race's first caution came out.

Seventh-starting Andy Bryant moved into third by lap 10 when the third caution waved. Meanwhile five-time track champion Kris Jackson who started 19th after having to run a B-Feature was up to seventh.

McCowan worked his way alongside Morton on the lap following the restart but Morton was able to re-establish command. As the race remained green the final 15 laps Morton went on to prevail by 1.02 seconds over the 17-year-old from Urbana.

""Dillon kept showing me his nose there low and I kept blowing him off running the middle and the top"" Morton said. ""Finally he got to where he was there there. That last yellow it was time to move down there.

""I appreciate him running me clean and not driving through me. I've got to thank Scott Allen. This car I can drive it on the bottom in the middle or the top and it's good.""

Andy Bryant finished third followed by Jon Sheets and Jackson to round out the top five.

Hendrix scores first USRA Stock Car win: David Hendrix of Waynesville took over the lead with seven laps remaining and went on to earn his first O'Reilly Auto Parts USRA Stock Car feature win.

Hendrix who started sixth moved into contention by lap nine and pulled alongside race-long leader Derek Brown several times using the outside groove over the next few laps - in between caution flags.

Finally on lap 13 Hendrix sailed past Brown coming out of turn four. Before the next circuit could be completed third-running Gary Donaldson was collected in a turn-two incident as he battled with Brown for position.

Hendrix a former track champion in the Street Stock division drove away to win by 2.6 seconds over Doug Keller with Robert White third and Brown fourth. Keller and White got by Brown—the feature winner in week one—with two to go.

""That's some fun racing"" Hendrix said. ""Me and the 11 car (Brown) were side by side for several laps and seriously I was just grinning the whole time. I was like man this is awesome I'm having a blast.""



David Hendrix won the Medieval USRA Stock Car main event.

USRA Modified thriller goes to Davis: Tyler Davis of Haysville Kansas nipped El Centro California's Lance Mari in a thrilling finish to take the Cedar Creek Beef Jerky USRA Modified feature win.

Mari charged into contention for the win late after Dillon McCowan who had pressured the leader most of the way fell out of contention.

""I knew the slider was coming on the last lap so I just loaded up on entry"" Davis said.

Davis who started second led all 20 laps but fourth-starting McCowan moved into the runner-up position by lap two.

McCowan used the outside line to pull alongside Davis to challenge for the lead on lap 10 but couldn't quite complete the pass. As those two weaved through lapped traffic and broke away from the field McCowan continued to give chase until a lap-16 caution.

Over the next lap after the restart McCowan pulled off with mechanical issues. Davis then had to hold off Lance Mari's charge over the final lap and did so by a half-car-length after Mari's slider in turn four coming to the checkers.

Matt Johnson wound up third with T.J. Tolan coming from 13th to fourth and Darron Fuqua fifth.



Tyler Davis won the USRA Modified main event.

But it won’t be the last one.

The committee recommended approving a construction contract for $9.97 million to Stuckey Construction of Waukegan Ill. If the City Council gives the deal its approval the new facility should be completed in about a year.

The original project estimated cost was $9.5 million. Six total bids for the project were received. The actual construction amount is $9269900 plus a contingency fund of $705100.

Replacing the current No. 4 facility at 4810 60th St. which was built in 1964 is a necessity said District 5 Alderman Rocco LaMacchia Sr. chair of the committee.

“(The project) is moving ahead” he said. “That fire station was built in the 60s. We’ve been putting money into it every year and basically putting good money into something that’s not worth keeping.

“The plumbing is terrible. The electrical is terrible. The plaster is coming off the walls. The windows are super cold. They frost up in the wintertime.” The firefighters who work out of that station deserve better LaMacchia said.

“It’s something that’s needed” he said. “These guys and girls need to be in something that’s stable. ... They have to have something that’s like living in your home. It’s something that’s needed. We hate to spend the money but it’s one of those things you have to do.”

Interim Fire Chief Christopher Bigley said several of the current building’s vital systems — specifically electrical HVAC and plumbing — are in need of significant repair.

In addition the floor plan needs an update to accommodate both male and female personnel who now fill the department’s roster he said.

“As the plan developed for the first phase and bids for work came in we quickly realized that the cost to repair was beginning to rival the cost of building new” Bigley said. “Furthermore even after a remodel there would still be 50-year-old building components buried in concrete.

“The decision was made to look into building a new station. We are building the new station next door because the current location meets the department’s needs now and will continue to do so in the future.”

Administrative offices controversy

What has been at issue is the need to now tear down the current administration offices that were moved to the Station No. 4 site six years ago.

The administration building which cost about $720000 to build will be torn down and construction for the new facility will follow LaMacchia said.

LaMacchia acknowledged that the situation is far from a perfect one.

“Two fire stations in a year and a half is pretty costly but it’s something that’s needed” he said noting Station No. 1 at 52nd Street and 22nd Avenue opened in August 2019.

Bigley said administrative personnel will temporarily move to the Station No. 3 Fire House at 2121 Roosevelt Road.

Eventual long-term plans for fire administration offices are to move them to the new City Hall which is a proposed three-story municipal office building and plaza where the former police station building is located at 812 56th St.

The new municipal building is part of the city’s $400 million Downtown Vision revitalization plan approved by the City Council last December.

New station features

The concept plans for the new fire station which received unanimous Public Works Committee support in February would nearly double the size of the current building to 29344-square-feet for daily operations.

Included in the plan is a 10000-square-foot tower for training operations.

“My vision for a new Station 4 would be a well-placed and designed building that would provide an optimum location for the fire department service delivery” Bigley said. “In addition to housing our equipment and personnel it will continue to serve as a training center with an included training facility and a maintenance shop.

“Proper planning includes predicting future growth and the station is being built with an additional apparatus bay and enough living space to accommodate four additional firefighters. This plan for expansion will become more and more important as the city continues to grow within its present footprint and as it pushes its boundaries further west.”

LaMacchia said there will not be any interruption in fire services that originate from the No. 4 firehouse.

“We’ll still be coming out of that fire station for services so as one is going up the other one is still going to be there” he said.

Around the world scientists and advocates call for keeping carbon in the ground as a means of staving off climate change. But in the Southwestern United States – mainly in Colorado and New Mexico – a mainstay of obtaining more oil is facilitated by doing the exact opposite: drilling pure reserves of carbon dioxide out of the ground.

After it’s extracted from these natural-source underground fields the gas then gets piped to the Permian Basin the nation’s top-producing oil fields of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. There oil companies use the CO2 to flood their wells forcing the last dregs of crude to the surface in a process also known as enhanced oil recovery or EOR.

Carbon flooding is often described as a way of helping recover available oil providing power while the energy sector transitions away from fossil fuels altogether. Sometimes oil companies mention it alongside questionable carbon capture technology suggesting that pulling CO2 from the atmosphere and pumping it underground into oil wells for permanent storage – and to loosen up remaining crude for extraction – would facilitate “carbon neutral” oil production.

However that picture of carbon flooding is a futuristic fallacy. The first barrel of so-called carbon neutral oil was produced only earlier this year by Occidental Petroleum. And it relied on carbon offsets rather than direct capture of CO2 and injection into wells.

The reality is that this little-known process uses mostly CO2 extracted from natural sources where it would’ve otherwise remained safely underground – not risking emission into the atmosphere nor furthering the use of planet-warming fossil fuels.

While the industry remains out of view of even many dedicated observers and watchdogs it has existed for four decades and its scale is massive.

Occidental Petroleum – a Houston-based corporation that recently rebranded itself as a “carbon management” enterprise despite being one of the top greenhouse gas emitter in history – says that it injects 2.6 billion cubic feet of CO2 per day into its Permian fields. The company is the largest leaseholder and one of the top producers in the Permian in both New Mexico and Texas. It drilled 13% of the basin’s production in 2015 and has said it foresees billions more in oil production from future CO2 floods.

Kinder Morgan another major player in this sector claims it transports 1.3 billion cubic feet of CO2 every day aiding the extraction of 50000 barrels of crude daily.

Carbon flooding and drilling have occurred in the U.S. for decades and they’re likely to grow in prominence. On this front oil companies have support from both major parties as well as President Joe Biden.

And tucked into the nearly 5600-page coronavirus relief bill passed late last year are more tax credits for CCUS (carbon capture utilisation and storage) – a suite of processes that includes carbon flooding as the most-prominent “utilisation” piece. In addition the legislation fast-tracks permitting of CO~2~ pipelines and other CCUS infrastructure. Since then congressional lawmakers in the current session have introduced more legislation along similar lines including the recently introduced SCALE Act.

However carbon flooding isn’t the innocuous technology that energy companies and politicians hope it to be. An exploration of the industry reveals it poses significant environmental harms existential climate threats and health risks.

In addition carbon drilling companies have a pattern of creating local economies that depend on their existence while simultaneously trying to undercut tax and royalty payments to town governments and residents.

How it works

Though the Permian is widely known for companies’ usage of hydraulic fracturing or fracking for oil it’s also where companies use carbon dioxide extracted from underground fields known as domes in Colorado and New Mexico to flood oil wells forcing 8%-20% of additional original oil in place to the surface.

An oil industry consultant and former engineer who also has done carbon flooding work for a company in the Permian told Capital & Main that drilling for CO2 is in many ways similar to drilling for oil and natural gas.

“It’s really the same tools the same equipment the same calculation going on. It’s just using different types of numbers” he explained. “But you find a CO2 source field which obviously can be several thousand feet underground and you move a drilling rig in and you drill for it.”

Nearly 80% of all oil extracted via carbon flooding in the United States is done with gas obtained from the domes in New Mexico and Colorado according to a 2015 US Department of Energy report. While the amount varies from year to year 2.9% of daily domestic oil production came from carbon flooding in 2018 according to a report from Denbury Resources a player in the industry.

Carbon flooding could help oil companies recover up to 284 additional billion barrels of oil a 2020 presentation given by industry consultancy Advanced Resources International concluded.

Today carbon flooding is touted as a potential climate solution due to the fact that a portion of the carbon dioxide used during the enhanced oil recovery process gets sent back underground keeping it out of the atmosphere where it would contribute to global warming. However the oil companies have viewed the drilling process as a way to extend the duration of their wells. As Kinder Morgan put it in a 2003 ad “Thanks to something invisible the Permian’s future is solid” adding that “CO2 flooding breathes new life” into oil fields.

However carbon flooding furthers the climate crisis by facilitating both more fossil fuel use and leakage of natural-source CO2 into the atmosphere.

“At best you’re just not changing the status quo” said Jeremy Nichols climate and energy program director for WildEarth Guardians. “Inevitably the CO2 will enter the atmosphere. … It will be released.”

A long list of safety and environmental threats

From day one carbon extraction has proven an environmental risk and sometimes a deadly one.

One of the byproducts of drilling for and then flooding wells with carbon dioxide is the potential release of a toxic corrosive gas called hydrogen sulphide or H2S. It and other gases can surface during the venting of carbon wells. And in some cases the chemical compound has proven deadly.

One such incident occurred in the central hub for carbon flooding Denver City Texas – once dubbed the “Carbon Dioxide Capital of the World“. After gas escaped from an injection well in 1975 nine people died from H2S exposure most of them residents living nearby. In total 17 people died from exposure in that area within a four month period.

An Environmental Protection Agency report points to 10 other H2S leaks from oil and gas extraction between 1974 and 1993. None of the incidents killed humans but they did kill jackrabbits and blackbirds a coyote groups of moose and cows a horse and other animals.

Some people living near carbon extraction sites cite H2S as a threat to their communities.

In southwestern Colorado’s Montezuma County – home to one of the world’s largest natural CO2 sources the McElmo Dome – these wells are rampant. Kinder Morgan the main stakeholder in McElmo Dome must keep an H2S contingency plan on public file with the county.

“Where they’re drilling and the H2S might be there you need to have a [respirator] mask” said Jimbo Buickerood of the San Juan Citizens Alliance an advocacy group that has worked on CO2 drilling issues in Montezuma County and elsewhere. “It’ll just kill you.”

On top of noise complaints and other disruptions related to the drilling citizens have reported smelling mystery gases coming from the wells from which CO2 is extracted.

Tom Hayden filed a complaint with Colorado’s oil and gas commission in 2019 after he said Kinder Morgan had been venting a CO2 well about 1000 feet from his home. He had the company check an air-quality monitor for anything dangerous but the alarm wasn’t functioning according to the complaint.

Knowing the potential danger Hayden wrote that Kinder Morgan seemed “lawless” and that he didn’t feel safe in his home fearing he “could be killed at any time.” Hayden’s complaint led to the state suspending Kinder Morgan’s well later that year.

CO2 leakage too has proven a persistent issue around extraction sites. Many are relatively low stakes such as the 2017 leak of 1 million cubic feet of CO2 at an Oxy USA facility in New Mexico’s Bravo Dome – another major drilling site.

Others are more devastating. Also in 2017 a CO2 pipeline in West Texas’s Scurry County blew and hurt at least eight people. One man was hit by shrapnel in his leg and back Snyder News reported. And in 1982 Colorado’s Sheep Mountain Unit CO2 extraction site was the source of one of the largest CO2 leakages and the largest recorded industrial release in human history.

Carbon flooding has likely caused small earthquakes in Texas one study found after researchers correlated shakes with the underground injection of CO2 for oil recovery over a five-year period.

Another carbon flooding byproduct – dirty “produced water” – is another potential source of leaks that can contaminate the soil and groundwater. Environmental advocacy group Clean Water Action calls carbon flooding “one of the most water intensive forms of oil production” one that demands freshwater drawn from the drought stricken Permian regions of Texas and New Mexico.

Climate peril and carbon flooding’s politics

Carbon flooding is often billed as a solution to climate change. The pitch from its proponents is that carbon can be captured at an emissions source like a power plant and piped safely away to an oil field. There it can help recover available oil and provide power while the energy sector transitions away from fossil fuels altogether.

But while some of the gas used in carbon flooding comes from capturing CO2 at emissions sources such capture technology remains unproven and too costly for widespread use – leaving much of the oil recovery to CO2 drilled from places where it otherwise would’ve stayed underground.

The carbon flooding process ends with between 3.7 and 4.7 metric tonnes of CO2 emitted for every metric ton of CO2 injected into the earth according to a 2009 study . Less than 0.2 metric tonnes of CO2 gets sequestered underground for each barrel of oil produced.

A 2020 study further concluded that the CO2 capture and storage process leaks between 0.43 and 0.94 kilograms of carbon for each kilogram of CO2 that gets stored. Carbon flooding using natural CO2 sources like the McElmo or Bravo domes the study concludes “cannot contribute to reductions in anthropogenic CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.”

Despite these studies the EPA statutorily mandates that CO2 drilling sites self-report their emissions data to the EPA only if the site emits over 25000 metric tons of CO2 per year. Asked if the agency had ever brought an enforcement action against any CO2 dome operators an EPA spokeswoman instead pointed a Capital & Main researcher toward a factsheet that didn’t answer the question.

(Update: On April 10 the EPA responded by stating “EPA has not brought any enforcement actions against any companies in there [sic] carbon drilling space.”)

Despite their flaws and little regulation carbon flooding and CCUS have powerful political allies.

President Biden has long favoured CCUS. His climate platform says he “will double down on research investments and tax incentives for technology that captures carbon and then permanently sequesters or utilises that captured carbon.”

His energy secretary Jennifer Granholm has also endorsed CCUS. “If confirmed I fully plan to commit resources to carbon management across the fuel and technology spectrum” Granholm wrote to senators after her January 27 confirmation hearing. “I am particularly excited by the opportunities for game-changing advances in carbon capture.”

An unreliable ally for local communities

Money is the driver for both carbon companies and the localities that allow such work on their land. But in many instances energy companies do just about everything in their power to keep their money out of locals’ pockets.

Extracted CO2 helps energy companies get more oil to sell and creating a market for carbon dioxide allows them to profit from a greenhouse gas.

Drilling operations primarily sit in rural areas that depend on their existence. New Mexico’s Harding County one of three counties housing the Bravo Dome gets 70%-80% of its tax revenue from carbon drilling operations. Neighbouring Union County takes more than 20% of its tax base from them.

In addition governments and individual landowners are often due royalties from the entities working their land. But to get the money they’re owed they often wind up in court fighting the energy companies. The state of New Mexico once sued Occidental companies for underpaid CO~2~ royalties. They settled in 2006 for $11.6 million.

The Department of the Interior is involved in an ongoing lawsuit against Oxy USA over royalties with a U.S. District Court ruling in December 2020 that the company owes the agency $1.82 million in royalty payments. Occidental has appealed the ruling.

Dolores County Colorado home of the Doe Canyon CO2 source field operated by Kinder Morgan raises an estimated 64% of its tax revenue from carbon extraction. Colorado’s Montezuma County depends on carbon drilling for more than half of its tax base. They’ve had to file suit to get their dues too winning a case against Kinder Morgan for more than $2 million in underpaid taxes.

“That gives money to our fire departments our cemeteries our roads – the whole county is based on the taxes” said Leslie Bugg the county assessor. Without the taxes she said “We wouldn’t even be able to have employees anymore in the offices.”

While lucrative for the county’s tax base there’s a glaring issue in Montezuma County: The carbon dioxide will likely run out in the coming decades. A 2011 Energy Department paper predicted that the current commercially produced CO2 sources at the current production rate could run dry by about 2050.

Just like an oil town before its crude dries up the county must prepare for a major economic blow. County Commissioner Jim Candelaria said he hopes the logging industry there can have a resurgence but building it up will take a while.

“I hope we have some time before that (carbon) runs out” he said “but it will run out.”

After implementing one of the world’s longest pandemic lockdowns during 2020 which took the economy to the brink of collapse a recent sharp spike in COVID-19 cases has forced the reintroduction of lockdown measures across the Andean country’s major cities. It is the popular tourist city of Medellin and Colombia’s all-important principal port Barranquilla which are the worst affected with strict curfews and restrictions on movement now established. Those measures will impact many sectors of the economy including the vital petroleum industry and weigh heavily on Colombia’s desperately required recovery. During 2020 the oil price crash and COVID-19 pandemic sharply impacted the Andean country’s energy sector causing the gross domestic product to contract by almost (Spanish) 7% Colombia’s worst economic decline on record. The strife-torn country’s dependence on crude oil becomes apparent when even in a year where prices plunged into negative territory and Brent averaged $41.96 per barrel it still accounted for 17% of fiscal revenue 28% of export earnings and 3% of GDP. Before the late-2014 oil price collapse the economic importance of crude oil was even greater. It generated over a fifth of government revenue more than 60% of Colombia’s exports by value and almost 5% of GDP. While a strong economic rebound for Colombia is projected for 2021 led by a recovering petroleum industry with the IMF and central bank both forecasting GDP growth of over 5% there are significant headwinds ahead.

The most pressing risk is the sharp uptick in COVID-19 cases and renewed lockdowns in Colombia’s major cities which will weigh heavily on an already fragile economy. These will cause GDP growth business activity and tax revenue to decline placing greater pressure on a fiscally embattled national government. Bogota’s precarious finances are highlighted by Colombia’s finance ministry in March 2021 raising the fiscal deficit to a startling 8.6% of GDP its highest level ever and greater than the 7.8% deficit reported for 2020 when GDP contracted by nearly 7%. A cash-strapped Bogota urgently needs to reactivate the energy sector by attracting additional investment if the economy is to recover.

While the Duque administration and Colombia’s peak industry body the Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP – Spanish initials) expressed considerable optimism regarding the petroleum industry’s outlook the numbers present a different picture. In January 2021 the ACP projected an annual exploration and production investment of $3.1 billion to $3.45 billion. While at the bottom end that represents a 51% increase over 2020 it is still at least $580 million shy of the $4.03 billion invested during 2019. Weaker than required hydrocarbon production highlights that the oil industry has yet to return to pre-pandemic operations. For February 2021 Colombia pumped 745769 barrels per day a worrying 15% decrease compared to the equivalent period for 2020 and similarly reported production volumes since the pandemic hit the Andean country. More worrying is that activity in Colombia’s oil patch as shown by the Baker Hughes rig count is not rising at the rate required. By the end of March 2021 there were only 14 drill rigs operating in Colombia compared to almost double that number 25 drill rigs for the same period a year earlier.

Those numbers indicate that despite the Duque Administration implementing strategies aimed at boosting oil company investment including tax relief through refunding or removing value-added tax spending is falling short of the required levels. Rising fiscal pressures combined with the declining economic activity caused by the latest round of lockdowns will force Bogota to ease spending and potentially even the tax breaks and other incentives extended to the petroleum industry. Recently proposed tax reform where the Duque administration is seeking to raise taxation revenue equivalent to 1.5% of GDP not only illustrates Bogota’s desperation but that many of the corporate tax benefits introduced since 2018 could be reduced or even removed. If that occurs it will deter further investment from foreign oil companies in what is already a volatile and highly uncertain operating environment.

Another emerging headwind is the growing skepticism over claims of a new commodity supercycle. Rising COVID-19 cases and renewed lockdowns around the world along with sluggish vaccine rollouts are weighing on the global economic outlook impacting metals and crude oil. According to Bloomberg investors are dumping commodities notably metals and the contagion has spread to crude oil making proclamations from a month ago that Brent is headed to $80 or even $100 a barrel appearing doubtful. Oil prices will be volatile over the remainder of 2021 especially now that OPEC Plus countries have flagged the gradual unwinding of production cuts including Saudi Arabia’s one million barrels per day which triggered the January 2021 oil price rally. That will weigh on crude oil prices particularly if major no-OPEC producers such as the U.S. and Brazil continue to bolster petroleum production. Weaker Brent pricing poses a considerable risk for Colombia because of its high onshore breakeven prices which are estimated to be up to $45 per barrel after tax. Most of the petroleum produced in Colombia is comprised of sour medium to heavy grade crude oils which are becoming increasingly less popular since the introduction of IMO2020 and the ongoing global push to substantially reduce the sulfur content of fuels. There are less hazardous jurisdictions with significantly lower breakeven prices in South America which produce lighter sweeter grades of crude oil making them superior destinations for foreign energy companies. Heightened insecurity in major cities and particularly the rural regions where much of Colombia’s oilfields are located poses a significant risk for foreign oil producers. The Andean country has been wracked by civil conflict for most of the last 70 years and there has been a sharp uptick in violence over the last two years under the Duque administration. Since 1 January 2021 there have been 28 massacres (Spanish) more than double the number for the same period in 2020 with 102 victims. The murder of social leaders environmental activists and labor leaders is a growing dilemma with 46 assassinations (Spanish) during that period. Those numbers alone indicate that the Duque administration is incapable despite prolific promises to provide sufficient policing and security throughout much of Colombia. Illegal armed groups are taking advantage of Bogota’s weakness which is being amplified by renewed pandemic lockdowns to expand control of vital terrain for coca cropping cocaine trafficking and illegal gold mining.

It is only a matter of time before rising violence and growing insecurity impact the energy sector. Toward the end of 2020 the ACP issued a communique condemning multiple violent oilfield invasions in eastern Colombia by indigenous communities. Those are evidence not only of domestic security breaking down but of the oil industry’s deteriorating social license in Colombia. Energy infrastructure notably oil pipelines and wellheads remain popular targets for the various non-state armed groups operating in the country. In 33 years of operation the 2220000 barrels per day Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline alone has suffered nearly (Spanish) 1500 attacks the latest being roughly a month ago. Pipelines are the only cost-effective means of transporting crude oil across Colombia’s rugged terrain to crucial ports that provide access to international energy markets. When bombed operations are shuttered forcing oil companies to use more costly road transport as well as store the crude oil produced on-site. Once storage facilities are at capacity producers are required to cease operations until the pipelines return to service. This risk was a key reason for Occidental Petroleum’s decision to sell its mature onshore Colombian oil assets last year to Carlyle Group for $825 million.

A range of local and global headwinds are buffeting Colombia’s economically crucial oil industry. Their impact is being magnified by the Andean country’s rapidly rising COVID-19 case count and renewed pandemic lockdowns in major cities as well as growing insecurity. It is becoming increasingly clear that the Duque administration despite guarantees is incapable of guaranteeing the security of many communities or industries outside of the major cities. The rising violence notably in rural regions will impact oil industry operations further magnifying the fallout from the pandemic. For these reasons it will be some time before Colombia’s oil industry returns to a pre-pandemic tempo of operations significantly endangering Bogota’s plans to re-open Colombia’s economy bolster its deteriorating finances and return the country to growth.

Despite their winning streak the group seemed genuinely surprised when they took the stage telling the limited in-person audience that especially after such an unusual year they had no idea who was going to win the category.

Backstage in the virtual press room the band elaborated on how surprised they were by their win.

""Obviously this year has been so weird. It kinda was up in the air for us"" Old Dominion explained. ""You feel so disconnected from the normal ways you measure your success by being on the road so it's kind of hard to gauge where we even are.

""We were nervous to be honest"" the band admits of their headspace headed into the show.

But there was one person who didn't have any nerves about whether or not Old Dominion would win the trophy and that was the bandmates' friend and fellow nominee Jaren Johnson of the Cadillac Three.

""We were sitting there and Jaren from the Cadillac Three was like 'Oh you got this! You're my favorite band! You guys are the best band in country music!'"" Old Dominion recount cracking up. ""We're like 'I don't know man it could go either way.'

""It's like we're their idols or something!"" Old D joke. ""They definitely thought we were gonna win. I don't know who we thought were gonna win.""

Old Dominion were the first winners announced live on Sunday night. Jimmie Allen Gabby Barrett Kane Brown Carly Pearce and Lee Brice were all announced as early winners before the ceremony.

A crushing computer chip shortage continues to choke the global supply chain.

Automakers are producing vehicles without smart technology — which requires chips — Apple's MacBook and iPad production was reportedly delayed and PlayStation 5s are being produced in limited amounts due to the squeeze.

It's an effect caused over time by pandemic-driven shutdowns and soaring demand for products that need chips.

But one question that has emerged during the crisis is where chips are produced — and why the US doesn't manufacture much of the global supply.

Here's why it doesn't.

Chips are difficult to produce and it's cheaper for US companies to outsource

In 1990 the US produced 37% of the world's chip supply according to a September 2020 report from the Semiconductor Industry Association. But now the country is responsible for just 12% of global chip production.

Seventy-five percent of the world's chip manufacturing comes out of Asia per the report and China is positioned to become the largest chip producer by 2030.

Why the decline in the US? It became cheaper to build chip facilities in countries outside of the US. Those foreign governments offer more attractive financial incentives to construct semiconductor factories like tax breaks and grants. There's also less regulation in places like Asia. On top of that there aren't as many jobs in the US created to run such high-tech factories.

There was a recent attempt to do so under the Trump administration — Apple supplier Foxconn was slated to build a Wisconsin facility that would produce large-screen TV displays and said it would create 13000 jobs but the whole project never panned out.

Some of the country's largest chip manufacturers are also some of the biggest in the world. Intel still produces much of its chip supply at home as the Wall Street Journal reported. But other major US chip producers outsource manufacturing to companies in Asia due to costs. One of those foreign contract companies is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company which produces more than half of the world's computer chips and is also Apple's primary supplier.

Making computer chips is a complex process. It's also difficult and expensive to build new facilities to manufacture the vital silicon component which means companies have to rely on existing plants. A new semiconductor factory can cost up to $20 billion as ON Semiconductor CEO Keith Jackson wrote in Fortune and that price tag is much higher in the US.

There are economic and national security benefits to ramping up US chip production

There could be risks in depending on foreign chipmakers if the US continues to fall behind China in the chip race as the Journal notes.

President Joe Biden is aware of the issue and the threats posed by relying too heavily on foreign manufacturing. As part of Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure plan there's a $50 billion allotment for domestic chip manufacturing incentives.

In a Monday meeting Biden said the key to navigating the current chip shortage crisis is to invest in the country's chip production.

""We need to build the infrastructure of today and not repair the one of yesterday"" Biden said according to NBC News. ""The plan I propose will protect our supply chain and revitalize American manufacturing.""

But as Recode notes it won't be a simple task to transition reliance to homegrown chip production. There will be a handful of factors to consider over time like weaning off of foreign contract manufacturers and ensuring there are enough US workers to power new facilities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvdGhlLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3Itc2hvcnRhZ2UtaXMtaGVyZS10by1zdGF5LWJ1dC1pdC13aWxsLWFmZmVjdC1jaGlwLWNvbXBhbmllcy1kaWZmZXJlbnRseS0xMTYxODY3ODA1NtIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L3RoZS1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXNob3J0YWdlLWlzLWhlcmUtdG8tc3RheS1idXQtaXQtd2lsbC1hZmZlY3QtY2hpcC1jb21wYW5pZXMtZGlmZmVyZW50bHktMTE2MTg2NzgwNTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The semiconductor shortage is here to stay but it will affect chip companies differently,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-semiconductor-shortage-is-here-to-stay-but-it-will-affect-chip-companies-differently-11618678056 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvdGhlLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3Itc2hvcnRhZ2UtaXMtaGVyZS10by1zdGF5LWJ1dC1pdC13aWxsLWFmZmVjdC1jaGlwLWNvbXBhbmllcy1kaWZmZXJlbnRseS0xMTYxODY3ODA1NtIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L3RoZS1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXNob3J0YWdlLWlzLWhlcmUtdG8tc3RheS1idXQtaXQtd2lsbC1hZmZlY3QtY2hpcC1jb21wYW5pZXMtZGlmZmVyZW50bHktMTE2MTg2NzgwNTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYXNwP25ld3NJZHg9MzA3MzUx0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly9tLmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3IvcGFnZXMvYXJ0aWNsZS5hbXAuYXNwP25ld3NJZHg9MzA3MzUx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amid chip shortage businesses seek pardon for Samsung chief,"US President Joe Biden holds up a silicon wafer as he participates in the virtual CEO Summit on Semiconductor and Supply Chain Resilience in the Roosevelt Room of the White House April 12 in Washington. AP-Yonhap



By Kim Yoo-chul



A continued mismatch in the global supply and demand of computer chips vital components of all digital devices has impacted manufacturing around the world. Making matters worse the situation is not expected to end any time soon.



The global shortage of semiconductors has become a ""political issue"" with U.S. President Joe Biden seeking to effectively handle the political and economic headaches caused by the scarcity of the high-tech products.



The semiconductor shortage has rattled the U.S. automotive industry. Vital parts in manufacturing cars and trucks have become unavailable forcing automakers to halt production. That will hurt Biden's economy-focused policies and Washington's initiative to maintain a lead over Beijing in the race to develop next-generation technologies.



Biden recently imposed restrictions on Chinese technology firms including Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. one of China's largest chip makers.



The U.S. president invited the top executives of major semiconductor companies including Samsung Electronics and Intel to an online meeting linked to the White House where Washington urged them to invest more to expand production capacity in the United States. President Moon Jae-in also invited senior executives at Samsung Hyundai SK and others to Cheong Wa Dae to explore the best possible ways for the government to help them stay competitive.



Samsung Electronics is the world's top memory chipmaker with a massive presence in the U.S. While Samsung is supporting Biden's drive to invest $50 billion in America's semiconductor industry as part of his signature ""CHIPS"" for U.S. program the Korean company is also facing pressure by China to invest more there. China is hoping Korea will become its technological ally.



""Samsung is feeling pressure as Washington is viewing the semiconductor shortage problem as a political issue. China wants South Korea to be a crucial partner in semiconductor-driven businesses such as big data and artificial intelligence. Given Samsung's previous hefty investments in China for memory chips and President Moon's hopes to revive the momentum of inter-Korean dialogue Samsung is being asked to pursue a dual-track approach in investments for semiconductors"" said a senior industry executive Sunday.



Sources said Samsung Electronics is ""very close"" to specifying its mega semiconductor investment plan both in the United States and South Korea. ""I can cautiously say the timing of the investment will come just few days before President Moon's face-to-face meeting with Biden at the White House possibly in early May"" another industry executive said asking not to be identified.



Washington has largely ceded to China Taiwan and Korea its position as a manufacturer of computer chips. U.S. companies are heavily reliant on a global chain of suppliers and traders that have all come under unprecedented strain during the COVID-19 pandemic. That reliance of U.S. industries on foreign companies such as automobiles telecommunications and defense poses a potential threat to America's national security and its economy.



Meanwhile Samsung is known to have generated some 40 percent of its annual chip revenue from China.



Samsung is expected to soon announce a 70 trillion won investment plan including 20 trillion won ($17 billion) possibly being allocated to its plant in Austin Texas according to sources.

The facility was forced to shut down in February due to a statewide blackout that resulted from severe winter weather.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFubC5nb3YvYXJnb25uZS1pbXBhY3RzL21pc3NvdXJp0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Missouri,"University of Missouri researchers use Advanced Photon Source to characterize semiconductor material potentially useful for solar cells

Researchers are looking at perovskites shown here a type of material that could have transformational potential in new generations of solar cells. (Image by Shutterstock/Audio und werbung.)

Researchers from the University of Missouri in collaboration with scientists from the University of Western Cape in South Africa and physicists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory have developed a new way to make hybrid perovskites — a combination of organic and inorganic semiconducting materials — that could form the basis of new solar cells or other electronic devices.

University of Missouri physicist Suchismita (Suchi) Guha and her collaborators improved the methods for making lead halide perovskites. Previous techniques for making these thin-film perovskites required liquid processing using solvents which rendered the perovskite films susceptible to degradation when exposed to air. Additionally with this prior manufacturing process part of the perovskite undergoes a temperature-dependent phase change to its structure causing performance limitations in real-world operating conditions.

With the new technique which paired chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with an additional step using a chloride ion the researchers were able to prevent the phase change in the perovskite holding it in a stable structure throughout a large temperature range. Additionally the CVD technique rendered the perovskite air stable making it appropriate for a potential solar cell.

The structure of the perovskite was analyzed at Argonne’s Advanced Photon Source.

Argonne partners with Washington University in St. Louis to deconstruct how photosynthesis works

Researchers solve a critical part of the mystery of photosynthesis uncovering an engineered version of a protein complex that switches the use of photosynthetic pathways. This discovery could improve human-made devices such as solar panels and sensors. (Image by Shutterstock/Quality Stock Arts.)

Scientists have long sought to understand photosynthesis the process by which plants and other organisms use the sun’s energy to create their own food. In a breakthrough discovery researchers from the DOE Argonne National Laboratory and Washington University in St. Louis have detected how modified photosynthetic proteins capture light and use it to initiate a series of electron transfer reactions.

Scientists traced the movement of electrons to discover how work is accomplished inside the cell of a photosynthetic organism. After a plant absorbs sunlight electrons normally take only one of two possible pathways. Scientists engineered a protein complex to disable one pathway and enable the other changing the electron’s direction. The team’s findings move science closer to harnessing the flow of energy — a feat that promises to greatly enhance the efficiency of many solar-powered devices including solar panels and sensors.

The DOE Office of Science sponsored this research.

Aerospace team harnesses the power of supercomputers to study aircraft drag

Using supercomputers at the ALCF  researchers simulated the flight of long-haul transport aircraft to understand how to reduce drag and save fuel. (Image by Skycolors/Shutterstock.)

In flight airplanes experience a resistive drag that slows their motion and requires great amounts of fuel to overcome. For long-haul aircraft — planes designed for 6- to 12-hour flights — this friction accounts for about half the total drag. Reducing drag promises to slash the amount of fuel required and limit the environmental impact. Researchers at the Missouri University of Science and Technology and NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton Virginia used supercomputers at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) to study drag.

Drag is caused by friction between the plane’s surface and the air. For shapes like airplane wings the effects of friction are confined to the boundary layer a thin region near the wing’s surface. The resistive force associated with the boundary layer is relatively modest when fluid motion is regular and ordered but becomes chaotic at high speeds because of turbulent motion.

The study focused on the backward-angling swept-wings similar to those on most aircraft and whose dynamics are difficult to predict and control. Using high-performance computing the team conducted petascale simulations of the entire process. Their findings may impact the design of many devices besides aircraft such as wind turbines.

The ALCF is a DOE Office of Science User facility.

Argonne MU partner on novel technique to advance how semiconductors are made

Argonne chemists Jeff Elam left and Anil Mane right and colleagues developed a molecular layer etching technique that may help advance microelectronics manufacturing. (Image by Argonne National Laboratory.)

Argonne and a team led by Matthias Young at MU have developed a new technique that could pack more circuitry onto semiconductors increasing the speed and capability of computers. Known as molecular layer etching (MLE) the technique promises to usher in new pathways for fabricating materials at nanoscale.

Microelectronics like semiconductor devices are at the heart of the technologies we use each day. To make them smaller and faster manufacturers cram in more and more circuitry onto films and 3D structures. Today this happens by using thin film deposition and etching to grow or remove films one layer at a time.

MLE can be used to design microscopic architectures enabling manufacturers and researchers to develop new ways of making nanostructures. The process may also be a safer option because it is free of halogens the harsh components of chemicals common in other etching processes.

This research was funded by the Center for Electrochemical Energy Science an Energy Frontier Research Center supported by DOE’s Office of Science."

One of the newest worldwide hopefuls is a Stateside pioneer. Paramount+ the rebranded and reconceived version of CBS All Access which launched in 2015 is boldly going where the latter service has not gone before. Like its media rivals Disney WarnerMedia and Discovery ViacomCBS sees transcending the U.S. as crucial to being able to replace traditional revenue with streaming as a hedge against cord-cutting. By 2024 the company expects to have 65 million to 75 million subscribers (up from 16 million for CBS All Access and Showtime’s OTT service). Total streaming revenue should hit $7 billion to $8 billion.

On March 4 the Paramount+ branding kicked in domestically. At the same time the service also lit up in 23 other markets — 18 in Latin America four in the Nordics as well as in Canada. Australia and Europe are among the other regions expected to follow with key launches later this year.

For Kelly Day who became president of streaming and COO of ViacomCBS Networks International last year the task is fairly straightforward. “We just look at it like this: There are seven and a half billion people outside the U.S.” she said in an interview with Deadline. “By going into these markets we have all this incredible opportunity to reach so many more viewers in so many different places.”

With 350 million subscription video on demand customers expected to sign up outside the U.S. by 2024 she added “The international opportunity in streaming is massive.”

ViacomCBS hopes Pluto which Viacom acquired in 2019 before reuniting with CBS will be a secret weapon. The free ad supported service saw its monthly active user base go from 1 million to 13 million in 2020. It had already been in the UK and Germany and then expanded to Latin America and Spain at the exact time when the coronavirus pandemic made free streaming more appealing than ever. This year Pluto will arrive in France and Italy. The company estimates it will have 100 million to 120 million active users globally by 2024.

The programming mix on Patramount+ internationally will be different from the U.S. version. There will be originals like SpongeBob SquarePants spinoff Kamp Koral. In addition the service will also add new and vintage Showtime series CBS fare (including NCIS a top draw for Netflix in the U.S.) and known properties like The Handmaid’s Tale and Killing Eve in some territories. Locally produced titles include Ib the Dog in the Nordics and the MTV-derived Acapulco Shore and Are You the One Brazil and upcoming originals Cecilia and The Envoys for Latin America.

Day says a tailwind for Paramount+ is the company’s history of operating globally long before streaming. ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish made his reputation by working a long stretch as an international exec at Viacom helping boost networks like Nickelodeon MTV and Comedy Central. The Paramount name also hitches the service’s fortunes to a name that can travel a lot more than CBS could.

“It’s an advantage for us as a company to have such a deep history with MVPDs and telco partners around the world” Day said.

The field is not wide-open however. Disney said last month that Disney+ has racked up more than 100 million subscribers in two dozen countries. After launching in the U.S. Australia and New Zealand in 2019 it has expanded across Asia and Europe and will be adding a number of key Latin American European and Asian territories later this year. Having taken control of Star via the 21st Century Fox acquisition in 2019 Disney also has made Disney+ an add-on to Star’s streaming service in India and other territories and also has launched a stand-alone Star service in many territories.

HBO Max launched nearly a year ago in the U.S. but the company plans to be in 39 territories across Latin America and the Caribbean starting in June. It will also launch in Europe but it won’t be in the UK German or Italy until at least 2025 due to a long-term distribution deal with Sky.

Wall Street analysts came away from the February streaming presentation by ViacomCBS fairly upbeat but the field is crowded and mounting a truly global service requires resources.

Benjamin Swinburne of Morgan Stanley last week lowered his 12-month price target on ViacomCBS shares to $50 from $55 maintaining his “equal-weight” (neutral) rating. He wrote in a note to clients that the uncertain outlook for streaming was a key factor. “Long-term we are unsure of global Paramount+ demand and streaming earnings power” he wrote.

Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson factored international presence into a recent sector analysis with the provocative title “Is Streaming a Good Business?” In the report he asserted that only a small handful of contenders have enough horsepower to make their global dreams come true without losing money.

“Netflix’s greatest asset – and the likely Achilles’ heel of many of their competitors – is indeed their international footprint which should drive incremental profit and return on invested capital into the future” he wrote. “While both the market and the press remain focused on the domestic SVOD streaming wars the real opportunity seems to be in both the shift in ad monetization from linear to digital and the higher total available market outside the U.S. as content owners pivot from pay-TV to OTT. Aside from Netflix Disney has already demonstrated this success as few others aside from Discovery seem to be all in around the world.”

Having expanded to 130 countries in 2016 and reaching 204 million subscribers by the end of 2020 Netflix has a few years’ head start on its newer U.S.-based competitors. Its spending on content — now approaching a staggering $20 billion a year — is a significant barrier to entry. Amazon Prime Video has been in more than 200 countries since 2016. Its willingness to shell out hundreds of millions on A-list movies and potential global blockbusters like the Lord of the Rings series will keep it very much in the chase. Apple TV+ is newest to the party among tech giants but the company’s installed base of more than 1 billion devices enabled it to launch the service in 100 countries in November 2019.

As Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos sees it there is still enormous upside in the global marketplace.

“There’s about a billion pay-TV households in the world people who pay in some form for subscription television” he said in a recent interview with Jason Bateman Will Arnett and Sean Hayes on their Smartless podcast. “And there are more than 3 billion people with a mobile phone who watch mobile content on their phone. So when you think about the addressable world we’re only about 10% there.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS90di90aGUtbmV2ZXJzLXMwMWUwMi1wcmV2aWV3LWNhc3QtY3JlYXRpdmUtdGFsay10b3VjaGVkLW9wZXJhLXNjZW5lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Nevers S01E02 Preview; Cast Creative Talk Touched Opera Scene,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bleedingcool.com/tv/the-nevers-s01e02-preview-cast-creative-talk-touched-opera-scene/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS90di90aGUtbmV2ZXJzLXMwMWUwMi1wcmV2aWV3LWNhc3QtY3JlYXRpdmUtdGFsay10b3VjaGVkLW9wZXJhLXNjZW5lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZWR1Y2F0aW9uL3dpdGgtY2xhc3MtMTItYm9hcmRzLWV4YW1zLWRlZmVycmVkLXN0dWRlbnRzLXdvcnJpZWQtYWJvdXQtdWctYWRtaXNzaW9ucy1jb2xsZWdlLWplZS1tYWluLW5kYS03Mjc2MzU0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With Class 12 boards deferred students worried about college admissions,"With CBSE and several state boards having rescheduled the class 12 board exams board aspirants are now worried about undergraduate (UG) admissions. Students are most concerned about those universities that follow a cut-off-based admission process on class 12 boards marks such as the University of Delhi (DU) and Mumbai University (MU).

PC Joshi pro-vice chancellor DU told indianexpress.com that going ahead with DU admissions without the CBSE board exam results is very difficult because every year more than 90 per cent of applicants are from the central board.

“This year we had planned to provide 50 per cent weightage to class 12 marks and 50 per cent to Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CUCET) score. The fate of board exams is now uncertain but we have not yet decided if we will go ahead with only the entrance exam. DU admissions will continue to be merit-based; however the criteria may get changed based on CBSE’s decision on board exams” Joshi said.

Harsh Gangwani class 12 student of Jai Hindi College Mumbai said that postponing the board exams is not a wise decision and will waste several months of a student’s career.

“The exams should have been cancelled as we do not know when the condition will be conducive to conduct the exams. Consequently professional examinations such as chartered accountancy (CA) company secretary (CS) will also have to be rescheduled and the next academic year will also be delayed” he added.

There are students who are worried that some universities may switch to entrance exams instead of merit-based admissions. “DU and IP University might roll out their entrance tests. Students are not prepared for sudden entrance exams as the syllabus and the registration process has not been shared yet. We are already three months late in the academic cycle it would be helpful if such details are shared with us now” said Aditya Gaur a class 12 student Paramount International School Dwarka. He aspires to join BCA or BSc course at DU.

Students are also concerned about various competitive exams as most of them will also get rescheduled and aspirants may get lesser time to prepare.

“Seeing the current situation of the pandemic the decision made has its pros and cons. The postponement might take a toll on the students appearing for entrance exams be it CLAT SLAT AILET or the students appearing for JEE Advanced BITSAT and NEET since the board exams dates might clash with these examinations and reduce the number of days before the exam which would have been utilised for revision for the exams” said Shivangi Vikas Mishra Class 12 student SAI International School Bhubaneswar.",,,,,,

One local drag queen to note is Daegen Michelle.

Michelle is a prolific artist and performer from Springfield who has been associated with local drag shows around town at places like Martha’s Vineyard and previously worked on Get Dusted a monthly drag performance at The Outland Complex.

According to Michelle her interest in drag as an artistic medium started when she was young.

“I've always had an infatuation with performing. I have memories of the women in my family dressing me up as a kid and they'd turn on music and I'd dance on the tabletops” Daegen said. “My mother allowed me to explore any interests I had; being the center of attention has forever been number one.”

Daegen’s drag career started in 2013 and since then she has gained a dedicated following both in the community and on her social media.

“The support I receive comes from the people in my personal life and from people who know me through my celebrity” Michelle said. “I have acquired a cute little fan base of so many amazing people and I am beyond blessed to know I am an inspiration for some and a muse for others.”

Michelle’s fellow performer and roommate Brett Baxley said Michelle is what he would consider a unique performer for the area. From her style to her attitude Michelle tends to shake things up for Springfield according to Baxley.

“Daegen has a really clear sense of her style and even if she's styling looks with thrift shop finds she has such a clear perspective that they always give you Daegen Michelle” Baxley said. “Before the pandemic Daegen and I would perform in drag shows together. Through quarantine I would produce digital drag videos for Daegen to share with her followers.”

One aspect of Daegen that makes her stand out is her identity as a transgender woman.

“It was drag that actualized the fact I am trans(gender)” Michelle said. “It allowed me to explore myself in and out. I've had people drop me because I'm unapologetically trans and I don't entertain people who are dismissive of the harsh realities trans people are subjected to. People can become so complacent in their privilege that they aren't willing to look outside of themselves. My art and skill is what has gained me any of the following I possess and I owe it all to myself.”

According to Michelle drag is viewed as a predominantly cisgendered male occupied field and anyone who doesn’t fit that model is going to have a harder time getting into it.

“Cis men are privileged” Michelle said. “Trans and cis women who do drag are subjected to a lot of misogyny due to people's shallow belief that drag artists are 'men dressed as women' or 'female impersonators.' That is invalidating to my identity. Drag is about exploring the fluidity of gender playing with it and for some of us it allows us to receive confirmation of our identities.”

In her art and performances Michelle said she opts to display as much of her identity as she can so that she might express her own pride and help others with their own.

“I draw a lot of inspiration from the trans goddesses and icons who have come before me” Michelle said. “Everyone wants to be the prettiest person in the room and it's always going to be me.”

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic Michelle’s live drag shows like many other local artistic mediums took a back seat to public safety. According to Baxley this has had an impact on Michelle's career just like other artists.

+2 COVID-19’s impact on the Springfield drag community Drag queens depend on physical interactions entirely as the majority of the money they make…

“There has really been a disconnect from any sense of community in the last year” Baxley said. “Before COVID-19 Daegen was one of the most popular drag performers in Springfield.”

Still Michelle said she has adapted and overcame to keep herself in the public sphere while quarantining and social distancing. To do this Michelle has begun diversifying her artistic pursuits.

“Outside of drag I've been trying to write music which is extremely tedious” Michelle said. “COVID-19 has taken me on a journey of doing anything I can to cure a boredom spell and I have highs and lows of creating.2021 is the year of the healed pretty b-----s like myself continuing the growth we've achieved over this last year.”

Fans can catch Daegen Michelle at the next monthly “Drag Brunch” at 11 a.m. Sunday April 18 at Cellar Plate.

Michelle said those who wish to support her can through Venmo Cashapp and Paypal @DaegenMichelle.

is safe as long as you know and trust the person you're sending money to. Once you authorize a payment it'll go through and there's no form of fraud protection.

Zelle runs through your personal bank's digital infrastructure so it's as secure as your bank.

There's no shortage of peer-to-peer digital payment apps; in 2017 Zelle joined the ranks of services like PayPal and Venmo as a simple way to send and receive money via your mobile device. Unlike the alternatives though Zelle is backed by hundreds of banks and directly transfers money between accounts in minutes.

That speed - and its status as the ""official"" digital payment system built into many banking apps - makes it a target for criminal activity which has led some experts to question the app's overall safety.

Zelle is safe if you know who you're sending money to

Zelle was built by banks and was engineered to be safe. ""Zelle is safe because it uses data encryption which offers users increased protection. From a privacy perspective it's safer than alternatives like Venmo and Cash App since it's harder for scammers to access users' personal information"" said Nishank Khanna chief marketing officer at Clarify Capital.

But some well-publicized incidents of fraud are a cause for concern and Zelle's consumer protection isn't especially robust if things go wrong.

The biggest drawback of Zelle is that it doesn't offer fraud protection for authorized payments. In other words if you purchase something online and use Zelle to pay for it you have no recourse if you never receive the item you paid for.

For example if you use Zelle to purchase an item from Craigslist and it turns out you were scammed Zelle won't refund you. Thus Zelle advises that you only use the service to pay people you absolutely know and trust.

Ted Rossman a senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com said ""The key with Zelle is to only send money to people you know and trust. Once the money is sent it's gone. There's no pending status no chargeback mechanism no buyer protections of any sort. If you send money to the wrong person you're basically at the mercy of that stranger to send it back.""

In fact some criminals try to capitalize on that. ""Some scammers deliberately encourage you to pay them via Zelle with the intent of stealing your money. If someone you don't know is requesting a payment via Zelle I'd suggest declining"" Rossman said.

But you're not entirely without protection. In many cases it all comes down to whether you authorized the transaction; if you did you're not protected. But unauthorized transactions are usually fully reimbursable.

""Zelle's ease-of-use can also make it possible for malicious parties and fraudsters to use social engineering to acquire Zelle credentials"" said Tom Kelly president and CEO of consumer privacy company IDX. Social engineering is when a scammer lies about their identity or goal to trick victims into giving them personal information.

Criminals have used social engineering to contact victims and request the two-factor code that Zelle requires to set up accounts. In situations like this criminals can easily set up a Zelle account on their own device using a victim's credentials.

You can defend yourself against these types of attacks the same way that you defend yourself from phishing attacks malware and other social engineering attacks: Keep your data and personal information secure don't divulge info to people you don't know and make your passwords unique and strong.

Alternatives to Zelle

""I would never suggest using Zelle for a first payment"" said Jake Hill founder of DebtHammer. ""If you're exchanging money with someone for the first time use something like PayPal. The fees are terrible but PayPal offers a much larger safety net. Once you've established a relationship of trust with this person then you can begin using Zelle for the convenience of instant wire transfers.""

So what are the alternatives to Zelle? There are several:

It was four years ago that we were first introduced to Mountain Dew’s DEW-S-A from PepsiCo. The patriotic sip combined three flavors in one which obviously gained the attention of soda lovers. While it was rumored the flavor would be back for summer 2020 the rerelease was pushed and it’s now rolling out for spring 2021.

DEW-S-A mixes together Mountain Dew Code Red White Out and Voltage for a red white and blue concoction. Code Red has a kick of cherry flavor White Out brings a smooth citrus flavor and Voltage completes it with raspberry citrus and ginseng flavor. When they all come together you get a fruity drink in a cool purple color.

Mountain Dew has the tendency to introduce flavors or bring them back without making any sort of official announcement beforehand and this time is no exceptions. Various people on Reddit have already found DEW-S-A at stores including Walmart. Retailer like King Scoopers and Kroger listed the returning soda on their websites within the past week.

It appears that the red white and blue packaging shades have been updated a bit along with the bottle shape. You can find DEW-S-A in bottles and cans — for what appears to be for a limited time — now.

Manzanita Sol a new apple soda from PepsiCo partnered with four popular Black and Hispanic-owned food trucks this weekend in New York City handing out free food and a bottle of the apple pop.

Honoring the contribution the local food trucks have made to their respective communities each owner also received $10000 from Manzanita Sol as part of PepsiCo Foundation’s commitment to invest more than $570 million over five years in Black and Hispanic-owned businesses and communities.

“New York is a place where you’ll find diverse cuisines around every corner and food trucks are what bring that authentic taste of home paired with a refreshing Manzanita Sol to the streets of the city” said iHeartRadio New York’s Power 105.1 radio personality Angie Martinez who helped announce the initiative.

Island Spice Grill owners and chefs Roxanne and Demetrius Newton have been serving Jamaican and Caribbean food to the central Harlem community from their bright food truck which is parked on the corner of 135th Street and Lenox Avenue across Harlem Hospital since 2014.

A long line of customers waited patiently to pick up some of the free food which included jerk chicken sweet and spicy shrimp wild flounder mac and cheese and a vegan dish while listening to reggae music and enjoying the smell of barbecued chicken and pork permeating from the large bbq pit sitting next to the food truck.

Roxanne Newton admitted that they were surprised when PepsiCo chose them to help launch Manzanita Sol and the free food initiative.

“We’re very honored to be part of that to be able to touch so many people you know?” her husband and chef Demetrius Newton said. “In a time like this where everybody needs it you know being able to give back it is important for us.”

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic the couple also fed essential workers for free — and they were excited to give back to the community once again.

“We try to touch as many people as we can because we know at the end of the day that’s all that really matters. How can you touch someone else during a time in need? That’s just something that’s joyful for us” Demetrius explained.

His wife Roxanne concurred and said “You give from the heart.”

Angel Jimenez the owner of Lechonera La Piraña in the South Bronx is known for his classic Puerto Rican pork dish lechón. Known as the infamous machete-wielding “La Piraña” Jimenez chops the slow-roasted pork with a machete before it’s doused with a healthy dose of garlic oil. He also serves generous portions of octopus salad with homemade hot pepper dressing over rice.

“La Piraña” who took over the business from his parents twenty years ago came through for his community during the COVID-19 pandemic. He shared that he gave out a lot of food from his truck which is located at 766 E 152nd St. on the corner of Wales and 152nd Avenues.

“Somebody comes to you and you ‘re hungry you got food you’re gonna say no?” he asked. “Money is not everything in life. I could have a lot of money but I’m gonna help my people.”

His friend of 20 years Mario Hernandez praised the machete-wielding chef not only for his contribution to his community during the COVID-19 crisis but also for his food.

“I love the food. It’s typical Puerto Rican food. You feel like you’re on the island. You feel like you’re in Puerto Rico when you walk in there; it brings you back to your culture” Hernandez said.

El Punto Final is located at 559 W 185th St. Washington Heights. The family-owned food truck delivers a taste of home to the Dominican community.

The owner Mateo who also works as a certified first responder with the FDNY grew up in Washington Heights and has a passion for food. He opened his food truck two years ago but was closed for almost ten months because of the pandemic.

It means a lot to him that he is able to serve Dominican food which is fused with other cultural cuisines to his community. One of his signature sandwiches is a DominiCubano a Cuban sandwich with a Dominican twist by adding tomatoes cabbage and a different type of ham.

“I was born and raised here because I feel like I’m giving back. Aside from doing something positive I am giving back to the community in the sense that they get to taste my food.”

The CFR is able to juggle both jobs with the help of his family.

“It’s so hard to keep up but you got to do it. I have a good family that helps me out but that I’m a first responder as a nine to five I also have to make time for my passion which is food and the restaurant business. So it’s it keeps me busy. I have very little hours to sleep but I get to eat I get to be with my family while I’m here” Mateo said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2Y2x1Yi5jb20vaW4tMTk5Mi1wZXBzaS1mZXZlci10dXJuZWQtZGVhZGx5LTE4NDY2ODc0NjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wiki Wormhole: In 1992 Pepsi Fever turned deadly,"We explore some of Wikipedia’s oddities in our 6284187-week series Wiki Wormhole.

This week’s entry: Pepsi Number Fever

What it’s about: A contest where everyone was a winner… with tragic results. In 1992 Pepsi Philippines started printing numbers 001-999 inside bottle caps with numbers corresponding to prizes that were announced on TV nightly. It was a huge success at first… until a misprint put the million-peso ($40000 USD) winning number on 800000 bottles resulting in rioting lawsuits and a massive debacle for Pepsi.

Biggest controversy: Those 800000 winning bottle caps weren’t technically winners. Each contest bottle caps had a security code alongside the number for confirmation; the misprints had no code. But that mattered little to people who were convinced they had won. Panicked Pepsi executives held a 3 A.M. meeting and worked out a compromise where the misprint bottle caps could be exchanged for a 500-peso ($18) consolation prize. Although 486170 people accepted it was a lose-lose for Pepsi. The payouts cost the company 240 million pesos ($8.9 million) on a contest that initially had $2 million USD set aside for prizes.

Strangest fact: Pepsi has a massively popular brand they sell everywhere except the U.S. The Number Fever contest included PepsiCo’s four biggest sodas—Pepsi 7-Up Mountain Dew and orange soda Mirinda. While Coke has Fanta and Keurig-Dr. Pepper has both Sunkist and Orange Crush Pepsi doesn’t have a signature orange soda in the U.S. The company started selling Mirinda in Spain in 1959 and it’s become a massive global brand popular everywhere from Mexico to India to Egypt and variants with flavors ranging from other citrus fruits to passionfruit banana hibiscus and tamarind. Pepsi apparently attempted to push Mirinda in the U.S. in the ’70s even commissioning Jim Henson to do a series of commercials with the Cookie Monster-esque “Miranda Craver.” But Mirinda seems to be the soccer of soft drinks catching on everywhere but here.

Thing we were happiest to learn: The contest was initially a huge success. Pepsi had run similar promotions with great success across Latin America and the contest got Filipinos excited enough that Pepsi’s market share went from 4% to nearly 25% overnight. (No word as to how far it dropped after disaster struck.)

Thing we were unhappiest to learn: While some people accepted the consolation prize (and accepted an honest mistake on Pepsi’s part) some people were angry. And some people were very angry. Pepsi drinkers who felt they had been cheated formed a consumer group the 349 Alliance (349 was the misprinted winning number) which organized boycotts protests and numerous lawsuits. In an sentence where the word “but” is doing some Olympic-caliber heavy lifting “most protests were peaceful but three [Pepsi] employees were killed by a grenade thrown into a warehouse in Davao and a mother and child were killed… by a grenade thrown at a Pepsi truck.” Thirty-seven Pepsi trucks were “pushed over stoned or burned.” One sitting Senator suggested rival bottlers were behind the attacks; a popular conspiracy theory at the time was Pepsi itself staged the attacks to frame the protestors as terrorists.

Also noteworthy: The Pepsi Number Fever case went to the Philippines’ Supreme Court. Hundreds of civil suits and thousands of criminal fraud complaints were filed in the wake of “the 349 incident.” One court awarded plaintiffs 10000 pesos each in “moral damages.” Three of those plaintiffs appealed for more money; the appellate court raised the award to 30000 pesos. Pepsi then appealed that decision and in 2006 14 years after the initial incident the Supreme Court ruled Pepsi was neither liable for the misprinted prizes nor further damages. And in a Simpson-esque “let’s never speak of this again” touch the Justices also ruled “the issues surrounding the 349 incident have been laid to rest and must no longer be disturbed in this decision.”

Best link to elsewhere on Wikipedia: While the 349 incident was a genuine accident the Hoover Free Flights Promotion was just astoundingly poor planning. In the early ’90s Britain’s ubiquitous vacuum cleaner company was being hit hard by a recession and competition from newcomer Dyson. So they ran a promotion in which anyone buying more than £100 worth of Hoover products would get two round-trip plane tickets to the U.S. Naturally the plane tickets costs several times as much as the vacuum cleaner and Hoover had to scramble to stop the already-out-of-control promotion. The British public viewed the promotion as “buy these incredibly cheap airline tickets and get a free vacuum cleaner into the bargain.” Hundreds of thousands of people took advantage and neither Hoover nor the airline were prepared for the demand (the airline eventually folded). Hoover tried to make the application process for the airline vouchers as complicated as possible to dissuade people but trans-Atlantic flights were going for £600 so £100 plane tickets and a free vacuum cleaner were too good a deal to pass up. Like Pepsi Hoover lost their shirts and also angered the public when they tried to renege on the too-good-to-be-true giveaway.

Further Down the Wormhole: One of the two grenade attacks in the wake of the 349 incident took place in Manila. The Philippine capital was founded in 1258 as Maynilá and has grown to be both the most densely populated city on earth with 1.78 million people in 107520 square miles and also a sprawling metropolis with a metro era of 12.8 million people. Among other things the city hosts the country’s only sizable baseball stadium—Rizal Memorial. The sport was popular in the first half of the 20th century but has declined to the point where the country’s last professional league folded in 2012. But Filipino and American baseball share some history; the first two players to hit home runs at Rizal were Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth on a world tour 1934. (The Bambino was at the end of his career as he left the Yankees in ’34 playing a disastrous ’35 season for the Boston Braves that saw him retire by Memorial Day.) That season was largely forgotten by the time the Sultan Of Swat was inducted into the Hall Of Fame a year later standing alongside some of baseball’s greats including a previous star for Boston with a terrific nickname Old Hoss Radbourn a 19th-century pitcher who holds what’s considered baseball’s most unbreakable record. We’ll examine his astounding career on the field and colorful exploits off of it next week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjAyMTA0MTgvaXNzYS1yYWUtZ2l2ZXMtbmV3LWNyZWF0aXZlcy1oYW5kLXRhbGtzLWVuZGluZy1pbnNlY3VyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Issa Rae gives new creatives a hand talks ending 'Insecure',"NEW YORK (AP):

Issa Rae remembers what life was like when she was starting out in Hollywood: no money and just hoping for a chance to be discovered.

“It was about ‘I just want the exposure. I need the right person to see me and see my work’ and I feel like I can deliver from there” she said. “And then it was ‘I’m broke as hell.’ If I could just have a certain amount of money to help me continue to do my work then I’d be good.”

It was a decade ago that the first episode of her viral web series Awkward Black Girl was launched. She ran out of money then was saved by a Kickstarter campaign.

So Rae now an aspiring entertainment mogul with a reported new US$40 million WarnerMedia deal wants to lighten the load for others hoping to climb the entertainment ladder.

She’s teaming up with LIFEWTR PepsiCo’s bottled water product line and its ‘Life Unseen’ campaign. They’re hoping to shed light on 20 up-and-coming creatives in fashion film music and visual art from under-represented communities.

Their content will be featured at LIFEWTR.com and their individual artwork will also be displayed on a collection of 20 bottles starting next month. There’s also a #LifeUnseenContest on Instagram which includes a chance for five more artists to be mentored by Rae and provided $10000 each for future projects.

“It’s always been a mission to make sure that people have a place within this industry” said the Insecure creator and star. “It’s about opening the door and even the talent that we selected we hope that that will be their mission as well.”

The campaign aligns with what Rae already does: extending her hand to pull others up. Industry colleagues and co-workers often sing her praises for offering opportunities in what’s perceived as a ruthless industry. Last season on Insecure she tapped several young directors to lead episodes like rising film-maker Thembi Banks and Rae’s own co-star Jay Ellis.

“If you have the opportunity to give people the chance that they’re looking for then why not provide that opportunity? I have nothing to lose and I have only things to gain by watching passionate people deliver” said Rae who recently won the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series.

Rooting for others to succeed especially black people who have been historically under-represented in Hollywood has been Rae’s mantra. Her viral “I’m rooting for everybody black” response during a 2017 Emmys red carpet interview was something she said off the cuff and is now found on T-shirts stickers pins and other trinkets.

“I still think about leaving the carpet that day and my publicist being like ‘Oh my God! You’re everywhere!’ And I was like ‘They didn’t like the dress?’” she said with a huge belly laugh. “’ Then she told me ‘Oh no! Everybody’s saying this phrase.’”

Rae’s Hoorae production company is now focused on the final season of Insecure. Serving as co-creator executive producer and lead Rae says it’s time to close this novel — even if the fans aren’t ready.

“That’s like being mad that you’re reaching the end of a book. And I understand that sentiment — it’s a compliment that people want it to continue. But you bought this book and you saw the length of it and we’re at the end of it.”

But does she feel pressure to end the show in a way that’s pleasing to both her and her loyal viewers?

“I have no doubt that if people don’t like the ending they’re going to make it clear to me and make it known for the rest of my life” she laughed. “So in that way yes there is pressure but I’m happy with where things are ending. I like stories ending.”

Up next for Rae is Rap Sh*t a series loosely based off the firecracker female rap duo City Girls as well as a remake of the cult classic Set It Off. She has also completed her first script for a movie she hopes to film soon. Hoorae is said to be juggling more than a dozen projects in various stages.

With magazine cover shoots and glamourous red carpet looks Rae is far from those early lean years despite still hustling like one. So what would she go back and tell that awkward black girl?

“She should not be afraid to dream big and to possibly dream even bigger” said Rae. “And you’re still going to be awkward so just embrace it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmYXFzLmNvbS9uZXdzL21rdGcvZnJvbS1jYW5zLXRvLWN1dGxlcnktcGVwc2ktdW52ZWlscy03dXBzLXJhbXphbi10aGVtZWQtbGltaXRlZC1lZGl0aW9uLWNvbGxlY3Rpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From cans to cutlery Pepsi unveils 7Up's Ramzan-themed limited edition collection,Mauro Porcini PepsiCo's SVP and chief design officer posted photographs of this collection on LinkedIn.

Here's why women and younger people are having more side effects to Pfizer or Moderna vaccine

A University of California San Francisco expert says these side effects after the second COVID-19 shot are normal because the immune response to the second shot is stronger.

A University of California San Francisco expert says these side effects after the second COVID-19 shot are normal because the immune response to the second shot is stronger.

SAN FRANCISCO -- For 24 hours these were the side effects Irma Duran went through after her second Pfizer shot.

""I had my shot at 10:30 in the morning and then at midnight that's when I woke up. I had a high fever and my bones... It felt like sand paper. Like someone was sanding my bones"" said Duran.

A University of California San Francisco expert says these side effects after the second COVID-19 shot are normal because the immune response to the second shot is stronger.

""It's the spike protein that the mRNA is tricking the cells intro producing. That is what is being detected. That is what we want it to do. This is all good stuff"" said George Rutherford UCSF's Professor and Epidemiology & Biostatistics.

In this CDC report data shows that out of 13.7 million Americans vaccinated during December and January of 2021 side effects were higher among women.

""78.7% reports were submitted for adverse events in women. Headache (22.4%) fatigue (16.5%) and dizziness (16.5%) were the most frequently reported symptoms after vaccination with either vaccine. Sixty-two reports of anaphylaxis have been confirmed 46 (74.2%) after receipt of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 16 (25.8%) after receipt of the Moderna vaccine.""

Luz Pena: ""Why it is that women and young adults are having more reactions to the second shot of the Moderna or the Pfizer vaccine?""

Dr. Rutherford: ""Women should have stronger immune responses because they have to protect pregnancies. They have to live to have babies. So it probably has to do with sex hormones. I can't tell you the exact biochemical mechanism but it makes perfect sense when you think about it in that larger context"" and added ""We also know that the immune system ages and collects problems as you get older but it's not at all surprising to me that the reactions are more common in younger people than older people.""

Now let's be clear these side effects are mild and tend to last between two to three days. They are headaches body aches and fever in some cases.

Should people be concerned if they don't have side effects to either of the vaccines?

""No. There is nothing wrong with them. They just have a better regulated immune system that can get them through this without causing a lot of unnecessary symptoms. If you don't feel these symptoms there is no reason for you to go get an antibody test"" said Dr. Rutherford.

San Francisco resident Alejandro Galicia 34 felt the side effects of the first Moderna shot. He was hospitalized a year ago with COVID-19 and was given a 50% chance of survival. He puts the body aches after his first shot in perspective.

""Mentally it brings you back to having a fever and it's just sort of psychological but then you tell yourself it's nothing compared to COVID"" said Galicia Diaz.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2h1bWFuLWludGVyZXN0LzIwMjEvMDQvYmVzdC12YWNjaW5lLWNob2ljZS1wZml6ZXItam9rZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best vaccine: How Pfizer became the “status” choice.,"Last week on a phone call with Tom Cox a former representative in the Kansas state Legislature who now works in government relations I told him I was soon to get my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.

“Welcome to the ruling class” he replied. Cox had also gotten the Pfizer shot and with it he has lately developed—facetiously he swears—a sense of Pfizer superiority.

It started after he his closest friends and his immediate family all happened to get the Pfizer vaccine. “We started calling ourselves ‘double-dosed Pfizer elites’ ” Cox said. “I will refer to anyone who’s had one dose as a ‘one-doser.’ Like ‘Oh you’re a one-doser? OK well you’ll reach this enlightened plane soon enough.’ ”

“One of my cousins got Moderna and I was like ‘That’s OK. We need a strong middle class. We can’t all be CEOs.’ ”

Cox is likely not the first Pfizerphile you’ve heard sing his vaccine brand’s praises. Pro-Pfizer sentiment is all over TikTok where you can find skits of bros bonding over their shared Pfizer status or one creator declaring that the name itself “Sounds rich. Decadent. Luxury!”

Olajide Bamishigbin a psychology professor in California was on a similar wavelength recently when he tweeted a GIF of SpongeBob SquarePants dressed in a top hat and monocle alongside the words “Me when somebody says they got any vaccine other than Pfizer.”

The Pfizer superiority complex is at once a joke and a real phenomenon. But is it affecting the vaccine rollout? “Even though I think that we have this instinct that’s out there”—the belief that Pfizer is the elite shot—“it still feels more playful than really driving outcomes” said Manuel Hermosilla a professor of marketing at Johns Hopkins’ Carey Business School who studies the pharmaceutical industry. He said he thinks people understand that getting whatever vaccine you can should trump any brand preference—though it’s unclear how this week’s news about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine could change that equation. On Tuesday U.S. health agencies recommended a pause in administration of the J&J vaccine after six women developed a rare blood clot disorder within weeks of receiving the shot. In all likelihood this pause will be temporary. (Hermosilla like most of this article’s sources spoke to Slate before the J&J pause took effect.)

As the vaccines have rolled out many experts have strenuously rejected the idea that there’s any “best” vaccine.

With the blood clot scare in the news it may seem an uncouth time to be a Pfizer snob. Objectively the Pfizer vaccine may have the best numbers with an efficacy rate originally reported as 95 percent. But with a 94 percent efficacy rate the Moderna vaccine was right behind it and J&J’s efficacy rate of 66 percent was actually quite good if you understand what the numbers mean. And the J&J shot has one big advantage on the other two which is that it can be administered in one dose instead of two. Once you’re able to get it again.

As the vaccines have rolled out many experts have strenuously rejected the idea that there’s any “best” vaccine. “The best vaccine is the one that goes in your arm” said Mary Hayney a professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison School of Pharmacy who researches vaccination. “I truly believe that there is not a big difference among the vaccines or a discernable difference. Whatever one is offered to you take it.” (Again Hayney spoke to Slate before the latest J&J news.)

But Lindsey Leininger a public health scientist at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College took a less hard-line approach. “Brand preference is very real and it’s very prevalent” she said. “I think it’s important to really highlight that these feelings are strong and they’re real and we in public health need to make some time to actually listen to them as opposed to brushing them off.”

This is not to say people don’t make vaccination decisions for silly reasons too. I for example ended up having a choice between the Pfizer and J&J vaccines. By the time I was booking my shot I had formed an idea of what the “Real Vaccine Experience” as the guy who runs the vaccine-finding bot TurboVax (aka Vax Daddy) put it should entail. Vax Daddy’s Real Vaccine Experience meant getting it at New York’s Javits Center; mine did too. When I was making the split-second decision between Pfizer and J&J because Javits happened to have both when I was booking two shots instead of one also felt like the Real Vaccine Experience to me. (I don’t know what brand Vax Daddy got.) I can’t say I know what I would have done if Moderna had been an option. After all this when I found out that a trusted colleague got the J&J vaccine I briefly regretted my choice. Yes it occurs to me that I should probably not base my health decisions so much on what my peers are doing.

“I think that’s very typical” Leininger said after I shared my appointment reasoning with her. People are “emotion-driven in the moment. That’s how we make decisions.”

But where might my—or anyone’s—preference for Pfizer have originated?

For Hermosilla Pfizer’s first-to-market advantage was significant. Remembering last fall he said “Our expectations were very low and we had a lot of time and a lot of interest in a vaccine solution to come up. Then all of the sudden in November we get Pfizer news. At least in my reading this was a little bit of a magical moment when [Pfizer CEO] Albert Bourla had this press conference and said ‘Hey we have 95 percent efficacy.’ Remember the FDA had said ‘We’ll take it if it is more than 50 or 60 percent.’ I think that that was a very special moment in our collective imagination in that there was a real solution to a real problem that was delivered by science much more quickly than we could have ever imagined or hoped for based on experience. This sequence of events left a very clear mark in our minds on this Pfizer vaccine being something special.”

Leininger had a similar perspective: “I remember exactly where I was when I was reading the news on my phone and I saw the Pfizer headline about the 95 percent efficacy” she said. “I started crying. I am not a crier. That sticks in our brains. The psychology of this is very important. I don’t remember where I was when I read the Moderna results and I really don’t remember where I was when I read the J&J results.”

A British publication called Marketing Week that declared Pfizer “the winner of the Covid vaccine brand battle” also cited this moment: “For the first time in my adult life I listened to the World Service news with a mug of coffee and a tear rolling down my cheek” wrote columnist Mark Ritson.

Pfizer that hard-to-reach celebrity didn’t respond to my questions about how it may have kindled this perception itself.

Matthew McLean a Londoner who works in branded content told me that part of what he liked about the Pfizer vaccine was its origin story. “There were stories about British people not going to appointments for the Pfizer vaccine when they were made available because they wanted to have ‘the Oxford vaccine’ because the AstraZeneca vaccine was partly devised by scientists at Oxford” he said. The Washington Post reported in February that some Brits were deriding the Pfizer vaccine as “the posh one” as opposed to “the English one.” “It’s the worst case of British jingoistic nonsense” McLean said.

“The reverse are people like me who like Pfizer precisely because it’s European” he went on. Pfizer is an American company but BioNTech the smaller firm the company partnered with on its COVID-19 vaccine was founded by Turkish immigrants in Germany. “It was a real happy Sesame Street pan-European multicultural success story.

“It’s a bit like which sounds so silly but it’s a bit like you know the best leather goods come out of Italy and the best steel comes from Sweden” McLean said. “It feels in that way kind of elite and higher quality. The fact that it’s not from the U.K.—which a lot of right-minded people are feeling more and more embarrassed about this country with Brexit and racism and everything—it’s like ‘Oh right we didn’t make this one; the one that comes from Europe is probably better’ is the general perception. Literally the first person who expressed this to me was my friend’s life partner. In his French accent he was like ‘Of course ze Pfizer is best.’ ” For what it’s worth the U.K. is currently ahead of the rest of Europe in vaccination stats.

Hermosilla of Johns Hopkins said another factor helping Pfizer might be an edge in manufacturing and distribution. “Pfizer has retained the headlines in the news because they have better manufacturing capabilities abilities and so they are making more vaccines.” The New York Times reported that “more than 180 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna have been administered” so far in the rollout as opposed to just 7 million of J&J. These numbers don’t make me personally feel very elite and they arguably make J&J look like the rare limited-edition option.

He also noted that while developing the vaccine Pfizer was already in the midst of a brand overhaul. It recently debuted a new logo that positions it as less consumer-oriented—no more pill shape—and more focused on scientific breakthroughs. He said he is interested to see what Pfizer does with the brand boost it’s gained through its vaccine success—but is surprised it hasn’t really done anything for the company’s stock yet. “Most people would agree that the reputational impact that has been thrust upon Pfizer over the last year has been very positive brand-wise” he said but “there hasn’t been the stock market reaction that you would expect.”

“It’s a lot of Pfizer elitism on there.” — Kimberly Vo

Can the idea of a Pfizer preference be substantiated with I don’t know data? Peter Loewen a professor at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy conducted a study of Canadians’ vaccine brand preferences and found that Pfizer and Moderna were tied at the top of the list with AstraZeneca after a run of its own negative blood-clotting news at the bottom despite its still being quite effective. Loewen’s study was of Canadians who have a different health system and different norms than Americans. But still if they like Moderna just as much how real can the preference for Pfizer be?

It was real enough for McLean the Londoner that he went out of his way to secure the shot. “It’s not like I would have been like ‘I refuse anything but Pfizer!’ but I went the extra mile to get Pfizer” he said. “I actually got two invitations from two separate bits of the health care network. One was from a sort of local community walk-in center and one was in a hospital which was actually much farther away from where I live so it was more of a big deal to go there. But one of the reasons I went with the hospital option was because I had a hunch that they were gonna give out Pfizer and the local place would give the other one.”

For Kimberly Vo a software engineer in the Bay Area who wasn’t yet eligible to make a vaccine appointment when we spoke it’s mostly just an online joke: “It’s this funny lighthearted thing that has sprung up over social media” she said. “My personal perception came mostly from going on TikTok. It’s a lot of Pfizer elitism on there.

“Everyone’s just been bored and we’ve been locked in our houses” she said of the way the vaccines have become personified. “We finally have something that is unifying all of us.” There’s been criticism that all this amounts to “stanning” for pharmaceutical companies players in an industry that is widely acknowledged to be if not flat-out evil at least worthy of skepticism. I would give a little more credit to the memers many of whom I think are playing on that very irony for laughs.

But jokes can shape people’s perceptions as Cox the former state representative discovered. “One of our friends was supposed to get the Pfizer shot but he messed up his order and ended up getting Johnson & Johnson” he said. After so much exposure to Cox’s Pfizer boosterism the friend had a case of PFOMO. “He has not been following a lot of this and so he was like ‘OK but is this one actually worse?’ ” Cox said he reassured his pal that the J&J shot would protect him.

Leininger too came up against the issue not of Pfizer snobbery but J&J sneering recalling one meme in particular. “There’s one that I find disappointing—understandable but disappointing. I saw one that said ‘House J&J: Good enough’ and I was like ‘Oh man!’ As a public health professional I wish that weren’t in the zeitgeist.” And if it wasn’t in the zeitgeist widely before—we spoke before the J&J pause—it sure is now.

As much as he knows “it’s all nonsense” McLean said it could be slightly awkward to compare notes with friends who’d gotten different shots. He recalled trying to comfort a friend who was “downhearted” after getting the AstraZeneca. “It’s a little bit like if you’re comparing exam grades” he told me. He felt like he’d gotten an A with Pfizer while his friend had gotten a B or a C—and he didn’t want to make it worse by rubbing it in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL1Nwb3RsaWdodC9Db3JvbmF2aXJ1cy9TdWdhLWFza3MtUGZpemVyLXRvLXNlbmQtSmFwYW4tYWRkaXRpb25hbC1DT1ZJRC0xOS12YWNjaW5lc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Suga asks Pfizer to send Japan additional COVID-19 vaccines,"WASHINGTON (Kyodo) -- Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga asked U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. on Saturday to provide additional supplies of COVID-19 vaccine to Japan Japanese officials said.

Suga made the request during telephone talks with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla on the last day of his three-day visit to Washington for a White House meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden.

Bourla was quoted by the officials as saying Pfizer would like to promote consultations about the request swiftly and coordinate closely with the Japanese government.

The talks came as Japan trails far behind Britain the United States and elsewhere in providing vaccinations to people.

Japan relies solely on imported coronavirus vaccines and Pfizer's vaccine is the only one the country has approved so far.

During the summit meeting on Friday Suga and Biden agreed to work together to help ensure fair access to coronavirus vaccines for developing countries and facilitate the production of safe effective and affordable vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region including by expanding their manufacturing capacity in India.

Japan only began inoculating about 36 million people aged 65 or older about 29 percent of its population on Monday after beginning its campaign with health care workers on Feb. 17.

Out of Japan's 4.8 million health care workers about 1.1 million or about 0.87 percent of the population had received at least one dose as of April 9 according to the Health Labor and Welfare Ministry.

Orli Sheffey | Student Life

Washington University School of Medicine resumed its vaccination clinic on Friday April. 16 with a new supply of Pfizer vaccines following a pause in distribution of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to all students faculty staff and family members of faculty or staff.

According to Amanda Wilkins director of occupational health at the School of Medicine 500 students faculty and staff had appointments scheduled for April 13 prior to the J&J pause. Nearly all of those appointments were rescheduled for April 16 after the University secured a supply of Pfizer.

“I think that the community has been very understanding and is really flexible with switching from J&J to Pfizer” Wilkins said Friday. “Everybody that was supposed to be here on Tuesday and get J&J has been here today to get Pfizer.”

Approximately 2050 community members had received the J&J vaccine through the University between April 6 and April 12 Interim Senior Administrator at WUSM Dr. Eva Aagaard said.

On the morning of April 13 immediately after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended halting the rollout of J&J Aagaard had an emergency phone call with other health experts at the University. In partnership with Barnes-Jewish Center she requested a redistribution agreement through the state to reroute a supply of the Pfizer vaccine to the University’s vaccination clinic. Within two hours the request was approved. At 10:13 a.m. the University notified the community of both the cancellation of J&J appointments and the plan to resume the vaccine clinic with the Pfizer vaccine.

“We’ve gotten used to this kind of emergency thing” Aagaard said. “We’ve had enough experience with this that we know who the right people are to have a conversation with. It was wonderful that the state was so efficient in approving our redistribution because that can sometimes be a limiting factor.”

Eligible community members who have yet to receive the vaccine are still able to register through the University. As of Friday the University had received 500 doses of Pfizer but that number is expected to increase depending on community demand.

“Every week you make a request for a certain supply of a certain vaccine and then you find out over the weekend whether that supply has been granted” Aagaard said. “It’s always a question in terms of trying to figure out each week… how easy will it be for us to give these shots out? Will people show up?”

Despite the challenge of determining the amount of vaccines to request Wilkins said that no doses have gone to waste since BJC began distributing doses in December.

“We do get a fair share of no shows but we don’t draw up the vaccine unless there are people here” Wilkins said. “Towards the end of the day we slow down what we draw up so that was what prohibited us from being able to or having to waste doses. We have that luxury with having [a] pharmacy on site whereas a lot of the other locations don’t have that.”

Another logistical challenge is that while the J&J vaccine only requires one dose the two doses of the Pfizer vaccine must be administered approximately three weeks apart. With many students already preparing for final exams in the next few weeks Wilkins said it could pose a challenge for students since the second-dose generally has more severe short-term side effects.

In response the University is offering four options for scheduling second doses. Although the CDC recommends administering the two doses of Pfizer 21 days apart Wilkins said that “you can generally do plus or minus a few days.”

“We’ve offered some starting on the 20th day and then we’re going to go until the 26th day” Wilkins said. “That is really what’s recommended and considered safe at this time.”

While many students agreed that the one dose would have been more convenient their main concern was scheduling another vaccine appointment after their J&J appointments were canceled.

“I was honestly just worried that I wouldn’t get another vaccine like they wouldn’t immediately sign me up for another one” junior Christina Chen said. “But other than that I was fine with [the Pfizer vaccine].”

“It would have been easier to get one dose but I also think doing it through the school has made it more organized” graduate student at the Brown School Chloe Lampros-Monroe said. “I had family members who have driven hours to a CVS [to get vaccinated]…I thought I was gonna have to spend hours on websites but they just rescheduled me quickly. It was cool.”

Although many students were willing to get any of the three vaccines approved by federal health agencies Jason Han a chief resident in anesthesiology at Barnes-Jewish Hospital who was volunteering at the clinic said that he was concerned that the pause on J&J would increase vaccine hesitancy. The recommendation to temporarily stop distribution of J&J came after six out of seven million recipients developed blood clots.

“A lot of people probably aren’t going to be aware of exactly why the vaccines were put on hold and would avoid getting vaccinated because of that” Han said. “It’s unfortunate; it’s a small population of folks that are involved. But hopefully they’ll be able to come out with some more evidence and prove that for larger populations it’s still good.”

However Wilkins said that for some the federal health agencies’ decision to pause J&J was reassuring.

“The CDC and FDA are really doing this out of the abundance of caution to make sure that we’re really counting for those people who are vaccine hesitant; because even though [the agencies are] putting a pause on it they want to make sure that it’s still safe and effective for everyone” Wilkins said. “And I think that really shows that they’re willing to do that to make sure that everyone has a safe experience.”

Renee Freeman a registered nurse administering the vaccine on Friday agreed with Wilkins’ view.

“I hope that it’s trust building for people that [federal health agencies] are keeping an eye out and actually taking action in the moment that there could be any type of considered problem with the vaccine because I know there’s a lot of people out there that are very skeptical or very concerned” Freeman said. “I think that this shows that they’re really doing their due diligence to monitor what’s going on with everyone.”

Although it was just Freeman’s first day administering the vaccine with the University she was excited to see a strong turnout on the clinic’s reopening day.

“I am just so happy to see so many people coming out and the relief that people start to feel after they start getting their injections” Freeman said. “I think it can be a little bit more emotional than some people were prepared for.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vZmFjdGNoZWNrLmFmcC5jb20vc2F0aXJpY2FsLWFydGljbGUtYWJvdXQtcGZpemVyLWJpb250ZWNoLWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmUtdXBncmFkZS1taXNsZWFkcy1mYWNlYm9vay11c2Vyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Satirical article about Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine 'upgrade' misleads Facebook users,"Satirical article about Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine ‘upgrade’ misleads Facebook users

Copyright © AFP 2017-2024. All rights reserved.

Facebook posts shared repeatedly by social media users worldwide claim that Pfizer has announced an “upgrade” to its Covid-19 vaccine that includes a “Microsoft chip for reduced symptoms”. The claim is false: the article originated on a satirical website. A search of both Pfizer and Microsoft’s media releases found neither company has announced an “upgrade” to any Covid-19 vaccine.

The claim was shared to a Facebook group here based in Papua New Guinea on April 14 2021.

A screenshot of the post taken April 16 2021.

The post includes a screenshot of this article. The headline reads: “Pfizer Announces COVID-19 Vaccine Upgrade Now Includes Microsoft Chip For Reduced Symptoms”.

The article goes on to claim that Pfizer released a statement saying it had “inked a deal with Microsoft to integrate their Pluton processor chip to reduce symptoms associated with the vaccine”.

The story then goes on to allegedly quote Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella saying: “This is a great revolution in medicine”.

The post’s caption claims Pfizer put “MICROSOFT (BILL GATES) CHIP/NANO TECHNOLOGY IN THE VACCINE”.

Screenshots of the article have been shared around the world here here here and here. The satirical article has been shared hundreds of times including here and here.

According to a note at the bottom of the widely shared article the story was originally published on a website called StonkMarket.

StonkMarket describes itself as a satirical financial news website that aims to “provide daily humor and make stonks go up”. Stonks is a deliberate misspelling of stocks which has become internet slang according to Dictionary.com.

The StonkMarket article includes the same headline and claims as the article shared in the misleading posts as shown in the screenshot comparison below:

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbC02dGgtY2lyY3VpdC10by1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS83MzU5OTQ1NTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: 6th Circuit to hear arguments Thursday,"No commitment required.

Alexander Rossi led the second practice this afternoon for the Honda Indy Grand Prix of Alabama presented by AmFirst at Barber Motorsports Park a session that resembled NTT P1 Award qualifying with a last-lap frenzy of quick times.

Rossi’s best lap of 1 minute 6.0797 seconds in the No. 27 NAPA AUTO PARTS/AutoNation Honda came on the final lap of the 45-minute session.

“It’s all good right now” Rossi said. “We’ve just got to see how the track evolves right now. It’s hotter than this morning.”

Josef Newgarden slowed on the front straight due to a mechanical problem with four minutes remaining triggering the third red flag of the session. That forced Rossi Scott Dixon and a handful of other drivers who had just switched from the Firestone primary black tires to the Firestone alternate red tires to have just one lap with the more grippy reds.

Rossi made the most of it as did Marcus Ericsson who ended up second at 1:06.2190 in the No. 8 Huski Chocolate Chip Ganassi Racing Honda to pace a 2-3-4 performance on the time sheets by Chip Ganassi Racing in this session.

Six-time and reigning NTT INDYCAR SERIES champion Dixon was third at 1:06.3018 in the No. 9 PNC Bank Grow Up Great Honda on his only flying lap on the red tires while first session leader Alex Palou was fourth at 1:06.3204 in the No. 10 SEGI.TV Honda.

Felix Rosenqvist rounded out the top five at 1:06.3948 in the No. 7 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet.

Colton Herta who was second quickest in the first practice this morning was unhurt in an incident 26 minutes into the session. Herta’s No. 26 Gainbridge Honda understeered in Turn 2 and veered off-course and through the gravel trap hitting the outside barrier. Herta was unhurt but his car suffered damage to both left-side wheel-suspension assemblies and the left-front wing.

“I just went too fast” Herta said. “The tires weren’t up to temp and just a little bit of a silly move by me to push it too hard at that point.”

NTT P1 Award qualifying starts at 5:55 p.m. (ET) today on the 17-turn 2.38-mile circuit. Expect the track record of 1:06.6001 set by Sebastien Bourdais in qualifying in 2016 to be smashed as 10 drivers were quicker than that time during the second practice.",,,,,,,,,

In Loving Memory ~

It is with very heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Michael (Mike) Robert Procter 79 of 150 Mile House BC on February 6 2024.

Working for his father's company Procter Electric he worked throughout the Cariboo-Chilcotin and Mike and his father were instrumental in creating novel systems to generate electricity at remote ranches and locations throughout the region.

He moved on to working in the industrial sector and became highly skilled in his trade. High in demand he worked in the construction of new sawmills and in various plants all throughout BC. Later he worked at several local sawmills and contracted throughout the area.

Over all those years Mike made many friendships that endured for the rest of his life.

He went on to marry Cheryl Midnight and they had two children Chris and Jody.

Mike had a penchant for fast cars nice trucks and fine guns. He enjoyed hunting fishing and classic car restoration. He traveled to horse shows throughout BC AB and briefly the US winning many trophies with their champion Arabian show horse Star-Sirza.

In the mid-80's Mike met his life partner Betty Johnson and in the 90's they settled in the 150 Mile area. Mike and 2 good friends purchased the 150 Mile Hotel a rich piece of history in the Cariboo. Together they revived it into the 150 Mile Roadhouse & Pub. For years the establishment was a notable and lively gathering place where many good times were had.

Mike was a hardworking generous man who was always willing to help his friends and family.

He had a great sense of humour he was always up to something and he was entertaining to be around. Throughout his life he was fortunate to have made many friends many acquaintances and to have many great stories to tell. Mike will be sorely missed by his family and friends.

Mike was predeceased by his parents Mary and Peter and his stepfather John Ailport.

He is survived by his life partner Betty brother Chris (Sherri) sister Andrea son Chris (Jenica) daughter Jody (Joey) stepson Bryan (Dawn) three nieces (Susie Mia and Alison) five grandchildren (Jayden Utah Talon Pyper and Keyfer) and many friends.

Mike wished for his ashes to be spread at his favorite mule deer hunting spot a beautiful area overlooking the Fraser River.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Joe Biden’s swift reversals on raising the nation’s refugee cap over the past 48 hours marked a rare moment of uncertainty for the new President within a carefully choreographed first 100 days – one that underscored the power of progressives to force Biden to change course even as they face legislative setbacks in a deeply divided Washington.

Biden sought to calm the uprising within his party during brief remarks to reporters Saturday after playing golf in Delaware. The firestorm followed Friday’s news that Biden would sign an emergency determination keeping the current cap on refugees entering the United States at 15000 this fiscal year a level set by the Trump administration that is far below historical norms and the 62500 the Biden administration had proposed earlier this year.

His Saturday remarks followed various clean-up efforts from the administration on Friday including a late conference call with refugee resettlement advocates where White House officials signaled the President was likely to raise the cap well ahead of the May 15 deadline they’d set hours earlier according a person familiar with the matter.

By way of explanation Saturday Biden hinted at the difficult politics he is facing as his administration attempts to halt the surge of migrants particularly unaccompanied minors across the southern border. He inferred that his plans to raise the cap which he affirmed in a speech in February had been complicated by what he referred to as the “crisis” on the border “with young people” uttering a word that his administration has tried to avoid in relation to the influx on unaccompanied migrant children.

“We’re going to increase the number” Biden told reporters of the refugee cap as he left the Wilmington Country Club. “We couldn’t do two things at once. But now we are going to increase the number.”

Biden’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday that the White House has not determined what that number will be but added that “President Biden’s ultimate target is going to reflect very much his commitment to bringing refugees to the United States to the maximum extent possible consistent with our ability to process them.”

It was a victory for progressives who along with humanitarian groups directed a wave of scorn and fury at the President on Friday the likes of which he has not seen during his nearly three months in office.

Despite the Democratic triumphs of winning the White House and control of the US Senate progressives have watched in frustration this year as many of their key legislative priorities – including voting rights gun control measures and policing reform – have been stalled by the limitations of a 50-50 Senate and their inability to find the 60 votes that are needed to overcome the filibuster.

Though Biden incorporated many progressive anti-poverty objectives into the Covid relief bill that passed through Congress earlier this year a provision raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour – a top priority for the left – did not survive. In such a closely divided Senate the center of the political universe has more often revolved around moderate West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin who has played an outsized role in determining the limits of the Democrats’ legislative agenda as he has rejected the pleas of liberal Democrats to overturn the Senate’s supermajority filibuster rules.

Expecting a break from Trump

The notion that Biden would abandon his campaign promise to raise the historically low refugee cap – a move fully within the powers of the presidency – drew fierce blowback in part because former President Donald Trump’s cap was a symbol of what progressives viewed as the racist and nativist instincts of his administration. Trump often demonized refugees at his 2020 campaign rallies claiming that he would turn swing states like Minnesota “into a refugee camp.”

Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar who fled civil war in Somalia with her family and lived in a refugee camp before ultimately coming to the United States in the 1990s tweeted Friday after the initial news that the administration wouldn’t raise the cap that there were “simply no excuses” for what she referred to as a “disgraceful decision.”

“It goes directly against our values and risks the lives of little boys and girls huddled in refugee camps around the world” she tweeted. “I know because I was one.”

New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reprimanded Biden on Twitter by reminding him that the Democratic coalition that elected him is fragile – and that his vow to “welcome immigrants” led many to vote for him “based on that promise.”

“Upholding the xenophobic and racist policies of the Trump admin incl the historically low + plummeted refugee cap is flat out wrong. Keep your promise” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.

In a sharply worded statement Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington who is the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus said it was “unacceptable and unconscionable” that Biden was going to maintain Trump’s “harmful xenophobic and racist refugee cap.” The decision she added demonstrated that Biden “has broken his promise to restore our humanity.”

It wasn’t just the far left hitting Biden. Many other Democrats including Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin the No. 2 Senate Democrat and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler also slammed the decision. Ultimately White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday afternoon that Biden would set an “increased refugee cap for the remainder of this fiscal year” by next month. But she cautioned that “given the decimated refugee admissions program we inherited and burdens on the Office of Refugee Resettlement his initial goal of 62500 seems unlikely.”

The Biden administration’s equivocation on the refugee cap reflects the heat they are facing about the crisis on the southern border in the middle of a pandemic – and the fear that Americans will conflate the two issues even though they are distinctly different policy areas.

A Quinnipiac poll released last week showed that just 29% of Americans approve of Biden’s handling of the situation at the southern border while 55% disapprove. With no immediate solutions in sight that immigration issue once again looms large for Democrats as they seek to hold onto and grow their congressional majorities in next year’s midterm elections.

White House officials alluded to the linkage between the two issues as the administration backtracked on Friday and Saturday.

Psaki suggested Friday that the Office of Refugee Settlement which is part of the Health and Human Services Department currently has limited bandwidth because some officials are working both on the situation at the southern border and on refugee resettlement issues. That argument however was rejected by refugee resettlement groups that said they had already been preparing for an increase in arrivals. Unlike migrants arriving at the border refugees undergo an extensive vetting and clearing process in preparation for entering the United States and hundreds who had already been approved had their flights canceled because of the delay in raising the cap.

Sullivan said on Sunday that the Biden administration inherited an “absolutely shattered system” to process refugees from the last administration and is trying to fix it. He noted that Biden has already changed the formula set by the Trump administration to allow refugees from Africa and the Middle East to enter the United States but said the President is “allowing refugees to get on planes today.”

As recently as February Biden had spoken about his commitment to alleviating the suffering faced by the more than 80 million displaced people around the world framing it as a moral issue that he planned to confront as President. At that time he said he was approving an executive order that would position the US to raise refugee admissions back up to 125000 during the first full fiscal year of his administration. He noted that America’s “moral leadership on refugee issues was a point of bipartisan consensus” for decades including when he served in the US Senate.

“We offered safe havens for those fleeing violence or persecution” Biden said in that speech at the State Department. “And our example pushed other nations to open wide their doors as well.”

The view that America must take a lead in sheltering the most vulnerable and endangered people around the world is shared by many progressives who swallowed their disappointments when Biden defeated Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary.

Their vociferous response to the administration’s backpedaling on Friday put Biden on notice that when he can use the power of the presidency to begin restoring America’s image as a humane tolerant and benevolent force in the world after four years of Trump they simply aren’t willing to accept the administration’s political excuses or delays – and will hold Biden to the promises he made to win their support.

All-new Ford EVOS defines Ford’s “Progressive Energy In Strength” design philosophy and applies the latest smart technology

Part of Ford’s China 2.0 plan the all-new Ford EVOS is the company’s first vehicle developed largely by a China-based team leveraging Ford’s global product development expertise and designed entirely around the Chinese consumer experience and ownership scenarios.

Ford EVOS is the first vehicle to reflect Ford’s “Progressive Energy in Strength” design philosophy with its innovative silhouette that communicates the agility and dynamic value of a coupe combined with the strength and sense of freedom of an SUV. The connected coast to coast lighting 3D parametric scale grille taillights with scale pattern and more distinctive design elements integrate Ford’s design heritage with Chinese aesthetic values.

Inside the intelligent embraced cockpit bridging the instrument panel and doors unites the entire interior space. On this foundation a 1.1m-wide horizontal screen including a 12.3” digital cluster and 27” 4K touch screen is nested into the soft and stitched instrument panel unfolding an advanced premium digital space.

Similar to the Mustang Mach-E Ford EVOS is equipped with Ford’s all-new Fully Networked Vehicle E/E architecture which supports dynamic quick and seamless over-the-air software updates to enhance product quality capability and customer experience over time.

During long road trips front passengers can enjoy entertainment content on their side of the screen while drivers use navigation functions on their own side. A customized relax mode combines with customized settings for in-cabin audio ambient lighting and seat positions for a truly personalized experience.

With EVOS Ford also plans to provide customers on-demand subscription services through the full-cycle user journey which includes a series of unique customized on-board content and features a more direct real-time owner communication and value-added maintenance service through over-the-air software upgrades.

It now has 60 employees according to its website including political organizers researchers and communications specialists. Mr. Wyss and his charitable foundation are not mentioned on The Hub Project’s website and his role in its creation has not been previously reported.

According to U.S. officials the data was stolen by Russian intelligence from the emails of John Podesta who has been an adviser to Mr. Wyss and was a top aide to the former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.

The Hub Project’s activities include organizing paid advertising campaigns that criticized Republican congressional candidates in 2018 as well as a series of marches in 2017 that called on then-President Donald J.

The new marketplace provides government agencies with a list of preferred suppliers for cloud consulting and cloud technology services. According to the DTA the providers selected are “experts in the cloud landscape” and provide “value-for-money” cloud services and solutions.

Cloud offerings are grouped into two procurement categories: cloud consulting and cloud services. The consulting category enables government buyers to tap cloud consultancies on a rate-card system. The cloud services category includes various IT capabilities offered under “as a service” delivery models.

A total of 348 suppliers have been selected for the marketplace including a number of heavyweight firms such as the Big Four accounting and consulting giants of EY KPMG and PwC mid-tier accountancy-origin firm BDO and global technology-oriented players such as Accenture Publicis Sapient Slalom Thoughtworks Tata Consultancy Services Tech Mahindra and Wipro.

The majority of suppliers are however mid-sized and small Australian enterprises building on the DTA’s policy to keep its third-party procurement as inclusive and varied as possible.

Mutharika was speaking at a news conference on Saturday at his retirement home in Mangochi accompanied by his loyalists who included Bright Msaka Francis Mphepo and Chimwemwe Chipungu.

The former president said he has not endorsed anyone to lead the DPP as people have been speculating arguing the party at an appropriate time in 2023 would have a convention to elect a leader.

Mutharika however said he would not be standing as a presidential candidate during the next party convention.

The former president also took time during the news conference to accuse the current government of running what he called “a cruel system” in which journalists are being abused and arrested.

Mutharika said during his regime he did not allow police to arrest anyone including journalists who were critical of his leadership.

He has since challenged government to allow people exercise their freedoms freely.

The former leader said there was need for Malawians to support the country develop.

He however said the government needs to tread carefully on its policies which are leading to loss of jobs. saying instead of creating one million jobs the Tonse Alliance administration is creating one million poor people.

Mutharika cited incidents in which top companies like Bakhresha are closing operations.

Why Are Americans Still at ...,"This article was produced in collaboration with Berkeley Journalism’s Investigative Reporting Program.

Brittany Liscord was at her job at the Children’s Museum & Theatre of Maine in 2018 when out of nowhere she received a warning from a colleague. It was about the massive petroleum storage tanks near her home.

“It came up that I was a runner in South Portland and I guess he had done some work in another city that had tanks” she said. “He said to me ‘You should be really concerned about the VOCs in your area.’”

Liscord went home and Googled “VOCs” while flashing back to a college introductory class on environmental science where the instructor had talked about the damage air pollutants could do to your lungs. She read that in significant amounts VOCs—volatile organic compounds—could be highly dangerous to health. Now all she could think about was the smell outside her home a noxious stench that on the worst days even made its way inside.

A company called Global Partners owned some of the tanks which stood just a tenth of a mile from where she and her husband Rob Liscord lived and held petroleum products including asphalt and a heavy fuel oil known as No. 6.

“I feel really fearful” Rob Liscord said adding that he gets headaches sometimes after he runs.

On any given day bulk storage tanks around the United States hold more than 2 billion gallons of asphalt or residual fuel much of it No. 6 according to the Energy Information Administration. Some of the tanks sit at refineries but a majority are located at terminals known as tank farms like the ones in the Liscord’s neighborhood in South Portland.

While emissions from petroleum products like gasoline or jet fuel have long been known to be dangerous and are subject to state and federal regulation asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil classified as “heavy refinery liquids” have been largely ignored by regulators because it was thought that their emissions were negligible.

But in an 18-month investigation Inside Climate News found that emissions from heated tanks containing asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil pose a risk to the health of millions of Americans who live close to the tanks one that federal and state regulators have failed to adequately address.

Changes in the petroleum refining process over the last 30 years have resulted in significant emissions from the two products when they are heated in tanks as they must be to keep their contents in liquid form. And these emissions often contain VOCs that can pose a threat to human health in some cases at levels high enough to violate federal clean air standards. The chemicals also combine with other pollutants to form ozone a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.

Yet companies that own the tanks have been routinely underreporting the extent of their emissions because instead of measuring the vapors from tanks they estimate them using a set of equations developed by the petroleum industry and approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

And those equations it turns out are often wrong.

Federal regulators and some industry insiders have known this for more than a decade but have taken no action to mandate that companies report emissions or measure them directly. As a result some states do not even require companies to track emissions from tanks containing asphalt or No. 6 and an overwhelming majority of states that do require it rely on the estimates from the petroleum industry equations.

Only when Inside Climate News began asking questions about the chemicals in the fumes in South Portland did the tanks receive wider public attention. Since then interviews with scientists regulators environmental advocates and government officials and documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act have made clear the national scope of the problem.

Tank farms line waterways across the country providing a critical stop in the distribution chain that brings the petroleum products to consumers. Owned by private companies like Global Partners they are knit into communities often just steps from neighborhoods schools and playgrounds. In South Portland the tanks sit near daycare centers and schools retirement homes and working-class neighborhoods like the one where the Liscords live.

Residents living near tanks that hold asphalt or No. 6 fuel oil have filed hundreds of complaints about noxious smells and reported symptoms—from headaches and breathing problems to cancers and other illnesses—that they worry might be connected to the tanks’ emissions.

The EPA has been aware of the flawed industry formula at least since 2007 when Global Partners disclosed as required by federal law that it had found substantially higher than expected emissions from No. 6 fuel oil tanks.

In a 2007 letter to the EPA and to environmental regulators in Massachusetts Global Partners which owns 25 tank farms around the country said that higher than expected emissions were not just the company’s problem. The higher emissions caused by the refining process changes and the inability of the formula to accurately predict emissions the company wrote were “an industry-wide issue.”

Global Partners’ letter set off an investigation by the EPA’s New England office into heated tanks owned by Global and other companies in the region and eventually led to agreements with two companies Global and Sprague Resources to make changes to address the emissions problem in several cities in the region including South Portland.

But the EPA did not direct its field offices in other parts of the country to look into heated tanks in their regions. And though the agency advised that the estimates based on petroleum industry equations should only be used if direct measurements were unavailable most companies and state regulators continue to rely on the estimates.

Not until late last year did the EPA issue an enforcement alert about the unexpected emissions levels from heated tanks and the flaws in the formula when applied to these kinds of tanks and the agency has taken no action since.

Edward Braczyk the northeast regional permit chief for the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection which worked closely with the EPA on its regional investigation said he had hoped that the agency would go on to take a far more aggressive nationwide look at heated tank emissions.

“It’s a shame” said Braczyk. “We put all this effort in trying to push EPA to do more.”

The routine underestimation of emissions some experts said is not limited to heated tanks but is a symptom of a much larger problem in which emissions from many petroleum sources are estimated rather than measured. Those estimates can be far off the mark indicating much lower—or much higher—emissions than is actually the case. In a 2006 report the Office of Inspector General of the EPA found that 62 percent of the equations used to calculate the estimates had been rated by the agency “below average” or “poor.”

“Everyone involved in the system has known about it. Has known the problems. Has known that shocking revelations are occurring” said John Walke the clean air director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “And yet we continue to live with this broken system and accept these problems these known deficiencies that are underreporting and under-controlling pollution.”

What is a Heated Tank?

Asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil are what is left once crude oil has been heated up and the high-value products like gasoline jet fuel and diesel have been removed leaving the thick sludge at the bottom of a vacuum stack. The sludge is so thick that it has to be heated to become liquid requiring special tanks for storage. And it is so deeply-refined that more volatile products are added back into the tank to make the products useful.

Inside a storage tank asphalt is frequently heated to more than 300 degrees. No. 6 is often heated to 130 degrees. In South Portland as in many ports massive tanker ships arrive with their hulls filled with the products. Pipes carry the liquids from the ships to the tanks. The tanks—typically more than three stories high and 115 feet wide—then hold the product until it’s ready to move on to the next step in the supply chain by truck or train. Historically regulators assumed that asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil products did not produce emissions of any significance just because they were so thick and depleted. The EPA which provides guidance to states on how to enforce the Clean Air Act does not even include asphalt in its handbook for estimating emissions from petroleum tanks although it does include No. 6. These assumptions have contributed to the impression in some states that asphalt and No. 6 oil do not need to be regulated according to the heads of state air agencies.

“To our knowledge the US EPA has not identified tanks storing these products as needing rules” under the Clean Air Act Doug Carr the chief of energy branch of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management air division said. “Therefore ADEM considers these tanks to be insignificant sources of air pollutants and they are not required to hold permits under our permit program.”

But as refineries have gotten better at squeezing every valuable drop out of the more profitable materials higher up in the vacuum stack the sludge at the bottom—what becomes No. 6 fuel or asphalt—has become even more depleted. And with a denser gooier product left behind refineries and terminals have mixed in additives to be able to work with it.

“Imagine you’re moving furniture on a floor and it doesn’t push really well” said John Jechura a chemical engineering professor at the Colorado School of Mines. “If you take a couple of small ball bearings and stick them under the furniture now suddenly you’re rolling.”

Additives—proprietary chemicals or lighter hydrocarbons that would normally be further refined into diesel—are small molecules that disperse among the heavy hydrocarbons that make up the asphalt or No. 6 oil. They can also drive up the vapor pressure leading to more emissions.

Both asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil have been found to produce emissions of VOCs though the emissions from No. 6 fuel oil appear to be greater.

When a team of experts studied emissions from heated tanks in Texas they discovered one reason the estimates were flawed: The vapor pressure for asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil were nearly impossible to determine because the liquids were so thick. As a result equations that estimated emissions by relying on vapor pressure—as the calculations used by most companies do—were at times off by several orders of magnitude because they relied on assumed vapor pressure values that were far too low.

A Broken System

The unexpected emissions that Global Partners discovered were a symptom of a larger problem in how air quality is regulated.

The EPA works hand-in-hand with state agencies to regulate pollutants from all sources. The EPA writes the regulations and for the most part the state agencies implement them.

“The whole giant [Clean Air Act] program as complicated as it is is designed to protect public health and the environment” said Joro Walker general counsel at Western Resource Advocates. “Because it’s so complicated the public really relies on state and federal agencies and sometimes their local air agencies to understand and enforce those requirements whether it’s in permitting or violations or whatever. We rely on those agencies to keep an eye on these facilities and make sure that they’re complying with the law.”

To do that the regulators rely largely on estimated emissions based on complex equations that take into account specifics about the emissions source.

Since 1968 the EPA has published a handbook with guidance for estimating emissions called AP-42. Today the reference document covers more than 200 different sources including heated tanks. Contained within AP-42 are the values or other equations—called emissions factors—used to calculate how much a facility might emit. States grant permits based on those calculations and companies then use the same process to estimate and report their annual emissions to the state.

For decades the EPA also offered a free software program called TANKS specifically for storage tanks that states and companies could use to make the estimates.

The handbook is intended to help regulators assess the emissions in a region not a specific location and it was based on averages not on specific sources of emissions. As a result the EPA handbook specifically states that using the emissions factors to estimate emissions from any specific source “is not recommended by EPA.” Yet across the country that is precisely how they are used.

The handbook’s chapter on storage tanks—heated and otherwise—contains an additional disclaimer: The equations in the chapter were developed by the American Petroleum Institute the largest U.S. trade association for the oil and gas industry.

“It’s in the industry’s best interest to make sure these emissions factors are low” said Ilan Levin the associate director of Environmental Integrity Project a nonprofit group that advocates for the enforcement of environmental laws which has sued the EPA over its emissions factors in the past.

Kirsten Rosselot a chemical engineer who worked on the analysis of vapor pressure and heated tank emissions said “The equations used to estimate the emissions from these tanks have never been validated. Estimates of emissions that are made using these equations don’t prove that emissions from heated tanks are below regulatory thresholds.”

In addition to the potentially flawed estimates that come from using the EPA handbook equations for specific sources TANKS the software the EPA gave to states to use does not take into account the fact that asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil have to be heated above 100°F which makes the products more volatile according to regulators in Texas and sources within the industry.

And the default values the handbook recommended for No. 6 fuel oil—and which some states and companies use for asphalt as well—were written before companies began using additives that have been found to produce higher vapor pressures.

In 2020 the EPA updated the handbook’s equations for heated tanks but it is still unclear whether they are accurate Rosselot said because of how challenging it is to find the actual vapor pressure of these products.

“Even if the equations that are used to estimate emissions work” said Rosselot “their result depends on the vapor pressure of the material being held and there is at present no commercially available way to reliably measure the vapor pressure of the material being held in heated tanks.”

What Happened in Chelsea

The waterfront in Chelsea Massachusetts is littered with oil terminals and industrial polluters. But in the 1990s there was one emissions source considered especially offensive to the city’s residents: asphalt.

Roseann Bongiovanni a lifelong resident of Chelsea said she used to roll her windows up as she drove down Marginal Street past some of the city’s massive asphalt tanks. “It was nauseating” she said. And it was worse for people who lived next door.

“I don’t think I realized what asphalt is—I mean isn’t that what’s on the ground?” said Bongiovanni who got a crash course in that as she helped the city take on the tanks as an 18-year-old freshman at Boston University. Twenty-five years later she is still fighting for clean air in Chelsea as the executive director of the nonprofit GreenRoots.

One of the tank farms in Chelsea was owned by Global Partners the same company that owns tanks in South Portland. In 1997 Global Partners sought to convert some existing tanks used for other products to asphalt and it was one straw too many for Chelsea residents. They teamed up with the city to fight back arguing successfully that the noxious smells from living close to asphalt tanks amounted to a nuisance which allowed the city’s board of health to ban new asphalt tanks from the city.

The board members knew from residents who lived near Global’s tanks that asphalt wasn’t the only problem and they next took aim at No. 6 fuel oil. Ultimately the board required Global Partners to install special equipment on its No. 6 tanks to help control the emissions.

Global opted to use a technology called carbon absorption canisters—equipment that could essentially filter out the pollutants and transfer them onto a solid surface.

“The carbon absorption canisters worked for a while then failed and were replaced and failed again” said Edmund Coletta a spokesman for the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality.

When Global sampled its emissions to figure out what was going on it discovered that the carbon was getting quickly saturated because the levels of emissions were much higher than expected. They were so high that the tank farm should have been considered a “major source” of emissions a designation that comes with heftier federal regulations and a requirement that companies use the best available technology to control their emissions.

In 2007 consultants working for Global Partners discovered that the company had received a shipment of No. 6 oil that “while meeting all of the standard specifications for No. 6 oil contained unexpectedly high levels” of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene hazardous chemicals which have a variety of health impacts.

But the company still did not know if the emissions it was measuring were from a bad batch of No. 6 fuel oil or if they represented a larger issue. According to Global’s letter to the EPA the consultants analyzed samples of No. 6 from “other available sources supplying the region” and found that the basic composition of the product they were receiving was fundamentally different from what it was in the past.

Those changes were resulting in VOC emission levels substantially higher than those predicted by AP-42 calculations” Global’s attorney wrote.

The company’s unexpected findings raised red flags with both state and federal environmental agencies. The EPA’s New England office began inquiries across the region soon after and Global began working with state regulators to find and implement an approved method for dealing with its emissions problem in Chelsea.

Ultimately Global Partners was able to install equipment to mitigate its emissions on its Chelsea tanks and avoid the financial burden of being classified as a major source of emissions. But no definitive health study was conducted to determine whether the emissions from the tanks might have harmed nearby residents.

But outside of Chelsea companies that owned heated tanks including Global Partners were still operating without emissions controls and underreporting their emissions.

An Investigation and Two Settlements

In 2010 in the wake of Global Partners’ discovery in Chelsea the EPA’s New England office sent letters to seven companies in the region asking questions about their heated tanks and informing them that the EPA was investigating whether the companies had violated the Clean Air Act.

Two companies Gulf and Motiva responded that they did not own any heated tanks.

But Global Partners and Sprague which did own heated tanks were asked by the federal agency to measure the actual emissions from the tanks.

The findings were surprising. At Sprague’s terminal in Searsport Maine emissions testing on one of the company’s No. 6 fuel oil tanks discovered emissions that were 500 times what the company had been reporting.

The emissions were still below a federal pollution threshold that would have required additional regulation. But the violations underscored what had been found in Chelsea: Chemicals that could have an impact on public health were being emitted without mitigation or acknowledgement by the company or the regulators.

Both companies contested the method the EPA required for sampling their tank emissions saying it falsely inflated the emissions but the EPA stood by its methodology.

“To my knowledge this is the only time that emissions from heated tanks were directly measured and made publicly available” said Rosselot. And the measurements in Maine she said may provide the only existing data about what the heated tanks that store asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil across the country are emitting.

Elizabeth Hernberg Sprague’s then-managing director for health safety and environment wrote in a 2012 letter to the EPA “The science of estimating #6 oil emissions has up until now been a theoretical approach.” Because of the actions of the EPA’s New England office she wrote “the bulk storage industry is becoming aware of the inconsistencies with TANKS and the #6 oil operating conditions and like Sprague is eager to find a better approach at estimating emissions … The industry nationally faces the same dilemma with potentially much greater significance at the much larger facilities in other parts of the country.”

The results were similar at Global Partners’ terminal in South Portland where the EPA-ordered testing revealed that the potential emissions from the No. 6 fuel oil and asphalt operations there alone exceeded 40 tons per year violating the Clean Air Act and putting the terminal over the threshold for being a major source of emissions that would fall under stricter regulations.

Both Global and Sprague also had been asked by the EPA to hire labs to determine the actual vapor pressure of their products. The sample of No. 6 fuel oil sent to the laboratory by Sprague was found to have a vapor pressure of 0.0083 psi—200 times higher than the default value the petroleum industry included in the EPA handbook at the time and four times higher than an updated figure the manual now includes. Because of the direct relationship between vapor pressure and emissions this was further evidence that the method being used to estimate emissions was inherently flawed.

As the EPA continued its investigation Maine’s state environmental agency in charge of regulating the facilities did little in response to the federal agency’s inquiry. In an October 2015 letter Susan Studlien then-director of the office of environmental stewardship at the EPA’s New England field office wrote to the state’s then-director of the bureau of air quality to express her concern about amendments to Sprague’s permit that had been approved by the state agency.

“I write to inform you of EPA’s view that the license amendments (of which EPA was unaware until after their issuance) fail to correct the underlying violations cited in the NOVs” she wrote referring to the citations or “notices of violation” the company had received. The company Studlien wrote should be using emissions controls on its heated tanks across New England.

In her letter Studlien said she was concerned that the state environmental department was not considering known technology fixes to reduce emissions specifically the technology used by Global Partners on its tanks in Chelsea. But since the EPA did not require companies to install such technology the agency could not force the companies to make the change.

As the years passed a new complication arose according to Braczyk from the Massachusetts DEP who was collaborating with the EPA. “When the Trump administration came in a lot of things just kind of froze” he said.

Processes that typically took weeks or a month took a year instead. “Everything had to get reviewed through the Department of Justice” Braczyk said. “And that’s where everything kind of stalled.”

In 2019 nearly a decade after beginning its investigation the EPA announced a proposed legal settlement with Global Partners. The agency cited Global for Clean Air Act violations at its facility near the Liscords’ home. According to the EPA the company’s asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil operations could have been emitting twice the level of VOCs that its permit allowed a problem that the EPA said went back about a decade.

Global Partners agreed that it would restrict how often its heated tanks ran and how much product they carried that it would add control technology to reduce the emissions and pay $190000 in fines.

“We strive to be good neighbors in all the communities we operate while we deliver the essential energy and products that families businesses and economies need for daily life” said Liz Fuller a spokeswoman for Global Partners. “Safety is the top priority and we operate our facilities under strict oversight from federal and state regulators.

On May 29 2020 the EPA and the state of Massachusetts announced a legal settlement with Sprague over its asphalt and No. 6 operations in Searsport and South Portland Maine; Newington New Hampshire; Everett and Quincy Massachusetts; and Providence Rhode Island. The company was cited for violating the federally enforced state requirements for VOCs and ordered to limit how many heated tanks it could operate and how much product could be processed at each facility to keep the company within its operating permit limits.

“The Consent Decree is now finalized and subject to coming to a consensus with the town and DEP we will obtain any necessary permits construct the approved solution and build a timeline for implementation” said Shana Hoch Sprague’s Managing Director Marketing & Customer Experience.

A Half-Hearted Pursuit

As EPA’s New England office investigated emissions at tank terminals around the region the office provided updates to the federal agency’s headquarters in Washington according to Dave Deegan a spokesman for the regional office. But it is unclear how far the EPA has pursued the issue in other parts of the country.

In response to questions an EPA spokeswoman said that in addition to the investigation of Global and Sprague in New England it has in progress “initial investigations of other sources.” The spokeswoman did not elaborate on where those cases were but Freedom of Information Act requests filed with the agency indicated that only two of the nine other EPA regional offices had taken any actions related to heated tanks.

In July 2019 inspectors in the Great Lakes regional office made an unannounced inspection at the Waterfront Petroleum Terminal in Detroit which had four heated tanks containing asphalt and five tanks containing No. 6 fuel oil. Using an infrared camera inspectors observed unexpected levels of VOCs being emitted from the vents of one asphalt tank and one No. 6 fuel oil tank. A spokesman for the regional office did not respond to questions about whether the agency took any punitive action or if the investigation was ongoing.

In EPA’s south central region investigators requested information from and visited the Houston Fuel Oil Terminal in 2015 which owned 128 tanks along the Houston Ship Channel some of which contained No. 6 fuel oil. The investigators found elevated levels of VOCs coming from the tanks. “We would not expect to see VOC emissions coming from a tank containing low vapor pressure liquids that is not in the process of filling” inspectors wrote in a 2015 report. More than five years later according to the EPA the investigation is ongoing.

In November 2020 after the legal settlements with Global Partners and Sprague the EPA published an enforcement alert titled “EPA Reminder About Inappropriate Use of AP-42 Emissions Factors” acknowledging what the agency had found in Maine and other states in its New England region.

In a four page memo the EPA reiterated its warning that the standard method for estimating heated tanks emissions—the petroleum industry’s equations included in the EPA manual—should not be used for specific sites.

The emissions and vapor pressure testing conducted in Maine in 2012 and 2013 the agency wrote “suggested that in those cases the use of the default vapor pressure in [the manual] had resulted in emissions estimates that were understated by a factor of 100 for permitting and reporting purposes.”

The memo went on to recommend a series of steps a company could take to ensure accurate emissions reporting including continuous emissions monitoring and the use of infrared cameras. In a list descending from most to least accurate the petroleum industry emissions estimation method in the manual was at the bottom.

“Remember AP-42 emission factors should only be used as a last resort” the memo said in bold font referring to the EPA manual adding “Even then the facility assumes all risk associated with their use!”

But the EPA still did not ban the use of the estimation method and not surprisingly given the costs of direct testing and measurement companies—and most states—have continued to use it.

A Patchwork of Regulations

When Inside Climate News surveyed regulators from air quality agencies in all 50 states a majority said that they relied on the industry equations included in the manual for estimating emissions and did not use direct site-specific measurements. Many also said they used the EPA TANKS program to calculate emissions from tanks containing asphalt or No. 6 fuel oil a method that cannot accurately estimate heated tank emissions.

In Arkansas for instance the communications manager for the state Department of Energy and Environment said they used the TANKS program because it “accounts for heated tanks.” But even the EPA—the creator of TANKS—has said that the program does not provide accurate estimates. The federal agency stopped updating the software in 2014 after finding that it was flawed.

Some states like Connecticut said that they did not even keep track of where tanks containing asphalt and No. 6 fuel were located because they assumed the emissions were negligible. “We have very little information on where a No. 6 oil tank would be located because historically the emissions were presumed to be so low as to not trigger any of our registration or permitting processes which would cause us to follow or track their emissions” said Jaimeson Sinclair the director of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection’s engineering section.

And while technology exists that could reduce the emission of VOCs—perhaps by as much as 99 percent—a recent review by the state of Maine found “the majority of tanks of this type being operated in the United States do not utilize any type of add-on control equipment to reduce emissions.”

In a few states though regulators have taken a keen interest in heated storage tanks.

In Texas for example state regulators in the early 2000s launched investigations into what’s known as the emissions gap—the difference between the amount of VOCs they expected based on known sources and the amount they found when they sampled the air. That allowed the regulators to pinpoint problems—flaring for instance—and try to close the gap. But even after resolving those problems a gap remained.

The Texas regulators suspected a possible reason for the discrepancy: The faulty assumptions about heated tanks and the vapor pressure of their products. They hired a team of researchers from the University of Texas including Rosselot to study the issue and in studies published in 2014 and 2015 they affirmed that emissions from heated tanks were almost certainly being undercounted and that the tanks were likely contributing to the emissions gap.

Russ Nettles a technical specialist with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality took particular interest in the issue. Nettles who died in 2017 began sounding an alarm about emissions from heated tanks at EPA conferences and in national industry workshops held in Texas. Emissions from heated tanks were being under-counted he said and the tools being used to estimate them—the petroleum industry equations in the EPA manual and the TANKS program—were wrong.

Nettles’ efforts resulted in some changes in Texas including the state dropping the use of the TANKS program and stressing that companies should test for the true vapor pressure of their products rather than using default values when possible. But the guidance echoed that of the EPA in saying that when site-specific monitoring was not available companies could use the petroleum industry equations in the agency’s manual to estimate emissions instead.

Asked about the continued use of the petroleum industry formula in most states the EPA spokeswoman said “We would recommend that States consider requiring testing to obtain more accurate emissions factors given that the Sprague and Global matters suggest the emission factors are not accurate.”

Is Our Health at Risk?

With few actual measurements of what is being emitted from the tanks residents who live near heated tanks like the Liscords in communities like South Portland are left wondering whether it is safe to breathe the air around them.

“People who live work and play downwind of heated tanks holding heavy refinery liquids are right to be concerned about the potential health effects of their exposure to the emissions from these tanks” said Rosselot who was among the team of experts who studied heated tank emissions in Texas at the request of state regulators.

While it has long been known that volatile organic chemicals like benzene and toluene in significant amounts can have serious health impacts virtually no research exists on the possible effects on human health of the VOCs emitted by heated tanks and the few studies that have been conducted have not been without controversy.

In 2007 for example the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) issued a report on health risks from asphalt emissions in response to years of complaints from communities across the country that were exposed to asphalt fumes.

The agency’s investigations primarily focused on asphalt plants in Arizona California Georgia New York North Carolina and Utah in the years from 1998 to 2004 but in one location—Salisbury North Carolina—the researchers looked at a tank farm. The terminal in Salisbury had been a source of hundreds of odor complaints from 1997 to 2001 from residents living near the tank farm and an asphalt plant and the state and county health agencies cited a high incidence of serious health problems in nearby residents and workers.

The agency investigators evaluated samples of tank emissions taken over the course of four months six years earlier in 2001. The study’s authors found that the chemicals contained in asphalt emissions from the tank did not exceed federal safety levels and did not pose a threat to public health. But the investigation was conducted after Associated Asphalt the company that owned the tanks had already installed technology to mitigate emissions.

Given the limited nature of the samples and the fact that the company had taken steps to control emissions the study’s findings did not instill much confidence in residents there.

No other direct study of the effect of emissions from heated asphalt tanks could be located but a handful of studies from federal agencies have looked at how workers who were exposed to asphalt fumes through their jobs were affected. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration lists headache skin rash sensitization fatigue reduced appetite throat and eye irritation cough and skin cancer as symptoms of asphalt exposure on its website.

When the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked into occupational exposure to asphalt in 2000 the study’s authors found that complaints of eye nose and throat irritation were common among workers who performed different kinds of jobs using asphalt including road paving shingle manufacturing and work at hot-mix plants and terminals. Some workers also reported skin irritation nausea headaches and fatigue. These reactions were found in workers whose exposure was below OSHA’s allowable limits. Some studies indicated elevated rates of lung bladder kidney brain and liver cancer among workers but the researchers were unable to draw a direct causal relationship.

The asphalt plant workers in the study were likely to have been exposed to higher levels of fumes than people who live near heated asphalt tanks. But the workers also went home at the end of the day while for residents who live near tanks the fumes are constant.

A subset of VOCs called Hazardous Air Pollutants or HAPs have been linked with symptoms like headaches and breathing problems in the short-term and some cancers and neurological problems in the long-term.

Exposure to high levels of the HAP benzene for example has been linked to acute myeloid leukemia and women who were exposed to high levels for an extended period had irregular menstrual periods and decreased ovary size. An acute exposure to benzene at very high levels can be fatal.

“Benzene is a known carcinogen thus there is no safe dose” said Joan Casey an environmental epidemiologist at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health.

But different states have different bars for what exposure level is considered acceptable.

The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention sets the bar for benzene at 0.4 parts per billion. At that level of ambient exposure there is an incremental lifetime cancer risk of 1-in-100000 over what would normally occur in the general population according to the state. In Massachusetts the allowable ambient exposure limit is much lower—0.03 parts per billion—a level associated with an incremental lifetime cancer risk of 1-in-1000000.

In South Portland Unsettled Questions

The Liscords considered buying a few different houses before they landed on the white craftsman style home on Reynolds Street in South Portland. It felt just right: It had an ideal layout it would be easy to make energy-efficient and it was on a street with friendly neighbors who said it was a good place to raise kids.

But that was before they knew about the smell. Once they moved in it was unavoidable on many days. When the EPA’s settlement with Global Partners—and later with Sprague—was announced their fears only grew.

The idea that Global’s tank emissions were so high in a place surrounded by tightly-knit neighborhoods came as a shock. That the EPA had been investigating this for nearly a decade without notifying residents only deepened the concern.

And though the EPA had determined what was being emitted by the tanks it did not study how those emissions might be affecting people who lived or worked or went to school near them. That work was left up to the state.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has had a network of monitors studying the air near the South Portland tanks since November 2019 and has found levels of naphthalene—a VOC that can cause respiratory and neurological problems—2.5 times the ambient exposure limit set by the state. But residents say the monitors are too far from the tanks to truly reflect what is coming from them and the state appears to agree—after more than a year of monitoring it has plans to move four of the monitors closer to the tanks.

There is reason to believe those monitors will find higher levels of VOCs. After the agreement between the EPA and Global Partners was announced in 2019 the state supplied air canisters to volunteers in South Portland who took samples of the air that were then analyzed in a state lab. Though not a rigorous scientific study the grab samples taken outside homes near the tanks found spikes of benzene as high as 5.8 and 8 times the state’s ambient air guidelines.

When Maine’s state toxicologist Andy Smith presented the initial findings at a City Council meeting in December 2019 he noted that the spikes found in the citizen-led samples did not rise above the acute risk threshold for the state meaning that a short exposure at that level would not be expected to have health impacts.

The International Liquid Terminals Association the trade association for tank terminals has downplayed the findings in the grab samples. “It’s unlikely that the storage tanks at terminals are a significant source of naphthalene emissions” said spokeswoman Cathy Landry. “Most airborne emissions of naphthalene result from the combustion (not storage) of petroleum products.” She also pointed to a statement from Maine regulators indicating that it’s not appropriate to use grab sample data to extrapolate about longer term levels.

Residents like the Liscords though worried that the spikes found in the citizen-led samples represented what they were breathing all day every day.

Daycare owners Gina Kostopoulos and Annmarie Marshall were concerned that the emissions might explain the headaches staff workers complained about on days when the air was thick with petroleum smells. And across a small cove from Global’s tanks Barbara Saulle wondered whether the fumes that regularly filled her home could have caused her miscarriages her migraines or two sons’ inexplicable liver disorders.

In community meetings over the last year and a half—held in person or and more recently virtually—residents have pressured state regulators to require more monitoring including 24/7 fenceline monitoring around the emissions sources and the use of more technology to control the emissions.

South Portland residents said that as a result of the settlements with both companies they have some reasons to celebrate including the pending installation of emissions control technology at Global Partners and Sprague facilities new state recommendations related to the use of infrared cameras to detect vapor leaks and emissions testing for new and modified heated tanks.

But unlike Massachusetts which now bans the use of the petroleum industry equations in estimating storage tank emissions Maine continues to allow it. A recent state report recommended against the use of continuous monitoring at the tanks or monitoring along the perimeter of the facilities also known as fenceline monitoring.

The Liscords say they want to stay in their home in South Portland but as they think about having kids they’re not sure it’s safe for them to stay there. They’re not sure they can go either.

“If we move someone else is going to live in this house” said Brittany Liscord. “The reality is people still live here.”

And that's because Apple is expected to be using its own ARM-based M1 processors in its new iMacs as well. The two models which are the 21.5-inch and the 27-inch respectively are reportedly codenamed J456 and J457 according to a report from Bloomberg.

However last month 9to5Mac discovered a couple of new Apple iMac device IDs dubbed ""iMac211"" and ""iMac212"" in the macOS Big Sur 11.3 beta update. While we do not know for sure if these new IDs are the same as those stated in the Bloomberg report what we can say is that a Geekbench run of the iMac 211 model was spotted today by a Twitter user who aptly calls himself 'Leakbench'. While leaked Geekbench scores themselves aren't always reason enough to get excited over what really caught our attention is the bizarre and uncanny processor that is seemingly powering the system.

The iMac 211 seems to be powered by an ""ARM Qualcomm"" eight-core processor however it is being detected as a Genuine Intel CPU. The motherboard too is seemingly being detected as an ""Intel Corporation iMac211"". The test was conducted on the macOS Big Sur 11.1 build 20C69.

Geekbench often reports clock speeds incorrectly so it's best not to look at that to determine final specifications however other details like the cache amount or cores are more reliable numbers and are much more unlikely to ever change. The processor appears to be an octa-core ARM chip just like Apple's own M1. However The M1 which is reportedly powering this year's 21.5-inch iMac model vastly outperforms this unknown CPU in Geekbench with nearly double the scores suggesting that the iMac211 may be a different product entirely.

But it must be said that we are talking about a potentially unfinished part and probably best not to look too much into these numbers. Regardless here's how the new weird CPU has performed.

Apple is set to hold its Spring event in four days on April 20 and it's possible that the company talks about the upcoming iMac line. The 21.5-inch iMac seems to be running out of supply and that may be in anticipation to the arrival of next-gen models.

According to boAt's co-founder Sameer Mehta the relationship would contribute to greater technology collaboration quicker deployment and refining of the product portfolio across price points.

It should be noted that before this in January boAt had also raised $100 million from New York-based private equity major Warburg Pincus at the same valuation.

The company has doubled its employee strength to 150 in the last year and has also established a local R&D unit in Bengaluru.

The former is expected to be completed in 2022 and employ 3000 engineers.

The South Korean giant also has other R&D centers in Vietnam to research into mobile devices household electrical appliances artificial intelligence and data analysis.

The Qualcomm R&D center opened in June last year in Hanoi with four laboratories for developing wireless technologies (4G 5G) and camera technologies and boosting the performance of mobile device batteries. It has around 50 engineers all of them Vietnamese.

The Samsung facility will develop smartphones for the Southeast Asian market and software for Australia New Zealand and Europe and serve as a 5G network testing hub.

Others have also chosen Vietnam to set up R&D centers including ride-hailing company Grab (in HCMC) South Korean tech giant LG Electronics (Hanoi and Da Nang) and Japan’s Toshiba and Panasonic (Hanoi).

Samsung also has 11 labs in Vietnamese universities to conduct collaborative education programs and enable students to take part in research into mobile phone technologies.

Many students have gone on to become researchers at the company.

Vu Thanh Thang vice chairman of cybersecurity firm BKAV said the trend of tech giants setting up R&D centers in Vietnam shows the country ""has the ability to take part in high value-added activities in the global value chain.""

Vietnam is now in a golden demographic period with 45 percent of its population being under 30 years of age which is attractive to global companies he said.

But this trend is causing difficulties to local tech companies since they have to compete with global giants to attract talent he pointed out.

He suggested that instead they should proactively train their own R&D engineers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbmFuY2lhbGV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2xpZmUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS1zYW1zdW5nLWdhbGF4eS1zMjAtZmUtNWctcmV2aWV3LW1vcmUtdmFsdWUtdGhhbi1vbmVwbHVzLTktMjIzNTAwNS_SAXhodHRwczovL3d3dy5maW5hbmNpYWxleHByZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlL3RlY2hub2xvZ3ktc2Ftc3VuZy1nYWxheHktczIwLWZlLTVnLXJldmlldy1tb3JlLXZhbHVlLXRoYW4tb25lcGx1cy05LTIyMzUwMDUvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G review: More value than OnePlus 9,"The Galaxy S20 FE is possibly the best phone that Samsung has ever made. The S20 FE which was launched last year to bring “premium Galaxy smartphone experiences” to more people nails the fundamentals so well it gives OnePlus even Apple something to think about.

For some curious reason only the LTE version of the phone was available in India all this time. The 5G S20 FE has arrived nearly six months after global debut. Some might say it was mighty brave of Samsung to launch it at all but there is another way to look at it.

Samsung knew it had a solid product that it could bank on to play as a stopgap until the S21 FE came along. To do what you ask? Well to spoil OnePlus’s party what else?

There is no doubt that the S20 FE 5G is Samsung’s answer to the OnePlus 9 (as the S20 FE 4G was to the OnePlus 8T) and while spec-nerds will find it hard to believe the phone makes a lot of sense despite its late entry and seemingly old hardware. If anything the best phone that Samsung ever made just got better—in India.

Breaking the habit

On paper there are only two differences between the S20 FE 5G and S20 FE 4G. The chipset and modem. The S20 FE 5G packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor and a second-generation X55 modem bringing support for Sub-6 bands in 9 different frequencies. The S20 FE 4G has Exynos 990 and the Exynos Modem 5123 accompanying it though it is 5G ready has been locked at LTE.

While 5G may not necessarily be a huge deciding factor for many buyers a flagship-grade Qualcomm chip surely is given Samsung’s unbendable perseverance to launch only Exynos-based premium S- and Note-series phones in India. The S20 FE 5G (like the S10 Lite) breaks with convention in that sense.

The Snapdragon 865 is based on TSMC’s N7P (DUV) manufacturing process and has an 8-core CPU with one ARM Cortex-A77 Prime core clocked at 2.84GHz three Cortex-A77 cores clocked at 2.42GHz and four ARM Cortex-A55 cores clocked at 1.8GHz. The Exynos 990 is based on a more advanced 7nm LPP (EUV) manufacturing process but the Snapdragon 865 uses more advanced (and more powerful) cores. Exynos 990 also has a larger die size. In other words the Snapdragon 865 is theoretically faster and more power efficient. The Qualcomm chip has the GPU advantage too.

All this translates into slightly better all-round performance in day-to-day tasks with real noticeable gains coming in while gaming. Compared to S20 FE 4G the S20 FE 5G feels snappier and can maintain steadier frame rates more consistently during graphics intensive gaming. It is also better at heat management and does not break a sweat unless you’re really stress testing it with a heavy game like Genshin Impact – which by the way has a tendency to stutter every now and then at peak setting but then that game is just too intense anyway.

That’s where the OnePlus 9’s next gen Snapdragon 888 unsurprisingly shines. But aside from that you will have to be as observant as Sherlock to pinpoint the differences. The S20 FE 5G is by no means a slouch despite its one-year-old hardware. OnePlus gives you more RAM (up to 12GB) and storage (up to 256GB) options but Samsung offers hybrid micro-SD expansion on top of 8GB RAM and 128GB storage.

The S20 FE 5G has marginally better battery life as well. Like the S20 FE 4G the S20 FE 5G also has a 4500mAh battery. I have been averaging 5-6 hours of screen on time with the phone’s display cranked up to 120Hz (at auto brightness) which is a respectable figure but of course your mileage may vary. Where the OnePlus 9 supports 65W fast charging Samsung is sticking with 25W and shipping a 15W charger in the box. But while the S20 FE 5G supports 15W wireless as well as reverse wireless charging the OnePlus 9 can’t do either.

If it ain’t broke

There is no telling the S20 FE 5G apart from the 4G model on the outside because they are virtually the same phones. It has the same matte polycarbonate back available in a slew of playful colours – including this minty fresh variant I have for review – with a metallic frame. It looks exactly like the S20 but obviously Samsung has watered it down to cut cost. But it has not cut any corners at least none that are deal-breakers.

The phone looks and feels high-quality and original even as OnePlus phones start to look more and more like a Samsung Galaxy with every new iteration. The OnePlus 9 may have a better in-hand feel but the S20 FE 5G is hands down a better designed phone with just the right amount of elegance and practicality. It does not attract a lot of smudge and fingerprints. It is also IP68-certified for dust and water resistance.

The 6.5-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display of the S20 FE 5G is easily among the best in the business with ample brightness levels and rich colours. It is also very fluid – a term OnePlus likes to use to market its version of AMOLED – courtesy a 120Hz refresh rate though this is not adaptive (or dynamic) like Samsung’s more expensive S- and Note-series phones. The display is flat and has significantly more bezels in comparison but all this bodes well for content consumption while giving you enough breathing space to rest your palms while doing it – it is not a compromise. The S20 FE 5G supports HDR10+ content playback and has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection. The optical in-display fingerprint scanner is iffy and perhaps the phone’s weakest link.

The OnePlus 9 has largely similar credentials but if I were to pick one OnePlus offers a slightly better package when it comes to calibration and tuning. The OnePlus 9’s display can get tad brighter and has Corning Gorilla Glass 5. It has a faster more accurate fingerprint reader too (though it suffers from its own challenges particularly lower-than-usual positioning).

The difference isn’t like night and day though. If anything most users would likely pick the S20 FE 5G because it is a little punchier. Content really pops out on it.

The real differences lie in the cameras. The two phones take two vastly different trajectories in approach and subsequently the output. While OnePlus has gone with high-profile Hasselblad branding and high-resolution sensors Samsung’s take is a lot more subdued but one that makes use of years of experience.

The S20 FE 5G has a more versatile camera setup among the two. It has a 12MP primary sensor behind a 26mm wide f/1.8 aperture lens with Dual Pixel PDAF and OIS. This is paired with another 12MP sensor behind an f/2.2 aperture ultra-wide-angle lens and 8MP telephoto camera.

The phone’s main camera shoots consistently good photos in good light with warm and pleasing – if a little oversaturated – colours lots of detail and excellent dynamic range. The OnePlus 9’s main 48MP camera shoots more natural-looking photos in contrast. Both phones are well stacked-out and there is no clear winner here to be honest.

OnePlus pulls ahead with better ultra-wide-angle performance across the board including spot-on edge correction on the back of a freeform lens. But Samsung offers more zoom which is also sharper. Optically the S20 FE 5G can only go as far as 1.1x but 3x hybrid zoom photos are serviceable. On paper it can shoot up to 30x zoom photos (up to 10x in low light/night mode) but that is just software overkill.

The S20 FE 5G’s cameras really come into their own in low light. Samsung’s night mode offers brighter more detailed photos in tricky and low light. The same is true about the phone’s portrait mode. Samsung’s phone is just better at subject isolation and creates a nice creamy background blur in photos across all lighting scenarios.

The S20 FE can’t do 8K video recording if you are into that sort of thing. 4K @30fps 60fps videos shot with the phone are sharp have lots of detail and offer excellent all-round stabilisation. The OnePlus 9 metes out slightly better results though audio recording is better on the S20 FE 5G.

On the front the phone has a 32MP camera which clicks nice and detailed selfies in most lighting scenarios – better than OnePlus 9.

The big picture

The S20 FE 5G’s biggest draw is software and support. Samsung now offers three major Android updates on select devices. Samsung says people are holding onto their devices for longer and it simply wants to extend the life cycle of its Galaxy products while providing the latest innovations “as soon as they are available”. This is a big step up from say three or four years ago when the company was infamous for software update rollout delays.

Tables have turned when it comes to OnePlus phones. Not only has OxygenOS started to look more and more like OneUI but it’s also riddled with bugs and delays. OnePlus phones aren’t the holy grail of high-quality software experience the way they used to once upon a time.

The S20 FE 5G is a classic example to show off the “new Samsung”. The phone launched globally in late September-early October last year with Android 10. It has launched in India with Android 11. Samsung has confirmed to Financial Express Online that it is eligible for two more OS updates. My review unit is already rocking the April security patch. The sheer frequency of Samsung rolling out fixes (like the latest one improves the stability of touch screen an issue I haven’t had on my unit but many users have been reporting about it) has gone up significantly over the last one year.

Not just updates Samsung’s software has also improved by leaps and bounds and even though there is still a lot of bloatware (and a few ads here and there) the experience is unobtrusive and efficient.

Verdict

Samsung has launched the S20 FE 5G in India at an introductory price of Rs 47999. Not only has it undercut OnePlus in pricing the S20 FE 5G also offers more value over the OnePlus 9. Heck it is a better buy than the S21 as well.

All this just goes to show how important nailing the fundamentals is. At this point the only reason to get the OnePlus 9 is the new Snapdragon 888 processor and probably its more powerful ultra-wide-angle camera. Had OnePlus launched the global variant in India the one that it is selling in the US for instance with wireless charging and IP68-certfication maybe just maybe things would have been different.

Regardless the S20 FE 5G is a no-brainer and a really good product despite the growing competition including ones from Vivo and Xiaomi. One that gets you more bang for the buck yet manages to impress with all-round premium look and feel.

Pros: Premium fit and finish IP68-certification Fast 120Hz display Fast performance with storage expansion Wired and wireless charging available Excellent software support Stereo speakers

Cons: Iffy fingerprint reader Haptics could be better

On both nights of the two-night spectacular WWE sold a limited number of tickets. This was to ensure fans could attend in a safe and socially distant manner. With an estimated potential attendance of 75000 fans under normal conditions for WWE in the stadium. Tickets were capped with just over 25000 available for each night. Both Saturday and Sunday achieved sell-outs with 25675 fans officially attending both nights of WrestleMania.

WWE said of that success:

“For the second consecutive night a sell-out of 25675 fans attended WrestleMania at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Bay FL with millions more watching at home on Peacock in the U.S. and on WWE Network around the world. Two sell outs with a combined 51350 fans attended both nights of WrestleMania at Raymond James Stadium.” “Adhering to local health guidelines a limited number of tickets were sold for both nights of WrestleMania with all in attendance seated in socially-distanced pods. Additional safety measures included health screenings and temperature checks prior to entry into Raymond James Stadium mask requirements social distancing mobile ticketing cashless concessions and enhanced sanitization throughout the venue.”

A new report from Justin Barrasso of Sports Illustrated indicates that WWE could be ready to repeat the feat at SummerSlam. The August event could have fans in attendance with SI reporting that WWE sources have confirmed that’s the plan.

Prior to WrestleMania the 9th of March 2020 was the last time WWE had fans in attendance. Raw and SmackDown have since made their home in the impressive WWE ThunderDome. While NXT has emanated from the Capitol Wrestling Center.

‘The Biggest Party Of The Summer’ was held in 2020 at the WWE ThunderDome in front of no fans. The main event saw The Fiend defeat Braun Strowman for the WWE Universal Championship. Following that match Roman Reigns made his return to WWE after several months by attacking both men.

Reflecting on the defeat Patrick Mahomes recently came out and said that he feels facing defeat will end up helping him more than success.

Mahomes’ comment is one that could be taken up as a topic for debate. Does losing really help one more than winning? One NFL analyst clearly does not agree with Patrick Mahomes’ train of thought.

Patrick Mahomes must focus on his successes

During a recent segment of Speak For Yourself NFL analyst Marcellus Wiley weighed in on the comments made by Patrick Mahomes.

“In my mind let’s just say this. The most efficient optimal model of behavior is to learn from your pattern of successes more so than your failures.

“Why? Because when you try to learn from your failures all you’re doing is looking at something bad that happened and it’s jarring. And it makes you re-evaluate correct?” said Wiley.

The analyst said that building on a winning mentality will only further give the push needed to achieve success.

“But when you win and you’re trying to like build off of your successes. You’re using that positive momentum. And it’s more encouraging.

“And also guess what it is it’s easier to snowball. That’s why the rich get richer. That’s why success begets success” he added.

Further talking about its role in the NFL Wiley said that it is only success that can help a player tap into the zone.

“Have you ever been in the zone when you are playing in the game? What gets you into the zone? Success. Failure doesn’t get you into the zone failure gets the doubt birds flying over your head” he said.

The Bucs quarterback began his day in New York spending time with his oldest son Jack before flying to South Florida to cheer Inter Miami and co-owner (and friend) David Beckham host the LA Galaxy in Major League Soccer.

Finally he jetted up to Tampa and drove his truck to Innisbrook Golf Resort for the Arians Family Foundation dinner and concert.

“It’s kind of the only thing that slows me down in life” Brady said Sunday night of the left-knee surgery he had less than two months ago. “It’s something like that. I’m cool with it. It’s just part of what you deal with. Things come up and you deal with them the best way you can. The best opportunity to get better and improve and I’m definitely feeling a lot better than I did six or seven weeks ago.

“You know it’s rehab. None of that is fun but I’m looking forward to getting back to real training and stuff which is hopefully here pretty soon.”

It was about a year ago that Brady having just signed a two-year $50 million contract with the Bucs organized workouts at Berkeley Prep in Tampa for about a dozen of his new teammates and one familiar old one tight end Rob Gronkowski.

Gronk arrived Sunday night just ahead of Brady and was joined by outside linebacker Jason Pierre-Paul and members of Bruce Arians’ coaching staff. A golf tournament is scheduled for Monday weather permitting.

The Bucs have voted not to participate in any voluntary in-person workouts at the team facility because of concerns surrounding the coronavirus according to a statement released on the NFL Players Association website.

Of course Brady and his teammates didn’t follow the NFLPA’s advice to stop their impromptu workouts a year ago.

It’s clear that the 43-year-old seven-time Super Bowl winner wants to resume throwing as soon as he’s done rehabbing his knee and cleared to begin football activities. Arians has said that likely will be in June. Brady didn’t disagree.

“We’ll just take it and see how we go and see how things play out over the course of the offseason” he said. “A lot of things come up and change over the course of the offseason and we have a lot of hard-working guys. Guys will be anxious to get together and get to work.

“As soon as I’m ready to go out and throw that will be really important for me. That’s always been a big part of my preparation actually doing what my job is. I try to teach the younger players it doesn’t matter going in and doing pullups and you know doing cross-fit games and scaling walls. What matters is being a good football player. That’s doing your job and whatever that entails for you. Whether that’s at receiver running back linebacker — do your job. That’s the best way to ultimately prepare to be a great player.”

Brady tore his anterior cruciate ligament in the same knee in the 2008 season opener against the Chiefs.

Clearly this injury is not as serious. Besides Brady’s learning curve won’t be nearly as big as it was a year ago.

It took until Week 14 but Brady finally became comfortable in Arians’ offense. After a 7-5 start the Bucs won their last eight games including four in the postseason culminating with a 31-9 victory over the Chiefs in Super Bowl 55 at Raymond James Stadium.

Brady finished the regular season with 4633 yards passing 40 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He added 10 TD passes and three interceptions in the playoffs.

Brady has a better feel for his teammates as all 22 starters from the Super Bowl victory return. The list includes Gronkowski running back Leonard Fournette and receiver Chris Godwin who received the team’s franchise tag.

“What’s it say? I think everyone is excited” Brady said of the club’s ability to keep the band together. “You know eight weeks ago we just finished. So it feels like we’re still a lot closer to the end of last season than we are to the beginning of the next one. But at the same time there’s always an itch to get started and get preparing. A lot of football players like staying in shape year-round and getting together.

“B.A. (Arians) had some amazing points he gave us all year ... our commitment to one another and discipline and following through with a lot of things we had to do over the course of last season. I’m sure things will be a lot different this season. Every year is very different. Every year has different challenges. You know we’ll see what we can make of it.”

Sunday’s event at Innisbrook was the first gathering of some Bucs players and coaches since the Super Bowl boat parade in Tampa in February. The Lombardi Trophy which an “avocado-tequila” intoxicated Brady tossed across the Hillsborough River was prominently displayed at Sunday’s event.

“I feel pretty good and I push myself pretty hard. I don’t know if I can go this week but we’ll see how things play out” Brady said smiling.

Over 25000 fans were in Raymond James Stadium for WrestleMania 37. A new report has noted that WWE are planning to feature live fans during the Biggest Party of the Summer.

According to Justin Barrasso of Sports Illustrated WWE are currently planning for fans to attend SummerSlam 2021. The date and location of the event aren’t currently known.

WWE returned to the ThunderDome after WrestleMania 37. It was reported at the time that WWE didn’t plan to resume their touring schedule until July at the earliest. WWE President Nick Khan has recently noted that WWE plan to return to the road full-time when they do rather than having one-off events with live crowds.

At the beginning of WrestleMania Night 1 Vince McMahon welcomed fans back after a year of the pandemic. Moments such as Bianca Belair’s SmackDown Women’s Championship victory were cheered on by the hot crowd.

While WrestleMania 37 was generally seen as a success backstage the size of the live crowd might have been risky. Unfortunately a fan who attended WrestleMania has revealed that they tested positive for COVID-19.

Perhaps the strongest bit of evidence is a recently leaked photo of a pallet of supposed MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Ventus 3X OC graphics cards being prepped for shipment from China to the United States. Following up on that leak it's said the new SKU will launch at $999 (MSRP).

Obviously there's little-to-no chance you will actually be able to buy one at MSRP if and when the new part launches at least not right away—the GeForce RTX 30 series is always out of stock . Save for a few lucky folk who beat the bots and miners to the punch the ongoing shortage of silicon including GPUs is very likely to render this a paper launch. Be that as it may cards do still carry MSRPs and here's how the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti allegedly fits within the pricing hierarchy of modern generation GPUs...

It is a smart launch assuming NVIDIA positions the card as rumored pricing it equivalently to AMD's Radeon RX 6900 XT . It will presumably offer better performance for the same money in both rasterized rendering and real-time ray-traced visuals. At the same time NVIDIA risks cutting into sales of the GeForce RTX 3090 though there are two reasons why the company might not be worried about that happening.





For one NVIDIA is selling every GPU it can source. That will probably be the case throughout 2021 and manufacturing partner TSMC even suggested the silicon shortage in general (not just of GPUs) could last throughout next year and even into part of 2023 as well.

Secondly it appears NVIDIA revised the originally intended specifications for the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti which in turn will create a bigger gap in performance between it and the GeForce RTX 3090. We mentioned this as a possibility when writing about the leaked photo of MSI-brand cards bound for the US and according to HKEPC which is hearing the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will cost $999  that's precisely what happened.







According to the Chinese-language news site the original plan was for the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti to essentially be a slightly cut down version of the GeForce RTX 3090  with the same number of CUDA cores (10496) almost the same amount of GDDR6X memory (20GB versus 24GB) and the same memory bus (384-bit).





However it's said NVIDIA is not really feeling the competitive pressure from the Radeon RX 6900 XT AMD's flagship GPU so it downgraded the specifications to 10240 CUDA cores and 12GB of GDDR6X memory.





Is that really the case? Only NVIDIA truly knows but we can say that earlier GeForce RTX 3080 Ti leaks and rumors did have it pegged as having 10496 CUDA cores and 20GB of memory whereas more recent ones reflect the seemingly downgraded specifications. As always we'll have to wait and see what emerges.

",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA4MC10aS1pcy1yZWFsLWFuZC1pdHMtYWxyZWFkeS1zaGlwcGluZy10by10aGUtdXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is real — and it's already shipping to the US,"The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti doesn’t officially exist yet but it looks like that’s going to change very soon indeed if a photo snapped by Facebook user Lok LOK is legitimate.

The picture embedded below shows a palette of MSI GPUs being shipped to Los Angeles and one of the boxes has a particularly enticing label: “GEFORCE RTX 3080 TI VENTUS 3X 12GB OC.”

Other pictures show a stash of GeForce RTX 3090 stock in the shipment as well as Radeon RX 580 Armor 8G OC and GT 710 2GD3 LP GPUs. The latter two are considerably less powerful than the super-popular RTX 30 GPUs but with all graphics cards in short supply and going for such inflated prices any kind of extra inventory is welcome.

If the image is all that it seems and not some kind of elaborate prank then it all but confirms the recent reports that Nvidia has reduced the power of the RTX 3080 Ti. The card was originally said to have 20GB RAM but both the EEC filing for Gigabyte’s version of the card and now this MSI shipment clearly say it’ll have ‘just’ the 12GB.

To be clear that won’t make the card a slouch in any sense. The latest rumors point to a card with 10240 CUDA cores 80 RT cores and 320 Tensor cores. The 12GB memory even if it is less than originally hoped for will likely be GDDR6X clocked at 19 Gbps. In short it should offer pretty incredible performance somewhere between the $499 base RTX 3080 and $1499 RTX 3090. Rumor has it that the RTX 3080 Ti will launch at around $999 in order to compete with AMD’s Radeon 6900XT.

Of course the above RRPs are all somewhat wishful thinking at this point. Demand is such that cards are selling out almost as soon as they are available and the second-hand market is awash with GPUs selling for vastly inflated prices. Even last-generation RTX 20 cards are going for alarmingly high prices in part due to their appeal to cryptocurrency miners.

While Nvidia has admitted that supply problems are likely to continue for the foreseeable future it’s rumored that the company will at least be taking steps to make the RTX 3080 Ti less appealing to cryptominers by introducing a hash rate limiter as found on the recent RTX 3060. Assuming it can’t be sidestepped — and the 3060’s could — that will be a welcome move for those looking to use their graphics cards for their intended gaming purpose.

While not officially announced previous rumors have pointed to a May launch for the RTX 3080 Ti. If the cards are part of a shipment already bound for LA that prediction just became a lot more likely.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL3J0eC1kaXJlY3QtaWxsdW1pbmF0aW9uLXNob3dzLWdhbWVzLXdpbGwtc29vbi1mZWF0dXJlLXVwLXRvLW1pbGxpb25zLW9mLWR5bmFtaWMtbGlnaHRzL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL3J0eC1kaXJlY3QtaWxsdW1pbmF0aW9uLXNob3dzLWdhbWVzLXdpbGwtc29vbi1mZWF0dXJlLXVwLXRvLW1pbGxpb25zLW9mLWR5bmFtaWMtbGlnaHRzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination Enables Games with Up to Millions of Dynamic Lights,"If you're a regular Wccftech reader chances are you might have stumbled into our story about ReSTIR a deep learning algorithm devised by NVIDIA engineers to render millions of dynamic lights in real time.

At the time almost a year ago ReSTIR (Reservoir-based Spatio-Temporal Importance Resampling) wasn't quite ready for game development purposes as its rendering cost was around 50ms for 3.4 million dynamic lights. That's way too much to be of any use for game developers as programmers need to find their entire rendering budget into 16.6 ms if they target 60 frames per second.

Fast forward to this week however and everything has changed with NVIDIA unveiling its game developer-ready RTX Direct Illumination technology at GTC 2021. In the RTXDI SDK ray tracing is combined with a dramatically more performant version of the ReSTIR algorithm paired with another deep learning algorithm ReGIR (Reservoir-based Grid Importance Resampling) which works as an initial sample generator for ReSTIR and can be applied to secondary surfaces whereas ReSTIR is reserved to primary surfaces.

RTX Direct Illumination promises to forego the so-called 'hero lights' phenomenon in games where only a few select light sources were actually casting shadows. This will enable much more realistic scenes. But what about performance? Well according to RTX UE4 Game Engine Evangelist Richard Cowgill with RTXDI it shouldn't really matter if you need dozens hundreds thousands or millions of lights; the cost is expected to be about the same. As a result the performance should essentially flatten and be more consistent particularly with NVIDIA DLSS enabled.

What's perhaps even more exciting is that RTX Direct Illumination provides tangible benefits to both artists and gamers. The former will have RTXDI telling the game's graphics renderer where to send rays with no need for manual input. The latter will finally get to interact with all of the lights in a scene since they are dynamic which may potentially improve gameplay as players cleverly find advantages by turning off or shooting any of the lights to cover a stealth approach for example.

As expected NVIDIA made it so RTX Direct Illumination is easily integrated with the existing RTX Global Illumination (RTXGI) SDK. Mixing the two should allow for scalable global illumination based on many many light sources.

The best part though is that all of this promising graphics technology won't be reserved just for GeForce RTX users. In fact Richard Cowgill confirmed that RTXDI and RTXGI are both entirely architecture-agnostic and will therefore work not only on AMD's Radeon RX 6000 Series GPUs but on ray-tracing capable consoles as well such as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X. Graphics APIs supported include DirectX Raytracing and Vulkan Ray Tracing.

Game developers interested in implementing RTX Direct Illumination will need a denoiser of course. While NVIDIA recommends their Real-Time Denoiser which comes with the ReLAX algorithm specifically designed for denoising raytraced specular and diffuse signals generated by RTX Direct Illumination devs are free to use another denoiser of their choice.

RTXDI has been made available as part of the NvRTX branch of Unreal Engine 4.26.1. There's no ETA yet for integration in the mainline Unreal Engine 4 branch.

During GTC 2021 NVIDIA also released an 'RTX Technology Showcase' tool to easily demonstrate the capabilities of RTX Direct Illumination RTX Global Illumination Deep Learning Super-Sampling and NVIDIA Real-Time Denoiser in an Unreal Engine environment.

Here’s how it works

Hong Kong it seems is bustling with GPU activity as recently there was a seize of illegal GPUs being smuggled and today a bunch of upcoming Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti MSI Ventus models were spotted.

Tech site HKEPC has reported that it has spotted MSI Ventus models of Nvidia's upcoming RTX 3080 Ti 12GB graphics cards. The graphics cards were seen during the process of transit as they are reportedly being transported from Hong Kong and destined for US retail stores and such. This is in preparation of the 3080 Ti's reported launch next month. The site adds that Nvidia is pricing the RTX 3080 Ti at $999 which is the same as AMD's 16GB Radeon RX 6900 XT.

The report says that the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will also come pre-installed with the mining limiter that was introduced alongside the RTX 3060.

Nvidia had initially wanted the RTX 3080 Ti to be the same chip as the 3090 with cut-down VRAM but has since abandoned that plan. Present reports confirm that the 3080 Ti will be a 12GB model however the CUDA core count of the chip is still unconfirmed. Earlier reports suggested that there might be 9984 CUDA cores but more recent ones say that the number might be higher at 10240.

In amidst the eclectic assortment is the upcoming ""GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Ventus 12G OC"" which will as the armchair generals of the forums have it release in a month's time.

Caught in the camera's lens are a handful of pallets each containing a dozen boxes of maybe a hundred GPUs. The well-protected crate is labeled with the 3090 and aforementioned 3080 Ti. The cardboard boxes contain GeForce GT 710's and Radeon RX 580's.

If the 3080 Ti is shipping to distribution centers now then it should release soon. The popular prediction is mid-May. The expectation that the Ti will be paired with 12 GB of memory also finds support in MSI's package label; the ""12G"" in the card's lengthy name couldn't mean much else but there's some risk of it being incorrect.

The current if dubious predictions about the Ti pin the card's core count at 10240 and its boost clock at 1665 MHz. If those figures are true then it will perform like a 3090 but with a little luck it'll be priced closer to the vanilla 3080.

It could even be cheaper if it has a built-in mining limiter that makes it less valuable to the crypto-crazed. And if the mining limiter works..."

The Canadian-American actor shot to fame in the Eighties and Nineties starring in films such as Beetlejuice Home Alone and Waiting for Guffman often playing comedic roles.

Asked if there was ever hope that she could follow in the footsteps of her peers such as Meg Ryan and play a romantic lead O’Hara told The Sunday Times that “if somebody was thinking of me that way they didn’t tell me”.

The Schitt’s Creek star then recalled having lunch with an unnamed writer-director from New York about a potential leading role in a romantic comedy.

“He said to me: ‘You’re great! I’m looking for your kind of woman. You know – somebody who’s pretty enough but anybody can have you.’”

In reply O’Hara told the director: “‘Why thank you so much!’

“I mean I didn’t get mad or anything” she continued. “That was just kind of ‘Oh! Oh… OK.’ Either I wasn’t pretty enough or he knew nobody could have me. I didn’t get the role.”

Last year O’Hara won at the Golden Globe SAG Critics Choice and Emmy awards for her performance as matriarch Moira Rose in the final series of Schitt’s Creek.

In an interview with The Independent  O’Hara said that she loved how confident “in a delusional way” she felt when playing Moira.

“I miss having that kind of nerve and creativity with how I present myself” she said. “I miss the opportunity to use arcane words in my conversations... Maybe I should just stay in character.”

The 17-year old teen came up with the idea in 2019 when she learned about sutures coated with a material that can indicate the status of the wound. However that technology can be pricey and she felt that those who actually need it wouldn’t be able to afford it.

Taylor thought of a more cost-effective method. She used beets to dye suture threads. The color of the dyed thread would turn from red to dark purple if the surgical wound were infected as the pH level of the skin changed from five up to a nine.

Taylor said she became particularly interested in surgical infections after finding out that those mostly occur after Cesarean sections in underserved communities.

“So when I was presented with this opportunity to do research I couldn’t help but go at it with an equity lens” Taylor told The Smithsonian.

Moreover Taylor’s invention landed her among the 40 finalists out of the over 1760 students who joined the 80th Regeneron Science Talent Search the nation’s oldest and most prestigious science competition for high school seniors.

The “worst case scenario” the Army Corps cautioned would be a tear in the plastic liner that engineers were counting on to hold back water perched atop dangerous waste material. Another worry the Army Corps raised: What if the private company in charge went bankrupt?

Army Corps officials warned the Manatee County Port Authority which was counting on the increase in business. They warned the Florida Department of Environmental Protection which stood to show it could transform a costly mess into an asset. And those warnings reached HRK Holdings the private company that bought the site and planned to make millions from storing dredge material.

All of them pushed back. And then the worst happened. The liner failed almost immediately after dredging began. Now 10 years later it has happened again.

This month a leak at Piney Point drove Manatee County to the nervous edge of catastrophe. Fearing a flood would rip through the surrounding community authorities ordered the evacuation of more than 300 homes. More than 200 million gallons of wastewater have been pumped into Tampa Bay the environmental impact of which is still unknown.

Under a spotlight in the aftermath the Florida Department of Environmental Protection is pledging to hold HRK accountable. But the agency isn’t a minor actor in the story of what went wrong at Piney Point. Florida’s environmental regulator agreed to a plan that put a group of New York financiers in charge of what was arguably the state’s biggest ecological risk. The agency questioned warnings from engineers who sounded the alarm that a major leak could happen. And the state knew HRK was behind on its goal to get rid of the polluted water.

Even the agency’s top official is bewildered by how Piney Point was ever allowed to become a dump site run by an inexperienced private company.

“The more I learn the less I understand” said Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Noah Valenstein during a news conference with the governor this week.

The state had money to close Piney Point for good before but chose to leave the site open for future business interests the secretary told lawmakers April 7. That has left “the property still there as a risk” Valenstein said.

Since the latest leak was first noticed a familiar pattern has emerged. Everyone involved is pointing fingers elsewhere. But records show officials at all levels — the state the company the county — had a hand in what Piney Point became. The county backed an idea to put more waste at Piney Point the company looked at an environmental risk and saw a chance to profit and the state stood by as a looming environmental danger festered on its watch.

Dredging Port Manatee

Port Manatee was looking to dredge a new berth becoming an attractive destination for huge freighter ships sailing through the Panama Canal. It needed a place to put all the muck.

In Piney Point port officials saw opportunity.

The Port Authority made up of Manatee County commissioners approached the Florida Department of Environmental Protection about the idea the Bradenton Herald reported in 2005.

The state was on board seeing a chance to make something useful out of an industrial site with a troubled history. It had spent years trying to drain acidic wastewater from Piney Point’s radioactive phosphogypsum stacks replacing the ponds with plastic-lined reservoirs.

Port records show that department officials and a consultant engineer Ardaman & Associates met with the Port Authority’s governing board in October 2005. They touted the strength and longevity of the liner saying it was a material that would “survive the elements well past our lifetimes.”

Former commissioner and Port Authority board member Joe McClash said board members were given samples to touch.

“There was a high degree of confidence because it was the same material used for landfills” said McClash.

A private company saw opportunity too. Despite the contamination industrial land close to a seaport made Piney Point an enticing real estate investment for HRK which purchased the roughly 700-acre site in 2006. In a dredging agreement with the port HRK could quickly make millions of dollars and fill in some of the old gypsum stacks.

But in 2008 the Army Corps of Engineers released a 72-page study calling the idea a risk.

“I got through 5 pages of this utter nonsense from the (Army Corps of Engineers) before my blood pressure hit the red zone” HRK representative Art Roth wrote after reading the report according to an email filed in court records. “Obviously facts experience and expert opinion don’t matter.”

HRK executives didn’t have first-hand experience in dealing with the complex geology of a gypsum stack but they did have something else working in their favor: the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and its engineering consultants at Ardaman.

HRK with the agency’s approval tapped Ardaman to rebut the Army Corps. The engineer had a long history with Piney Point having worked with the state on closure efforts for years.

Ardaman tamped down fears in a report professing confidence and repeatedly calling a leak “unlikely.”

The Army Corps continued to oppose the project.

An Army Corps official wrote to the executive director of the port in 2009 saying that even if the risk of failure was low “the consequences could be great.” He noted HRK could go bankrupt like prior owners who operated the phosphate plant on the site. That would put the state in a jam. More to the point the risks were unnecessary because a cheaper safer option existed to dump the dredge material miles offshore into the Gulf of Mexico.

The Florida Department of Environmental Protection threw its weight behind Piney Point too. Then-Secretary Michael Sole wrote to an Army Corps leader that the state had “previously identified several benefits to the local environment and community” from disposing of dredge spoils there.

An official under him at the agency noted the department had spent more than $100 million cleaning Piney Point and continued to hope the new reservoirs would be useful for a project such as dredging. The agency gave assurances that the Army Corps would be shielded from litigation if something went wrong.

The Army Corps was still worried records show almost right up until the 2011 dredge operation began. A high-ranking Army Corps official in Washington D.C. wrote the port saying the plan was needlessly risky.

The Army Corps would not agree to an interview for this story. Ultimately it let the dredging go forward.

Disposal began that April. In May there were signs of a leak which an expert eventually traced to a tear in the liner. The Department of Environmental Protection fearing the leak would disrupt the gypsum stacks issued an emergency order letting crews send about 170 million gallons of potentially contaminated water toward Tampa Bay.

HRK has since sued Ardaman saying the company relied on the engineering firm’s assurances and expertise that the plastic liner system would hold. That litigation has been tied up in court for eight years. Ardaman’s attorney did not answer emails for comment. The company did not reply to a request for comment submitted through a contact form.

Now with another breach to answer for HRK is again arguing it was misled by Ardaman.

A recent warning

The liner that kept water in the large reservoir at Piney Point stopping it from leaking is about 0.08 inches thick. That’s equal to 76 Hefty strong trash bags.

After the 2011 leak and subsequent fixes officials continued to trust the plastic liner. But fears did not subside and the state required HRK to make routine inspections.

As recently as March 2020 an independent engineer brought on to evaluate Piney Point warned of a looming disaster.

The potential for “catastrophic damage to the public and the environment is considered unacceptable” two engineers for the firm Wood declared in a letter to HRK and the Department of Environmental Protection.

The engineers described liner tears above the water level the “unknown and likely compromised condition” below the surface and possible lingering trouble from the 2011 incident. They suggested the reservoir “should immediately be drained” and kept stable until the gypsum stack system could be closed.

State regulators were taken aback. The letter contained “several factually incorrect statements” according to the state.

In response John Coates the manager for the Department of Environmental Protection’s mining and mitigation program questioned what proof Wood could have for some of the letter’s assertions. The engineers had only looked at part of the liner that was above water which would be more worn from the sun he wrote. Coates had been involved with oversight at Piney Point for years.

If the Wood engineers had qualms about lingering issues from the 2011 leak Coates wrote they could have spoken up earlier in previous years working at the site. The agency did not make Coates available for an interview.

Dee Ann Miller a spokesperson for the Department of Environmental Protection said the state did not receive a reply to Coates’ letter. But it did receive an annual inspection report dated June 2020 in which the same engineering firm described the phosphogypsum stack system as “generally in good condition based on Wood’s visual inspection.”

A Wood representative declined to comment.

Throughout the rest of 2020 records show HRK staffers continued to document small cracks or potential flaws above the water line.

“HRK routinely inspects notifies FDEP and corrects synthetic liner flaws identified above the water line of the water storage compartments” the company said in a statement this week. Valenstein the department secretary has said “that’s the ongoing process with a liner system.”

About a year after Wood’s warning residents around the old plant property would flee their homes on the recent Easter weekend as authorities warned that a leak from a liner tear could cause the collapse of Piney Point.

Then the blame began.

Signs of trouble

HRK Holdings has two main responsibilities at Piney Point according to a presentation Coates of the Department of Environmental Protection gave to Manatee commissioners in January 2019.

• Clean up and manage the site.

• Provide financial assurance that the property will be cared for decades into the future.

It was the department’s job to make sure they did that Coates said. “They have to be held accountable and they are being accountable.”

But HRK has struggled to meet its obligations records show.

Engineers working at the site repeatedly documented how the company was not disposing of polluted water fast enough to meet a Feb. 15 2019 deadline in an agreement with the state. HRK did not have the technology or equipment needed to finish the job on time the independent engineers said.

The company said this week it “has continuously and diligently relayed concern to all who would listen of the impending problems and risks” at Piney Point and “has proposed numerous solutions to” state and local government without getting approval or funding. HRK pushed for a deep well to inject wastewater underground among other solutions.

Rain has continued to fill the site. Jeff Barath HRK’s manager at Piney Point recently told elected officials in Manatee that without help wastewater could soon overwhelm the ponds.

To assure the state that Piney Point will be managed into the future the company has had to keep money in a trust. HRK says it has to get state approval to pay for at least some repairs on the property.

The fund gives the Department of Environmental Protection money in case HRK goes out of business and the state has to step in to manage Piney Point again. That’s what happened when the plant’s last private owner Mulberry Corp. failed two decades ago. Coates said the acidic wastewater ponds would have overflowed without state intervention.

But Coates told commissioners in early 2019 the money HRK held with the state was not enough to take care of all the waste at Piney Point in the event the company went out of business.

As of March 31 about the time this leak was reported a financial report provided by the Department of Environmental Protection showed that HRK had less than $2.5 million in a fund overseen by the Florida Department of Financial Services.

Lawmakers are now talking about spending as much as $200 million to close the place for good.

The money men

HRK Holdings was an unusual choice to take over an abandoned phosphate plant.

Valenstein the state’s top environmental official has said other sites like Piney Point are run by active mining companies.

HRK was created by a group of three Wall Street financiers: William “Mickey” F. Harley III Scott Rosenzweig and Gary Kania. The firm set up as a limited liability corporation took its name from their initials with Harley and Rosenzweig each owning 40 percent and Kania 20.

Kania later left HRK and Rosenzweig died in 2012.

Harley had a reputation for buying companies in financial trouble. A 2004 profile in Forbes described him as a “vulture” who learned about distressed firms while working at investment bank Allen & Co. before he moved on to manage Mellon HBV’s $1.2 billion hedge fund. It catered to affluent investors who could afford the $1 million minimum investment.

Harley declined to comment for this story.

A graduate of the Yale School of Management Harley at one time owned a handful of Hooters franchises and held $6 million in stock in Frederick’s of Hollywood the lingerie retailer where he also served on the board of directors. He sat on the board of a Canadian-based energy firm that mined for uranium in Namibia. Later he invested in a pecan farm.

The Bradenton Herald reported that the investors learned of Piney Point from Roth a fertilizer consultant who was then hired by HRK.

But records show that in 2001 Kania was following the bankruptcy of Mulberry Corp. closely. He was a vice president at a New York-based bank and was listed as its contact in a claim made in bankruptcy filings that Mulberry owed the bank $36.6 million.

Tampa attorney Herb Donica was hired by Mulberry Corp bankruptcy trustee John Brook after Piney Point closed. He visited the site off U.S. Hwy. 41 so often paint began to peel from his silver Mercedes the result of acid from an abandoned pond on the site drifting through the air he said.

The job of the trustee was to get the best deal for Mulberry’s many creditors but it wasn’t like a normal bankruptcy since the site was under the control of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection Donica told the Tampa Bay Times.

Manatee commissioners declined the chance to buy the site for $4 million saying it was too polluted even for that bargain price.

Other companies were interested in acquiring Piney Point but Kania’s familiarity with the site gave HRK an advantage Donica said this week.

Around the time of the sale he told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune: “They satisfied us that they knew what they were getting into. We were never going to turn it loose to someone who wasn’t aware of the managing and monitoring that is required.”

Brook the trustee said last week that the Department of Environmental Protection vetted HRK and approved the sale.

HRK financed the $4.3 million purchase through a $10 million loan secured by a mortgage on Piney Point from AmSouth Bank which later merged with Regions Bank. It was also required to pay $3.8 million to the department toward the ongoing cleanup of the site.

Court records show that the company struggled even as it borrowed more money from Regions. By 2008 liens were being filed against the Piney Point property and HRK was sued for $1.7 million because it failed to pay a construction company to demolish old phosphate factory equipment.

By 2010 Regions agreed to consolidate the firm’s debt into a single promissory note of $17.5 million.

There was some money coming in. The firm leased land to a salt company that wanted storage. A warehouse for keeping fertilizer was built and the start of the pumping of dredging material from Port Manatee’s Berth 12 project promised more revenue. Port records show HRK was paid $3 million through 2011.

The company’s finances nosedived after the first leak.

Barely more than a year later it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Tampa federal court. Claims from creditors reached $33 million. That included a $12 million lien from Port Manatee which had been sued by the dredging company claiming that the delay caused by the leak had cost it $4.7 million.

Harley HRK’s principal owner was also hit with a lawsuit filed a few months later by the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation. The wealthy Pittsburgh nonprofit accused Harley of misusing its $2 million investment to make payments to companies he owned including HRK through his hedge fund.

Soon after regular reports showed the value of the nonprofit’s investment was plummeting. By April 2008 its $2 million investment had dwindled to $306000 the lawsuit claims.

Around June 2009 Harley closed the hedge fund’s offices the lawsuit states and started operating the fund out of a Hooters basement.

The lawsuit alleged that he transferred the remaining investment funds into a company he owned called the Arsenal Group. Arsenal sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to HRK during its bankruptcy court records show. The lawsuit was closed after the two sides agreed to a settlement. The terms were not disclosed.

HRK emerged from bankruptcy in 2017 although it remained millions of dollars in debt to Regions Bank.

What now?

The state is vowing this will be Piney Point’s “last chapter.”

How that will happen is unclear. Gov. Ron DeSantis has directed the Department of Environmental Protection’s scientists and engineers to draw up a plan. Valenstein the department’s secretary said closure will mean draining and filling the ponds to make sure water can no longer be stored at Piney Point.

The governor has redirected about $15 million toward treating water at the site. State lawmakers say they could greenlight up to $200 million for closure.

The leaking reservoir today according to state regulators contains a mix of old seawater from the dredging rainwater and polluted water related to the fertilizer industry.

Manatee County administrator Scott Hopes says what happened isn’t the county’s fault and points out that Piney Point was the responsibility of a private landowner that was overseen by the state.

“Certainly the county did not have the resources to do what’s being done right now” he said.

Valenstein told lawmakers this month that he is interested in ordering a report detailing his agency’s actions at Piney Point.

Already another business is circling the property.

In September Regions Bank assigned HRK’s outstanding debt to Fortress 2020 Landco. Soon after Fortress sued HRK seeking to foreclose on several debts and lines of credit that HRK has failed to repay. The loans total $25 million according to the lawsuit.

It’s unclear what investor or company is behind Fortress. The company was registered in August in Delaware a state that draws hundreds of thousands of business registrations because of laws that keep executives’ names confidential.

Records filed with Florida’s Division of Corporations also in August list a business address in Fort Worth Texas. Orla Drilling which works with oil and mining companies is listed as operating from that site. HRK has filed motions seeking to have the Fortress lawsuit dismissed.

This new legal battle could complicate the governor’s plan for the state to clean up the site permanently and hold HRK accountable.

Glenn Compton who is chairperson of the local environmental group ManaSota-88 doubts the state will be able to get much money from HRK. He has long criticized what he sees as mismanagement and poor regulation of Piney Point. He considers it a “historic mistake” that will be difficult to bring to a close the culmination of decades of poor choices and the lasting fallout of Florida’s fertilizer industry.

“What we’ve learned is there’s no such thing as a future beneficial use of a phosphogypsum stack. These are wastelands and they’ll be wastelands for generations to come” Compton said. “The price is being paid by the taxpayers and the environment.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

For weeks Habitat volunteers and members from the Southeast Church of Christ have been making repairs to the church at 1424 Allen Ave. SE as part of a larger neighborhood renewal plan.

The Renewal Project: Southeast Canton is a multi-year $3 million project to revitalize neighborhoods and help end generational poverty. In February Habitat received a $100000 grant for the project from the Republic Services Charitable Foundation.

Habitat built its first homes on 14th Street SE in 1989.

Solomon Cooks and spreading the love of God

The Southeast Church of Christ is at the geographical center of where much of the building will take place according to Habitat's Executive Director Beth Lechner.

""About 10 years ago we came out to do a few projects and I thought it would be great to use the church grounds for a devotion site"" she said.

Lechner said it led to a chance meeting with the late Solomon Cooks Sr. a church leader who lived in the neighborhood.

""He was one of those men whom you could feel the presence of God"" she said. ""He handed us the keys to the church. While we were in the church we noticed the bathrooms needed some repair and we offered to fix them.""

Lechner and Cooks developed a deep friendship. He died earlier this year at 95.

""He lived a very simple life. He loved God"" she said. ""All of us need our people those people we can talk to. Solomon Cooks was one of my people. He was a great community builder. He came to the dedications of our houses in the neighborhood and did house blessings.""

Cooks' son Nate said he appreciates Habitat because new housing means new neighbors some of whom may be seeking a spiritual home.

""There's no question that the relationship between Habitat and the Southeast Church of Christ was a godsend for both of us"" he said. ""They're just a phenomenal group and not just for this building.""

More than houses in SE Canton

Lechner said that as plans for the newest project began to get underway Habitat reconnected with the church meeting with members and residents to discuss how the church could become a center of neighborhood activity.

""It's about more than houses"" Lechner said ""It's about getting to know the neighbors and their needs. What better place to start a project than at God's house?""

Among the repairs currently taking place at the church are a new baptistry some exterior painting new landscaping a new roof with shingles donated privately plus gutters and downspouts.

Lechner noted that the roof was replaced in one day. ""They take really good care of their church but they were desperate for a roof.""

The repairs have been a chance for church members to reunite since the pandemic shutdown. There are plans to reopen the first Sunday in May.

""This is beyond amazing"" said Gloria Cooks Roaner one of several Cooks children who attend the church. Other members who gathered recently to work include Diane DeGraffenreid Helen Brunner and Aimee Tyson whose mother purchased a Habitat home in the neighborhood in 1996.

The Rev. Dr. Larry Battle said the church which recently acquired its status as a 501 C3 non-profit has plans to do more for its neighbors noting that they've previously done food and clothing giveaways.

""We want to open the building more than on Wednesdays and Sundays"" he said.

Battle said an active church and good housing give people and neighborhoods a sense of stability.

""Many of the world's problems come from a lack of communication"" he said. ""You can't pay for the things being done here. (It's) watering to blossom this community again.""

Aaron Brown Habitat's director of Neighborhood Investment said he believes God is using the project to reach residents present and the future.

""The church is the definition of a safe place and when they need a friend"" he said. ""I feel like God has been working. We're seeing it play out.""

Battle said dedicated members such as Solomon Cooks are the reason the church is thriving. The original Southeast Church of Christ was founded on Cherry Avenue SE. The current building was built in 1982.

""He was a walking Bible who not only knew the Scriptures but tried to live it"" Battle said of Cooks Sr. ""He wasn't a perfect man but the thing he strived to be was the man God wanted him to be. He was an encourager.""

Lechner agrees that a healthy church is a component of a healthy neighborhood. Six new construction projects and 14 critical repair projects are planned.

""People have told us the southeast isn't worth investing in"" she said. ""We couldn't disagree more. There are wonderful people in this neighborhood.""

Prime Minister Andrej Babis told reporters late on April 17 that the decision to expel the Russians was made on the basis of ""unequivocal evidence"" provided by investigators from the Czech intelligence and security services.



The Czech Republic ""must react to these unprecedented revelations in a corresponding manner” Babis said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9jemVjaC1yZXB1YmxpYy1leHBlbHMtMTgtcnVzc2lhbi1lbWJhc3N5LXN0YWZmLW92ZXItMjAxNC1ibGFzdC9hLTU3MTY0MzY20gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuZHcuY29tL2VuL2N6ZWNoLXJlcHVibGljLWV4cGVscy0xOC1ydXNzaWFuLWVtYmFzc3ktc3RhZmYtb3Zlci0yMDE0LWJsYXN0L2EtNTcxNjQzNjY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Czech Republic expels Russian Embassy staff over 2014 blast,"The Czech Republic has accused Russian intelligence of being involved in a 2014 explosion at a military ammunition warehouse. It's searching for suspects involved in the 2018 Skripal poisoning.

The Czech Republic is expelling 18 Russian diplomats over alleged links to an ammunition depot explosion in 2014 Prime Minister Andrej Babis said Saturday.

They have been given 48 hours to leave the country.

Why Czechia is expelling Russian diplomats

On October 16 2014 there was a blast at a warehouse containing 58 tonnes of ammunition near the eastern Czech village of Vrbetice.

It was followed months later by another big explosion at a nearby warehouse with 98 tonnes of ammunition.

""The explosion led to huge material damage and posed a serious threat to the lives of many local people but above all it killed two citizens"" Babis said.

Babis said Czech authorities had ""clear evidence"" linking GRU Russian intelligence agency officers from unit 29155 to the blasts after receiving information on Friday.

The expelled Russians have all been identified as members of their country's SWR and GRU intelligence services.

Babis added: ""The Czech Republic is a sovereign state and must adequately react.""

But Russia hit back at the accusations. The Interfax news agency cited Vladimir Dzhabarov first deputy head of the upper house's international affairs committee as saying Prague's claims were absurd and Russia's response should be proportionate.

Prague on Sunday said it would inform its NATO and European Union allies about its latest findings.

Police hunt for Skripal suspects

Meanwhile the Czech organized crime squad (NCOZ) said it was looking for two men using Russian passports in relation to the explosions.

The names in the passports are

Alexander Petrov born in 1979 and Ruslan Boshirov born in 1978. The names match those of the two people wanted in Britain over the poisoning of double Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury in 2018.

The suspected GRU members are said to have been present in the Czech Republic for six days in mid-October 2014 visiting the region where the ammunition depot is located.

The suspects of the 2018 novichok nerve agent poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury England have been linked to a 2014 blast in the Czech Republic that killed two people.

Czech police said Saturday that they were searching for two men in connection with a serious crime. Czech police released images matching those of the Salisbury suspects Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. UK officials said the men are behind a 2014 explosion at an ammunition depot in Vrbetice.

The Czech police added that the men are known to be carrying various passports including Russian passports with Petrov and Boshirov’s names.

Moscow has denied any involvement with the Salisbury incident and the men who identified themselves as Petrov and Boshirov claimed they briefly visited the historic cathedral city as tourists. Putin has said the two men identified as suspects are “not criminals.”

The UK foreign office said on Sunday: “It has been announced by the Czech authorities that the two GRU Officers that were charged with the attempted murder of the Skripals in Salisbury Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov were also behind the deaths of two civilians and an explosion in the Czech town of Vrbetice.”

Czech police say the men were in the Czech Republic between October 11 and October 16 of 2014 and added they also carried passports from Moldova and Tajikistan under the names of Nicolai Popa and Ruslan Tabarov respectively.

Shortly before the announcement the Czech Republic said it would expel 18 employees of the Russian Embassy in Prague in retaliation for the 2014 explosion which caused huge financial and environmental damage.

“As Foreign Minister I decided to expel all employees of the Russian Embassy who were clearly identified by our security services as officers of Russian Intelligence Services SVR and GRU” Acting Foreign Minister Jan Hamacek said at the time.

Russia will take “retaliatory measures” against the Czech Republic over the move the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday.

The decision to expel 18 embassy employees was “based on unfounded and far-fetched excuses about the involvement of Russian special services in the explosion of 2014 at military depots in Vrbetice settlement” the statement said.

“This is even more absurd since the Czech leadership previously blamed the companies that own these warehouses for explosions” it added.

The Russian ministry alleged the move was “an effort to please the United States against the background of recent US sanctions against Russia the Czech authorities have even surpassed their overseas masters in this regard.”

Russian intelligence service

Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said Saturday “there is well founded suspicion that officers of Russian Intelligence Services GRU unit 29155 were connected to the explosion of a munition depots in Vrbetice in the year 2014.”

He added that the blast “caused enormous material damage serious threat and disruption of people’s lives but especially it killed two of our citizens two unexpected and innocent fathers.”

Babiš said he informed the European Council President Charles Michel about the investigation into the explosion. The Czech Republic will discuss the explosion with NATO and European Union allies on Monday according to a tweet sent early Sunday by Hamacek.

Hamacek was scheduled to travel to Moscow in the coming days to discuss the possibility of the Czech Republic acquiring the Russian Covid-19 vaccine. The trip has been canceled because he would be “needed at the government’s meeting on Monday” he said.

After that announcement Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Russian state news agency TASS “Prague is well aware of what will follow such tricks.”

In a tweet sent Sunday Deputy Chief of Mission at the US Embassy in Prague Jennifer Bachus said “The United States stands with its steadfast Ally the Czech Republic. We appreciate their significant action to impose costs on Russia for its dangerous actions on Czech soil.”

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK “stands in “stands in full support of our Czech allies who have exposed the lengths that the Russian intelligence services will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations in Europe.”

He added that it showed ” a pattern of behavior by Moscow following the Novichok attack in Salisbury.”

NATO said Sunday it supported the Czech Republic as it “investigates Russia’s malign activities on its territory.”

“We express our sympathy to the loved ones of the victims of the explosion in Vrbetice. Those responsible must be brought to justice” a NATO official said in a statement.

Relations between London and Moscow deteriorated in 2018 when the UK government pointed the finger of blame at the two Russians it said were the agents of the GRU. The bitter diplomatic fight also saw a wave of tit-for-tat expulsions between Russia and Western nations.

This week the administration of US President Joe Biden targeted Russia with sweeping sanctions and diplomatic expulsions punishing Moscow for its interference in the 2020 US election its SolarWinds cyberattack and its ongoing occupation and “severe human rights abuses” in Crimea.

This story has been updated to clarify what Czech police said on Saturday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ic2VydmVydG9kYXkuY29tL25ld3MvcGFnZS1vbmUvMjAyMS8wNC90aGUtZ29vZC1iYWQtYW5kLXVnbHktb2YtcmVjeWNsaW5nLWluLWNoYXV0YXVxdWEtY291bnR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The good bad and ugly of recycling in Chautauqua County,"Chautauqua County residents like most Americans are good at recycling and bad at recycling.

They’re good in that many residents make an effort to recycle parts of their trash instead of having it all end up in a cell at the county landfill. They’re bad in that sometimes they dispose of things that aren’t recyclable or at least aren’t clean causing more problems than if they just threw those things in the trash in the first place.

In 2020 Chautauqua County collected nearly 3500 tons of recyclable materials. That doesn’t include recycling collected by private contractors who take their recyclable materials elsewhere. The breakdown is as follows (in tons):

¯ cardboard: 779.24

¯ paper: 579.02

¯ scrap metal: 520.19

¯ glass: 512.37

¯ tires: 382

¯ single stream: 249.92

¯ electronics: 209.11

¯ plastic: 205.80

¯ metal cans: 37.40

SCRAP METAL

Tracy Pierce is an analyst for the county’s Division of Solid Waste. Pierce notes that in order for an item to be recycled there must be a buyer who wants that product. “Every recycling commodity we deal with becomes a commodity and it has a spot market. The spot market for us is Buffalo. In Buffalo there’s a bunch of buyers a bunch of brokers” he said.

Number 2 scrap which is unsorted metal is collected by Weitsman in Jamestown at the county transfer stations. The company pays the county a percentage based on the Buffalo spot market price. It can be sorted with a magnet to separate the ferrous metals which contain iron and the non-ferrous metal. “This stuff moves all the time” Pierce said.

Pierce discussed recycling during an interview at the Webster Road transfer station in the town of Pomfret. That day there was a bicycle there with the rubber tires still on it. To recycle that bicycle it will be run through a shredder. Anything that is not metal such as the tires becomes residue and is discarded in a landfill.

METAL CANS

The county collects pie tins aluminum cans clean tin foil and tin cans. Pierce said it’s important that the cans be cleaned and labels removed before turning in. “When we send this it ends up being with contamination that has to be removed. That causes the scrap recycler a disposal fee and now they have to get rid of it” he said.

Pierce says New York state is more efficient with recycling cans of soda pop or Arizona iced tea (look on the top to see if there’s a deposit). About 25 years ago aluminum was recycled every 90 days. Today it’s every 60 days which means theoretically you could be drinking out of the same can six times a year.

CARDBOARD

Chautauqua County collects corrugated cardboard as well as flat cardboard like empty tissue or cereal boxes. The corrugated cardboard has the most value but Chautauqua County has been collecting both kinds since former County Executive Greg Edwards made the change.

“One of the inefficiencies nationwide and internationally is separating (the types of cardboard)” Pierce said.

However cardboard is almost always able to be recycled. The only time it’s not is when it becomes contaminated from food particles like pizza boxes that come from takeout. That’s because the food attracts bugs rats and other animals. And once animals get into the recycled materials it needs to be thrown away.

Another issue with cardboard is with Amazon and shipping packages. The labels should be removed and the packing needs to be discarded. Packing plastic can actually be recycled with plastic bags that are accepted at large retailers like grocery stores Walmart and Home Depot.

PLASTICS

Used plastic is the most difficult item to recycle and to sell not only locally but nationwide. Chautauqua County collects seven different types of plastics. Those include jars milk jugs and detergents shampoo margarine and food containers and yogurt containers. But often people throw all sorts of items that have plastic in them but don’t qualify for recycling.

“All of this should be food containers” Pierce said while pointing to the bin that residents place their plastic in for recycling. “No toys no potting goods no racks from the nursery. … the reason why food is the common theme here is it’s a higher quality plastic.”

Pierce said motor oil bottles pesticides bleach bottles window wipers all should be thrown away. Even an unwashed laundry detergent bottle can contaminate recyclables so please rinse it. “Keep it clean and dry” he said.

Certain types of plastics can be turned into coats or carpets. However not all plastics are used for the same purpose so the plastic needs to be separated by resin type manually. The plastic collected through deposit program in NY has the greatest demand because it is clean separated.

Demand for the plastics increases with demand from consumers and the rise in energy prices.

“If there’s no demand on the other end it just gets piled up” said Pierce. “Plastic is the least efficient.”

In fact last year for a short time some of the plastic collected by Chautauqua County had to be placed in the landfill because they couldn’t find a company to take it. “When we’ve been lucky we’ve had our vendors say we’ll take some plastic” he said.

SINGLE STREAM

In the city of Dunkirk residents have all their recyclables collected at once. This is known as “single stream” recycling. Dunkirk is the only municipality in the county that uses single stream recycling.

In 2020 Republic Services sold its recyclable material recovery facility in Kenmore to Modern Disposal and Modern closed that facility. Now they sort recyclables at their Buffalo plant. Currently Modern is the only recyclable material recovery facility in the region that processes single stream and plastic within reach. They still accept Dunkirk’s single stream collection however because they have so much recycling they won’t accept any new contracts.

PAPER

Around Chautauqua County are “paper retriever” collection bins. They are at the county landfill but also at schools churches and other not-for-profit locations. Once the bins are filled depending on the market they are collected and the local user is given $20 a load. Right now the economy isn’t as strong so the county isn’t making money off its paper however the county doesn’t have to pay to get rid of it which includes newspapers magazines “junk” mail cards telephone books envelopes and office and school paper.

That’s because of the government. According to Pierce the U.S. government and other branches of government are the biggest consumer of recycled paper. Because the federal state and lower levels of government require their paper to be recycled there’s a strong demand for paper even when the economy is weak.

According to Pierce paper can be recycled up to seven times. After that it breaks down too much and is used to make toilet paper or paper towels.

Pierce said most of the paper recyclables from Chautauqua County goes to the Midwest Syracuse Buffalo or Canada

GLASS

Late last year the Jamestown BPU decided to eliminate collecting glass from its customers.

At the time Dave Leathers BPU general manger told The Post-Journal there are two reasons why BPU officials wanted to are looking to remove glass from the recycling program. He said the first is it’s an expense to the solid waste division because it costs money to pick up the glass recycling and then transport it for disposal. The second reason is that even with a spread out pickup time which is usually 8 to 10 weeks apart customer participation is low.

The change was approved by the Jamestown City Council.

Jamestown area residents that still want to recycle glass can take it to the Falconer transfer station.

Technically the colored glass and clear glass are not recycled but are broken down and used by the county’s DPW department at the landfill in place of stone. “Rather than go and mine stone out of nature we’re using the glass” said Pierce. “We’re very fortunate to have it.”

Glass with deposits on them are the cleanest glass and sought by recyclers. However glass at the landfill is often contaminated by light bulbs window glass and ovenware. That glass can’t be melted down at high temperatures. Because of this recycling companies don’t want it.

There’s been talk at the state level to put deposits on wine and liquor bottles. Should that happen Pierce believes the available glass for recycling will drop substantially.

ELECTRONICS

A few years ago Chautauqua County used to collect TVs computers and other electronics for free. The county no longer does that and instead charges a fee for every item residents dispose. That change is because the county must pay to get rid of the electronics.

In 2015 New York state enacted legislation making it illegal for electronics to be placed in landfills. That doesn’t mean individuals don’t try to sneak them into the landfill however they’re breaking the law and can face significant fines.

“According to the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) 90% of the toxic metals in the landfill comes from electronics” Pierce said.

For electronics Pierce noted there are companies that take old TVs to their plants manually dissemble them remove the precious metals and send the unusable parts to a landfill. Right now the county is using a company in Victor NY to disassemble the electronics.

TIRES

Vendors are required to take old tires when customers buy new tires which Pierce encourages residents to do. The county does accept tires for a fee. The county bales tires and uses them in the landfill but they collect far more tires than they need so they ask residents to have the business where they buy news ones dispose of them.

WHAT CAN CITIZENS DO

The first thing Pierce wants to see residents to do is not contaminate recyclables with things that can’t be recycled. That only generates more waste and can cause items that would be recycled to end up in the landfill.

There are a number of small things as well.

Small propane tanks can be recycled with scrap metal although the county asks that residents place the blue cap on the tank after disposing it to help distinguish it from a grenade. They can also be disposed of at hazardous waste collections the county occasionally hosts.

Another problem item is old wires and sockets from home renovations. They should be taken to a metal recycling facility instead of thrown in the trash. That’s because the trucks at the landfill drive over them and the tires are popped.

Batteries can be thrown in the trash unless they’re rechargeable or Lithium-ion. In that case they can be brought to the store where they were purchased. The same is true with fluorescent light bulbs.

New York has banned plastic bags from most retail stores. Even so many people have lots of plastic bags around their house and throw them away. Pierce says to put trash in the bags; don’t throw a “bag of bags” in the trash because they can start to blow around. “We compact the trash. When the compactor drives over the trash bag it breaks and those bags just go ‘poof’ when the wind blows. There’s nothing in them” he said. He did note that they’re starting to see fewer bags in the landfill.

Pierce was working for the county when New York added deposits to water bottles. The number of water bottles that end up in the landfill dropped significantly. He writes to state officials every two years asking for legislation to be enacted to cover bottles like Gatorade energy drinks etc. He would like to see others ask for this legislation to pressure state to make a change.

Two other points Pierce suggests have to do with how we shop.

Pierce notes that shopping on line requires greater consumption of packaging than mall shopping. According to a study by Simon Properties (former owner of Chautauqua Mall) less packaging material is used to stock retail stores than shopping on-line; and the average shopper visits more than one store and buys six to 10 items. The efficiency of mall shopping is also greater because most mall shoppers go with family and friends. Plus nobody leaves the store with items that don’t fit thus there is a reduced occurrence of returned items which reduces fuel consumption.

Finally Pierce suggests residents try purchase more items made from recycled materials and increase production through consumer demand. For example Mohawk Industries a large flooring manufacturer has an entire carpet brand that is made from recycling food containers. Patagonia makes clothing from recycled plastic. If more consumers purchased materials made from recycled plastics the need for recycled plastic will increase and less plastic will end up in landfills."

The co-main event features a battle of lightweights looking to get things moving in the right direction in their 2021 debuts as Jeremy Stephens squares off with Drakkar Klose.

Following an eight-year run at featherweight the 34-year-old Stephens returns to the 155-pound ranks looking to earn his first victory since February 2018. While the results haven’t been there Stephens has continued to face elite competition during his prolonged skid with his four losses coming against Jose Aldo Zabit Magomedsharipov Yair Rodriguez and Calvin Kattar.

The battle-tested “Lil Heathen” has always been a tough out and fueled by a desire to snap out of his current funk and start fresh at lightweight no one should be surprised if he turns back the clock this weekend and dials up a dynamite performance against Klose.

The Michigan native is one of those fighters that truly highlights the incredible depth of talent and narrow margins that separate competitors in the 155-pound weight class as he arrives in Las Vegas this weekend sporting an 11-2-1 record overall and 5-2 mark inside the Octagon. Last time out Klose had his three-fight winning streak snapped by Beneil Dariush in a wildly entertaining back-and-forth affair where he had the surging contender on roller skates before getting stopped a minute into the second round.

ANDREI ARLOVSKI VS. CHASE SHERMAN

Veteran heavyweight Andrei Arlovski subs in for Parker Porter in this main card matchup with Chase Sherman that has barnburner written all over it.

Arlovski’s UFC career stretches across three decades and despite having logged more than 50 professional appearances the former heavyweight champion shows no real signs of slowing down. He posted consecutive victories over Philipe Lins and Tanner Boser in 2020 before running into rising star Tom Aspinall earlier this year and now takes a second swing at securing UFC victory No. 20 this weekend.

Sherman made his return to the Octagon in 2020 extending his winning streak and finishing streak to four with a second-round stoppage win over Ike Villanueva in May. An all-action fighter who has never been shy about wading into the fray and taking one in order to land one of his own the 31-year-old has shown improved technique and better utilization of his weapons during his current run of success and a victory over Arlovski on Saturday would easily be the biggest of his career.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC11cy1jYW5hZGEtNTY3NTM5NjjSATVodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3Mvd29ybGQtdXMtY2FuYWRhLTU2NzUzOTY4LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Time: A love story coloured by incarceration,,,,,,,,,,

A presentation at the 2021 ARC Industry Forum Americas demonstrated the many ways the MITRE ATT&CK Framework for ICS can help ICS cybersecurity teams.

MITRE ATT&CK is a framework for communicating and consuming intelligence about cyber threat actors tactics and techniques. It includes a curated knowledge base of real-world observations that defenders can leverage in understanding security risks identifying security gaps and selecting needed mitigations.

The enterprise version of ATT&CK framework was created by MITRE Corporation in 2013 and has become a popular tool used by IT security professionals in the private sector government and cybersecurity product and service community. The ICS version of ATT&CK was developed in 2019 to address the specific needs of industrial control system (ICS) cybersecurity defenders. It reflects the unique issues of attacks on equipment at Level 0-2 of the Purdue model.

Michael Hoffman of Dragos provided a great impartial overview of the MITRE ATT&CK Framework for ICS at the 2021 ARC Industry Forum Americas. Mike has over 20 years of experience in the oil & gas industry and various certificates and degrees in cybersecurity from SANS. He also teaches cybersecurity courses at SANS. His talk demonstrated the comprehensiveness and power of MITRE ATT&CK for ICS and the many ways that users can leverage this information to protect critical control systems.

MITRE ATT&CK for ICS

MITRE ATT&CK for ICS is organized around a matrix of tactics and techniques. Tactics are the individual steps that attackers might use to achieve their ultimate goals. They include actions like initial access execution persistence evasion etc. Techniques represent the different ways that tactical goals might be accomplished. For example attackers could achieve initial access through techniques like data historian compromise drive-by compromise engineering workstation compromise exploit public facing application external remote access etc.

This matrix structure provides a convenient platform for distributing threat intelligence about known attack groups like Xenotime and known malware campaigns like Industroyer. The MITRE ATT&CK for ICS knowledge base has extensive information to help defenders identify attack groups and understand the malware campaigns that present the highest risks to their industries and control systems. As attack groups tend to use different tactics and techniques the matrix can also be used to direct defender efforts towards vulnerable areas that deserve the most attention. A convenient graphical tool on the Dragos website shows the techniques used by the many threat groups they monitor.

NuEra principal officer Keith McGinnis anticipated a busy weekend for the new adult-use dispensary noting that it opens at a time when cannabis sales throughout the United States seem to be on the rise.

As an example of its potential benefit to Pekin’s business community he said when NuEra opened its East Peoria medical dispensary in 2016 the Riverside Center where it is located was largely vacant. Five years later new businesses and a steady flow of patrons have come to the shopping center and new sales tax revenue has come to the city of East Peoria. McGinnis believes that NuEra’s presence can achieve the same result for Court Street and the city of Pekin.

“The city of Pekin will be very happy with the revenue going into its coffers throughout the year” he added.

Pekin Area Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Amy McCoy said it is a positive development any time a new business comes to a community. In addition to the anticipated tax revenue for the city the store has created 12 new jobs.

“We’re happy to welcome (NuEra) to Pekin” McCoy said.

Justin Wright of Pekin believes that the arrival of an adult-use cannabis store in the community is long overdue because he does not believe cannabis should be illegal at the state or federal level. He added that the legalization of recreational cannabis in Illinois will help the state regulate its sale and use.

""(People who want to buy cannabis) will buy it somewhere” he said. “I’d rather see them buy it at stores than from cartels in Mexico.”

Tamia Brown of Pekin hopes NuEra’s presence is the start of a trend where more new businesses come to the community and she expects the city to benefit from the revenue the store will bring. Her main reason for looking favorably on a new cannabis store however seems to be that she has seen cannabis medically benefit a loved one.

“My uncle has been a three-time cancer patient” she said. “Cannabis has really helped him.”

With legalization of recreational cannabis a controversial issue nationwide it is not surprising that the community’s reaction to a new dispensary in town is not uniformly positive. In January Pekin City Council member Mike Garrison voted against NuEra’s special-use authorization request to set up the dispensary. Ross Gould chairman of the Good Shepherd School board also expressed concerns about the store’s proximity to the school. Brian Avery of Pekin does not see the presence of an adult-use cannabis store as inappropriate.

“I think there are legitimate medical reasons people need it for” he said. “Medical issues aside I don’t think anybody needs to do it. But I think people will make excuses to do it. I feel the same way about alcohol.”

NuEra Pekin is located at 3249 Court St. Hours of operation are 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday through Wednesday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday through Saturday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA0LTE5L21vdXNlLXRyYXAtc2hvcnRhZ2UtZ2lwcHNsYW5kLzEwMDA3Nzk3ONIBKGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvYXJ0aWNsZS8xMDAwNzc5Nzg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mouse trap shortage as plague leads to panic buying,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-19/mouse-trap-shortage-gippsland/100077978 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA0LTE5L21vdXNlLXRyYXAtc2hvcnRhZ2UtZ2lwcHNsYW5kLzEwMDA3Nzk3ONIBKGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvYXJ0aWNsZS8xMDAwNzc5Nzg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The news that got a lot of attention this week was a new bill introduced that aims to get cruise ships sailing again.

Senators from Florida and Alaska sponsored a new piece of legislation that would allow cruise ships to start sailing without the CDC's interference.

Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan along with Florida Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio announced a bill that is aimed at overriding the CDC’s current framework for getting cruise lines back to sea. In this new legislation called the CRUISE Act or Careful Resumption Under Improved Safety Enhancements lawmakers are calling on U.S. health officials to change current guidelines.

The purpose of the bill is to end the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC)'s Framework for Conditional Sail Order (CSO) by July 4 2021 so that cruise lines can restart sailings from the United States.

Royal Caribbean Group CEO sees signs ""We Are Approaching The End"" of cruise shutdown

Royal Caribbean Group Chairman and CEO Richard Fain thinks cruise ships being able to sail again may be up next.

In his latest video update Richard Fain sees a lot of key milestones happening now that point to the fact things are moving in the right direction.

Included in his comments was mention of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recent update to its Framework for Conditional Sail Order (CSO) which Mr. Fain characterized as ""tougher restrictions on cruising out of U.S. ports.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXJpYmJlYW5uYXRpb25hbHdlZWtseS5jb20vY2FyaWJiZWFuLWJyZWFraW5nLW5ld3MtZmVhdHVyZWQvdXMtZW1iYXNzeS1zYXlzLXJveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1jcnVpc2VzLW9mZmVycy10cmFuc2l0LW9wcG9ydHVuaXR5LWZyb20tc3QtdmluY2VudC1mb3ItdXMtY2l0aXplbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Embassy says Royal Caribbean Cruises offers 'Transit Opportunity' from St. Vincent for US citizens,"In a revised Natural Disaster Alert the Embassy said that boarding on the Celebrity Reflection will begin at 7:00 a.m. (local time) and will depart the Kingstown Port at 1:00 p.m.

The ship will arrive in Philipsburg Sint Maarten on Saturday at approximately 7:00 a.m. the embassy said.

It said the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) “recommends against travel on cruise ships because the chance of getting COVID-19 on cruise ships is higher since the virus appears to spread more easily between people in close quarters aboard ships.”

The embassy said there is no cost or travel fare for the ship’s voyage.

It however said US citizens will be responsible for making their own onward travel arrangements.

“Please plan accordingly including potential hotel stays in Sint Maarten and booking onward commercial airline flights from the Sint Maarten Princess Juliana International Airport which offers direct flight to multiple US cities” the embassy urged.

It said US citizens who decide not to depart St. Vincent and the Grenadines to be prepared to “shelter in place for an undetermined amount of time” adding that “there are currently no future plans for other transit opportunities.”

The US Embassy urged US citizens to register online by completing the US Mission Bridgetown and the Eastern Caribbean – Manifest Form stating that the deadline to register is Thursday April 15 at 12:00 noon.

The embassy said there are several travel restrictions including no children under the age of six months; no pregnant women over 23 weeks of gestation; no individuals requiring dialysis; no individuals with terminal conditions; no individuals who have been identified as close contacts of a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case; and no pets.

“All departing passengers 2 years of age and older are required to have a negative COVID Antigen Rapid Test (taken within 24 hours of boarding)” the US Embassy said. “A printed copy of your negative test results will be required prior to boarding the cruise ship.”

It said a testing center Health Solutions Inc. is located near the seaport in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

“All passengers are required to complete a health questionnaire prior to boarding” the embassy said. “The ship will have the form available at the pier.”

It said travelers are required to complete an online immigration (ED) card prior to travel to Sint Maarten and must purchase mandatory COVID-19 health insurance prior to travel to Sint Maarten.

In addition the embassy said all airline passengers to the US ages two years and older must provide a negative COVID-19 test (either PCR or Rapid Antigen) taken within three calendar days of travel.

Alternatively it said travelers to the US may provide documentation from a licensed health care provider of having recovered from COVID-19 in the 90 days preceding travel.

The embassy said masks are required until guests reach their staterooms onboard the cruise ship.

It sad any guest who requires medicines (insulin etc.) should board with adequate stock for several days and that food and water will be provided onboard the cruise ship.

NASSAU BAHAMAS — Three years after Royal Caribbean International’s president and CEO first saw the impact of a feeding program operating out of a crowded cottage in Nassau and vowed to lend support the cruise line this week delivered its most generous gift yet — nearly $1.5 million of food weighing 675000 pounds enough to provide over two million meals.

Actually fighting back tears Bahamas Feeding Network (BFN) Executive Director Philip Smith said: “This is unbelievable the most amazing gift ever.”

Smith was looking at eight refrigerated containers stacked at Arawak Port each packed with meat poultry seafood and one packed with dry items. It was the first of three shipments expected this month and followed last year’s donation of $400000 plus 5000 turkeys for the holidays.

“I am speechless” Smith said. “There are no words to express what this means and how many people it will help feed. There are no words to express how much we love and appreciate Royal Caribbean; Michael Bayley the president; his team; everyone at Royal who has contributed to this and especially knowing that they have had no revenue in the last year because of the pandemic.”

After the last year’s suspension of sailing the cruise line announced late last month it would resume operations in June and in a novel move would begin summer voyages from Nassau creating homeporting opportunities for The Bahamas.

The first Royal Caribbean ship to return to service in the region since the shutdown Adventure of the Seas will sail from Nassau on June 12.

Royal Caribbean International President and CEO Michael Bayley has said publicly many times that Nassau was the cruise line’s first destination over 50 years ago and remains its most visited port of call today bringing more than one million guests a year to Nassau.

That close affiliation has created bonds between Royal Caribbean and a number of entities in The Bahamas including the Bahamas Chamber of Commerce and Employers’ Confederation the National Training Agency LJM Maritime Academy Music Makers and Fox Hill Original Congos Junkanoo groups the Berry Islands Community Centre the National Food Security Task Force and schools on Grand Bahama and throughout the islands.

But no alliance and no commitment has run deeper than that to the Bahamas Feeding Network.

Russell Benford vice president Government Relations Americas said: “We took a team from Royal Caribbean to Moseff house in Fox Hill where we first saw the work of Bahamas Feeding Network volunteers pouring their hearts and energy into preparing packing and distributing hot meals.

“We were blown away by what we saw and we have continued to be impressed. We are happy to help in any way we can and are determined to find a way to ramp up that assistance at this time knowing the need had increased over the last year.”

According to BFN’s latest report it has provided over 138000 food parcels since last June providing 9660000 meals. This latest donation will result in enough food parcels to feed over 500000 families.

Smith said: “We believe in ‘Just Give’ and ‘Just Love’ and Royal Caribbean has been giving and giving and giving even during challenging times and we cannot express how much we in The Bahamas appreciate and love them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHA6Ly9jYXJpYmJlYW4ubG9vcG5ld3MuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvZXZhY3VlZXMtYXJyaXZlLXNpbnQtbWFhcnRlbi12b2xjYW5vLWFmZmVjdGVkLXN0LXZpbmNlbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Evacuees arrive in Sint Maarten from volcano-affected St Vincent | Loop Caribbean News,"The management of Port St Maarten today welcomed 159 passengers aboard the Celebrity Reflection cruise ship who were evacuated from St Vincent and the Grenadines due to the eruption of La Soufriére volcano.

Prime Minister Silveria Jacobs along with other officials were present to ensure any needed assistance was rendered to the passengers.

The arriving passengers all had a negative COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours of arrival and are predominately nationals or residents of the US Canada and the United Kingdom (UK).

The Rapid Deployment Team; a trained group of crisis responders from the Foreign Development and Commonwealth Office of the UK Government and Canadian Honorary Consul Pierre DeCelles were present at Port St Maarten as well to assist the UK and Canadian passengers with their onward travel arrangements.

Some passengers needed assistance booking hotel stays or booking onward commercial airline flights from Princess Juliana International Airport (PJIA).

Prime Minister Jacobs stated: “The Government of St Maarten is pleased to have facilitated the arrival of the passengers together with Port St Maarten and all stakeholders who were involved in this operation. Sint Maarten continues to stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in St Vincent and as such we will continue to assist where possible.”

Meanwhile Minister of Justice Anna Richardson who was also present at Port St Maarten stated: ""Globally tragic events are occurring daily. Persons needing to be uprooted and moved to safer grounds can’t be a pleasant experience.

Nevertheless I am elated with the cooperation displayed by all the coordinators and service agencies. I'd like to especially thank the Immigration and Border Protection Services team for their hard work and dedicated service with processing the passengers.

I also extend appreciation to KPSM for being instrumental in escorting passengers who were against time to catch their connecting flights.""

This humanitarian operation was possible via collaboration between the Government of St Maarten Port St Maarten the United States (US) Consulate in Curaçao and Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines (RCCL).

Chilton Named 21st President of the University of New Hampshire,"Following a national search Elizabeth S. Chilton a native of the Northeast who most recently served as chancellor of Washington State University’s Pullman campus has been appointed the 21st president of the University of New Hampshire effective July 1 2024.

Chilton will succeed James W. Dean Jr. who is retiring after six years leading UNH. She was appointed the inaugural chancellor of Washington State’s Pullman campus in 2022 after joining WSU in 2020 as provost and executive vice president of the WSU system.

“UNH is a leading public university with strong student outcomes a large and diverse research portfolio and dedication to the state of New Hampshire and I am honored and humbled to have the opportunity to serve as president of this incredible institution” Chilton says. “I’ve long admired UNH’s history vibrant and engaged community and commitment to student success and scholarship. I look forward to returning to the Northeast to join the Wildcat family and help UNH serve our students and society in pursuit of a prosperous future.”

WSU Pullman is the system’s flagship and Washington State’s land grant university serving about 18000 students. Prior to becoming chancellor her role as chief academic officer included oversight of research functions across the six-campus system a role she continued in while serving as chancellor for the last two years.

A first-generation college student and a graduate of public universities Chilton is a champion for public higher education deeply committed to access and liberal arts education. She values UNH’s unique position as a leading public research institution that maintains a sharp focus on undergraduate education inspired by the university’s research mission while also remaining a strong believer in the power of a transformational undergraduate experience.

“Dr. Chilton has shown tremendous leadership and strategic vision across the academic and research enterprise and her career is a testament to the mission of public higher education” said Jamie Burnett ‘95 ‘96G ‘98G the vice-chair of the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees and chair of the presidential search committee. “She cares deeply about the student experience and is committed to advancing student success at UNH. She has a record of collaboration lifting up her peers building partnerships and creating opportunities. The UNH community and the state should have a high degree of confidence in Elizabeth’s appointment.”

Chilton’s appointment concludes a search launched last fall after Dean announced his intention to retire. A 16-member search committee comprised of representatives of the Board of Trustees faculty staff and students across UNH’s three campuses led the search.

Chilton will visit all three UNH campuses from May 9 to 11. She will spend May 9 and a portion of May 10 in Durham before visiting the Manchester and Concord campuses on the afternoon of the 10th.

“Elizabeth is a proven and versatile leader devoted to the mission and values of public land grant universities” said USNH Board Chair Alex Walker. “She brings the experience track record and capabilities to lead a multi-campus institution that is part of a larger well-coordinated public higher education system. She distinguished herself among a very strong pool of candidates as the right person to lead the University of New Hampshire in these dynamic and challenging times in higher education.”

From 2017 to 2020 Chilton was dean of the Harpur College of Arts and Sciences at Binghamton University part of the State University of New York system. Prior to that she spent 16 years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst serving in a variety of roles including professor anthropology department chair and associate vice chancellor for research and engagement.

This big-mouthed sports car promised two-plus-two seating in an even smaller lighter package than the 86 contrasting the two-seat Mazda. Though the S-FR fell off the radar Toyota apparently didn't forget about it as Japanese media indicates the S-FR is finally cleared for production.

Citing Best Car Magazine which typically publishes original reporting in print before sharing it online Forbes says the S-FR will launch in late 2026 or early 2027. It's reported to be in co-development with Daihatsu and Suzuki which were previously rumored to be working on a small mid-engined model together. It seems that project has evolved into a more conventional front-engined rear-wheel-drive coupe that'll become the S-FR—with a larger more powerful engine.

Toyota S-FR Racing Concept. Toyota

Specifically the S-FR is reported to use a three-cylinder turbo engine making around 150 horsepower to turn the rear wheels. Curiously rumors of a revived Toyota Starlet with a GR performance version specify a similar engine; 150 hp from a 1.3-liter engine downsized from the one in the GR Corolla. This also matches the displacement of the engine in the Daihatsu Vision Copen concept from October which would seem to preview Toyota's next sports car. Or at least Daihatsu's version of it.

The S-FR's design will reportedly be overhauled for production with a smaller grille and altered headlights. There was no word as to the potential implementation of the S-FR Racing concept pictured above with its aggressive rear wing canards splitter and diffuser. These could feasibly be offered as accessories or even as exclusives on a hypothetical GR model. That's purely speculative on our part though.

Price-wise Toyota is reportedly targeting the equivalent of $22700. That wouldn't just undercut the Mazda MX-5 by around $6000 but also make it one of the cheapest new cars on sale in the U.S. period—if it makes it here. Toyota is reportedly undecided about selling the S-FR in the States where it already sells the similar GR86. Offering both could easily cannibalize sales potentially without taking as much share of Mazda's pie as intended.

There's also the question of where it'd fit with the supposed Celica reboot which could culminate in a thrifty fun rear-wheel-drive coupe to compete with the Honda Prelude. It too seems like it'd contend for S-FR and GR86 customers weakening the prospects for all involved. If the S-FR does come around my money's on it staying out of the States just like the Starlet is supposed to. I mean with Mazda locking down the small sports car market and the GR86 addressing one size up why even bother?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vUG9saXRpY3MvcmZrLWpycy1jbGV2ZXItbW92ZS1lYXJuLWJhbGxvdC1hY2Nlc3MtbmF0aW9ud2lkZS9zdG9yeT9pZD0xMDk4NzIxOTfSAWhodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9Qb2xpdGljcy9yZmstanJzLWNsZXZlci1tb3ZlLWVhcm4tYmFsbG90LWFjY2Vzcy1uYXRpb253aWRlL3N0b3J5P2lkPTEwOTg3MjE5Nw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RFK Jr.'s 'clever move' to help earn ballot access nationwide: Allying with little-known parties,"""You usually don't see this kind of coordination and effort"" one expert said.

One Saturday last month several dozen members of the Alaskan Independence Party a small largely unknown political group whose primary goal is to put Alaskan secession from the United States to a vote gathered in Fairbanks for their biennial convention.

Among the topics of conversation: whether to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president.

The party ultimately rejected Kennedy who is running as an independent after a few outspoken members said they did not want him atop their 2024 ticket according to John Howe the party's chairman who was involved in the discussions.

""There was serious consideration"" Howe a machine shop owner told ABC News.

The decision to pass on Kennedy was seen as a blow to the candidate -- ""They wanted us to put him on the ballot"" Howe said -- as Kennedy works to overcome the biggest obstacle to his plans to run as a major outside candidate in November: getting on the ballot across the country.

Typically independent candidates must undergo the painstaking expensive process of gathering thousands of signatures from registered voters in each state in order to qualify for ballot access.

But a candidate can bypass those requirements if a political party that already has ballot access in a given state nominates them to lead their ticket there.

Kennedy has successfully employed that strategy in Michigan and California where he will technically appear on the ballot as the nominee for the Natural Law Party of Michigan and the American Independent Party of California.

What's more his campaign has been in contact with minor parties in at least six other states too ABC News has learned through conversations with leaders in more than a dozen minor parties across the country. (The Kennedy campaign did not return requests for comment for this story or respond to the details that the party leaders provided.)

""As the campaign sees and recognizes that these are very convenient vessels out there it's a clever move and it's not a surprise they do it"" Derek Muller a University of Notre Dame professor specializing in election law told ABC News.

Early polling of the 2024 race suggests Kennedy could take a notable amount of support in a close race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden the two leading candidates -- if Kennedy makes it on the ballot. A new ABC News/Ipsos survey of adults found Kennedy with 12% in a hypothetical five-way election with Trump Biden and two other candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein.

Kennedy's campaign claims to have made it on the ballot in 10 states so far including the battlegrounds of Michigan Nevada and North Carolina. Elections offices in three states have confirmed to ABC News that Kennedy is on the ballot. In other states officials have said they can't yet confirm his candidacy.

Kennedy's strategy of linking with minor parties has encountered both challenges and success. In some cases like Alaska the parties have rejected him while in others they are actively speaking with his campaign about nominating him.

His campaign tried and failed to earn the nomination of the Unity Party of Colorado which chose instead to back West another independent candidate Tijani Cole the party's chairman told ABC News in an email.

The Alliance Party a national group with ballot access in South Carolina has been more receptive.

""National Alliance Party leadership has begun early conversations with the campaign for potential mutual support"" Phil Feuhrer the party's national co-vice chair told ABC News in an email.

Besides nominating Kennedy to lead the party’s ticket in South Carolina Feuhrer said the party is discussing helping the Kennedy campaign gather signatures across Minnesota to appear as an independent candidate there.

""If we reach full agreement with the campaign and our internal statewide leadership teams it would include placement onto the South Carolina ballot as well as the Minnesota Independence-Alliance taking lead on placing the campaign onto the Minnesota ballot"" Feuhrer added using the official name of Minnesota's branch of the party.

""Those conversations are young and still ongoing"" he said.

Kennedy's camp is also in talks with the Reform Party which has ballot access in Florida and Mississippi according to party leaders.

Jenniffer Desatoff the party's Florida chair told ABC News they are ""continuing communication with the Kennedy campaign at this time."" (Kennedy's campaign also contacted the Ecology Party of Florida but was informed the party does not have a ballot line in the presidential race the party's chair Cara Campbell told ABC News.)

Elsewhere the Kennedy campaign twice reached out to representatives of the Constitution Party which has ballot access in nearly a dozen states but the party and the campaign were never able to connect Donna Ivanovich a spokeswoman for the party told ABC News.

Meanwhile Kennedy has formed a party of its own We the People to secure ballot access in several states including in Delaware Hawaii and North Carolina. In those states the signature threshold to make the ballot is lower for candidates aligned with a party than for independent candidates.

Although other independent candidates ally with minor parties for ballot access -- like West is also doing in the 2024 race -- the breadth and ""coordination"" of Kennedy's effort stands out said Muller the Notre Dame election law expert.

""You usually don't see this kind of coordination and effort because the candidacies are usually not serious enough to make the outreach to all these parties in all these different states"" he told ABC News.

But by aligning himself with small often niche parties Kennedy risks absorbing the burden of their sometimes checkered history some observers warned.

The American Independent Party of California which nominated Kennedy last month had backed George Wallace the former Alabama governor and notorious segregationist in the 1960s.

In a video announcing his nomination Kennedy acknowledged the party's past support for Wallace but said it ""has had its own rebirth even before I came along.""

""It's been reborn as a party that represents not bigotry and hatred but rather compassion unity idealism and common sense"" he said.

Another problem with wooing minor parties is that Kennedy's beliefs sometimes don't align with theirs.

The members of the Alaskan Independence Party who rejected Kennedy as the party's nominee were wary he would agree with them on their view that government-owned land should be given back to Alaskans Howe the party chairman told ABC News.

But Kennedy's chances at winning the nomination may have sunk days before the convention when he failed to win over the previous chair of the Alaskan Independence Party Bob Bird in a radio interview with Bird.

""The AIP will not be placing RFK on the ballot"" Bird wrote in a column after the interview casting Kennedy as an outsider.

""Our liberty and prosperity must come from within ourselves"" Bird wrote ""not from a knight galloping in from the Lower 48.""

ABC News' Isabella Murray and Oren Oppenheim contributed to this report.

Editor's note: This story has been corrected to clarify that the Alliance Party does not have automatic ballot access in Minnesota."

Leading stock indexes continued their winning streak with S&P 500 maintaining the uptrend for the fourth week in a row and hitting a new high.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 34000-mark for the first time adding around 150 points in the last session. The sentiment was buoyed by encouraging retail sales data and reports of jobless claims falling.

The first-quarter earnings season got off to a good start with banking giants JPMorgan Chase Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs unveiling their latest financial data mid-week. They were joined by software firm Infosys on Wednesday.

The spotlight stayed on financial services Thursday also when the closely followed reports of Citigroup and Bank of America came out. Delta Air Lines and soft-drink behemoth PepsiCo released earnings on the same day. The first phase of bank earnings concluded on Friday with Morgan Stanley’s blockbuster Q1 report.

It’s going to be mixed bag next week. For instance the companies scheduled to report on April 19 include United Airlines Holdings IBM and Coca-Cola. The important corporate houses preparing to report on April 20 comprise Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson as well as streaming giant Netflix which has been thriving on the COVID-driven boom. The earning reports of superbike company Harley-Davidson and Lockheed Martin are also slated for Tuesday.

The other major companies that can elicit investor interest include Halliburton Verizon Communications Chipotle Mexican Grill and Kinder Morgan – the companies will report earnings on April 21. The next day it is the turn of American Airlines and Southwest Airlines as well as tech firms AT&T and Intel. American Express is probably the only big player to report on April 23.

The market was abuzz with the news of Microsoft’s $20-billion buyout of cloud software company Nuance Communications. In another important deal in the cloud space Datadog completed the acquisition of the SaaS-based security platform Sqreen.

The otherwise quiet M&A market witnessed Dell Technologies becoming two standalone public companies by spinning off its 81% ownership in VMware. The other major deals include Amgen’s $2-billion purchase of Five Prime Therapeutics and the acquisition of Upchain by software firm Autodesk.

MARION - The title of the last completed mural might just be the moniker for the team that is already working on the biggest mural yet in the Marion Murals series in the new downtown historic district.

In this case a hardworking team is getting the job done.

""All You Need"" another concept designed by Marion Cultural and Civic Center Executive Director Josh Benson is a nod to the Beatles' iconic Abbey Road album cover.

Located at the corner of Union and Madison it is directly across from ""Purple Rain"" on the Union Street Arts building.

Benson said he is enjoying the murals project especially with great help from the community members like Luke O'Neill Haley Ottolini and Morgan Griffith.

""A big thanks for this mural goes to building owner Theresa Stearns for allowing us this canvas"" said Benson who also thanked Sherwin Williams of Marion one of the partners on the project.

Just a few days after completing ""All You Need"" Benson is teaming up with O'Neill and Marion native and artist Shawn Vincelette for ""Statue of Freedom"" which will adorn the side of The Citadel.

Benson said the new project is the biggest mural yet.

The team finished prepping the building on Saturday and work began on Monday morning.

Vincelette said he expects the project to take about two weeks.

Vincelette is the artist for the first of the murals recreating a piece from his ""Marion Landmark Series"" that covers the south side of the building owned by Steve Fowler that houses Lavish Bath Box.

Marion Mayor Mike Absher is encouraging visitors to the city's Facebook page to stop by one of the murals snap a photo and post it to the page using the #MarionMurals.

tween Chicago and the East Coast could cost similar to providing a

station free of freight train interference on downtown’s lakefront.

The open door for creating this transportation center could soon

close with more development at Tower City (KJP).

All Aboard Ohio’s Board of Directors voted unanimously this week to favor Tower City Center as the site for a proposed Amtrak mini-hub. But the Board of the non-profit passenger rail and transit advocacy association noted that it would not oppose development of the existing Amtrak station site as the transportation hub.

The statewide group said that Amtrak’s proposed mini-hub at Cleveland makes a major capital improvement like this justifiable. It didn’t make sense with Amtrak running just one or two trains each day in the middle of the night. But Amtrak’s proposed Cleveland mini-hub would bring significant new passenger traffic and business activity to downtown Cleveland.

The Board said the timing of its statement urging restoration of Tower City Center the former Cleveland Union Terminal (CUT) as the city main railroad terminal was motivated by these factors:

Amtrak is proposing new routes and expanded services on existing routes that could grow its passenger rail services at Cleveland from four nightly trains to 22 trains a day arriving and departing around the clock. Amtrak passenger boardings at Cleveland may grow from 50000 per year (or one-fifth of Greyhound’s traffic here) currently to 500000-1 million (or up to one-fifth of Hopkins International Airport’s annual traffic). This passenger traffic is based on rail service levels existing at other mid-sized metro areas;

Amtrak passenger boardings at Cleveland may grow from 50000 per year (or one-fifth of Greyhound’s traffic here) currently to 500000-1 million (or up to one-fifth of Hopkins International Airport’s annual traffic). This passenger traffic is based on rail service levels existing at other mid-sized metro areas; Development is possibly on the horizon for the Riverview parking lots between Huron and Canal roads that could end further consideration of the remaining opportunity for restoring Tower City Center as a railroad station unless actions were taken now to preserve a railroad right of way below any development and inclusion of station facilities in any development planned by Bedrock Real Estate or its partners and affiliates;

for the Riverview parking lots between Huron and Canal roads that could end further consideration of the remaining opportunity for restoring Tower City Center as a railroad station unless actions were taken now to preserve a railroad right of way below any development and inclusion of station facilities in any development planned by Bedrock Real Estate or its partners and affiliates; Sherwin-Williams has donated to the City of Cleveland the property on which its John G. Breen Technology Center sets prior to relocation to Brecksville in 2024. With the research facility gone it allows for the western throat of an Amtrak station at Tower City Center to be built around the Stokes Federal Courthouse.

Moments after departing Cleveland Union Terminal (now Tower

City Center) in 1971 Erie-Lackawanna’s afternoon commuter

train picks up speed bound for Youngstown (Dave Mackay).

All Aboard Ohio said the biggest reason for developing Amtrak’s mini-hub at Tower City Center is because the region’s rail transit and bus hub is already in and next to Tower City. Plus the proximity of many businesses and attractions the potential for co-locating with an expansion of the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad having a station free of interference from freight trains and a crossing of the Cuyahoga River that won’t further inconvenience boaters and commercial shipping are important reasons too.

The nonprofit organization said it spoke up now because time could soon run out on considering Tower City Center as an Amtrak mini-hub. Future development may possibly encroach on the Riverview parking lots between Huron and Canal roads. This may well be the last opportunity to restore passenger railroad service to what was the Cleveland Union Terminal. Cleveland has a good back-up location on the lakefront but All Aboard Ohio said it would like to see the better location explored now before it’s too late.

Here is additional detail on why All Aboard Ohio said Tower City Center is a superior location for an Amtrak mini-hub station in Downtown Cleveland:

Today restoration of passenger rail service at Tower City Center

would have to be sited differently than it was decades ago due

to development encroaching on the former Cleveland Union

Terminal rights of way. But other changes like the departure

of Sherwin-Williams’ research center will create opportu-

nities for restoring stations here (KJP).

Greater Cleveland’s public transportation hub is located at Tower City Center and outside its front door on Public Square. Not only is Tower City the hub of all rail rapid transit lines but the downtown Cleveland routes of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA) Akron Metro RTA Laketran Portage Area RTA and Stark Area RTA all converge on Public Square.

Tower City Center is also within a five-minute walk of more employers hotels restaurants shops and attractions than the lakefront station site. And it offers the potential for air-rights development above the station tracks and related facilities something that is more complicated above tracks that also host freight trains especially those carrying hazardous materials as is the case on the lakefront.

Railroad rights of way accessing Tower City Center remain largely intact even though tracks were removed shortly after railroad passenger service to CUT ended in 1977. They are mostly owned by GCRTA and exist parallel to GCRTA rail rapid transit tracks which Amtrak trains cannot use due to federal regulations regarding crash impact standards as well as insufficient lateral clearances.

The 2002 construction of the Stokes Federal Courthouse on CUT’s west throat had presented an obstacle. But during the West Shore Corridor Alternatives Analysis a decade ago Parsons Brinckerhoff (now WSP) showed that railroad commuter trains from Lorain could enter a station built on the former CUT coach yards now the Riverview parking lot. It required building above Canal Road to avoid the Stokes Federal Courthouse. But now Canal Road can be rerouted or removed and the western throat to a Tower City Amtrak station built where Sherwin-Williams Breen Technology Center is now located after its probable demolition sometime after 2024.

Numerous cities throughout the United States are restoring or

expanding their historic railroad stations for their intended pur-

poses. This is the historic Denver Union Station which was

being modernized and dramatically expanded in 2013 to

accommodate regional passenger trains (Ryan Dravitz).

Amtrak officials expressed to All Aboard Ohio their desire for having a station in Cleveland with operations that will have to contend with few if any freight trains. A station at Tower City Center would offer that. To enjoy this same benefit at a lakefront station would involve rerouting freight trains to a ?Lakefront Bypass? just south of downtown Cleveland requiring the investment of about $200 million to add tracks to existing Norfolk Southern rights of way.

Tower City Center offers the potential for a shared station facility with the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad (CVSR) offering enhanced visitor access to the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. CVSR has long desired an extension of their train services to downtown Cleveland which according to past studies would result in annual ridership growing from about 200000 passengers per year to more than 300000. Direct CVSR service to the lakefront is not operationally or economically feasible.

Another advantage of a Tower City Center station is that trains would cross the busy navigable portion of the Cuyahoga River on a high-level bridge. On the lakefront that crossing is via a drawbridge that must be raised and lowered every time any boat larger than a small recreational watercraft seeks passage. The railroad has the legal right of way here which causes significant traffic jams of boats and larger lake carrier ships. Increasing rail passenger traffic on the lakefront will worsen this waterway congestion and negatively impact commercial shipping.

Cleveland’s tiny Amtrak station on the lakefront is served only by

four pre-dawn trains. Yet they provide a brief bit of nightlife to

downtown’s windswept lakefront as seen here in 2015 (KJP).

Lastly Greyhound bus service is likely to follow Amtrak into a new or expanded station facility in Cleveland as has happened throughout Ohio and the nation. Greyhound traffic is about 250000 passenger boardings per year in Cleveland. A multi-modal transportation center that combines Greyhound with an Amtrak mini-hub would consolidate passenger boardings and improve connectivity between transportation modes. At stations where Amtrak and Greyhound co-locate total passenger boardings have typically increased by about 20 percent.

While the former CUT rights of way are mostly intact some uses have encroached upon the right of way in the past four decades. In nearly all situations there is sufficient room for the new uses and the restored railroad track to co-exist. For example through Ohio City the CUT right of way was built to accommodate six tracks (two for rapid transit and four for railroad). There is room to shift the existing Red Line Greenway closer to Columbus Road to allow for two Amtrak tracks to be constructed. In other locations such as on the east side of Tower City RTA tracks and electrical installations would have to be moved slightly to accommodate Amtrak tracks.

Here is 2019 passenger boarding data (and change from the prior year) for Amtrak stations that have Amtrak service levels in the 14-28 trains per day range plus 2019 Cleveland Hopkins International Airport passenger enplanements data:

Albany NY 26 trains/day 806960 boardings +0.08%

Seattle WA 14 trains/day 682132 boardings -0.06%

Milwaukee WI 16 trains/day 639713 boardings +5.8%

Portland OR 16 trains/day 585344 boardings +1.6%

Lancaster PA 28 trains/wkday 16 Sa/Su 577305 boardings +1.7%

St. Louis MO 14 trains/day 354304 boardings -2%

Cleveland Hopkins International Airport 4894541 enplanements +4%

With an Amtrak station Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad station and Greyhound station all combined under one roof at Tower City Center the total passenger traffic from all three modes could exceed 1.3 million boardings per year.

Developing an Amtrak mini-hub that’s largely free of freight train

traffic on downtown Cleveland’s lakefront will require relocating

freight trains to a bypass route just south of downtown. That may

be as expensive as restoring Tower City Center/Cleveland Union

Terminal (below) but without as many of the benefits as serving

the transportation center on Public Square (KJP).

In its new iteration the program will focus especially on SMBs considered poised to grow quickly and focused on addressing climate change the release stated.

“The findings of our recent Springboard to Recovery report showed that scale-ups will be crucial to U.K. economic recovery post COVID-19” said NatWest’s Andrew Harrison head of Business Banking and Entrepreneurship in the release. “Scale-ups are 50 percent more productive than other [SMBs] but at present only 2.5 percent of all businesses fall into the scale-up category. That’s why we’re relaunching our Enterprise program to help more [SMBs] reach this next level of growth and productivity.”

NatWest will work with 1400 businesses throughout the U.K. under the program the release stated. It has created 50 new positions “to ensure these businesses are given appropriate tailored support.”

After the onset of the pandemic the model NatWest adopted included virtual events coaching sessions and one-on-one support for entrepreneurs according to the release. Prior to the pandemic the young businesses would have been housed in accelerator hubs.

“Over the course of this year the bank aims to support those on the program through a blended model resuming use of its hubs once coronavirus guidelines allow in conjunction with virtual aspects of the program that have proved most valuable to entrepreneurs over the last year” the release stated.

NatWest “is committing to supporting 35000 entrepreneurs through its Enterprise programs in 2021 and a further 200000 interventions with future entrepreneurs through mentoring webinars and coaching” according to the release.

The bank’s efforts have led to the creation of nearly 1300 jobs to date the release stated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVycG9vbGVjaG8uY28udWsvbmV3cy9saXZlcnBvb2wtbmV3cy9jb25jZXJuLWxpdmVycG9vbC1wcm9wZXJ0eS1jb21wYW55LWNvbGxhcHNlcy0yMDM4ODQwMNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVycG9vbGVjaG8uY28udWsvbmV3cy9saXZlcnBvb2wtbmV3cy9jb25jZXJuLWxpdmVycG9vbC1wcm9wZXJ0eS1jb21wYW55LWNvbGxhcHNlcy0yMDM4ODQwMC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Concern as Liverpool property company collapses owing creditors millions,"Investors have expressed concern after a Liverpool property company entered into liquidation owing creditors millions of pounds.

North West Development Consortium Ltd (NWDC) formerly known as YPG Group Ltd entered into liquidation last year.

An Estimated Deficiency Report by the Insolvency Service states that the company owes £9126084.34 to creditors many of who are local independent companies. According to the same figures £3.8m is owed to YPG related companies.

YPG managing director Ming Yeung has claimed that £1.4m has been paid out to creditors so far which would reduce total liabilities to £7726082.94. Mr Yeung also said that the company's property schemes would all be completed.

NWDC formed part of the Yeung Property Group of companies which is behind a number of property schemes in Liverpool city centre.

YPG has been behind plans to build new apartment complexes in a neglected part of the city re-branded as the Fabric District. The company is also behind a major apartment project on the waterfront called Kings Dock Mills and Hamilton Hub and Pembroke Studios.

A representative for investors in YPG's schemes in Liverpool contacted the ECHO. He said: ""We are concerned that NWDC is now in liquidation. According to the official creditors list the company owes millions. Many of the companies owed large sums of money are local  independent businesses. This concerns us.

""There have been delays on a number of YPG schemes such as Kings Dock Mills Fabric Village and Hamilton Studios. We also note that NWDC was formerly YPG Group Ltd. The company changed its name months before it entered into liquidation. This concerns us too.""

Mr Yeung said that sister company YPG Developments Ltd would now ensure all schemes were delivered and completed.

Mr Yeung also said that over £1m had been paid out to contractors following the collapse of NWDC.

He said: ""The contracting company went into liquidation due to losses incurred from contractual errors caused by management issues. We also experienced cost overruns which has made the contracts unviable .

""The company name was changed as at one point we had an interested party wanting to buy the company and we didn’t want the YPG brand to go with the sale. The sale subsequently didn’t materialise and the company went into liquidation.

""The majority of the creditors on the list are from within our own group. We have paid in excess of £1.4m already to sub contractors on revised contracts that has covered their loss

""We granted them new contracts under YPG Developments Ltd and we increased their contract value to take into consideration the loss that YPG Group Ltd had affected them.""

Mr Yeung told the ECHO that although some of the YPG schemes were behind schedule the liquidation of NWDC was not a particular concern. He said that the pandemic had caused major problems for the company over the last year.

He said: ""This does not affect any of the projects as it was a construction company and didn’t own any property.

""All the schemes were unaffected as YPG Developments Ltd took over all the build contracts and has honoured all contractual liabilities and made good the errors caused by bad on site management decisions.

""Due to the pandemic most of the projects have encountered delays. The delays give rise to re-negotiations with our funders which are currently underway.

""On Kings Dock Mills 90 apartments have reached practical completion and are undergoing their legal conveyance. New terms have been agreed with the funder for an extension and we expect to resume the remaining completion of the 125 apartments within weeks. We hope to complete in the summer of this year.

""Fabric Residence had its delays initially because funding for the scheme was hampered due to legal constraints. Under recent case law a funder would normally get a first charge ( a type of mortgage) and that would suffice. However recently funding has been difficult due to unilateral notices ( granted to buyers of apartments) placed upon the title ( the deeds) by onward purchasers which previously had no bearing on funders. We tried very hard to get funding and after a long period we finally found a lender that would assist despite the unilateral notices.

""The pandemic has also played a major part in additional delays. We are on site and work is progressing . This is now expected to complete in October this year.

""Hamilton Studios is 75% complete and we have been awaiting some documentation from the freeholder and work is due to recommence . Again the pandemic has caused delays with tenants and also the build programme.

""Renshaw Street is a hotel scheme but during 2020 the appetite for hospitality ventures has diminished. We took the decision to sell the site on and currently we have a buyer that is looking to purchase the site.""

""It has been a very difficult year for property developers and we have not been spared by the ensuing aftermath.""

Mr Yeung 53 told the ECHO that the company had enjoyed some success in the Cleethorpes area during the pandemic.

He said: ""We have completed 40 houses and a major leisure scheme involving major brands such as Costa Coffee. So there are success stories too.""",,,,,,,,,

The company was also responsible for Pokken Tournament for Wii U and arcades – as well as the Switch port that released later on.

Perhaps unsurprisingly it was Pokken Tournament that ultimately led Bandai Namco being able to work on New Pokemon Snap. Director Haruki Suzaki mentioned that to IGN and also confirmed that the team was able to speak with some of the original Pokemon Snap developers while tackling the Switch project.

Suzaki said:

“Pokken Tournament utilized Bandai Namco Studio’s strengths and it made Pokémon appealing in a new way. Because of this we got another opportunity to do something together again and this led to the development of New Pokémon Snap. We were able to talk with the developers [from the original game] and the project started with the involvement of many people.”

Switch owners can look forward to playing New Pokemon Snap on April 30.

Emily Ratajkowski joked that she’s ‘always breastfeeding’ after welcoming first child Sylvester.

The model gave birth to the little one last month announcing the news on Instagram with a sweet snap.

Taking to Instagram the 29-year-old shared a snap as she fed the newborn making a joke about her recent social media antics.

‘If it seems like I’m always breastfeeding it’s because I am’ she told her followers.

Laura Whitmore was among the fans living for the post with the Love Island host sliding into the comments to pen: ‘I hear ya!’

‘Yes.. that’s basically your life when breastfeeding… all the f*ing time’ another follower agreed.

An Instagram user replied: ‘Yup those early days it’s 24/7. You’re doing great mama.’

‘Such a special time enjoy every second’ one urged.

Emily welcomed baby Sylvester into the world with husband Sebastian Bear-McClard in March sharing the first glimpse of the tot five weeks ago.

‘Sylvester Apollo Bear has joined us earth side’ she wrote alongside a photo as she cuddled him in her hospital bed.

‘Sly arrived 3/8/21 on the most surreal beautiful and love-filled morning of my life.’

The Gone Girl actress previously confirmed that the new parents were planning on raising their child in a gender-neutral household.

Lifting the lid on her thoughts on motherhood she told Vogue: ‘When my husband and I tell friends that I’m pregnant their first question after “Congratulations” is almost always “Do you know what you want?”

‘We like to respond that we won’t know the gender until our child is 18 and that they’ll let us know then. Everyone laughs at this.’

‘There is a truth to our line though one that hints at possibilities that are much more complex than whatever genitalia our child might be born with: the truth that we ultimately have no idea who – rather than what – is growing inside my belly.’

5 The background of some of Chloe's photos have had fans suspecting editing

But her followers noticed something strange about the shape of the fence she was leaning on after she posted the snap on Instagram.

She was also accused of Photoshopping yet another of her sexy snaps.

The reality star came under fire from fans who begged her to lead a better example to ""young girls"".

The Geordie Shore favourite shared two photos on Monday that left fans claiming she had edited her bum as they spotted an odd detail in the background.

5 Fans have noticed small photoshop fails

Chloe drew attention to her shapely bottom as she wrote: ""A man that can hold the door for you and smack your [bum].""

But the star who posed in a tight brown jumpsuit was swiftly called out by eagle-eyed followers who noticed the editing lines along her legs and ""bowed"" lines on the boxes on the shelves behind her.

One follower kicked off a thread of comments that criticised the celeb writing: ""Shame it's another photoshop.. Seeing as the white box is bowed.""

Another replied: ""Can literally see the outline right down her right leg where they f***ed it up.""

In June her followers pointed out several curiosities in a racy red lingerie post with curved lines and sharp angles usually tell-tale signs a slimming tool has been used.

Followers also pointed out her wonky door in one underwear snap this April.

The star opened up about her impressive weight loss revealing that she has gone from 11 stone seven pounds to nine stone nine pounds in just 12 months."

After years of being engaged the couple’s foundations were seemingly shaken up by the rampant speculations that A-Rod cheated on JLo with Southern Charm starlet Madison LeCroy. Everyone denied the allegations but amid the split between what the Internet affectionately calls “Mom” and “Dad” LeCroy and another former co-star have chosen to comment on the situation.

The highly dramatic reunion special for Southern Charm this year is where all the controversy began when Craig Conover accused Madison LeCroy of bragging about sleeping with an “ex-MLB player.” When it finally came out that the MLB player in question was allegedly A-Rod LeCroy denied any cheating and that A-Rod was an “acquaintance” who she only spoke with on the phone. She has since been relatively quiet about the dissolution of A-Rod and JLo’s relationship but following the break-up announcement LeCroy simply said to Page Six:

I wish them the best.

Madison LeCroy’s statement though short and unemotional might come across a bit as sprinkling a little salt in the wound. She wishes them the best but her alleged contact with Alex Rodriguez is what ignited the speculation. Even so in Rodriguez and Jennifer’s Lopez’s statement they make no mention of LeCroy at all and merely allude that they are “better as friends” and will continue to “support each other.” For the most part they all seem to want to keep it courteous.

At the same time though the Southern Charm star and single mom is getting a lot more flack across the board for what allegedly took place with Alex Rodriguez. LeCroy was reportedly single and unattached during these occurrences while A-Rod was obligated and very much engaged to JLo.

Ahead of A-Rod and JLo’s announcement of their split however another Southern Charm star threw her hat in the arena. Cameran Eubanks was a major staple on all seasons of the Bravo show even being figuratively referred to as the mom of a bunch of Peter Pans before her sudden exit last year. She told US Weekly:

It’s pretty crazy. I feel bad for Austen. I feel bad for J. Lo but crazy!

Cameran Eubank’s comments allude to the exes involved: Jennifer Lopez and Southern Charm bro Austen Kroll. Southern Charm captured the pretty tumultuous relationship between Kroll and Madison LeCroy over the last few seasons. But again LeCroy seems to be getting the majority of criticisms when Kroll actually di cheat on her (proven via video footage). Allegedly talking to an engaged man even when you’re single is bad form – but not a crime.

But I much like Cameran Eubanks feel bad mostly for JLo. She is a triple threat practically a cultural institution and we can only wish her the best moving forward.",,,,,,,,,

Maggie Myers says they got kicked off their Southwest Airlines flight on Friday. She says her 2-year-old son was having a hard time keeping his mask on.

TRENDING:

A flight attendant came up to them and said he had to keep it on for the flight. Myers says they were doing their best to have him keep it on.

She says the flight was booked at 31% capacity and her family had negative tests.

""We had not encountered this problem on any other flights so far and then they just decided that this was the one ya know? And so the fact that he put the mask on and he still refused to let us stay on the flight was just really upsetting"" said Myers.

The family was set to board another flight Saturday afternoon.

Southwest Airlines released the following statement about the incident:

While we regret any inconvenience this family experienced while traveling federal law requires each person 2 years of age and older to wear a mask at all times throughout the travel journey. Not wearing a mask is a violation of federal law. To assist this family with completing their travel Southwest rebooked them for free on a later flight to their destination.

The potential electrical problem that prompted airlines to remove some 737 MAX planes from service has been found in more areas of the plane than initially known a report said Friday.

Boeing said on April 9 that the issue discovered during the manufacturing process requires ""verification that a sufficient ground path exists for a component of the electrical power system.""

But The Wall Street Journal citing Boeing reported Friday that the manufacturing issue affects ""more areas of the flight deck than previously known.""

Boeing did not directly comment on The Wall Street Journal report but said it plans to develop guidelines with Federal Aviation Administration oversight.

""Boeing is working with customers on service bulletins that will be submitted to the FAA for approval"" a Boeing spokesman said.

""The bulletins focus on ensuring a sufficient ground path in the flight deck of affected airplanes"" he added.

Southwest Airlines United Airlines and American Airlines all said last week that they were removing some of their MAX planes from service following the Boeing announcement. Boeing said it notified 16 carriers in all of the issue.

Shares of Boeing fell 1.2 percent to $248.18 losing ground following reports of the problem.

The electrical issue is a setback after the MAX was cleared in November 2020 to return to service after a 20-month grounding following two fatal crashes.

""Specific details regarding investigators' latest findings are scarce at the moment but it's troubling to learn that the electrical defect is being found in other parts of the plane"" said Briefing.com.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 0.32%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

Metric Q1 2024 Q1 2024 Analysts Estimate Q1 2023 % Change Adjusted EPS $0.56 $0.55 ($0.41) N/A Revenue $3.87 billion $3.83 billion $3.93 billion (1.5%) Gross margin 28.6% N/A 21.2% 7.4 percentage points

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtbnlzZS0xNjE0NDAyNzEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange you may begin.

Dennis Lange: Thank you Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 first quarter webcast. Here today in addition to myself is Don Allan President and CEO; Chris Nelson COO EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning Don Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.

And as we normally do we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO Don Allan.

Don Allan: Thank you Dennis and good morning everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy. We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022.

Story continues

Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results. Specifically we have captured 1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024 consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations. We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months.

As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20% which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business. We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as widebody plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.

We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023 ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award. Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.

Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29% up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50 up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. On April 1 we completed the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet. Looking forward in 2024 we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.

I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.

Chris Nelson: Thank you Don and good morning everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor first quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion down 1% organically versus prior year as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand which pressured volume. Pricing was relatively flat consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Now turning to the product lines.

Power tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand. Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data which showed an early start to the season versus prior year. We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last two years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory which pressured shipments in the quarter.

We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the UK.

We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America Brazil Mexico Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary for Tools & Outdoor we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands market activation and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to the long-term shareholder returns.

I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure. Within the Industrial segment Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening. Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1% an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity.

A toolbox filled with an array of different tools representing the professional products of the company.

This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.

DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site. Additionally our TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive.

We believe these innovations coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT Craftsman and STANLEY. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.

Pat Hallinan: Thanks Chris and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately 145 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the period bringing our aggregate savings to approximately 1.2 billion since program inception. As we focus our portfolio streamline our business structure and transform our operations our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.

Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming which are more event-driven will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.

We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025. And -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter which affected five sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year. Regarding product platforming this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.

In aggregate our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024 improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately 360 million where we've traditionally averaged a roughly 700 million increase in the first quarter of the year.

Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024 we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives.

These items combined with organic cash generation support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent investing in organic growth and our transformation funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024 and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year.

We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.

Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024.

These are designed to accelerate innovation market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley brands. This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.

Our adjusted EPS range remains $1 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely relating to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024 with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.

Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25% with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile. In summary we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion cash generation balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don.

Don Allan: Thank you Pat. As we report another quarter of progress our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands particularly DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2x to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening. We are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. With that we are now ready for Q&A Dennis.

Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks Don. Shannon we can now start the Q&A please. Thank you.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

According to an Allegra Survey 63% of respondents prefer to get their coffee through a drive-thru over going inside.

It was only around the corner from the city’s first Starbucks which opened in 2003.

McCrossin liked the area for many reasons but among them was taking advantage of the research the coffee chain’s had done when opening in that area.

“If I could just tap into a small percentage that they believe will go to their coffee shop plus there’s a whole sector of customers who would go to independents” McCrossin said.

Now a decade later the opposite is happening.

With a new focus on drive-thru and off-premise sales — aided recently by the COVID-19 pandemic new free-standing Starbucks locations are emerging in Columbia at a blistering pace growing by more than one third in the past year to 19 with more to come.

It would seemingly create a conundrum for independent coffee shops but local owners see the emergence of more coffee as a potential benefit. Local shops have had their own rise recently as well with at least five opening since 2019.

“It’s a rising tide the more people that drink coffee the better off more coffee shops are and I think it ultimately kind of helps ... put specialty shops a little more into the limelight” McCrossin said.

Starbucks seems to have decided Columbia is a major growth market but the company does not discuss its regional strategy. It did not respond to a request for comment.

Since March 2020 Starbucks has opened at least six new locations in the Midlands according to a listing kept by the website Starbucks Everywhere which is not affiliated with the company.

During that same time Greenville added three Starbucks locations and the Charleston market added one according to the website.

In the Columbia area all these new cafes feature drive-thru lanes. That includes prominent commuter corridors such as the BullStreet District and Millwood Avenue near downtown and Lake Murray Boulevard in Irmo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3Mtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWZyZW5jaC10b2FzdC1zaGFrZW4tZXNwcmVzc28v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Secret Starbucks Order Everyone Is Trying Right Now,"Starbucks regulars might be aware there's been a shortage of oat milk lately… but there's certainly no shortage of Starbucks coffee hacks out there right now.

JOHNS COUNTY Fla. – Three people were killed and five others were injured early Saturday morning in a head-on collision of a pickup truck and an SUV on State Road 13 according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

Troopers believe a pickup truck heading south on SR-13 just after 1 a.m. veered out of its lane and hit a northbound SUV near the Shands Bridge. Seven people from Pompano Beach were inside that SUV three of which were juveniles.

According to the FHP preliminary report a man and two women were killed two other people were critically injured and another three suffered serious injuries.

The driver of the pickup a 21-year-old from St. Augustine was among those hospitalized with critical injuries.

According to FHP five people were not wearing seatbelts including one that was killed. A 2-year-old girl who was not restrained was critically injured.

All lanes of State Road 13 were blocked just north of the Shands Bridge for hours Saturday morning. Lanes have reopened in the area.

A woman contacted News4Jax saying the family who lost the three loved ones in the crash has a GoFundMe account set up to help pay for funeral costs.

According to News4Jax records at least one person has died in a crash every day in the last week. Three of the deadly crashes involved drivers crossing lanes into oncoming traffic or changing lanes:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFubC5nb3YvYXJnb25uZS1pbXBhY3RzL21pc3NvdXJp0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Missouri,"University of Missouri researchers use Advanced Photon Source to characterize semiconductor material potentially useful for solar cells

Researchers are looking at perovskites shown here a type of material that could have transformational potential in new generations of solar cells. (Image by Shutterstock/Audio und werbung.)

Researchers from the University of Missouri in collaboration with scientists from the University of Western Cape in South Africa and physicists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory have developed a new way to make hybrid perovskites — a combination of organic and inorganic semiconducting materials — that could form the basis of new solar cells or other electronic devices.

University of Missouri physicist Suchismita (Suchi) Guha and her collaborators improved the methods for making lead halide perovskites. Previous techniques for making these thin-film perovskites required liquid processing using solvents which rendered the perovskite films susceptible to degradation when exposed to air. Additionally with this prior manufacturing process part of the perovskite undergoes a temperature-dependent phase change to its structure causing performance limitations in real-world operating conditions.

With the new technique which paired chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with an additional step using a chloride ion the researchers were able to prevent the phase change in the perovskite holding it in a stable structure throughout a large temperature range. Additionally the CVD technique rendered the perovskite air stable making it appropriate for a potential solar cell.

The structure of the perovskite was analyzed at Argonne’s Advanced Photon Source.

Argonne partners with Washington University in St. Louis to deconstruct how photosynthesis works

Researchers solve a critical part of the mystery of photosynthesis uncovering an engineered version of a protein complex that switches the use of photosynthetic pathways. This discovery could improve human-made devices such as solar panels and sensors. (Image by Shutterstock/Quality Stock Arts.)

Scientists have long sought to understand photosynthesis the process by which plants and other organisms use the sun’s energy to create their own food. In a breakthrough discovery researchers from the DOE Argonne National Laboratory and Washington University in St. Louis have detected how modified photosynthetic proteins capture light and use it to initiate a series of electron transfer reactions.

Scientists traced the movement of electrons to discover how work is accomplished inside the cell of a photosynthetic organism. After a plant absorbs sunlight electrons normally take only one of two possible pathways. Scientists engineered a protein complex to disable one pathway and enable the other changing the electron’s direction. The team’s findings move science closer to harnessing the flow of energy — a feat that promises to greatly enhance the efficiency of many solar-powered devices including solar panels and sensors.

Aerospace team harnesses the power of supercomputers to study aircraft drag

Using supercomputers at the ALCF  researchers simulated the flight of long-haul transport aircraft to understand how to reduce drag and save fuel. (Image by Skycolors/Shutterstock.)

In flight airplanes experience a resistive drag that slows their motion and requires great amounts of fuel to overcome. For long-haul aircraft — planes designed for 6- to 12-hour flights — this friction accounts for about half the total drag. Reducing drag promises to slash the amount of fuel required and limit the environmental impact. Researchers at the Missouri University of Science and Technology and NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton Virginia used supercomputers at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) to study drag.

Drag is caused by friction between the plane’s surface and the air. For shapes like airplane wings the effects of friction are confined to the boundary layer a thin region near the wing’s surface. The resistive force associated with the boundary layer is relatively modest when fluid motion is regular and ordered but becomes chaotic at high speeds because of turbulent motion.

The study focused on the backward-angling swept-wings similar to those on most aircraft and whose dynamics are difficult to predict and control. Using high-performance computing the team conducted petascale simulations of the entire process. Their findings may impact the design of many devices besides aircraft such as wind turbines.

The ALCF is a DOE Office of Science User facility.

Argonne MU partner on novel technique to advance how semiconductors are made

Argonne chemists Jeff Elam left and Anil Mane right and colleagues developed a molecular layer etching technique that may help advance microelectronics manufacturing. (Image by Argonne National Laboratory.)

Argonne and a team led by Matthias Young at MU have developed a new technique that could pack more circuitry onto semiconductors increasing the speed and capability of computers. Known as molecular layer etching (MLE) the technique promises to usher in new pathways for fabricating materials at nanoscale.

Microelectronics like semiconductor devices are at the heart of the technologies we use each day. To make them smaller and faster manufacturers cram in more and more circuitry onto films and 3D structures. Today this happens by using thin film deposition and etching to grow or remove films one layer at a time.

MLE can be used to design microscopic architectures enabling manufacturers and researchers to develop new ways of making nanostructures. The process may also be a safer option because it is free of halogens the harsh components of chemicals common in other etching processes.

This means that instead of using the old fashioned physical SIM card that is inserted into the proper slot on a handset a digital chip mounted on the handset's motherboard is activated by the user's carrier. One advantage to using an eSIM is that a device can be made physically smaller since the SIM tray can be designed out of the device.









While there is no definitive word about whether eSIM support will come to the Galaxy S21 line it would make sense to expect eSIM functionality to be available for this year's first flagship series. Besides allowing the eSIM feature to be activated the update will also exterminate some bugs and add security improvements. Once the update has been completed an eSIM Card Manager will be added to the OneUI settings menu to help users switch networks.





Speaking of switching networks let's say that you want to swap from Big Red to Team Magenta while on the go. Instead of scrambling to obtain a new Team Magenta SIM card with eSIM all you have to do is tap some buttons on your phone to switch carriers. It can't be any easier than that.

And that means my wife and I are going to have to revisit our wireless plan to accommodate a third line of data.

When you've got a kid approaching the age of smartphone ownership you've got a lot of internal debates facing your family. Is my child old enough for a phone? Should I invest in the best parental control apps ? What kind of device is even the right one for a first-time smartphone owner?

Best family cell phone plans: What are your options?

Get one of the best cheap phones for your kids

Against those contentious questions the issue of whether your current wireless data plan is the right one for a family with a growing number of smartphone users seems like it's less rife with the potential for family drama. But it's nevertheless an important question to answer as what you decide will definitely impact your monthly budget.

You could simply call up your current wireless provider and tack on another line to your current plan. (Indeed if you've already got more than two users on one plan that's probably the best course of action.) But the simplest move isn't always the most cost effective one and any change to your smartphone usage is an excellent opportunity to figure out whether you and your family have the best cell phone plan for your needs.

Based on our phone plan deliberations in the Michaels household we're making the switch from Verizon to Visible. Here's why.

Assessing our current family plan

My wife and I currently get by on 3GB of shared data from Verizon a plan we've held onto for the last... seven years? Eight years? It's been so long since I've gone shopping for cell phone plans I don't rightly remember. It was certainly back before phone carriers started doing everything they could to get you to switch over to an unlimited data plan.

The trouble with Verizon is that it's one of the pricier carriers out when it comes to unlimited data.

Now 3GB of data may not seem like enough for two people to use comfortably but it's worked out well for us. My wife and I both work at home so there's no data-sucking commutes and neither one of us does a lot of streaming. A few years back we even downgraded from a 4GB plan when we realized we weren't consuming anywhere near that amount of data each month. I can count the number of times we've been hit with an overage in the last eight years on one hand.

That's going to change once our daughter joins the land of smartphone-toting citizens. For starters Verizon would likely insist that we upgrade from our Obama administration era tiered data plan to a more expansive — and more expensive — unlimited offering. And even when we impose some limits on our daughter's phone usage there's still going to be a notable uptick in data over what we're currently using. That forces us to look at all the best unlimited data plan options out there.

AT&T vs Verizon vs T-Mobile

Before we even start searching for a new monthly data plan AT&T is out of the running. Someone somewhere in my Northern California municipality has built an anti-AT&T defensive shield that begins approximately on my front porch and stretches to my backyard. Save for AT&T erecting a cell phone tower in my kitchen — sorry space is tight enough already — we're not about to sign up for a service we can't ever use.

We could stick with Verizon which offers a number of different types of unlimited plans at various prices. Even better you can mix and match those plans so that my wife — who's more inclined to stream things than I am — gets the Verizon Play More plan while I opt for the cheaper Start Unlimited plan. Play More bundles in Disney's three streaming services so that's another expense we can wipe off the budget.

Additionally Verizon offers a Just Kids option when you've already got at least one line of unlimited data. Just Kids caps talk and text to 20 contacts and includes some parental controls. It also costs less than a full unlimited data plan though not that much less.

The trouble with Verizon is that it's one of the pricier carriers out when it comes to unlimited data. Mixing and matching the plans outlined above would still put a $170 dent in my monthly budget about $80 more than what we're paying now for our tiered plan.

If you get good service from Verizon you can expect similar performance from Visible.

T-Mobile is appealing because its costs are generally lower than Verizon's. Indeed three lines of the T-Mobile Magenta unlimited data plan would cost us $120 a month though it's important to realize that reflects a current promotion where T-Mobile is waiving the cost of the third line. Otherwise three lines cost $140 a month with perks like a free Netflix account. (You may recall we recently cancelled Netflix a move not well-received by the youngest member of our family.)

T-Mobile does not let you mix-and-match the Magenta plan with the cheaper Essentials plan though. There's also no kids plan with a lower cost and any parent-friendly caps like there is at Verizon.

But there are options beyond the major carriers. And the best one for my family means we won't have to stray from the Verizon network that's served us so reliably.

Why Visible works for my family

Visible is a Verizon-owned mobile operator that uses Verizon's network to provide cell phone service. There's no cap on LTE data speeds though I have noticed that Verizon prioritizes its own traffic which means data on Visible can move just a tad slower. (Visible does cap 5G speeds at 200 Mbps and you can only get 5G service on select phones at the carrier.) Basically though if you get good service from Verizon you can expect similar performance from Visible.

And that performance comes much cheaper at Visible. The carrier has a single unlimited data plan which costs $40 a month taxes and fees included. That's half the price of Verizon's best unlimited plan. Even better Visible discounts your per line fee as you add more lines so as a family of three I'd be paying $30 a month — or the same discounted $120 price T-Mobile currently offers.

The perks at Visible aren't plentiful — I'm once again on my own for any streaming services I'd want to pay for. But in the end the lower monthly bill is worth far more to my bottom line.

Bottom line

We're a ways off from my daughter getting her cell phone and data plan prices have a way of shifting. So what looks like a good deal now may be topped by something better once my wife and I are ready to sign off on a phone for our kid.

The point of this exercise though is to show that parents have a lot of different options for family plans beyond just shrugging and adding an extra line to the plan they already have. And if you're willing to go beyond the likes of AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon for service you just might find some real bargains that will keep the cost of your monthly smartphone bill at a reasonable level.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGV0ZXJjb2hhbi8yMDIxLzA0LzE4L2FmdGVyLTE5LWFubnVhbC1nYWluLXRhbGVuZC10cmFkZXMtMi1iZWxvdy10aG9tYS1icmF2by1nby1wcml2YXRlLXByaWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After 19% Annual Gain Talend Trades $2 Below Thoma Bravo Go-Private Price,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2021/04/18/after-19-annual-gain-talend-trades-2-below-thoma-bravo-go-private-price/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGV0ZXJjb2hhbi8yMDIxLzA0LzE4L2FmdGVyLTE5LWFubnVhbC1nYWluLXRhbGVuZC10cmFkZXMtMi1iZWxvdy10aG9tYS1icmF2by1nby1wcml2YXRlLXByaWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGVzay5uZXQvbmV3cy9zcHJpbnQtaHVsdS1vbi11cy10LW1vYmlsZS1lbmRpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"T-Mobile ends Sprint's ""Hulu on Us"" promotion after acquisition","T-Mobile will not continue a promotion with the Walt Disney Company’s adult-oriented streamer Hulu that saw Sprint customers earn a free subscription as part of their overall wireless service.

The affirmation comes as T-Mobile is in the final stages of integrating Sprint into its business after closing on a $31 billion deal to acquire the country’s fourth-largest wireless brand last year.

T-Mobile is expected to continue supporting Sprint and its customers for a little while longer even as the company starts to sunset Sprint’s older-generation CDMA network in favor of T-Mobile’s 4G LTE and 5G wireless service.

Prior to the merger some Sprint customers received a Hulu subscription for free as part of a perk called “Hulu on Us.” Those customers will continue to enjoy their free Hulu subscription as long as they maintain an eligible Sprint account a T-Mobile representative confirmed this week.

The company is no longer activating new lines of service under the Sprint brands which effectively means the “Hulu on Us” promotion has ended.

T-Mobile is giving Sprint customers with a compatible 4G LTE or 5G phone the option of exchanging their Sprint SIM card for a T-Mobile one a move that effectively moves their account over from Sprint’s system to T-Mobile’s system.

That switch effectively changes a customer from Sprint to T-Mobile which opens them up to other perks including a $10 a month discount on YouTube and Philo’s streaming TV service and free access to Netflix on some plans. T-Mobile stopped offering its own streaming TV service called TVision last month."

“We urge Tesla to continue to work on improving Autopilot technology and for NHTSA to fulfill its oversight responsibility to ensure that corrective action is taken when necessary” Robert L. Sumwalt the board’s chairman said. “It’s time to stop enabling drivers in any partially automated vehicle to pretend that they have driverless cars.”

The board adopted a number of staff findings and recommendations from an investigation into the crash that began more than six months ago. The findings included the determination that Autopilot failed to keep the driver’s vehicle in the lane that its collision-avoidance software failed to detect a highway barrier and that the driver was probably distracted by a game on his phone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vdGVzbGFtb3RvcnNjbHViLmNvbS90bWMvdGhyZWFkcy8yMDIxLW1vZGVsLXktbG90cy1vZi1yb2FkLW5vaXNlLXJ1bWJsZS1vbi1zdG9jay0xOXMtYW55LWFkdmljZS1mb3ItaW1wcm92ZW1lbnQuMjI2MTE1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Model Y lots of road noise rumble on stock 19's - any advice for improvement?,"Tesla Model Y Luxury Coilover Suspension Kit by Unplugged Performance The Unplugged Performance Luxury Coilover Suspension Kit for Tesla Model & installs in place of the factory dampers [shocks / struts] and springs bringing a luxurious and sporty ride with full height and feel adjustment.

Just got my 2021 Model Y AWD LR with the stock 19"" wheels & continental tires and I really like everything about the car except the road noise rumble! It's my first EV and first Tesla so I spent most of the limited test drive focusing on all the other new stuff like one-pedal driving and didn't notice the road noise *too* much. Also I was mostly on smoother roads for the test drive. I had intentionally picked the 19"" wheels to hopefully get a smoother and quieter ride.Now that I've had more time with it the rumble is kinda making me nuts. The noise is extremely bass-y and rather fatiguing on even slightly rough roads at even super-slow speeds. Wind noise is actually pretty good it's really just road noise that's bothering me.Using my trusty dB meter things didn't seem too bad using the dBA scale (which under-measures low frequencies to more closely mimic our own hearing range) showing values in the 60-70dB range. Not bad. But when I swapped it over to dBC which is used in industrial settings where bass is a more prevalent issue holy crap! Going all of 18 MPH on a slightly rough road I was measuring 96 - 100 dB!! Yikes!! Even on the smoothest pavement in town the dBC readings were in the mid-to-high 80's.I brought up an iPhone app that plots the full frequency spectrum (iAudio Tool) and there was huge build-up at around 35Hz which is super-low bass.So I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to improve this? I'm guessing the extra rubber door seals from RPM Tesla and the like probably won't do much of anything and I don't suspect I'll get a lot out of going down the dynamat/mass-loaded-vinyl rabbit hole without going completely nuts and covering the whole car.But what about replacing the suspension with either the Unplugged Performance kit or the Mountain Pass Performance kit? Would either of these reduce the rumble?And what about different tires? The ones on the car are already the ContiSilent (hah!) tires but apparently Car & Driver has a low opinion of their road noise reduction:Maybe a different tire would have better road noise characteristics?Any insight is most appreciated!!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzQvMTgvMjIzOTA2MTIvdHdvLXBlb3BsZS1raWxsZWQtZmllcnktdGVzbGEtY3Jhc2gtbm8tZHJpdmVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two people killed in fiery Tesla crash with no one driving,"Authorities in Texas say two people were killed when a Tesla with no one in the driver’s seat crashed into a tree and burst into flames Houston television station KPRC 2 reported.

The cause of the crash which happened at about 9PM local time in Spring Texas (near Houston) is under investigation. According to KHOU in Houston first responders had to use 30000 gallons of water over four hours to put out the fire as the Tesla’s battery kept reigniting. Authorities tried to contact Tesla for advice on putting out the fire; it’s not clear whether they received any response.

Preliminary reports suggest the car was traveling at a high rate of speed and failed to make a turn then drove off the road into a tree. One of the men killed was in the front passenger seat of the car the other was in the back seat according to KHOU. Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman told KPRC that “no one was driving” the fully-electric 2019 Tesla at the time of the crash. It’s not yet clear whether the car had its Autopilot driver assist system activated.

Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment on Sunday. The company dissolved its press office and doesn’t usually respond to media inquiries however. In a tweet on Monday Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed that “data logs recovered so far” suggest that Autopilot was not engaged at the time of the crash nor had the vehicle’s owner purchased the company’s “Full Self-Driving” option that may have allowed the use of Autopilot on local roads.

There have been at least 23 Autopilot related crashes under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration but this appears to be the first fatal crash where there was no driver in the driver’s seat. Tesla has previously cautioned its customers that Autopilot is not an autonomous driving system and still requires constant attention to the road while in use. The company’s cars only check that attention with a sensor that measures torque in the steering wheel though leaving room for misuse — something the National Transportation Safety Board admonished Tesla for last year.

Tesla has previously provided guidance for first responders who encounter fires involving its EV batteries. Reignition of the battery can be a problem because unlike gas-powered vehicles even if the fire is extinguished an EV battery still has stored energy. Tesla’s guidance suggests it’s better to let the fire burn out than continuing to try to put it out.

In the past Tesla CEO Elon Musk has rejected calls from Tesla engineers to add better safety monitoring when a vehicle is in Autopilot such as eye-tracking cameras or additional sensors on the steering wheel saying the tech is “ineffective.” He said in 2018 that Tesla would regularly release safety data about its Autopilot feature but added that “negative” press coverage about it might persuade customers not to use it.

“When there is a serious accident it is almost always in fact maybe always the case that it is an experienced user and the issue is more one of complacency” Musk said on a May 2018 call with investors. “They just get too used to it. That tends to be more of an issue. It’s not a lack of understanding of what Autopilot can do. It’s [drivers] thinking they know more about Autopilot than they do.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hdXRvcy10cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi90d28tZGVhZC10ZXNsYS1jcmFzaC10ZXhhcy10aGF0LXdhcy1iZWxpZXZlZC1iZS1kcml2ZXJsZXNzLXdzai0yMDIxLTA0LTE4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two dead in Tesla crash in Texas that was believed to be driverless,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/two-dead-tesla-crash-texas-that-was-believed-be-driverless-wsj-2021-04-18/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hdXRvcy10cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi90d28tZGVhZC10ZXNsYS1jcmFzaC10ZXhhcy10aGF0LXdhcy1iZWxpZXZlZC1iZS1kcml2ZXJsZXNzLXdzai0yMDIxLTA0LTE4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMTgvbm8tb25lLXdhcy1kcml2aW5nLWluLXRlc2xhLWNyYXNoLXRoYXQta2lsbGVkLXR3by1tZW4taW4tc3ByaW5nLXRleGFzLXJlcG9ydC5odG1s0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjEvMDQvMTgvbm8tb25lLXdhcy1kcml2aW5nLWluLXRlc2xhLWNyYXNoLXRoYXQta2lsbGVkLXR3by1tZW4taW4tc3ByaW5nLXRleGFzLXJlcG9ydC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'No one was driving' in Tesla crash that killed two men in Spring Texas report says,"Based on a preliminary investigation police told KPRC 2 they believe nobody had been behind the wheel but they have not finished their investigation. A preliminary probe was not conclusive.

The Tesla vehicle a 2019 Model S crashed into a tree and burst into flames according to the reports. One person was found in the front passenger seat and another in the rear passenger seat.

Two men died in a Tesla crash in Spring Texas on Saturday night and it appeared no one was behind the wheel according to local police interviewed by reporter Deven Clarke at NBC affiliate KPRC 2.

Firefighters reportedly used 32000 gallons of water and spent hours suppressing the fire that resulted from the electric vehicle crash.

Police told The New York Times that minutes before the crash the wives of the men involved heard them say they wanted to go for a drive and were talking about the vehicle's Autopilot feature. The men were 59 and 69 years old.

As CNBC has previously reported Tesla sells automated driving systems under the brand monikers Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD). It also releases a ""beta"" version of Full Self Driving (FSD beta) software to some customers who have the premium FSD option which costs $10000.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on a Feb. 11 episode of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast: ""I think Autopilot's getting good enough that you won't need to drive most of the time unless you really want to.""

Tesla Autopilot and FSD are not capable of controlling the electric vehicles in all normal driving circumstances.

In a letter to the California DMV late last year according to records obtained by CNBC and others Tesla lawyers said that ""neither Autopilot nor FSD Capability is an autonomous system."" And in their owners' manuals Tesla cautions drivers: ""The currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.""

Nonetheless many Tesla fans and influencers share videos on social media that show people driving hands free for prolonged periods asleep at the wheel or with nobody in the driver's seat.

For example actor Jamie Foxx shared a video on his YouTube channel where he pretended to be asleep at the wheel of a Tesla Model 3 operating it hands free with his eyes closed. In January this year as The Drive reported a teen and his mom made a video in which he pretended to sleep at the wheel of a Tesla and then climbs into the back seat for a snooze.

In Germany a Munich court actually banned Tesla from using phrases equivalent to Autopilot and Full Self-Driving capability in its advertising because they found this language misled consumers and overstated the capabilities of the cars.

CNBC has reached out to Tesla and fire and police departments in Harris County Texas for further information.

The news of the fatal crash comes as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is evaluating comments from the public that it sought in advance of proposed rulemaking. The federal agency has not regulated automated driving systems yet but left that task to states.

NHTSA released a statement Monday morning saying it will launch special investigation into the incident.

""NHTSA is aware of the tragic crash involving a Tesla vehicle outside of Houston Texas"" the statement said. ""NHTSA has immediately launched a Special Crash Investigation team to investigate the crash. We are actively engaged with local law enforcement and Tesla to learn more about the details of the crash and will take appropriate steps when we have more information.""

There have also been several crashes recently involving Tesla vehicles prompting federal probes to determine whether Autopilot or FSD systems figured in the collisions. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said last month that it had opened 27 investigations into crashes of Tesla vehicles 23 of which remain active.

Just a few hours before the report of the fatal crash in Spring Texas Musk touted the company's self-reported first quarter accident data.

He said on Twitter – where he has more than 50 million followers – ""Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle.""

According to data that Tesla gathered but hasn't shared with third parties for independent analysis the company said: ""We registered one accident for every 4.19 million miles driven in which drivers had Autopilot engaged. For those driving without Autopilot but with our active safety features we registered one accident for every 2.05 million miles driven. For those driving without Autopilot and without our active safety features we registered one accident for every 978 thousand miles driven.""

Tesla did not disclose how many accidents involving their cars resulted in injury fatalities or just vehicle or property damage."

Charles M. “Chuck” Geschke a Los Altos resident who co-founded Adobe Systems and later was kidnapped for four days until he was freed by the FBI died on Friday at age 81.

“This is a huge loss for the entire Adobe community and the technology industry for whom he has been a guide and hero for decades” said Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen in an email to employees.

Geschke co-founded Adobe in 1982 with John Warnock a colleague from Xerox. They collaborated on Adobe PostScript a product that sparked the desktop publishing revolution.

Considered the priesthood

The son of a photo engraver Geschke grew up in Cleveland was educated in Catholic schools as a child and spent three and a half years at a Jesuit seminary studying to become a priest according to his Adobe biography. Ultimately deciding to forego the priesthood he enrolled in Xavier University where he received a bachelor’s degree in classics and a master’s degree in mathematics. He earned a Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University.

Geschke married his wife Nan in 1964. The couple had three children. They lived in Los Altos since 1972.

Geschke began his career as a scientist and researcher in the Computer Sciences Laboratory of Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center according to his biography. In 1980 he helped establish and became manager of Xerox’s Imaging Sciences Laboratory at the same location. His duties centered on overseeing and conducting research activities in the areas of computer science graphics image processing and optics.

Leaving Xerox and starting Adobe

In 1982 he and John Warnock who conducted interactive graphics research for Xerox became frustrated by the difficulty of moving their innovations and research beyond the laboratory and into production. The two decided to venture out on their own; they quit Xerox and created a new company Adobe Systems Inc. named after a creek that runs past their homes in Los Altos.

Their first product PostScript allowed for highly detailed professional documents to be sent from a personal computer to a laser printer. Within two years Geschke and Warnock reported Adobe revenues of $1.7 million.

In 1985 Apple Computer bought a 19% stake in Adobe and began packaging PostScript with its LaserWriter printer helping Apple to become the leading computer for graphic design.

In 1986 Adobe partnered with Texas Instruments to incorporate PostScript applications into its laser printers. Soon thereafter IBM licensed PostScript for its personal computers.

Adobe grew from 27 employees in 1984 to 3000 by 2001 the company said. Adobe had an IPO in 1986.

Another advance by Geschke and Warnock was the Adobe Type Library a collection of typefaces developed specifically for electronic application. Initially the Type Library offered 300 unique typefaces making it the largest collection available; the 2001 version of the Type Library (renamed as Font Folio) provided 2750 font choices according to Adobe.

Later Adobe would acquire PageMaker and PhotoShop allowing the company to sell a package of software to customers that would cover their graphic design needs.

When asked in 1995 by InformationWeek about any fear that Adobe was too heavily weighted toward the print industry Geschke replied “The move from paper-based to electronic documents doesn’t worry us. People still want authoring tools.” However in the years ahead Adobe would expand into the internet creating tools for building websites and applications.

Kidnapping

In 1992 Geschke was kidnapped at gunpoint from the Adobe parking lot in Mountain View by two men as he arrived for work. He was freed when a man caught with $650000 in ransom money led authorities to a bungalow hideout in Hollister the New York Times reported.

The two kidnappers Mouhannad Albukhari 26 of San Jose and Jack Sayeh 25 of Campbell were eventually sentenced to life terms in state prison.

Geschke served as co–chairman of the board and president of the company until 2000 when he retired as president. Geschke served as chairman of the board with Warnock from

September 1997 to January 2017 and member of the board until April 2020.

Awards and honors

In 1999 Geschke was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). In 2002 he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum. In 2006 Geschke along with Warnock received the American Electronics Association’s Medal of Achievement. In 2008 he received the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society. He also won the 2008 National Medal of Technology and Innovation awarded by President Obama. In 2010 the Marconi Society co-awarded Geschke and Warnock the Marconi Prize.

Geschke and his wife started a foundation that has been recognized for its philanthropic work. In 2012 the National Catholic Educational Association honored the couple with its St. Elizabeth Ann Seton award for its contributions to promote Catholic education. The foundation funded construction of the Geschke Learning Resource Center at the University of San Francisco.

Geschke served on the boards of the San Francisco Symphony the National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management the Commonwealth Club of California the Egan Maritime Foundation the Nantucket Boys and Girls Club and the computer science advisory board at Carnegie Mellon University.

“As much as his inventions changed the world it is his focus on people purpose and culture that has profoundly impacted each of us at Adobe” said Narayen the Adobe CEO. “As he always said Chuck wanted to create a company where he would want to work. He believed that good ideas come from everywhere in the company and that it’s not only what we do but how we do it that matters most.”

Geschke is survived by his wife Nancy (“Nan”) Geschke and his three children.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFmaW5hbmNpYWwuY29tL2luZGlhcy1iaWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1iYWl0LXRvLWdsb2JhbC1jaGlwLW1ha2Vycy13aG8tbWlnaHQtdGFrZS1hLXBhc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India's billion-dollar bait to global chip makers who might take a pass,"(ATF) Stung by an acute shortage of semiconductors worldwide in the face of incessant demand for consumer electronics India is angling toward self-sufficiency by enticing the who’s who of global high-tech to set up chip factories. Yet a lot of those hall-of-famers might end up staying offshore.

The country has targeted a wish list of companies from Europe Japan South Korea and Taiwan. It includes Taiwanese majors Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company VIA Technologies and United Microelectronics Corporation. US giants Intel Micron Technology NXP Semiconductors and Texas Instruments are on the list along with European chipmaker Infineon and Fuji Electric and Panasonic of Japan.

India’s recruitment comes after governments across the world have started subsidising construction of semiconductor plants a way to ease chip shortages that are hobbling the automotive and electronics industries and highlighting the world’s dependence on Taiwan for supplies.

India wants to establish reliable suppliers for its own formidable electronics and telecom industry so it cuts dependence on China which today supplies 65% of the country’s $50 billion annual semiconductor consumption.

The proposal is simple on paper: make in India and get $1 billion in cash incentives.

The Indian government is also ready to offer manufacturers assurances by buying the chips and mandating that certain industries buy made-in-India chips from Indian plants. India-based chip makers would be tagged as “trusted sources”.

Not convinced

But even if the offer looks compelling global chips makers are reluctant.

In Taiwan at least seven local semiconductor companies have met the island’s deputy economic affairs minister Shen Jong-chin twice to understand how they might invest in India but they reached no conclusion.

“In terms of the fab location selection there are many factors to consider in order to fulfil our customer’s needs” a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) spokesperson told Asia Times Financial. “TSMC does not rule out any possibility but there is no concrete plan to set up fabs in India at this time.” TSMC is the world’s largest contract chipmaker.

Fellow Taiwanese chipmaker United Microelectronics Corp said the company is “open to evaluating all regions for projects provided that the opportunity fits with the company’s ROI objectives.”

But company spokesman Richard Yu added that the company “generally prefers regions closer to Taiwan to ease logistics and management while still providing manufacturing risk mitigation through geographic diversity.” The company better known as UMC has factories now in Taiwan China Japan and Singapore.

Inadequate facilities

India is not always an easy place for setting up a chip fabrication plant.

Experts say semiconductor manufacturing (fab) is a complex techno-commercial operation that requires large investments business and operational ability. They say it requires grasping all the right ingredients such as the market private investment infrastructure and technology itself.

Putting all that together is a tall order.

“India lacks infrastructure that foreign factories expect and has an incomplete semiconductor supply chain – meaning higher shipping costs” Taiwan-based boutique market analysis firm Isaiah Research told ATF.

The biggest hurdles are the country’s constantly changing rules and policies as well as infrastructural bottlenecks some analysts believe.

“Fluctuation in India’s laws make business people unsure” Cheng Kai-an an industry analyst with Taipei-based Market Intelligence & Consulting Institute told ATF adding that Taiwanese chipmakers have particularly found India’s electricity and water supplies unstable.

Crush to get chips

Yet the country needs chipset manufacturers – and lots of them. The global semiconductor shortage and geopolitical tensions with China are not only beginning to hurt the country’s manufacturing but those factors also heighten India’s need for attaining self-sufficiency in the semiconductor supply chain.

India’s semiconductor consumption which was already facing a demand-supply crisis following delays from China after the Indo-China border clash last year is now facing massive supply chain issues according to a recent report by professional services firm EY.

The global semiconductor industry relies on a few global players for high-end chips – which led to the shortage following pandemic-era demand for devices to support telework and home study. Automotive chip orders have added to that demand. China and Taiwan own a significant portion of the semiconductor manufacturing market in the world the EY report says.

Consequently “fabs assume significance in view of the fact that India is poised to increase its share in global manufacturing of mobile phones IT hardware automotive electronics industrial electronics medical electronics IoT and other devices in the near future as it aspires to have $400 billion of electronics manufacturing by the year 2025” the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said when inviting investors from the target list.

For foreign chipmakers India offers a suite of incentives called the Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors to run over eight years. India should attract investors with its “cost-effective” skilled labour “fast improving” infrastructure and a domestic electronic components market that’s on track to reach $200bn by 2025 about 10 times the amount of 2019 the Indian National Investment Promotion & Facilitation Agency says.

India’s bid could be a big attention-grabber for private and foreign fab investors say experts.

“The biggest strength India has today is the market for electronics products and domestic manufacturing” Satya Gupta the chairman of India Electronics and Semiconductor Association a trade group with more than 300 members told ATF.

Domestic manufacturing of electronics products has potential to grow $400 billon — of which $250 billion would be consumed locally and $150 billion exported Gupta says. That growth “creates a good demand for semiconductors products and makes the business case of Fabs stronger” the chairman added.

India’s intent and efforts work in its favour too others say.

While India has already announced various incentive schemes at the national level many state governments are ready and eager to provide incentives and infrastructure for electronics and semiconductor manufacturing.

“Today India is the second largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world. Few years ago no one would have imagined that. The same way semiconductor manufacturing can happen in India” Venkata Simhadri the CEO of MosChip an Indian fabless semiconductor company told ATF.

“But it needs lot more support and commitment from the government and the industry.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90ZWxlZ3JhbS9uYW1lL3JvYmVydC1ibG9lbWVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTY2MjU2MDXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Bloemer Obituary (1949 - 2021) - Sterling MA - Worcester Telegram & Gazette,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/telegram/name/robert-bloemer-obituary?id=6625605 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90ZWxlZ3JhbS9uYW1lL3JvYmVydC1ibG9lbWVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTY2MjU2MDXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

It’s more like a biotech incubator. But different.

In brief The US Food and Drug Administration has approved only a handful of cell and gene therapies but over 1000 candidates are now in clinical trials creating a demand for pharmaceutical services that far outstrips supply. Several new ventures and a few of the largest traditional pharmaceutical services firms are rising to the challenge providing expertise in areas such as viral vector development gene editing and genetic engineering of chimeric antigen receptor T cells. While the opportunity is great these firms face a highly competitive market for trained scientists and a lack of standards in a new realm of science.

The Discovery Labs another new services company has some similarities to ElevateBio. The Philadelphia-area venture is perhaps more like BioCentriq a university-based services firm now opening in New Jersey. But there are differences.

These three companies and others like them are directing their services at the burgeoning cell and gene therapy industry. In the process they are helping create a completely new branch of the pharmaceutical CDMO world. They will be competing with one another and with a handful of giant services firms that are also investing in the cell and gene therapy sector.

The pharmaceutical services sector has existed since the 1970s—ever since as lore has it the drug company Smith Kline & French sought outside help making raw materials for the ulcer pill Tagamet. In the ensuing years the sector has grown beyond such pharmaceutical chemicals to encompass ingredients for biologic drugs as well as drugs in their finished-dose forms. But the cell and gene therapy services sector has the look and feel of a wholly separate services sector—one serving a market primed for rapid growth.

The US Food and Drug Administration has approved only 7 cell and gene therapy drugs but the new product pipeline is teeming with approximately 1200 experimental therapies more than half in Phase 2 clinical trials. Estimates of annual sales growth are about 15% for cell therapies and nearly 30% for gene therapies. And the number of cell and gene therapy developers is rising rapidly; the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine estimates 1100 such ventures in 2020 an increase of about 10% over 2019.

Services companies are challenged by the newness of the cell and gene therapy field. They find themselves in the paradoxical position of trying to establish standard processes for research and manufacturing—essential to fast efficient low-cost operations—at the same time that they have to bring innovation to a new field.

Moreover the demand for services currently outstrips supply—supply not only of research and manufacturing capacity but also of an educated fully trained workforce. Competition for talent by all accounts is cutthroat.

“Workforce development is definitely a problem” says Peter Bigelow president of xCell Strategic Consulting. “The field is growing so rapidly and is so new that experienced people either don’t exist or are difficult to source.”

The most likely pool for talent is the pharmaceutical industry Bigelow says. “For instance people with mammalian cell culture experience can bring important capabilities for cell line development downstream processing and analytical methods.” As such there are clusters of potential good hires in Boston San Francisco and Bethesda Maryland. But these locations are also emerging as hubs for services firms making competition fierce and staff retention a problem.

Bigelow also notes the challenge of working in an emerging area of science. “Processes are not optimized because they are being developed and installed for the first time” he says. “There is significant trial and error underway.” He expects regulators will eventually impose a greater sense of order in an industry where currently parameters are to some extent set by suppliers of technology and equipment such as single-use bioprocessors.

John Khoury executive vice president of Project Farma a consulting firm in the area of emerging medicines says that innovation hubs where services firms exist near universities and institutions developing cell and gene therapy science will expedite technology transfer and commercialization.

But he agrees with Bigelow that the lack of standardization currently hampers efforts. “The fundamental challenge in cell therapy” Khoury says “is that you’re building the plane as you fly it.”

Quick starts

The scramble to develop staff and standards reflects the challenge of getting a foothold in a specialized field far more complex than the basic cell line development that characterizes making traditional biologic drugs.

Gene therapy for example requires the engineering growth and purification of adeno-associated virus (AAV) and lentivirus viral vectors—vehicles used to deliver genetic material into cells. The genetic engineering of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells is a primary service in cell therapy. And then there’s the need for CRISPR technology–based gene editing.

Aspiring services companies are making aggressive moves to meet the growing demand.

Trial time



Announcing a $525 million series C financing round in March ElevateBio described a “disruptive business model” for fostering new cell and gene therapy ventures.

ElevateBio’s model puts what Chief Scientific Officer Mitchell Finer says are the capabilities of a “fully integrated pharmaceutical company” at the service of start-ups that work at ElevateBio’s facilities and use its assets and scientists. The firm also invests in these start-ups. One—AlloVir a developer of viral-specific T-cell therapies—closed an initial public offering of stock last year. ElevateBio has started other companies including HighPassBio an immunotherapy T-cell specialist focused on leukemia.

“There are a lot of smart people out there” Finer says “who are either academics or small biotech companies that have gotten started but can’t afford to make investments in process development manufacturing and analytics and don’t know how to carefully characterize their products. So we thought we could be an enabler.”

The firm headquartered in Cambridge Massachusetts has most of its production and analytical assets in nearby Waltham where it is starting up cell and gene therapy manufacturing at a 13000 m2 facility that it calls BaseCamp. Full-scale production is expected to begin by year’s end.

Finer arrives as a services sector entrepreneur with a solid resume in cell therapy. He’s the former chief scientific officer of Bluebird Bio a gene therapy developer and was head of research at Cell Genesys where he was involved in putting the first CAR T cells into clinical development in the 1990s.

“Cell and gene therapy is pretty last century. A bunch of people doing work at a lab bench” Finer says of how R&D and production are often done. “We are investing in manufacturing automation. We’re investing in deep analytics on these viral and cell products.” Standards will emerge for the new methods and technologies as the sector evolves he says introducing a level of commoditized service. “Maybe someday Elevate will add a traditional CDMO business.”

The Discovery Labs is embracing some parts of the traditional fee-for-services CDMO model from the start. The firm is starting up a 55000 m2 cell and gene therapy facility near Philadelphia called the Center for Breakthrough Medicines. It’s based at a former GlaxoSmithKline R&D center that the firm acquired in 2018.

The Discovery Labs’ first process development labs opened last month and manufacturing suites certified to the US Food and Drug Administration’s current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) standard are due to start by early next year says Audrey Greenberg the firm’s executive director.

Plans to open a business incubator called Unite IQ were put on hold last year with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic Greenberg says. “As the vaccine kicks in and people come back to work we are going to reimagine how we deploy that at our site” she says. The Discovery Labs also plans to launch an accelerator or manufacturing support service in conjunction with an academic partner.

The focus now is on CDMO services says Joerg Ahlgrimm the Discovery Labs’ chief operating officer. “It’s important to know that many biotech companies have one two or three assets and it’s prohibitive to build internal capacity.” Infrastructure is not only expensive but also technically complex says Ahlgrimm who formerly headed the pharmaceutical and biotech business at the big Swiss CDMO Lonza.

Like other firms the Discovery Labs is facing an uphill climb in a competitive market for staffing Greenberg admits but it’s also ideally situated. “Philadelphia is really the birthplace of cell and gene therapy” she says. “We have upward of 20 to 30 cell and gene therapy companies here now.” Greenberg notes that Carl June a pioneer in CAR T-cell therapy runs a lab at the University of Pennsylvania where James Wilson did early work on delivering gene therapies with AAVs.

“There are upwards of 70000 life science employees in Philadelphia” she says. “So this is really the perfect place to start a company like this.”

Haro Hartounian senior vice president and general manager at BioCentriq would argue that New Jersey is ground zero for cell and gene therapy given that Novartis’s US headquarters are in East Hanover New Jersey. The FDA approved the Swiss drugmaker’s spinal muscular atrophy gene therapy Zolgensma in 2019. Bristol Myers Squibb another New Jersey company won approval last month for Abecma a CAR T-cell therapy for multiple myeloma.

BioCentriq which opened on the campus of New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) in Newark is arguably in the same geographic market for talent as the Discovery Labs. The problem is that even in the New Jersey-Philadelphia corridor there is a shortage of adequately trained scientists Hartounian says. Last year NJIT launched a professional science master’s degree program in cell and gene therapy.

BioCentriq operates a clinical production site and training facility on the Newark campus and a pilot plant in South Brunswick New Jersey. The company is partly funded by the university but its staff members are all from industry Hartounian says.

While BioCentriq promotes itself on its website as a CDMO for cell and gene therapy Hartounian distinguishes between its approach and that of a traditional CDMO. “If you go to a traditional CDMO you give them a project and they work on it using their own resources” he says whereas customers work on-site at BioCentriq.

“It’s kind of a hotel type of approach” he says. “Companies can rent a clean room or even bring their own scientists and engineers and chemists and work with our scientists to develop their product. It’s very attractive for these companies because they have control.”

The company has 12 employees but expects to triple its staff in a matter of months Hartounian says. In March it announced that it will provide clinical manufacturing of Tevogen Bio’s investigational T-cell-based COVID-19 treatment. “We are conducting aggressive business development in discussions with many companies” Hartounian says. “That means we are going to reach capacity.”

Evolution

The Boston area not surprisingly is shaping up as another hub of research and manufacturing support for cell and gene therapy companies. One emerging player is the Center for Advanced Biological Innovation and Manufacturing (CABIM) a partnership between Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies Cytiva the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Harvard University and Alexandria Real Estate Equities.

Announced in November 2019 the center recently leased a 3700 m2 facility at the Arsenal on Charles research park in Watertown Massachusetts. CABIM will operate as an incubator but for cell and gene therapy process development researchers rather than for start-up companies according to Daniel DeVido director of business development at Fujifilm Diosynth.

CABIM teams Fujifilm Diosynth the biologics unit of Japan’s Fujifilm with Cytiva a supplier of single-use cell manufacturing equipment in facilitating research at the two universities. Other leading Boston-area institutions are also clients including Massachusetts General Hospital Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

DeVido describes Fujifilm’s move into cell and gene therapy as beginning with its 2011 acquisition of Diosynth a biologic-drug CDMO in North Carolina. “What better way to understand biologics than to acquire a CDMO and sort of see what the universe of biologics looks like?” says DeVido who joined the company in 2012.

The Diosynth acquisition led to the 2014 purchase of Kalon Biotherapeutics a manufacturer of vaccines made in mammalian cell culture from the State of Texas and Texas A&M University. “But it became obvious that gene therapy was going to be the big use for viral vector production whether as products or lentivirus vectors that are used to edit cells” DeVido says. “The business evolved.”

The Texas operation’s grounding in biologics and vaccines directed that evolution. “We had a couple of really top-notch virologists but from a process standpoint we are borrowing a lot from all our experience in biologics.” There are basic similarities between growing cells to produce and isolate proteins and growing cells to produce and isolate viruses as viral vectors. “It’s not apples and oranges” DeVido says. “We were able to bank on a lot of our experience.”

Pharmaceutical services for cell and gene therapy will likely remain mostly separate from the traditional CDMO market DeVido says. But that isn’t stopping other large pharmaceutical services firms from moving into the field.

Lonza one of the largest CDMOs and a pioneer in both small- and large-molecule services is an example.

“Typically Lonza is forward looking and through its history there have been unnoticed acquisitions of pioneering technologies or companies acquisitions of relatively small size that would not make it into the headlines” says Alberto Santagostino senior vice president of the firm’s cell and gene therapy business unit.

One such acquisition was the 2010 purchase of Vivante GMP Solutions in Pearland Texas. The biologics services operation grew organically into a dedicated cell and gene therapy facility that Lonza inaugurated in 2018. Today the company provides related services in Portsmouth New Hampshire; the Netherlands; and Singapore.

We had a couple of really top-notch virologists but from a process standpoint we are borrowing a lot from all our experience in biologics. Daniel DeVido director of business development Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies

Big spenders

Other big pharma services firms entered the arena more precipitously with headline-making acquisitions.

Catalent paid $1.2 billion for Paragon Bioservices in 2019 getting two Baltimore-area facilities making AAV and lentivirus vectors. The company has since added production of plasmid DNA (pDNA) a building block for cell and gene therapy-based vaccines. An $18 million deal in 2019 to acquire viral vector sites from Novavax in Gaithersburg and Rockville Maryland filled out the company’s regional presence.

In Europe Catalent paid $315 million to acquire the Belgian firm MaSTherCell a clinical-scale cell therapy manufacturing specialist in 2020 and an undisclosed amount earlier this year to buy Delphi Genetics a pDNA specialist also in Belgium. Catalent purchased the production assets of the cell therapy firm Bone Therapeutics which is on the same industrial campus as MaSTherCell last year. The purchase gives Catalent accesses to large-scale manufacturing pending the opening of a new facility at MaSTherCell next year.

New field



Catalent a diverse CDMO to start with has taken on something fundamentally new with cell therapy says Colleen Floreck a former Paragon employee who is now vice president of marketing and strategy for Catalent’s cell and gene therapy business.

“I think it was a decent-size pivot for Catalent when they purchased Paragon” Floreck says. “What made the marriage work is that Catalent is a very established player in biologics scale-up and manufacturing. There are quite a few similarities.” Cell growth and development for example are fundamental to both biologics and cell therapy.

“But then there are significant differences” she says. The cell therapy market is “100% emerging” whereas the biologics market is relatively mature. “Then you couple that with the level of innovation” Floreck says plus the relative lack of standards and the contrasts become formidable.

“In the biologics business there are only so many processes that are optimized for producing a protein. You are not going to make new ones when there are gold standards on the market” Floreck says. “For gene and cell therapy these magic bullets don’t exist or at least not yet. That’s what everybody is trying to develop.”

Catalent’s approach to such challenges has been to embed the cell and gene therapy unit in its biologics business where it has access to support in the areas of quality and regulatory control supply chain management and overall infrastructure.

Thermo Fisher Scientific on a track nearly parallel to Catalent’s plunged into cell and gene therapy in 2019 with the $1.7 billion purchase of Brammer Bio a contract manufacturer of viral vectors. The company subsequently acquired Novasep’s viral vector business in Belgium. Like Catalent it is growing its cell and gene therapy CDMO business unit as part of a larger biologics business.

Brammer’s headquarters in Gainesville Florida are the locus of viral vector development and analytics for Thermo Fisher. But two-thirds of the company’s US workforce for viral vectors is in Massachusetts where it operates several sites including a manufacturing facility in Cambridge that Brammer acquired from Biogen in 2017 and a viral vector production site that Brammer built in Lexington.

Thermo Fisher recently acquired a building in Plainville about a 45 min drive from Boston where it will bring more viral vector production on line next year.

Thermo Fisher continues to invest in the Florida operations where it focuses on developing processes and analytics says Christopher Murphy vice president and general manager of viral vector services. “We want to expand there to help smaller companies just starting with their molecules to get going in their clinical trials and then if their product matures move up to one of our commercial manufacturing sites.”

WuXi AppTec another large CDMO offers cell and gene therapy services in China and in the Philadelphia Navy Yard where it began cell therapy manufacturing in 2004 and gene therapy in 2014. Last month the Chinese firm announced the acquisition of Oxgene a UK-based specialist in cell and gene therapies for a reported $135 million.

David Chang CEO of WuXi Advanced Therapies a division of WuXi AppTec says the company’s expertise in cell and gene therapy has grown from an early emphasis on biologics testing which it began in Philadelphia 15 years ago. That emphasis is reflected in the firm’s addition of a T to what it describes as a CTDMO approach Chang says. The company began adding process development and manufacturing services 8 years ago.

Oxgene an innovator in AAV and lentiviral vector manufacturing adds a European site but it also adds capabilities Chang says. “Oxgene allows us to go into early-stage plasma design viral vector development and cell line development” he says. “We are striving to provide a comprehensive service to our clients but more importantly we want to ready ourselves to provide the next generation of revolutionary platforms.”

Pharmaron another China-based CDMO has invested internally and through acquisition to add cell and gene therapy to a business that began in small-molecule services.

In November Pharmaron acquired Absorption Systems a US firm offering cell and gene therapy services from sites in San Diego Philadelphia and Boston. This year Pharmaron agreed to acquire a multipurpose biologics facility featuring cell and gene therapy capabilities from AbbVie in Liverpool England for $119 million.

Fast-forward

The run of investment in cell and gene therapies is likely to continue sources agree. Some even predict another large CDMO acquisition in the months ahead.

Aldevron a company whose growth anticipates a booming market is investing heavily in expansion. Based in Fargo North Dakota the producer of pDNA messenger RNA protein and enzyme starting materials for cell and gene therapies and vaccines plans to more than triple capacity this year with the addition of an 18000 m2 facility to its current 6500 m2 operation according to Vijay Surapaneni executive vice president of global operations and supply chain.

And at least one manufacturing technology specialist has made a move into services. Univercells the developer of a single-use bioreactor technology called Scale-X launched a CDMO Exothera a year ago.

“We started by setting up a development team not a manufacturing team” says Thibault Jonckheere deputy CEO of Exothera. “We believe that through our ability to use the best technologies and do data-driven process optimization we can really improve the processes used in gene therapy.” And that includes technology beyond what its parent company offers.

This year Exothera is expanding into CGMP manufacturing building two sites near Brussels. The larger a 13000 m2 facility on the Univercells campus will be ready to go by the end of the year Jonckheere says. The firm employs 70 and plans to double that this year.

Jonckheere says Exothera is entering a services sector with a flexible business model unlike that of a traditional CDMO. “You are less likely to strike 10-year contracts” he says. And that flexibility extends to the lab and the plant where processes are manual and routines are in flux.

“As a manufacturer I don’t like that” Jonckheere says. “Because you want things to be reproducible and standardized. It shows you mastered what you are doing. But with cell and gene therapies there are a lot of complex mechanisms at play so we are not there yet.”

Other executives share Jonckheere’s unease about the wide-open scientifically challenging sector. But like him they also feel a sense of competitive exhilaration.",,,,,,,,,,,,
TJX,TJX Companies,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA0LzE3L2JlZC1iYXRoLWJleW9uZC1zdG9jay1wbHVuZ2VkLTEyLW9uLXdlZG5lc2RheS1hbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bed Bath & Beyond Stock Plunged 12% on Wednesday -- and for Good Reason,"Bed Bath & Beyond stock trades as if management's multiyear turnaround plan is a slam dunk. But the company could continue losing market share to stronger competitors.

Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) has been a popular recovery stock over the past year. While the home-focused retailer lost money in its recently ended 2020 fiscal year it has a new management team and its financial results have already started to improve (albeit modestly).

Those factors have attracted plenty of risk-loving investors. In fact Bed Bath & Beyond stock has more than quadrupled over the past 12 months sending it to a multiyear high.

However Bed Bath & Beyond shares gave up some of their gains earlier this week dropping 12% after the company released its fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday. Considering the long-term challenges the company faces the stock could have more downside ahead.

A decent quarter

Bed Bath & Beyond's management painted the fiscal fourth quarter (which roughly corresponded to the months of December January and February) as a success. Comparable sales grew for a third consecutive quarter rising 4%. The core Bed Bath & Beyond brand delivered an even stronger 6% comparable-sales gain as digital comparable sales nearly doubled.

Additionally adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) jumped 13% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share ticked up to $0.40 from $0.38 in Q4 of fiscal 2019.

These results certainly weren't terrible. That said total sales declined compared to the prior-year period even after adjusting for the sale of several non-core retail brands over the past year. Moreover the company was facing an easy year-over-year comparison for earnings per share (EPS). In Q4 2019 adjusted EPS plummeted 68% year over year from $1.20 to $0.38. Just five years ago Bed Bath & Beyond posted EPS of $1.91 in the fourth quarter.

In short Bed Bath & Beyond's Q4 results were still poor by historical standards. Management might like to blame the pandemic for that weakness but industrywide sales of home goods have been growing strongly for most of the past year.

Threats offset opportunities

Looking ahead CEO Mark Tritton and his management team hope to rebuild Bed Bath & Beyond's earnings power through a combination of better inventory management new omnichannel capabilities and the launch of a slew of private-label brands. Bed Bath & Beyond also plans to return $1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks over a three-year period using the proceeds of its recent asset sales and other excess cash.

These initiatives hold real promise for the company. Most notably Bed Bath & Beyond will launch a private-label brand carrying various home essentials at lower price points than it offers today. That could help the company win more sales from value-conscious shoppers.

Nevertheless Bed Bath & Beyond could continue to lose market share to stronger rivals. For example off-price giant TJX Companies' (TJX 0.48%) HomeGoods segment (which also includes its HomeSense chain in the U.S.) posted a 12% comp-sales gain and a 14% increase in total sales last quarter. Importantly it did so with no e-commerce presence.

As the pandemic recedes and consumers become more comfortable shopping in person HomeGoods' market-share gains could accelerate. TJX also plans to launch a HomeGoods e-commerce business later this year.

Adding to the threat TJX plans to expand HomeGoods and HomeSense from 855 domestic locations as of late January to at least 1500 stores over the long term. This suggests that TJX sees an incremental sales opportunity of $5 billion or more some of which would come at Bed Bath & Beyond's expense.

An uncertain earnings trajectory

Even after falling 12% on Wednesday Bed Bath & Beyond stock trades for more than 18 times the 2021 Wall Street analyst consensus for EPS of $1.33. That's no bargain for a retailer with razor-thin and volatile margins.

If management gets sales growing again while expanding gross margin as planned Bed Bath & Beyond stock could certainly rise over the next few years. However investors shouldn't underestimate its competitive disadvantages relative to mass merchants like Target which benefit from much higher traffic and lower costs -- not to mention off-price retailers like TJX that can offer unbeatable prices.

While Bed Bath & Beyond is making smart moves to bolster sales and earnings its new initiatives may not fully offset the long-term sales and margin pressure it faces from losing share to stronger competitors. Investors should probably wait until the company shows sustained progress toward its financial goals before considering investing in Bed Bath & Beyond.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The school’s athletic department has generated the equivalency of $185 million in advertising and exposure a university spokeswoman said.

JACKSON Miss. — Like pretty much any and every coach Deion Sanders has a whiteboard in his office at Jackson State. Yet the board mounted above the coffee maker and microwave a few feet from his desk is hardly typical. There are no X’s and O’s scribbled on the board to diagram plays.

Sanders’ board contains a list of 20 items — either generic products or the names of specific stores. These are marketing targets.

""Go get ‘em"" Sanders said alluding to the directive for a marketing firm SMAC Entertainment enlisted to pursue potential deals. ""That’s the way my mind thinks.""

Few if any can sell it quite like Sanders who has never been shy about pushing the envelope and won’t stop now.

NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores schedules odds stats and more.

This is what Jackson State knew it was getting in hiring the electric Pro Football Hall of Famer to become “Coach Prime.” And his star power is already paying off in a big way.

'COULDN'T BE PROUDER:Aikman on friend former teammate Deion coaching at Jackson State

A university spokesman told USA TODAY Sports on Friday that the Tigers athletic department has generated the equivalency of $185 million in advertising and exposure since Sanders was hired in September to revitalize the football program — and more — at the HBCU school. Surely this is “The Deion Effect” that athletic director Ashley Robinson stated during a recent interview with USA TODAY Sports.

The way Sanders sees it it is only the beginning.

The whiteboard illustrates how much he recognizes the buzz about him can generate revenue for an underserved program seeking a wide range of upgrades.

The first item on the board: Insoles. Makes sense. The Tigers like all athletes need their footwear support.

Sanders’ board also includes items for ""credit repair"" (Is this a play on ""starving students?"") ""coffee"" (I’m thinking there’s a tie-in to all-nighters before mid-term exams) ""pain"" medication (football is a collision sport) and as the coach noted ""tractor supply"" (which I’m assuming might have been inspired by shoddy practice fields).

Surely this is an interesting time on the college landscape for this. On Friday Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves signed Mississippi Senate Bill 2313 which allows college athletes to receive compensation for use of their names images and likeness (NIL). The law goes into effect on July 1 with Mississippi becoming at least the ninth state to pass this type of measure and the third — following Florida and New Mexico — with that soon of an effective date. These actions are occurring against the backdrop of a sweeping reform movement to rebut the NCAA’s traditional and draconian measures that have prevented athletes from being paid while coaches administrators schools and other institutions bring in billions of dollars.

During an interview with USA TODAY Sports earlier this month Sanders didn’t point to the items on the whiteboard as specific for individual player marketing opportunities — it was obvious that most if not all of the items could potentially have overall team themes while many could go either way — but he was undeniably fired up about the prospect of his players cashing in.

""If this happens we’re able to say 'Let’s go' "" Sanders said. ""At 12:01 (on July 1) we want to announce deals. But that’s how (you) go out and prep 'em. The (marketing) team is already on that stuff.""

Sanders did not maintain that the school or athletic department would directly line up deals for the players. Surely he knows NCAA rules.

The NCAA however is in the process of considering an extensive rules proposal that addresses NIL quite necessary with so many measures in various states poised to become laws allowing NIL payments for college athletes in addition to the case being weighed by the U.S. Supreme Court that challenges whether the NCAA’s restrictions on compensation for athletes violates antitrust laws. The NCAA’s rules proposal was originally scheduled to be voted on in January but the matter has been tabled.

One part of the proposal would allow an institution to provide information and education to student-athletes related to NIL activities and clears schools to assist in evaluating professional service providers for such. This part however prevents an institution from identifying or selecting a professional service provider or arranging for payments.

Imagine how Sanders might have cashed in back in the 1980s when he created his ""Neon Deion"" image at Florida State — backed up by his enormous talent. He was way ahead of his time. Which makes him uniquely qualified to relate to the athletes — at Jackson State and across the nation — as this NCAA reform evolves.

But still: Item 5 on Sanders’ whiteboard? Condoms.

Say what?

""The slogan is good"" Sanders said. ""It says 'I’ve got you covered.' ""

That’s going to takes some explaining.

""The reason that’s on there is because what am I coaching right now? A bunch of young men"" Sanders said.

""When we came off the break (in March) I asked the team 'What happened on the break? Somebody tell me some good stories. Well one of the kids said 'Coach I met my son for the first time.' His girlfriend gave birth and they had a boy.""

Sanders said the room was overwhelmed with emotion given the revelation.

""I’m sitting there thinking"" he said "" 'This is a child. Raising a child. We’ve got to teach these kids how to practice safe sex.' ""

This is what Sanders must also mean when he says his job is about more than coaching. It’s about developing young adults. And about selling the message too.

When I became a travel writer and content creator however the disparity got worse. Asians are the world’s largest ethnic group and yet when it comes to the travel industry Asians are vividly missing.

China has the highest number of outbound tourists and other Asian countries also rank highly in this global statistic. Yet these tourists hardly ever see themselves and their perspectives represented properly in travel businesses and travel media.

Sarah Lee director at Captivate Digital Media says social consciousness has deepened some travel companies’ awareness of the need for diversity; however a massive gap still exists because there aren’t enough people of color at executive levels in these companies.

“This likely stems from unconscious bias or worse"" she said. ""Until that imbalance is addressed the industry will only be able to move forward so far.”

And it doesn’t end with representation. Prejudice against Asian tourists has long been an experience Asian travelers have endured but with the recent surge of anti-Asian racism stories of violent altercations and discrimination abound.

However many Asian professionals in the travel industry are striving to make a difference around the world. Here they share the issues they believe are still persistent; what they’ve striving for in their roles; and the path they think the industry needs to take to become more diverse and inclusive.

(Editor’s note: Interviews have been edited for clarity and length.)

Marjorie Perlas founder of Scapade

Before we talk about bringing Asian voices in on a global scale we need to give the Asian community back their own narrative. Asians have always been portrayed as supporting characters in their own stories to contrast White faces that are splashed across the screens in travel media whether it’s an ad from a tourism board featuring a White traveler or a T.V. show that follows a White man as he makes uncomfortable faces while explaining what the local food tastes like.

Placing Asians into an “other” role trickles into the rest of the industry. It assumes that a Western lens is always necessary. So-called “experts in the Asian market” profit off workshops without meaningful connection to the culture.

I was once hired for a role working with the Chinese inbound market. Even though I am not Chinese it was implied that it was “the same thing” because I’m Asian.

Astrid Vinje founder of The Wandering Daughter

The main conversation regarding diversity is usually whether Black and White travelers’ experiences are factored in. There are numerous experiences I have had while traveling that could relate to neither part.

My narrative is hardly ever depicted in the travel media world. Brands need to consider that Asians aren’t necessarily all based in Asia. An Asian American’s perspective of their hometown is different from a White American’s and they need to be given a place to share that. Only then will Asians feel included in the branding and representation of a destination. It should make them think that it is a place where they are welcome and won’t be faced with an anti-Asian sentiment.

The power dynamic needs to shift so that it’s less about a foreigner “discovering” a new destination and more about a local sharing their country’s knowledge with the world.

Zinara Rathnayake travel writer and co-creator of NatnZin

Many people associate Asia with its food and beaches and don't stop to consider that people from places like Sri Lanka are capable of sharing their own stories. It's twice the effort as you struggle as an Asian and as a minority in Asia itself.

Representation within the industry is quite horrifying. Listicles in significant publications are devoid of Asians or have tokenism with a single person thrown in for effect. For example this list about “best travel blogs” in Asia mainly includes White expats. None of Culture Trip’s “Most Inspiring Asian Travel Instagrammers You Need To Follow” [published in 2017] written by a non-Asian are Asian.

The industry needs to do better research reach out to a diverse set of local writers and do justice to the content being produced beyond surface knowledge created just within a couple of days.

Marilou Moles content creator at Twenty York Street

The need for Asian representation in the travel media industry cannot be emphasized enough. Representation shouldn’t merely be a box to check off but there is now more than ever a need to have Asian decision-makers in the top ranks. That is the only way to have systemic and lasting change.

Aside from that we need advocates and allies who can also fight against racial profiling while traveling such as people pulling their eyes back or loudly calling out 'Ni Hao' as greetings in the industry.

Having someone who looks like us comes from the same background and culture as us who understands our travel needs and preferences can bring about solutions that have our best interest and well-being in mind right from the get-go.

Asian representation shouldn't be seasonal or trendy — we shouldn't have to wait for Asian Heritage Month or more violence to spark the #StopAsianHate movement continuously.

Adrienne Lee director of global impact for Tourism Cares

More Asians are required at executive positions in the travel industry to develop intentional pipelines representation and mentorship for Asian talent to break the “bamboo ceiling” and the “model minority myth.”

The repercussions and harm of the model minority myth have made many in the Asian community invisible. It’s not only important for Asian staff to have a seat at the table but to feel welcomed and heard which leads to a foundation of trust and belonging.

Having a diverse leadership not only sets the tone vision and strategy of the organization but also impacts the bottom line. There is a strong correlation between a more diverse leadership team and the financial performance of the company. Diverse leadership challenges assumptions thinks holistically of the customers they serve and is truly authentic in its values.

While there has been a lot of attention on the Chinese travel market there is significant growth and opportunity all over Asia.

If global travel companies want to capture a slice of the growing Asian travel market it is vital that they have people in roles that understand Asian values and expectations and how to create travel experiences that Asians want.

Companies are also structurally set up to consider the West as the “source markets” and other places — including Asia — as “destinations.” This means most head offices are based in Western cultures. Therefore it is natural for most key positions to be occupied by people who know the source markets (the West) and can bring in business. However as the source markets are shifting to Asian locations these companies will need to change these structures to grow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWxvaXR0ZS5jb20vZ2xvYmFsL2VuL291ci10aGlua2luZy9pbnNpZ2h0cy9pbmR1c3RyeS90cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi1ob3NwaXRhbGl0eS1zZXJ2aWNlcy9idXNpbmVzcy10cmF2ZWwtdHJlbmRzLW91dGxvb2stMjAyMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reshaping the landscape: Corporate travel in 2022 and beyond,"A few travel use cases underwent significant shifts from 2021 to 2022. Respondents rated client project work more replaceable by technology this time around indicating that teams have gotten better at executing virtually. Meanwhile industry conferences’ content was rated more dependent on face-to-face interaction. The return to live events that began in the fall of 2021 may have served as a reminder of the benefits of in-person learning. Finally respondents rated leadership meetings as lower in importance in the 2022 survey versus 2021. It’s possible that leadership meetings were seen as more crucial because the pandemic was closer to its peak.

Conferences and events

Among respondents to this survey meetings contracts constituted nearly one in seven dollars of prepandemic travel spend. But that figure only captures a portion of conferences’ impact. It leaves out travel for the purpose of attending events hosted by others. According to a 2020 Phocuswright study meetings and conferences accounted for 18% of hotel gross bookings in 2019.6

Even harder to measure is the role live events play in industries bringing together peers and partners for both structured and spontaneous interaction. Such interactions have been an early and lasting pandemic casualty.

The remainder of 2022 will likely be a lean year but a key one for industry conferences and events. Businesses are feeling their absence after two years of cancellations and online-only formats. Travel managers surveyed continue to place high value on the networking that takes place at these events which they find ill-served by virtual formats. And when it comes to the content component of conferences travel managers are less confident about tech replaceability compared to our 2021 survey. Travel managers place conferences and exhibitions among the top five travel types (out of 10) that they expect to lead growth in 2022.

Still many measures of short-term plans to spend on meetings and events indicate the industry will not quickly bounce back to its prepandemic size. Nearly three in four (72%) respondents say their companies will spend less on external conferences than in 2019 (figure 9). Companies are taking a rigorous approach prioritizing the most constructive events closely monitoring who and how many attend and seeking events with a powerful mix of networking and content. They also are making adjustments to their own events. Since Q4 2021 more than half say they have canceled or postponed events and more than half have adjusted downward their attendance expectations. A much smaller number are moving events to warmer locations and months which could have a lasting effect on demand for conference venues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiF2h0dHBzOi8vcmFhamplLm12Lzk4NDYx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iberia to begin flight operations to Maldives in time for summer,"The national airline of Spain Iberia has announced intention to begin flight operations to Maldives= in time for summer.

The Spanish airline is scheduled to fly to the island destination from July to August.

International media reports that Iberia will schedule two weekly flights from Madrid to Maldives for the two-month period once authorized.

This has pushed the total number of summer destinations the Spanish airline is scheduled to launch flight operation to to 112.

The airline is currently awaiting authorization from the Maldivian government to begin operations.

Executive Chairman of the Spanish airline Javier Sánchez-Prieto revealed that their decision to add Maldives to its summer destination routes mirrors their efforts to boost tourism and raise the company morale. He added that it is also an “example of how Iberia is adapting to the new circumstances and opening new markets.”

Maldives was awarded the ‘Safe Travels Stamp’ by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) during September 2020 in recognition of the government’s efforts in implementing enhance health and safety measures in line with the WTTC global ‘Safe Travels’ protocol and creating a safe gradual plan by rebuilding confidence among travelers and ensuring a coordinated approach in restarting our tourism industry

Endorsed by the World Tourism Organization and more than 200 travel companies the ‘Safe Travels Stamp’ aims to provide and ensure travelers of enhanced standards of hygiene are in place and the assurance that they can once again experience safe travels.

Since borders were reopened during July 2020 30 international airlines have resumed flights to the island nation. Some of these airlines have since been increasing flight frequencies to the country due to popular demand among travelers.

Since the beginning of the country’s tourism-revival journey Emirates has held the title of top airline bringing tourists into the Maldives having flown over 68800 tourists to the popular island destination so far this year. Some of the other airlines topping the list are Qatar Airways IndiGo Aeroflot Go Air Turkish Airlines Flydubai Lufthansa Azur Air Russia Austrian Airlines as well as Etihad Airways among others.

Jerry Omodara state security adviser announced this at a press conference on Sunday in Lokoja. Omodara said with effect from Monday April 19 motorists and commuters still operating from outside the new Lokoja Terminus would be prosecuted.

He said that the state government has constituted a mobile court for summary trial of defaulters of the order. He added that motorists commuters and food vendors should operate from the new Mega Terminal.

He also disclosed that the government has withdrawn the Certificates of Occupancy of all land that hitherto served as motor parks in Lokoja Metropolis.

He urged all commercial vehicles and passengers to move to the Lokoja Mega Terminal to continue their business.

Omodara who is also the chairman Movement to Mega Terminal and Beautification of NATACO Felele Highway said government would re-design all Lands formally used as motor parks in Lokoja.

He explained that no vehicle would be allowed to carry passengers in any part of the metropolis except at the Mega Terminal.

He stressed that all vehicles passing through Lokoja metropolis must drop off their passengers only at the Mega Terminal.

“The state ministry of transport various committees security agencies including Police DSS NSCDC FRSC Kogi Transport and Road Maintenance Agency have been directed to impound any vehicle that violated the order” he said.

Omodara stressed that organised transport companies plying the Abuja-Lokoja highway had been informed of the decision of the state government to ensure compliance.

He noted that government’s earlier decision exempting motor parks around Ganaja Junction for Kogi-East bound travelers remained “for now”.

He added that the waiver did not include inter-state travelers.

Abubakar Mohammed an official of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) Kogi advised government to keep to its words to make the mega terminal work according to plans.

Speaking earlier Baron Okwoli the State Commissioner for Transport said the floating of the the Mega Terminal was a part of efforts by the state government to revolutionise transport management in the state.

He said that the facility though built and commissioned by the Idris Wada administration in January 2016 had to be brought up-to-date in line with international standards. He added that it was to ease transport management in the state.",,,

An introduction from Bryn Fosburgh senior vice president Trimble

More than a year ago I had a chance to have dinner with one of my colleagues from the early RTK development days Steve DeLoach a retired civil engineer and land surveyor with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. We hadn’t seen each other in decades and our meeting gave us a chance to reminisce about those long days and challenging problems in our efforts to define GPS surveying techniques for more accuracy faster initialization on-the-fly movement and real-time data. We talked a lot about the many smart people who collaborated—sometimes across government and private sectors—to develop a revolutionary technology.

We also wondered if this important history was getting away from us. Did younger surveyors know the origins of a technology that’s part of their daily workflows? Probably not but they should have access to it if they are interested because it was really an incredible time in the history of surveying.

With that dinner conversation Steve and I landed on the idea of an article about the history of RTK. Steve reached out to Marc Cheves at The American Surveyor about publishing it and Marc agreed. Soon there was an email chain and phone interviews to collect the memories of Steve as well as Dr. Benjamin Remondi a retired GPS technologist from the National Geodetic Survey and Trimble; Kurt Maynard of Trimble and formerly John E. Chance & Associates; and Mark Nichols Timo Allison and Nick Talbot long-time Trimble leaders who were integral in the development of the first commercial RTK systems.

Their memories reminded me of how far we’ve come. I’m amazed that in the more than four decades after the launch of the first satellite for the Global Positioning System we’ve gone from using a map and compass or laser to locate ourselves from hundreds of meters to today—when everyone can get a fairly decent location using their phones and watches. Today RTK boosts GPS accuracy for real time positioning within a few centimeters and serves as the foundation of a billion-dollar-plus precise positioning industry in construction agriculture surveying transportation and logistics.

So rich is the history of RTK it would take a book to do it justice—and maybe someday someone will write it. For that reason this series doesn’t aim to be comprehensive but instead offers some historical snapshots told by people who were involved in the development and commercialization of this seminal technology.

So please join us on an abbreviated tour of the complex and innovative journey of RTK development including:

key individuals who saw potential in using GPS to solve surveying problems;

technological forerunners research and breakthroughs;

the early 1990s heyday of closing in on the biggest technical challenges; and

RTK commercialization.

Since its heyday of development roughly three decades ago Real Time Kinematic (RTK) has far surpassed the dreams of its early innovators.

Those dreams started taking shape as civilians saw the potential of leveraging the military’s new Global Positioning System (GPS) launched in 1978 to improve challenging positioning and navigation issues in marine and land surveying. The system was designed to use code-based signals for real time accuracies of 3-to-5 meters horizontal and 10-to-15 meters vertical but there were ideas on using parts of the signal that the GPS designers hadn’t anticipated.

“It’s a great story of a surveying system made by surveyors for surveyors” said Steve DeLoach retired deputy chief of engineering and construction for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) which funded significant RTK breakthroughs in the late 1980s and early 1990s to vastly improve dredging operations. “Before RTK establishing geodetic control horizontal and vertical was a massive labor-intensive endeavor.”

From the late 1970s through the mid-1990s RTK pioneers saw potential in GPS to solve surveying challenges in accuracy motion and timing but they had to attract funding pursue knowledge leaders and put in the hard work of testing systems and developing the complex computer algorithms to augment and correct the signals of GPS.

Soon after the launch of the first GPS satellite Charles Counselman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed a GPS receiver called the Macrometer that was based on a radio astronomical technique and suitable for geodetic work. Also around that time papers from luminaries such as John D. Bossler and Clyde C. Goad (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and Peter L. Bender (Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics National Bureau of Standards and University of Colorado) explored the idea of processing GPS carrier-phase signals. (Bossler J.D. Goad C.C. & Bender P.L. Using the Global Positioning System (GPS) for geodetic positioning. ) This new use of GPS was altogether different from the original intent.

International events also had impact. In 1983 Korean Air Lines flight 007 was shot down by the Soviets killing the 269 people aboard. The aircraft had been traveling from New York City to Seoul South Korea via Anchorage Alaska when a navigational error caused it to drift into Russian airspace. In response to the tragedy President Ronald Reagan issued an executive order to make GPS available for civilians at an accuracy of 100 meters.

But many needed something more accurate than what was the intended design of the GPS code signals so the focus shifted to the static applications using GPS carrier-phase signals. Scientists devoted to geodesy readily adopted GPS carrier-phase processing developing the mathematics and writing software which allowed geodetic surveyors to forge ahead with novel methods of establishing horizontal geodetic control with accuracies ultimately at the millimeter level in three dimensions.

“Now that’s something that surveyors really care about” DeLoach said.

Industry also responded crafting GPS receivers for this new idea such as those by Magnavox and Texas Instruments. These early GPS receivers while revolutionary in capability were also large ungainly and built for specific scientific and surveying applications. This made them unworkable for broad industry applications but those would come later.

There would be other problems to overcome such as shifting from static to kinematic surveying faster initialization precision for vertical measurements and processing in real time. Accurate static surveying was terrific but many applications would require high accuracies while moving.

It was those early dreams for GPS however that fueled the solutions that would eventually form the revolutionary RTK technology which today achieves precise relative positioning in real time. For surveyors in particular RTK enables them to be more productive by reducing the need for time-consuming optical surveying methods in many applications.

“Everything was intentional and by design—and yes we saw the future” DeLoach said. “But did we see a farm tractor being guided automatically to an inch accuracy? Or a bulldozer cutting and filling with no surveyors putting in stakes or autonomous cars? Not really no.”

DeLoach was among those pioneers who played an integral role in early RTK development and here we will meet him and two other key individuals to learn about some of the problems they hoped to solve.

Steve DeLoach

A vision for vertical precision for tidal measurement and hydrographic surveying

Before the advent of RTK surveying required many field crews to conduct the complex tasks that were necessary for geodetic control. As part of its job supporting the nation’s water-based commerce USACE used those national control networks to expand local networks along rivers and harbors for the engineering and construction work involved in building operating and maintaining 25000 miles of coastal and inland river channels 14000 miles of levees more than 230 locks and 700 dams.

USACE knew the challenges of marine navigation and hydrographic surveying.

Marine engineering and construction projects relied on a tidal or river datum and establishing that datum and transfer to the marine vessels performing the work was a difficult and expensive task with vertical accuracies in feet which introduced significant errors. Less accuracy equated to USACE paying more for dredging operations because payment is typically based on the amount of material removed from a channel. An error in vertical measurement to the bottom correlated to USACE paying millions of dollars more in contract fees.

“The vertical was extremely critical to us” DeLoach said.

DeLoach had a lofty vision for a dredging research project that focused on getting precise real-time vertical positioning at the dredge.

“In the 1980s when I was arguing for funding under the Corps Dredging Research Program the conventional wisdom was that GPS was good to a few meters and it was two times worse in the vertical than the horizontal” DeLoach said. “The geodesists of course were doing centimeter-level work but still complained about 1.5-to-2 times worse in vertical. So many in the Corps research program thought the pursuit of the required accuracies in real time was simply a waste of time.”

But DeLoach the Corps’ chief surveyor M.K. Miles and other leaders in surveying and mapping research and development and civil works thought otherwise and would parlay this belief into funding to land the project. With GPS DeLoach believed it was possible to achieve real-time three-dimensional positions of dredges and hydrographic survey vessels to an accuracy of a couple of inches.

In pursuit of breakthroughs individuals collaborated to share data and methods sometimes across public private and academic sectors.

“We built a team of engineers and scientists—surveyors geodesists electrical engineers civil engineers mathematicians computer scientists physicists—to kluge together the system” DeLoach said. “We published what we could and hid nothing.”

Any historic look at RTK should recognize not only the relentless efforts by these engineers and scientists—some of the smartest in the world—but also the high school interns who helped process data and the college students who schlepped heavy equipment for testing DeLoach said. “This is about a lot of people” he said. “They were all marching in the same direction and all passionate.”

Benjamin Remondi

Centimeter surveys using GPS

When it came to problem solving with GPS and software Dr. Benjamin W. Remondi became a go-to guy for the National Geodetic Survey and a bevy of other government agencies and organizations.

After early career stints at NASA and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the 1970s Remondi believed he’d found his calling in orbital mechanics and software development. “At some point I faced the fact that I had to become an orbit expert” he said so in 1979 he headed to The University of Texas a leading university on the subject to gain that expertise.

After Remondi felt like he’d learned everything he could from the Texas program he returned to his work for the GOES program content that “this is my life’s work. I’d love to do this for the rest of my life.”

But soon he would be presented with a challenge that steered his career in a different direction and it came from Dr. Clyde Goad a leading engineer and scientist at National Geodetic Survey who Remondi had met through work for a defense contractor.

Remondi hadn’t planned to do a Ph.D. thesis but 15 months later Goad presented an idea saying: “Ben I have a really hard problem to solve. No one’s solved it and it’s worthy of a Ph.D. dissertation.”

After an interview with Goad and Admiral John Bossler another pivotal leader in geodetic surveying and GPS Remondi agreed to take the job and pursue the research.

“It was solving a GPS surveying problem using GPS signals for centimeter-or-better accuracy for surveying for the nation” Remondi said. “It was a big problem and nobody had software or a model to do that yet.” This work on static surveying the focus of his Ph.D. thesis led to Remondi wondering if centimeter accuracies could be achieved while moving. He ran some initial tests on demonstrating kinematic surveying was possible (but not yet in real time) and published a paper on his findings.

That work would lead to researchers in the field referring to him as “the father of Real Time Kinematic survey.”

Mark Nichols

Precision and reliability for surveying applications

As a high schooler in the 1970s in New Zealand Mark Nichols spent a summer working for an engineering company on a hydro dam in a rugged part of the country. While the job solidified his interest in surveying and led to a 30-plus year career with Trimble those early experiences had him questioning if there was a better way for many traditional surveying practices.

He tells about his first day on the job that summer when he was asked to measure from the top of a hill to the bottom through some trees using the then-modern version of a survey chain—a steel tape. “We went to throw it over the trees and it snagged and we broke the chain” he said. “Then you had to get the two pieces get them together straighten them out and solder them back together in the field. I looked at all of this and went: there must be a better way.”

Another time he arrived at the jobsite only to discover that local residents opposed to the dam project had pulled out all of the stakes he’d put in just days earlier to mark construction for the contractor. In that instance it also registered to him that there must be a better way.

Nichols went on to get his degree in surveying and then started doing survey work for the New Zealand government which exposed him to the power of digital computing. Eventually he picked up a laptop that had a small screen and printer and started writing software to do survey calculations. At a time when feature coding was done with numeric codes he thought there had to be a better way and led the development of natural language feature coding for automatic map generation.

That better way—in fact many better ways that he and the Trimble team would help develop in the decades to come—leveraged GPS to make breakthroughs in precision initialization and commercial design for RTK.

One key aspect of developing RTK involved solving the integer ambiguity and then continuously processing the measurements.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s “brilliant engineers around the world were trying to solve this problem” he said “and more importantly solve it with a high degree of reliability.”

“Initially we solved the integer ambiguity by occupying a known point which worked for land surveying and then developed the algorithms to solve it while moving ‘on the fly’ (OTF).” This capability would open up the use of RTK for marine machine control and other applications and simplified the use for surveyors because it automated the initialization without the need for a point of beginning each time the receiver lost lock.

“OTF” Nichols said “was the tough problem that all the teams were racing to solve.”

Duck Town Council at its April 7 regular session meeting recognized two employees for their services to the town.

First of the evening’s recognitions went to Fire Chief Donna Black who was commended for her 15 years of service with Duck. Also singled out for her five years with Duck was public relations special events assistant Betsy Trimble.

During the recognitions Mayor Don Kingston advised that Duck employees are recognized for their employment with the town at five year intervals and as a part of the program in addition to being recognized at a council meeting each person receives a certificate and a gift certificate from a Duck business.

In a different type of presentation College of The Albemarle President Dr. Jack Bagwell and dean of the Dare Campus Tim Sweeney gave council a brief overview of college programs and the current construction project in Manteo. During the presentation Bagwell reminded listeners that the college now 60 years old has four campuses serving seven counties and has the number one ranked nursing program in North Carolina.

Sweeney added that the school has several new programs aimed at providing short term training for students.

When asked if dorms are to be included in any future plans Bagwell advised that it has been discussed but there are no current plans for any dorms.

Moving through the agenda to the public hearings scheduled for the night a request to establish a one-bedroom apartment above existing retail space at the Soundside Shoppes at 1180 Duck Road was rescheduled for September.

Following an initial approval on that request by council in March adjacent property owner Phil Morgan with the Seagreen Gallery provided comments within 24 hours that put the request back on the agenda for additional discussion. In an apparent attempt to overcome Morgan’s concerns both applicant Belinda Pleva and Morgan asked that the issue be deferred until September 1.

The second hearing centered on adding fill of up to ten feet to areas of the property at 111 Bayberry Drive.

According to Joe Heard director of community development there is evidence that in past years the site had been used as a borrow site with enough sand removed to create a bowl effect as much as 12 feet deep. The owners simply want to add enough off-site fill material to plug the hole and raise the property elevation to be in line with the adjacent property at 113 Bayberry Drive. The site would still be about one or two foot below the height of the roadway.

With very little discussion council gave unanimous approval to the request provided there are no negative comments received within 24 hours as did the Duck Planning Board back in March.

The final hearing for the evening was by Doug Kraus for a conditional use permit to convert Units C4 and C9 of Scarborough Lane Shoppes previously occupied by The Sweet Duck from existing retail space into a 28-seat restaurant.

According to Heard the structure at 1171 Duck Road that was constructed in 1995 and expanded in 2002 is actually on two properties totaling just over four acres. Functioning together as a single development there are 34 commercial units in four retail buildings. Although the change in use requires a minor increase in parking – from 165 to 167 spaces – the site already has 176 which is more than the minimum required.

The conditional use permit request was also approved subject to the 24-hour comment period required for video/virtual meetings.

In other business for the night Nancy Caviness was selected as a town representative to the Albemarle Commission’s Regional Broadband Initiative Working Group and town manager Drew Havens presented several financial policies for council’s review and consideration for possible adoption at a future meeting.

Also approved in the consent agenda were February 17-18 annual retreat minutes March 3 regular session meeting minutes a resolution declaring April as Child Abuse Prevention month a resolution declaring May 9-15 as “Thanks Outer Banks!” Week a disaster debris removal contract extension with CrowderGulf two agreements with DEC Associates Inc. for financial advisory services related to the upcoming beach nourishment project a beach monitoring contract with Coastal Protection Engineering and $93000 in budget amendments to cover extra COVID cleaning in Town Hall and unanticipated legal fees.

That's assuming all the above personnel are on the field come September.

There's no guarantee the Red Raiders' two biggest weapons on offense will be ready by the season opener. Tech coach Matt Wells revealed after Saturday's spring game that All-Big 12 receiver Erik Ezukanma suffered a broken right arm in two places during Thursday's practice and underwent surgery Friday to repair the injury.

Taking shape:Transfer's arrival starter's position switch firm up Tech line

""The good thing is it's not going to derail Erik's Texas Tech career and absolutely not his NFL career"" Wells said. ""It'll be a few months through the summer. He's got some hurdles to overcome. ... We'll have a whole lot better idea come August.

""He'll play a lot of football for us in the fall. The biggest thing is how fast can he heal. None of us know. We'll know a little bit more in six weeks.""

The Red Raiders lost Ezukanma a week after SaRodorick Thompson underwent shoulder surgery that makes the two-time team rushing leader questionable for the Sept. 4 season opener.

One has 11 career touchdowns via the air the other 20 touchdowns on the ground.

Wells said Thompson's injury was fluky suffered from unremarkable grazing contact rather than a direct hit. And he described Ezukanma's injury as ""kind of a freak thing.""

The Red Raiders were in an 11-on-11 sequence. The 6-foot-3 220-pound junior put his right arm down to brace a fall and it gave way. Dr. Robert Gaines a Lubbock orthopedic surgeon did the repair.

Fingers crossed:Shoulder surgery makes Thompson questionable for 2021 opener

""He'll be quick on the mend"" Wells said ""and he was in good spirits. We talked to him this morning again as well as yesterday. He's a tough man one of our best players our best workers and our best people in this program. He'll come back stronger than ever. He knows it we know it and his teammates will be there to lift him up.""

While Thompson and Ezukanma spend the summer working to come back the Red Raiders can at least be encouraged by some of the skill-position personnel they saw over the past month and again Saturday. The spring game — actually only one half followed by an assortment of one-on-one competitions — was Tech fans' first chance to see Tyler Shough the 6-5 220-pound transfer from Oregon who figures to take over at quarterback.

Henry Colombi and Shough both ran series with the first-team offense Colombi going 4 of 9 for 64 yards with a dropped pass Shough 8 of 15 for 106 yards.

Shough's arm will stretch defenses more easily than the Red Raiders were able to with former starter Alan Bowman who is transferring to Michigan. He started all seven games Oregon played during the pandemic-disrupted 2020 season and has the tools NFL scouts like.

""Tyler has the ability to stand in the pocket and really make all the throws — from the near hash far hash across the field and it really opens you up in terms of what you can do"" offensive coordinator Sonny Cumbie said. ""Defensively they're going to have to defend the whole field with his arm strength his ability to get it out. His delivery's very quick and he's a sharp player.

""That will add an element to our offense in terms of you're going to have to defend the whole field. If we're on the left hash we can make that (throw) whether it's a quick out whether it's a comeback whether it's a deep out we can make that throw to the far sideline.""

Tech's top five outside receivers — Ezukanma Trey Cleveland J.J. Sparkman Loic Fouonji and Jerand Bradley — all are listed from 6-3 to 6-5. Sparkman was the one who stood out Saturday catching a 34-yard pass from Shough and a 38-yard pass from Donovan Smith both on deep throws down the left sideline.

""We talk about catch radius"" Cumbie said ""and those guys you put the ball in the vicinity then they're going to make a play on it.""

Second act:Shough stoked by Tech's potential his chance to make a difference

Sparkman's first catch positioned the offense for a field goal — or field goals. Jonathan Garibay and Trey Wolff both got a shot from 42 yards and both converted.

Sparkman's second big play set up the second of two touchdowns in the one-hour scrimmage portion. Smith operating the third-team offense bought time in the pocket and flipped an 8-yard scoring pass to Bradley in the front of the end zone.

The only other came TD came at the end of an 11-play 75-yard drive that Colombi engineered. Colombi hit Cleveland with a perfect throw for 34 yards to move the ball across midfield and found slot receiver Dalton Rigdon for 17 yards to make it first-and-goal.

Tahj Brooks got the payoff barreling through a tackler for a 1-yard touchdown off the left side.

Cumbie echoing running backs coach DeAndre Smith's assessment from earlier in the week said Brooks was the most consistent offensive player this spring. The 220-pound sophomore got more opportunity with Thompson and Xavier White both missing time.

""That run is pretty much what we've seen in 15 practices from Tahj Brooks"" Cumbie said ""in terms of his toughness his physicality his pad level. He has unbelievable vision and feet in the backfield.""

The Campbell Minn. native proved to be up to the job bringing his more than 35 years of experience at U.S. Bank operations in the Midwest to bear.

Daby recently agreed to an interview with The Forum where he talked about his pandemic year as a leader how banking has changed thanks to COVID-19 and the economic opportunities and challenges for the region.

In March when you took over the job you were greeted with a pandemic. Tell us about the disruptions that the pandemic has brought to traditional banking.

It’s a blur honestly that (first) month or two of trying to get it all pointed in the right direction.

Within a day or two (of stepping into the job) I was on a conference call with all of the branch managers in the state talking about closing lobbies reducing hours so that our employees would have time to do all of the other stuff that they needed to do because everybody else was reducing hours. There was just a lot of reacting and moving fast.

The nice part about it ... crisis provides focus and it also builds teams really quickly. When you walk into a situation like that with new partners you get to know each other and trust each other fast.

RELATED:

We have some digital technology which allowed us to serve people virtually but we needed to get that up to scale very quickly. … We had the tools we just had to get up to speed as fast as we could and be ready to help customers because they still needed to do their banking.

What type of operations do you think you will keep or expand? What aspects of banking will you be glad to see return as the pandemic wanes?

The mobile banking being able to co-browse and share screens and look at things with customers online. … Webex or virtual meetings. We actually found out there's value in a lot of this.

And customers have really taken to some of the digital tools.

The part of banking that will never change is that it is a people business and it's a service business. When we can finally get back to sitting face-to-face and supplementing the digital with a really great face-to-face conversation and a relationship beyond the computer screen I’m really looking forward to that.

What sort of initiatives would you like to see U.S. Bank spearhead in the region in the next five years?

Our mission statement is to power human potential. I always think of it in three phases.

Powering our customers’ potential. There’s the basics we do checking savings credit cards but then we’re expanding that with other offerings in the digital space. And then one other piece that we’re growing right now is our ability to offer advice and help from a financial literacy standpoint.

You hear very frequently ... ""I wish that somebody had taught me that before.” So we’ve really decided that we need to take ownership in that and help people feel empowered in their finances..

I really want to find ways to take those financial literacy capabilities to the community whether that’s one on one … or through nonprofits or service clubs or whoever and that's both on the consumer side and the business side. I have a bit of a personal passion for entrepreneurs. If we can help them understand business finance and understand what they’re getting themselves into hopefully we can help them succeed and then help the local economy grow.

The last leg of that three-legged stool would be our employees. We have 1500 employees in the region. … Their personal growth and their commitment to the community will also be a part of that financial literacy.

What sort of economic challenges and opportunities do you see for this region in the next few years?

We have to get past the pandemic because there are certain segments (of the economy) that have been really hit hard. I think about the hospitality industry the dining industry tourism. We have to get through the pandemic enough so that we can all help those industries so they come back.

ADVERTISEMENT

Beyond that I think we’ve got a couple of very important pieces of our regional economy in energy and agriculture but they can be cyclical.

(For example) it was like a month or two before the pandemic hit that the whole brouhaha between (Russia) and Saudi Arabia really smacked the oil industry. We were dealing with that. And then a pandemic. (And now the area is dry). We could use a little moisture.

Those three things set aside this economy is amazing. ... For being on the backside of a pandemic unemployment is unbelievably low housing starts were up incomes are up housing values are up. That just speaks to the power of this economy.

What is the importance of community service to you?

I love things that build community. I'm just about the growth of the community.

I’ve served on downtown organizations just to make sure the core of the community is strong.

I’ve had the chance to meet with the DCP (Downtown Community Partnership) a couple of times already. I’m a big fan of what they do. I’m a huge fan of Emerging Prairie and what that’s doing both for the community at large and ...the entrepreneurial community. This area has something special with that entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Any other issues that you think are important?

I’ve always felt that banks are really an integral part to the growth and success of the community. … I’m a believer in (the saying) a rising tide lifts all boats. We just need to make this community strong and everybody wins. I'm just excited to be part of that and have U.S. Bank be part of that.

In early April the Beverly Hills-based bank holding company purchased MUFG Union Bank’s homeowners banking services unit for $250 million in cash — a disruptive deal in a below-the-radar-business.

That transaction has catapulted PacWest into the top ranks of the HOA field according to banking analysts and observers.



An HOA or homeowner’s association is an organization within a subdivision planned community or condominium building that makes and enforces rules for the properties and its residents. Those who purchase property with an HOA jurisdiction automatically become members and are required to pay fees.



An HOA banking practice provides lockbox electronic receivables processing and other financial services to HOA management companies.



Industry analysts expect the HOA banking niche to see a runup in profits as interest rates move higher when the economy emerges from the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic.



PacWest President and Chief Executive Matthew Wagner declined to discuss the acquisition when reached for comment.



The push by PacWest into the HOA market underscores the company’s recent strategy to diversify its lending portfolio and broaden its income streams. PacWest suffered a loss of $1.24 billion last year due to goodwill impairment charges and higher credit loss provisions as Covid-19 took a toll on the company’s loan portfolio.



PacWest had a string of 29 acquisitions between 2000 and 2019. It scrapped an agreement to buy El Dorado Savings Bank in Northern California back in January 2019. It picked up where it left off in February with a deal to buy Civic Financial Services from Redondo Beach-based real estate company Wedgewood a residential business purpose lender.



Some of PacWest’s strategic business push could become clearer when it releases its first quarter financial statement this week.



Nationally the HOA business is difficult to track with some analysts estimating the market encompasses tens of billions of dollars in deposits. No one is sure of the exact size though analysts point to a few big players in the field.



PacWest bought its ticket into this elite club of HOA players with the acquisition of the Union Bank unit. Analysts see the field as ripe for consolidation — with PacWest showing an appetite to become a major player.



“It’s an area that banks are looking to get more involved with. It’s a nice cheap source of deposits. This does put PacWest in a good position to go after this market” said David Chiaverini senior banking analyst with Wedbush Securities Inc. based downtown.



A major change



Wall Street sees the PacWest acquisition as catapulting $29 billion-in-asset Pacific Western Bank to a top competitive spot for HOA services — a major change considering the bank was virtually nowhere on the playing field only a few months ago.



Indeed the MUFG unit adds about $4 billion in HOA deposits to the roughly $1 billion PacWest in HOA funds the company already had on hand. With more than $5 billion in HOA deposits PacWest now ranks among the top banks in the sector according to analysts.



PacWest is betting the payoff will come from rising interest rates and several on Wall Street have already upped their estimates of the bank’s earnings outlook because of the deal.



“It doesn’t pay off in year one or two but give them $4 billion in deposits over the next two three five or 10 years” said Andrew Terrell a vice president and research analyst in charge of regional banks for Stephens Inc. in Little Rock Ark.



“I did the math and it’s a big accretion” he said. “I think PacWest is either the biggest or very near to becoming the biggest HOA banking business.”

Others agree.



“This will benefit PacWest for years. This business is sticky. It’s hard to move customers” said Chris Marinac co-founder and director of research at Atlanta-based FIG Partners an investment banking arm of Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “This is a no-brainer.”



The business also provides another benefit Marinac observed.



“There is a lending component to this” he said of HOAs. “There’s normal maintenance and wear and tear and renovation requires money. If there are enough deposits you can use them to back credit. There isn’t much risk. The chances are very low that they’ll default on the property and the land is worth a lot.”



Local rivals



The biggest rivals in the HOA market locally are Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorporation a $35 billion-in-assets institution that does HOA services business in California under its Alliance Association Bank subsidiary and Irvine-based Pacific Premier Bancorp Inc. parent of $20 billion-in-asset Pacific Premier Bank.



Pacific Premier became an even larger player last summer when it acquired Opus Bank.



In March Pacific Premier disclosed in a securities regulatory filing that it had roughly $1.8 billion in HOA deposits.



Alliance Association President Stephen Curley said his banking unit had roughly $3.9 billion at the end of 2020.



Another major player is Mutual of Omaha Bank which runs its corporate offices out of Phoenix and manages the HOA business.



The company had about $4.5 billion in HOA deposits following CIT Group Inc.’s purchase of Mutual of Omaha for $1 billion in early 2020. The bank changed hands again in October when Raleigh N.C.-based First Citizens BancShares Inc. agreed to merge with New York-based CIT Group in an all-stock deal valued at roughly $2.2 billion.



At the time of the sale CIT Group Chief Financial Officer John Fawcett said the bank’s HOA deposits reached a record high of $5.5 billion adding that the operation was on track to “double HOA deposits over the next five years.”



“I think we’re all about the same size” Curley said. “I think why people think we’re larger is because we’ve grown organically 100% and everybody else did it through acquisition.”



“PacWest wanted to be a player in this business and you know they decided it was easier to buy it than to build it” Curley added.

Now that nearly 200m vaccine doses have been administered people are gathering in bars restaurants and shops. The days are warmer and longer. And banks are making returns on equity of 20% once more.

It has been a while since Wall Street has been able to present the kind of stellar results that America's banks announced to their investors on April 14th. JPMorgan Chase posted record revenues in the first quarter; those at Goldman Sachs were twice the level in the first quarter of 2020. Profits at Bank of America doubled on the year; those at Citigroup tripled. Returns on tangible common equity a measure of profits relative to capital leapt to 20% at Citigroup 29% at JPMorgan and 33% at Goldman. Not since before the global financial crisis more than a decade ago have the banks’ shareholders been so flush (see chart).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vbW9udGF2aWxsYS5uZXQvMjAyMS8wNC8xOC9vbnBvaW50LW9wZW5pbmctaW4tZnJlZC1tZXllci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OnPoint Opening in Fred Meyer – Montavilla News,"Crews are busy at work transforming the former Glisan Street Chase Bank into an OnPoint Community Credit Union. Located inside the Fred Meyer Grocery store at 6615 NE Glisan Street the bank space has remained vacant since last December. Freshly painted signage and new teller stations indicate that banking services will soon return to this location.

The swapping of financial institutions is part of the largest branch expansion in OnPoint’s history. The Credit Union agreed in November of 2020 to open twenty new branches located within Fred Meyer stores across Oregon and Southwest Washington. A month later Cory Freeman became Vice President and Regional Manager of the in-store branches. During that announcement the Glisan Street Fred Meyer was identified as one of those twenty new locations.

The opening of OnPoint is a welcomed change to a recent trend that is reducing banking options in the Montavilla area. Chase Bank US Bank and Riverview have all closed or plan to close their nearby branches. Convenient banking is essential to small businesses dealing in cash. This new location may entice local businesses to move their accounts over to OnPoint. Look for the Credit Union to open in the next few months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL21pZGRsZS1lYXN0L3N5cmlhbi1wb3VuZC1pbXByb3Zlcy1hZnRlci1jZW50cmFsLWJhbmstcmFpc2VzLWV4Y2hhbmdlLXJhdGUtMjAyMS0wNC0xOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Syrian pound improves after central bank raises exchange rate,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-pound-improves-after-central-bank-raises-exchange-rate-2021-04-18/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL21pZGRsZS1lYXN0L3N5cmlhbi1wb3VuZC1pbXByb3Zlcy1hZnRlci1jZW50cmFsLWJhbmstcmFpc2VzLWV4Y2hhbmdlLXJhdGUtMjAyMS0wNC0xOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Getting vaccinated comes as a huge relief. You finally have physical protection against a virus that has haunted us for over a year. Naturally you’re probably thinking about what you’re going to do first. Once two weeks have passed following your second dose (or one Johnson & Johnson dose) you’re considered fully vaccinated.

At this point what activities are considered ‘safe’ to resume?

It’s complicated.

While the current COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective no vaccine is perfect and there are still millions of people who have yet to get their shots. This makes the answers to questions about risk often complex.

The good news: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already started releasing some post-vaccination guidance and is expected to continue to expand on this. So far they’ve declared it’s safe to hang out with other vaccinated people once you’re fully vaccinated. They’ve also declared it “low-risk” to travel domestically once fully vaccinated. But what about things like going to the gym the movies or an outdoor ballgame? Is it really safe to get on an airplane right now?

“With most activities you’re expanding your bubble and that’s the whole point of being vaccinated. But we’re seeing variants that have more transmissibility — it takes less virus to get sick and we’re seeing this in children now too” says Meenakshi Bewtra a Penn Medicine physician and an assistant professor of epidemiology and of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. “So you want to think about who could be in that other bubble including those who may be unvaccinated and considered high risk and also the fact that although these vaccines are very effective there’s still the small chance you could get infected.”

How to assess risk after getting the vaccine

There are a ton of factors that play a role in assessing risk for every situation and experts don’t all agree on exact risk levels for each post-vaccine activity. But there are two areas that generally aren’t debated:

You’re in a safer position once fully vaccinated. Still until more people are protected we should proceed cautiously to protect both ourselves and others.

So what does this all mean? It means that once you’re fully vaccinated it’s unlikely you need to be nervous about venturing to the grocery store. But you do need to continue to wear masks and social distance in most public situations. Outdoor activities remain generally preferable to indoor ones. And you should continue to avoid large crowds.

“The good news is even in the unlikely case where someone gets an infection after a vaccine their likelihood of a serious infection requiring hospitalization is very low based on the data we have so far” says Ayiti-Carmel Maharaj-Best an assistant professor of clinical family medicine and community health at the University of Pennsylvania. “But until we achieve herd immunity we still have to be vigilant to protect those who have not yet received the vaccine.”

How safe are everyday activities? Experts rank them:

To help guide you further we asked seven local experts to rank everyday activities from low-risk to high-risk. All rankings assume you’re fully vaccinated and following appropriate precautionary measures like masking and distancing. One caveat: Risk levels are never clear-cut and will fluctuate depending on what’s going on in your area.

“With any activity it’s going to be very dependent on how much COVID is in your community and what percentage of your community is also vaccinated” says Bewtra.

Consider this a starting baseline and as always assess your own situation accordingly.

Scale: 1-4; 1. Low-risk 2. Low-to-medium-risk 3. Medium-to-high-risk 4. High-risk

** All rankings assume you’re fully vaccinated and following appropriate precautionary measures like masking and distancing.

Going to the gym

Average: 2.6 (low-to-medium-risk)

Highest score: 4; Lowest score: 2

“[This is] high-risk unless we can follow masking disinfecting and social distancing guidelines effectively [which] is difficult to do this even under the best of circumstances in a gym.” Avadhani

“Distance and masking are especially crucial here with the heavy breathing jumping and other movements that could allow particles to travel further distances.” Maharaj-Best

“I’d consider this low-to-medium-risk if you have a rather large gym with good ventilation but medium-to-high-risk if it’s a small community gym which likely has less ventilation.” Johnson

Going to a group exercise class (indoors)

Average: 3.1 (medium-to-high-risk)

Highest score: 4; Lowest score: 2

“I think indoor group exercise is higher-risk than the gym because there’s generally less room to socially distance. And with most exercise the amount of exhale is higher than in everyday activities.” Bewtra

“The higher the intensity of the activity the more likely there will be heavy breathing misplaced masks and particles spewing around the room. I’d say low-impact classes like yoga and pilates are reasonably safe but I would not recommend a group boot camp.” Maharaj-Best

Going to a group exercise class (outdoors)

Average: 1.4 (low-risk)

Highest score: 2; Lowest score: 1

“Almost anything outdoors and masked is going to be very low-risk so encourage your local exercise class instructors to get outside.” Johnson

“Outdoor classes allow for excellent air circulation. Wearing a mask with social distancing would minimize infectious risk.” Mareiniss

Running outside without a mask

Average: 1 (low-risk)

Highest score: 1; Lowest score: 1

“Running with a group would increase the risk of infection.” Mareiniss

“Always carry a mask with you.” Bewtra

“[If alone] you’re likely not sharing air with anyone so this is very low-risk. That said the Schuylkill River Trail gets narrow and crowded in some areas so avoid these areas if you’re going maskless for your sake and others.” Johnson

Going to a museum

Average: 1.7 (low-to-medium-risk)

Highest score: 2; Lowest score: 1

“Most museums are large and open with plenty of room for shared air. But if eating or drinking is allowed inside this goes up to medium-to-high-risk or even high-risk in the eating area.” Johnson

“Risk will depend on the ventilation in the museum and number of people. Generally with social distancing and masks I would consider it to be an acceptable risk.” Mareiniss

Going to a movie (indoors)

Average: 2.1 (low-to-medium-risk)

Highest score: 3; Lowest score: 1

“You need to wear a mask and keep that mask on — so no popcorn or drinks.” Bewtra

“This depends on a number of factors including the ventilation in the theater the duration of exposure and concentration of people. If the vaccinated individual removes their mask to eat or drink I would consider such activity to be high-risk.” Mareiniss

“There’s no way to know once the lights go out if people keep their masks on. Skip the theaters for now — too much unknown.” Johnson

Taking an Uber/taxi

Average: 2.1 (low-to-medium-risk)

Highest score: 3; Lowest score: 2

*One expert ranked the risk as 2 with the windows down; 3 with the windows up

“Limiting passengers to the backseat and having the windows down would help to further decrease risk.” Maharaj-Best

“If the driver is masked and the windows are down this is a ‘2’. If either of those aren’t true this is a ‘3’. If both are not true cancel your ride.” Johnson

Going to church / a place of worship

Average: 2.4 (low-to-medium-risk)

Highest score: 3; Lowest score: 2

“In some of these older churches the ventilation might not be as good. If the windows are open there’s no singing and you’re socially distancing you can mitigate some of that risk. But any kind of choir is going to make it riskier.” Bewtra

“Most churches are doing socially distanced fully masked services some even with reservations. This is low-to-medium-risk but if you’re doing more close-quarters fellowshipping I’d escalate it to medium-to-high-risk. Be very careful to minimize time in relatively small shared spaces like the restroom.” Johnson

Going to an outdoor ballgame

Average: 1.9 (low-to-medium-risk)

Highest score: 3; Lowest score: 1

“Philly sports fans are known for letting their passion show. Screaming and cheering can theoretically increase the particles emitted so distance and masking is critical.” Maharaj-Best

“I would keep the mask up in between eating.” Bewtra

“[Risk] also depends on whether we are talking about risk for the individual or the population. Going to a ballgame seems like a very low-risk activity for [a vaccinated] individual but since it involves a lot of people it may be higher-risk for the city.” Bilal

Going to a restaurant (indoors)

Average: 3.6 (medium-to-high-risk)

Highest score: 4; Lowest score: 2

“Because masks are off distance is extra important here. Also choosing who you dine with. If you are with your household or with a small group of vaccinated friends that may be reasonably safe if appropriately distanced from other tables.” Maharaj-Best

“With current capacity allowances there are too many people in a confined space sharing the same air. This is of particular concern with the variants which have shown potential to infect fully vaccinated people.” Johnson

Going to a restaurant (outdoors)

Average: 1.4 (low-risk)

Highest score: 2; Lowest score: 1

“The circulating air outdoors acts to limit the risk of exposure and infection.” Mareiniss

“Mask up when your server comes because you don’t know their vaccination status but if everyone at your table is vaccinated and you can eat outside that’s a great way to enjoy eating at a restaurant safely.” Bewtra

Grocery shopping

Average: 1.4 (low-risk)

Highest score: 2; Lowest score: 1

“Minimize time in the store.” Avadhani

“Try to go shopping at off-peak times and go with a list.” Johnson

Retail shopping

Average: 1.4 (low-risk)

Highest score: 2; Lowest score: 1

“If the fitting rooms are open to each other above and below I’d try to keep the mask on as much as you can. You need to assess the situation and act accordingly.” Bewtra

“Try to avoid weekend shopping when possible.” Johnson

View the current offers here.

It's no secret there's a massive rental car shortage right now.

So I can't say I was completely surprised when I went to book a car back to Philadelphia after visiting family in Dayton OH last week and my search on Kayak returned prices starting (starting!) at a whopping $460 for a one-day economy vehicle rental.

I had already been in Ohio for three weeks after a one-week extension thanks to a last-minute opening to get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and needed to get home and had too much stuff (re: three weeks' worth of baked goods from my mom clean-out-the-closet junk an overstuffed suitcase and my pup Ruby) to get on a plane which probably would have been cheaper.

Thus I began my quest for a way home that wouldn't set me back almost $500.

Securing a car out of Dayton was out of the question. One-way rentals — available only at the Dayton International Airport (DAY) — were too astronomically priced to justify a mere eight hours of use. I figured I might have better luck in a larger market so I shifted my focus to the next closest major city that would take me in the same direction as my final destination -- Columbus OH. Sure enough cars were pricing out for a fraction of the cost. And by fraction I mean only $120 — $340 cheaper than the options in Dayton.

But before I could book I had to solve for one last issue: how to get the 70+ miles from my mom's house to the rental office in downtown Columbus. Despite the distance I priced out an Uber out of curiosity and found my solution. The fare was only $95 after applying the up to $15 monthly Uber credit from The Platinum Card® from American Express (enrollment required for benefit). Plus a $20 tip for the driver that I paid for with the twenty my mom slipped me on the way out (thanks Mom!).

That meant instead of spending $460 for a one-way rental out of Dayton I was able to reserve a car for only $120 out of Columbus plus $95 for the Uber to get there saving me $245 in the end. Not bad if you're willing to do a little schlepping.

To pay for the reservation I used my Chase Sapphire Reserve to take advantage of the rental protection.

Bottom line

The rental car shortage is very real especially if you are starting from a limited market like I was and don't have much flexibility in terms of dates and/or are making a close-in reservation.

That said there are workarounds if you're willing to get creative. Consider larger markets nearby and using alternative modes of transportation such as Uber to get there. Dig into your credit card perks for any tools that will help keep costs down and always remember to use a card that offers rental protection to book.

Uber is being forced in some countries to provide more employment benefits through court actions and in order to ease tensions with workers and regulators—and drivers in South Africa and Nigeria are taking note.

In February a group of drivers in South Africa announced plans to file a class action lawsuit against Uber for unpaid overtime and holiday pay. The drivers are hoping for a similar victory to that of their British peers with the UK Supreme Court in February ruling that Uber must treat drivers as workers not as self-employed contractors. That entitled drivers to benefits such as minimum wage and paid leave. (The law firm which represented the UK drivers is assisting with the South African lawsuit.)

What’s becoming increasingly clear is that the US-based gig worker model is falling short to that of labor standards in other parts of the world such as in countries like South Africa which have a history of unionization and strong worker protections. The tensions could become a hurdle for Uber’s global growth.

“After the London fiasco Uber cannot put the genie back in the bottle and we expect more regulatory and legal battles in South Africa and across Europe on this hot button issue” said Dan Ives an analyst at Los Angeles-based investment firm Wedbush Securities in a statement to Quartz. “The class action suit in South Africa could slow Uber’s growth plans in the country until this overhang is removed or settled.”

South African Uber drivers are currently classified as self-employed despite long-standing efforts by drivers for more protections. Drivers in the country face a particularly challenging climate as they are often targeted with violence and intimidation by meter-cab competitors and the country’s powerful taxi network.

The British law firm Leigh Day and Johannesburg-based peer Mbuyisa Moleele Attorneys said in a statement to Reuters that the case could affect up to 20000 drivers.

The tension between gig companies and workers is also showing up in other parts of Africa. Last month a group of Uber drivers in Nigeria said it is working on a class-action lawsuit against ride-hailing companies Uber and Bolt also citing the UK outcome. The drivers are seeking compensation for unpaid overtime and holiday pay pensions and social security as well as union recognition. (The company faced a similar suit by two Nigerian drivers in 2017.)

The latest action comes as the ride-hailing market in Africa has been expanding with a proliferation of local startups and international competitors. DiDi Chuxing a Chinese ride-hailing backed by SoftBank began operating in Cape Town South Africa in March. According to the BBC Uber is present in at least seven African countries and has 150000 drivers.

Following the UK case Alexander Colvin a dean at Cornell’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations says that it wouldn’t be a “surprise” if the South African courts were to be protective of driver rights and grant workers employment law protections.

How much is at stake for Uber was evident last year having won on its own turf with Prop 22 in California. Uber along with Lyft DoorDash and Instacart spent over $200 billion on a campaign to keep workers classified as independent contractors with limited benefits in one of the largest markets it operates in. But outside of the US the ride-hailing giant and other gig companies have faced a slew of regulatory battles particularly in Europe the last several years.

In 2018 Uber drivers in Europe became eligible for sick leave and some other health-related benefits. Then in 2020 Foodora workers in Norway formed their first union after a six-week strike. The 600 employees involved demanded higher pay as well as guaranteed compensation for workers’ use of bikes uniforms and smartphones.

Uber may have cleared worker classification hurdles in the US but the global debate on gig worker rights is far from over.

I’ve been naturally “blessed” with a couple of large sunspots on my face thanks to a childhood spent growing up on the beach without proper SPF habits. However my time spent in the sun has never quite mimicked the adorable spots I find ever so charming. I know many people born with freckles who have tried nearly everything under the sun to get rid of or conceal them –a cosmetic pursuit that’s always left me puzzled and envious.

And while the obvious remark that embracing your natural beauty — “flaws” and all — certainly warrants being addressed here I find freckles to be an asset not a flaw. Moles over-sized birthmarks and blemishes are nothing to hide in my book. I’ve learned the phrase ” you always want what you don’t have” is astonishingly accurate when it comes to our personal views on beauty. When I was young I prayed that I would be granted with the voluptuous curves (and cleavage) of Marilyn Monroe when I grew up but instead was dealt a different set of cards — an awkwardly lengthy frame and a modest (aka flat) chest.

I’ve come to embrace without ever being tempted to correct these traits with surgery — though I will admit to wearing a ridiculously padded bra from time to time. While I realize this is an arguably trite cliche in the age of body positivity my point is that enhancing your features with makeup and hair changes can be a fun way to play with certain features you find attractive without concealing the beauty you were born with and for me fake freckles are the prime example of this ethos. And clearly I’m not alone here seeing as how nearly every Instagram filter comes with a subtle set of freckles and all the cool beauty TikTokers are giving tutorials on how to get faux freckles.

After conducting even more research on the blossoming beauty trend I found a lofty collection of YouTube tutorials and beauty how-to’s offering step-by-step guides for achieving the look. Makeup artist Katie Jane Hughes is a fan of the look as are YouTubers like James Charles and even supermodel Candice Swanepoel.

With that being said when I discovered a freckle-feigning beauty product called Freck I was immediately intrigued at the idea of coloring on faux freckles over my base for a “natural” look. Aside from their undeniable adorable factor adding a couple of spots on top of your makeup can help an over-powdered or full coverage look appear more natural and skin-like. It’s the ultimate hack for “no-makeup makeup.”

Freck is an excellent fool-proof product that allows you to create long-lasting and natural-looking spots. I waited a month for it to get restocked before I was able to purchase it and yes it was worth the wait. But it’s also super easy to add them on using an eyebrow pencil eyeliner or eyeshadow that’s a few shades darker than your skin color and has a cool or neutral undertone. There are even stick-on products to give you a super intense look too. Here’s how to fake freckles for a quintessentially sunkissed look at any time of the year.

Freck O.G. Freckle Pen

If I didn’t make it obvious earlier I am clearly obsessed with this freckle-faking pen. It’s a liquid formula that dries down matte (almost like a long-wearing lip stain) after a couple of minutes giving you time to pat in the product for a more natural look. I simply press the applicator directly on the bridge of my nose and cheeks and use my finger to soften them a bit but you can also use a beauty sponge for extra precision.

I like to add this on top of foundation and a good setting powder for extra longevity but you also wear it alone or under a tinted moisturizer or BB cream for a more subtle effect. Also the O.G. Pen now comes in an XL size and darker hue Freck Noir to suit a wider range of skin tones.

ColourPop Faux Freckle Pen

This easy-to-use faux freckle pen comes in two shades—light brown and dark to cater to different skin tones. The pen is designed with a foolproof felt-tip applicator and a super-long-wearing ink formula that stays put all day long.

Lottie London Freckle Tint

This newly debuted drugstore freckle pen is great for quickly adding some spots to your look. It has a similar application design to Freck’s and allows you to build up your faux freckled look to your desired liking whether you’re going for subtle or aiming to look like an Instagram filter.

Lime Crime Freckle Pen

Just like a felt tip eyeliner marker this Faux Freckle pen is easy to use thanks to large but precise applicator tip. The long-wearing formula dries down quickly but too fast so that you can’t pat down any accidents before it sets into place for the day. I also love that it’s available in two different shades to accommodate more skin tones: amber and cocoa.

Pseudo Labs PHreckles

This genius liquid formula applies similarly to the way the sun would “apply” natural freckles to the skin. Basically you flick the freckles onto your skin using the spoolie-like brush working in sections of the face. It also features a fine-tip applicator allowing you to add precise or more prominent spots as well. PHreckles are waterproof and transfer-resistant for up to eighty minutes or wear and they last about four to six hours. Also the leather packaging the kit comes with couldn’t be any chicer.

L’oreal Infallible Long-Lasting Eyeliner Pen

This long-wearing felt tip eyeliner is a great alternative to the Freck Pen because it has a pointed tip for precise application when you’re adding dots by hand and dries down almost instantly for a full day of fade-resistant wear. Simply tap the applicator onto the areas where you want to add some dots and quickly pat with a finger brush or sponge to soften the look to your liking.

Wunderbrow Dual Precision Brow Liner

If you’re looking for a more forgiving (i.e. error-proof) option for fake freckles this long-wearing eyebrow pencil is a solid choice. It’s creamy enough to give you plenty of blending power in case you mess up in the process but not overly waxy so you don’t have to worry about it smudging or transferring throughout the course of the day.

NYX Nude Matte Eyeshadow

Using a taupe or cool-toned brow powdered eyeshadow is another more forgiving product for adding fake specks. However this method requires a bit more prep than others. You’ll want to grab an angled or super-tiny shadow/inner corner brush and add a generous amount of powder. Then you’ll use your finger to create flicking motions to apply the product over your nose and cheeks. It may sound a little daunting but it results in an ultra-natural effect which you can choose to wear alone or build up with a pencil afterward.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Leading stock indexes continued their winning streak with S&P 500 maintaining the uptrend for the fourth week in a row and hitting a new high.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 34000-mark for the first time adding around 150 points in the last session. The sentiment was buoyed by encouraging retail sales data and reports of jobless claims falling.

The first-quarter earnings season got off to a good start with banking giants JPMorgan Chase Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs unveiling their latest financial data mid-week. They were joined by software firm Infosys on Wednesday.

The spotlight stayed on financial services Thursday also when the closely followed reports of Citigroup and Bank of America came out. Delta Air Lines and soft-drink behemoth PepsiCo released earnings on the same day. The first phase of bank earnings concluded on Friday with Morgan Stanley’s blockbuster Q1 report.

It’s going to be mixed bag next week. For instance the companies scheduled to report on April 19 include United Airlines Holdings IBM and Coca-Cola. The important corporate houses preparing to report on April 20 comprise Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson as well as streaming giant Netflix which has been thriving on the COVID-driven boom. The earning reports of superbike company Harley-Davidson and Lockheed Martin are also slated for Tuesday.

The other major companies that can elicit investor interest include Halliburton Verizon Communications Chipotle Mexican Grill and Kinder Morgan – the companies will report earnings on April 21. The next day it is the turn of American Airlines and Southwest Airlines as well as tech firms AT&T and Intel. American Express is probably the only big player to report on April 23.

The market was abuzz with the news of Microsoft’s $20-billion buyout of cloud software company Nuance Communications. In another important deal in the cloud space Datadog completed the acquisition of the SaaS-based security platform Sqreen.

The otherwise quiet M&A market witnessed Dell Technologies becoming two standalone public companies by spinning off its 81% ownership in VMware. The other major deals include Amgen’s $2-billion purchase of Five Prime Therapeutics and the acquisition of Upchain by software firm Autodesk.

UPS,United Parcel Service,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbWluaW9ucG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xOC91cHMtZHJpdmVyLXJldGlyZXMtYWZ0ZXItNDQteWVhcnMtb2Ytc2VydmljZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPS driver retires after 44 years of service,"MORGANTOWN —After more than four decades as a United Parcel Service driver Tom Howes is heading into retirement but his dedication will not be forgotten.

“I feel like a football coach that’s losing their all-star quarterback” said Tryston Kessler Tom’s supervisor.

His career with UPS began when he was 19. In his first position Tom worked between the early hours of 3:30-8:30 a.m. each day as a delivery truck loader. He said that was back when UPS only delivered to addresses in the United States.

A few years passed and he was promoted to a full-time position as a delivery and pickup driver. From there he began delivering wherever he was needed covering Harrison Taylor Marion Monongalia and Preston counties.

Over the years Tom was often on his route during times of historical tragedies and events. For many of those moments he remembers exactly where he was.

“Looking back there are certain days that stand out to me in my memory” Tom said. “Like where I was delivering on the day President Reagan was shot the space shuttle exploded or on 9/11.”

As a driver Tom recalls braving many storms.

The worst winter he remembers was around 2010 or 2011. The snow in Morgantown was deep but it was worse in Preston County. Carports garages barns and other structures had collapsed from the weight of the snow.

As plow trucks were being driven nonstop he said he delivered many roof rakes tire chains and snow blower parts that winter. It became common for state road workers to call him directly in hopes of getting the parts they needed as soon as possible to keep the roads clear.

When Superstorm Sandy hit in 2012 he remembers how heavily it rained while he was delivering. As his truck climbed higher in elevation the rain quickly turned to slush. Fallen trees began to litter and block the roadways but he continued on his route.

“The leaves were still on the trees and the wet snow was causing them to snap which sounded like rifle shots” he said.

Most importantly Tom remembers the people who were there to help him when he needed them most. When the weather was rough it was common for people on his route to offer him a warm place to stay. If his truck was stuck in a snowbank he knew those same people were just one call away.

His career had no lack of mishaps as well.

In an attempt to surprise him for his birthday Tom’s wife Connie Howes shipped his gift to her parents’ house for safekeeping. Unfortunately for Connie Tom was going off his normal route that same day since another driver had taken the day off.

“She stopped over at her parents’ house after work and here I pull up to deliver to her parents’ house because I had the package my wife had ordered” he said. “It just ruined her surprise.”

Since taking on his first position at UPS Tom has seen the company evolve into what it is today.

As a truck loader he had to memorize charts instructing him how to reload each truck. When he first started his career as a driver he had a clipboard in hand where he wrote down deliveries and collected signatures. Every truck at that time was standard shift.

When he began rural routes country stores were a wealth of information when it came to directions. Today many of those previous systems are now digitized GPS systems guide drivers and the number of packages delivered each day has grown exponentially due to online shopping.

Delivering packages day in and day out has allowed Tom to get to know the people on his route. He said what someone ordered often reveals their hobbies interests and what is going on in their life.

Although Tom will miss getting to know the people on his routes he is looking forward to enjoying many of the hobbies he has had little time for including going to the gym with his wife and skiing.

“I would like to thank all of the people who have shown their kindness and appreciation to me for getting their deliveries to them” he said. “My one regret is that I never won the lottery because every rough road that I went up I would tell the people when I win the lottery I am going to pave your road.”

During the program the Top 12 contestants sang Oscar-nominated songs including the raspy-voiced Beckham who performed the romantic ballad “(Everything I Do) I Do It for You” from the 1991 film “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.”

Toward the end of the show host Ryan Seacrest assembled the singers on stage and announced the names of each finalist including Beckham whom he called “the pride of Apple Valley.”

After singers Ava August Brennan “Beane” Hepler and Madison Watkins came up short in “Idol” votes Seacrest announced that the finalists would depart for a weeklong stay at the Disney World Resort in Florida before returning to the show on May 2.

During his performance Beckham wore a dark blazer striped shirt jeans and cowboy boots as he strummed his guitar and sang the Bryan Adams song featured in the motion picture soundtrack and on Adams’ album “Waking Up the Neighbours.”

After Beckham’s performance judges Lionel Richie Katy Perry and Luke Bryan gave the singer a standing ovation while a live shot showed his parents in Apple Valley cheering for their son along with the family dog Festus named after a character from the TV western “Gunsmoke.”

'I think you’re the frontrunner in this thing'

Bryan heaped accolades on Beckham a United Rentals heavy machine operator who was born in Victorville and graduated in 2014 from Whitcomb High School a continuation school in Glendora located in the San Gabriel Valley.

“I’m so inspired by how much you’ve grown from the day you walked into the audition until now” Bryan told Beckham. “And man that was a — your ability to just be yourself and deliver songs like you do it is just — man I think you’re the frontrunner in this thing I really do.”

Richie said during the first half of Beckham’s performance he was holding his breath and waiting for the singer to “let go.”

“The second half of that song you found yourself — you found yourself OK?” Richie said. “No matter what happens give us all of you from now on. You got the power you got the voice — make it happen.”

Perry said she didn’t know who Beckham was singing for but believes there were a lot of young ladies voting that had “hearts in their eyes” and thinking the singer’s song was performed just for them.

Perry said Beckham delivered his unusual song choice “authentically” and took the song to “the next level” while “pushing his voice.”

During the show Beckham said he chose the inspirational song because it reflects much of his life before “Idol'' back when he was in “a bad way.”

'A few drinks too many'

A video showed Beckham playing his guitar somewhere in the High Desert as he recalled the day he “had a few drinks too many” and tried to drive home. One clip showed a damaged truck as Beckham recalled the worst night of his life.

San Bernardino County court records show the crash occurred Oct. 31 of last year. Beckham faces two misdemeanor charges and has pleaded not guilty. On Monday April 12 a judge continued the case to June 7.

Beckham said he doesn’t know where he’d be if he never started his “American Idol” journey adding “I could be dead I could be in jail.”

In a previous show Beckham said during the crash his life flashed before his eyes in the near-death experience that set him on a straighter narrower path.

Joining Beckham in the Top 9 are singers Alyssa Wray Caleb Kennedy Casey Bishop Cassandra Coleman Deshawn Goncalves Grace Kinstler Hunter Metts and Willie Spence.

View the current offers here.

For a long time there were primarily two classes of rewards credit cards: Those that cost $100 or less per year in annual fees and then ones that were $500 or more per year. Naturally the $500-plus per year premium cards came with many more perks than those that cost under $100. But there's a whole lot of runway between those two annual fee amounts.

Luckily for those looking for a different option in the sweet spot between the entry-level and premium tiers in recent years the space for credit cards with annual fees costing between $200 and $300 per year has started to fill out a bit. This included splashes such as the big American Express® Gold Card revamp in 2018 ($250 per year; see rates and fees) and the trend continues now with the very recent introduction of the New United Quest Card which comes with an annual fee of $250.

In the world of airline credit cards the most head-to-head competitor to the United Quest Card at this mid-tier level is likely the Delta SkyMiles® Platinum American Express Card which also comes with a $250-per-year price tag (see rates and fees). These two cards are issued by different banks and provide miles and perks valid at different airlines but they also share many similarities.

Let's see how these two cards stack up in a head-to-head competition.

Welcome bonus

Both of these mid-tier airline cards come with impressive welcome bonuses right now.

The new United Quest Card offers up to 100000 bonus miles with its introductory offer. This bonus is awarded in two parts: 80000 bonus United miles after $5000 in spending in the first three months and another 20000 miles after a total of $10000 in spending in the first six months. TPG values the full 100000-mile bonus at $1300.

The Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex is currently offering 90000 bonus miles after you spend $3000 on purchases in the first three months of account opening for a limited time (offer ends May 5 2021). TPG values these 90000 miles at $990.

Which is better?

While TPG values the full United Quest bonus at over $300 more than the Delta Platinum Amex bonus making it the winner in this category your particular valuations may vary based on how you usually use your miles. Here are some of our favorite ways to redeem 100000 United miles.

It's also worth highlighting that earning the full 100000-mile bonus with the United Quest card requires a total of $10000 in spending while the Delta Platinum Amex requires just $3000 in spending to earn the full bonus which may be an easier assignment for some. Here are some ideas on big-ticket everyday expenses you could shift to your card if you need help reaching that $10000 total within six months.

Winner: United Quest Card

Main benefits and features

The United Quest Card offers some interesting perks that aren't replicated by many other cards.

There's a $125 annual statement credit against United purchases each year which is pretty easy to value at $125 for United travelers. It also awards two 5000-mile bonuses — one for each time you redeem miles per cardmember anniversary year up to 10000 total miles in a year. Based on TPG valuations that's a potential $130 in value each year.

On top of those unique offerings the card also provides a free first and second checked bag for the cardholder and one other on the reservation along with priority boarding and a 25% statement credit toward inflight purchases on United. Having this card also makes the cardmember eligible for upgrades on award flights if they have United elite status.

The Delta Platinum Amex's marquee ongoing benefit is the anniversary companion ticket awarded each year you renew the card. This ticket is only valid in Main Cabin (economy) and the first ticket must be charged to your Delta card. There are also some fare class restrictions which make the benefit unavailable on certain dates and routes. On the positive side the benefit can be used even if the cardholder is not on the flight making it shareable with friends or family.

Both cards offer elite-like benefits such as a certain amount of included checked bags when flying that airline (and using the card to purchase the tickets) priority boarding and a 20%-25% rebate on eligible inflight spending on snacks drinks etc.

Which is better?

While there is the potential for greater value out of the annual Delta companion ticket than the United $125 statement credit and two 5000-mile award bonuses more strings are attached to its use. There is also a reasonable chance the companion ticket benefit could go wholly unused in a given year if there isn't a trip that lines up with availability or the need to bring along a traveling companion.

Given all that we're calling this one a draw as both cards have similar base-level perks and either set of unique perks could be more valuable in different scenarios.

Tie: United Quest and Delta Platinum Amex

Earning miles

The United Quest Card provides 3x miles on United purchases (immediately after earning $125 United purchase credit) 2x on other travel charges (including other airlines hotels car rentals etc.) 2x on dining and select streaming and 1x miles on other purchases.

The Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex has a similar 3-2-1 earning structure to the United Quest Card. In the case of the Delta mid-tier card you'll earn 3x miles on eligible purchases with Delta and hotels (made directly with the hotels) 2x miles at restaurants and U.S. supermarkets and 1x on other purchases.

Which is better?

While getting 3x miles for charges with their respective airlines isn't bad the truth is neither of these mid-tier airline cards is truly great when it comes to spending bonus categories.

That said keep in mind the different TPG valuations for the miles. For example earning 2x United miles per dollar is a 2.6% return on spending if you use TPG valuations while 2x Delta miles is just a 2.2% return given the lower valuation per mile.

However if you want to earn United miles you're really better served with the Chase Sapphire Reserve's 3x points awarded on dining and travel since you can transfer those Chase Ultimate Rewards points to United at a 1:1 ratio.

If it is Delta SkyMiles you seek you can earn 5x Membership Rewards points on airfare booked directly with the airlines via The Platinum Card® from American Express (up to $500000 on these purchases per calendar year) and/or 4x points per dollar spent at restaurants and U.S. supermarkets with the American Express Gold Card. You could then transfer those Amex Membership Rewards points at a 1:1 ratio to Delta SkyMiles.

In short neither is great when it comes to spending bonuses but both are respectable.

Tie: United Quest and Delta Platinum Amex

Elite benefits

The United Quest and Delta SkyMiles Platinum cards both make it easier to inch to the next elite status level with spending put on the cards. However both require a lot of spending to move the needle up the status chain very far.

The United Quest Card awards 500 Premier qualifying points for every $12000 charged to the card with a max of 3000 points with $72000 in annual spending.

For context in 2021 United will require 3000 PQPs and eight flight segments or 3500 PQPs and four flight credits for the entry-level Silver status tier. The next tier Gold would require 6000 PQPs and 16 flight segments or 7000 PQPs with four required flight segments on United or United Express. In other words assuming you had at least four segments on United-operated flights in the year you could charge your way to United Silver status with $72000 in spending on the card.

With the Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex you earn 10000 Medallion Qualification Miles after spending $25000 in a calendar year on the card. You can then unlock an additional 10000 MQMs after spending a total of $50000 in a calendar year.

Delta requires 25000 MQMs and $3000 Medallion Qualification Dollars (essentially dollars spent with the airline) for entry-level Silver status and 50000 MQMs and $6000 MQDs for Gold status. This means you normally could not spend your way to Silver status with Delta the way you could with United assuming you met the flight segment requirement.

With Delta if you don't meet the Medallion Qualification Dollar thresholds in a calendar year you can still qualify for Platinum Gold and Silver Medallion status if you have earned the required Medallion Qualification Miles or Medallion Qualification Segments and make at least $25000 in eligible purchases on your card that year. If you want top-tier Diamond status and didn't meet the MQD threshold you must make at least $250000 in eligible purchases on your card that year to unlock that status level.

Which is better?

The reality is these benefits are very similar though each program works a bit differently. Frankly I don't like how the benefit works on either card very much as I'd rather see it possible to make incremental progress with everyday spending than have to hit a five-figure amount of annual spending before you make any progress at all.

However I'm giving the edge to United because you can charge your way to enough PQDs for Silver status assuming you hit the flight segment requirements.

With Delta you can actually also do that this year with a 2021-only opportunity for an additional 2500 MQMs each time you spend $25000 in purchases on your Platinum Card up to two times but it's not a normal offering. If that becomes a permanent addition it could likely sway me to ranking Delta as the victor in this category.

Delta Platinum Amex

The Delta Platinum Amex now provides cellphone coverage for stolen or damaged phones when you use it to pay your monthly cell phone bill. Coverage is valid up to $800 per claim with each claim coming with a $50 deductible and a maximum of two claims per 12-month period.

Club access

United Quest

Unlike the United Club Infinite Card — and even the United Explorer Card that provides two annual one-time passes — the United Quest card does not provide any United Club access benefits.

Delta Platinum Amex

With this card you and up to two guests can purchase Delta Sky Club access for $50 per person when traveling on a Delta flight.

TSA/Global Entry

United Quest

The card offers a statement credit of $100 every four years against application fees for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck when charged to your card.

Delta Platinum Amex

You can receive a statement credit every four years after applying for Global Entry ($100) or a statement credit every 4 1/2 years after applying for TSA PreCheck (up to $85).

Which card should you get?

If you fly a couple of times per year with either of these airlines both are cards worth considering.

Personally I have the Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex primarily for the annual companion certificate but also so that I have some elite-like perks when it comes to waived bag fees and priority boarding. When combined with other limited-time offerings that come and go (such as the current $15 monthly statement credit at U.S. restaurants) I easily cover the $250 fee per year in value.

I also very much want the United Quest Card. The $125 annual statement credit on United purchases and two 5000-mile credits when you redeem miles each anniversary year are enticing to me as a regular United flyer. Trying the card out while it has a bonus of up to 100000 miles is likely going to be enough to get me to apply before that bonus ends.

Between the two cards which is best for you likely comes down to which airline you reliably fly at least a few times per year.

In the case of the Delta SkyMiles Platinum Card its best ongoing perk (the companion certificate) requires that you fly at least once a year with a companion on a paid ticket. If you don't fall into that category I'd skip this card in favor of one of the other Delta options such as the Delta SkyMiles® Gold American Express Card that comes with an introductory annual fee of $0 for the first year then $99 (see rates and fees).

With the United Quest Card while it may be worth trying out during the introductory 100000-mile bonus period regardless of your exact travel patterns on an ongoing basis this card will be best for those who fly on a mix of paid and United award flights every year. Otherwise the $95-per-year (waived the first year) United Explorer Card may be a better match for less frequent United flyers.

It's entirely possible that both the United Quest and Delta SkyMiles Platinum cards deserve a spot in your wallet — I hope to end up with both of them in mine.

Bottom line

It's fun to rank two similar competitors against each other and see where one shines the brightest.

The United Quest card currently has the stronger introductory welcome bonus better built-in travel protections and a slight edge when it comes to elite status earnings.

However the Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex is the heavyweight champion if you travel on paid domestic flights with a companion if you want ongoing cellphone protection or if you want to check bags for more than two people on your reservation. Personally speaking I'm about to move my own cellphone bill over there to help offset the cost of future unfortunate drops.

These mid-tier cards both make compelling cases to join your credit card lineup. If you only want to choose one the best one for you will likely be the one that aligns with the airline you fly most consistently.

Ned Lamont April 13 expressing concerns with legislation expanding state-run healthcare and imposing a new tax on policyholders.

“The pandemic has demonstrated that employees can work virtually making it easier for companies to choose where they are domiciled and grow” the executives wrote in the letter.

“As a result it has never been more critical for the state to create a climate that retains and attracts businesses that will help stabilize the economy. All of us will have to decide where it will be best to deploy our resources long term.

“Private employers and taxpayers should not fund unsustainable public policy pursuits.”

Signed by the CEOs of Anthem Cigna CVS Health Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare and UnitedHealth Group the letter warned that passage of SB 842—which expands state-run healthcare—”will only further deteriorate the state’s fragile economy.”

Fiscal Health Questions

In February CBIA called for an independent audit to address the significant questions surrounding the fiscal health of the state’s municipal plan—known as the State Partnership Plan—which is the model for SB 842.

State Comptroller Kevin Lembo a leading advocate for expanding state-run healthcare manages the partnership plan. He has yet to respond to the audit request.

“The State Partnership Plan does not have the proven experience to run a health insurance program for its residents” the letter signed by the executives notes.

“The state comptroller administered the partnership program at a shortfall of $10 million in 2018 and $31 million in 2019.

“Taking from one pot of money to cover a deficit in another is not sound fiscal policy.” April 13 CEO letter

“The argument put forth attempts to argue the partnership program is solvent and successful; we would argue that taking from one pot of money to cover a deficit in another is not sound fiscal policy.

“Continuing on this path will only further deteriorate the state’s fragile economy.”

CBIA’s call for an audit cited the latest detailed and concerning analysis of the plan’s fiscal outlook produced by the insurance agency Brown & Brown.

The agency has a large number of clients enrolled in the municipal plan. Brown & Brown officials are concerned with the plan’s unregulated status and believe greater oversight is needed to ensure its fiscal health.

Tax Hike

In the letter to Lamont and legislative leaders the insurance company CEOs also addressed a proposed tax hike—modeled on a now repealed federal tax—that will drive up healthcare costs for employers and families.

The $50 million tax on healthcare polices included in SB 842 and HB 6447 is designed to fund additional premium subsidies for policies issued by the state-run healthcare exchange.

The executives argued that the federal American Rescue Plan Act signed into law March 11 provides the premium relief sought by both bills without raising taxes on small businesses and residents.

“The state should not attempt to lower the cost of insurance for some by imposing significant new taxes on others.” CEO letter

“While we believe your intent is one we share—to bolster the state’s health exchange Access Health CT—we firmly believe that state and newly passed federal funding can and should be used for this purpose—not a new tax on policyholders” the letter notes.

“Residents are already paying over $100 million in health insurance taxes to the state. The state should not attempt to lower the cost of insurance for some by imposing significant new taxes on others that will inevitably be passed along to policyholders in the form of higher premiums.”

Innovation

A recent independent report showed that the 2019 repeal of the federal tax on insurance policies will reduce premiums by more than $270 billion over the next 10 years.

The health insurance executives also referenced Lamont’s call for private sector innovation to address rising healthcare costs and to support small businesses.

“You rightly called upon the private market to continue innovating and providing more choices for some of our struggling small employers” the letter read. “We have done just that. There are now a number of offerings with new products in the market.

The 2019 repeal of the federal tax on insurance policies will reduce premiums by more than $270 billion over 10 years.

“To allow carriers to innovate and further compete the administration and the legislature should explore updating the current legal and regulatory framework to allow for maximum flexibility.

“We look to you to provide leadership and focus on proposals that will provide much-needed stability and support.

“As companies committed to the people and communities of Connecticut we look forward to working with you your administration and the legislature to find ways to build a sustainable affordable and more accessible health system for the people we are privileged to serve.”

Economic Impact

According to a 2019 study produced by the Connecticut Economic Resource Center the health insurance industry employs 25058 workers and supports another 23000-plus additional jobs in ancillary industries.

The study found that industry employers pay $5.2 billion in wages and benefits annually with an average salary of $123000.

Connecticut’s health insurance industry employs 25058 workers and supports another 23000-plus additional jobs.

The industry also generates $15.5 billion in annual economic activity pays over $209 million in state taxes and provides $101 million in funding for public health and welfare programs.

The CERC report estimated that even a 10% decline in the state’s health insurance industry would lead to a loss of some 5000 jobs and $1.6 billion in economic output.

A decline of 25% to 50% would lead to a loss of 12000 to 24000 jobs and $4 billion to $8 billion in economic output.

PART 2: Health workers propose a command center that can dispatch ambulances refer patients to the right hospitals or quarantine facilities and monitor those getting treatment at home – in coordination with local governments

After weeks of drastic increases in coronavirus cases health workers in Philippine hospitals look to the coming months with worry. There will be a “vicious cycle” of surge upon surge if changes are not done with the Duterte government’s pandemic response.

The current situation could have been avoided. In early March medical workers were already calling on the government to act quickly on the rapid increase in infections. They were the same health professionals who called for a two-week return to a strict lockdown from July to August 2020 the last time the Philippines saw a deadly spike in cases.

With the Philippines once again facing a surge in coronavirus cases the Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC) listed several measures both LGUs and businesses could take to ensure Filipinos' safety.



READ: https://t.co/ailDSoBRlk pic.twitter.com/OKdNxbnWfm — Rappler (@rapplerdotcom) March 16 2021

At the time the Health Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC) called for improving ventilation in workplaces coordinating contact tracing across local government units (LGUs) and accelerating pop-up bike lanes to offer safer transport options. They stressed that a time span of just days would be crucial so the country could avoid a deadly increase in cases. Only a few of those quick actions they asked for were taken.

Infections has since quickly outpaced government efforts. An initial “stricter” general community quarantine was enforced within a bubble encompassing Metro Manila and the provinces of Bulacan Rizal Laguna and Cavite while health officials mostly only reminded the public to take “extreme caution” and practice health protocols.

The efforts were not enough to stop a record increase in cases that later prompted the national government to place Metro Manila and adjacent provinces again under enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) the strictest level of lockdown for two weeks later shifting to a modified enhanced community quarantine on April 11.

“We reemphasize that this mobility restriction is but a short-term intervention and yet it seems to have been wasted again. The government still has no clear plans and efforts to fix the root causes and the nation continues to suffer because of this” HPAAC said.

Now health experts are once again pleading with the Duterte government to consider its demands to improve patients’ access to care. Hospitals remain packed they said. Hundreds if not thousands of sick patients were still suffering waiting in line for treatment.

Where to focus

Epidemiologist and internal medicine specialist Dr Antonio Dans said much of the focus of the Department of Health (DOH) and the government’s other pandemic officials was to “strengthen” the capacity of the health system to treat COVID-19 patients – mostly by adding more beds putting up makeshift hospitals and hiring or reassigning health workers to high-risk areas.

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Monday April 12 that the government had been able to improve the health system’s capacity after some 2200 ward beds 700 isolation beds and about 164 intensive care unit (ICU) beds were added to several hospitals during the two-week lockdown.

Vergeire said the DOH also contracted hotels to house health workers who had mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 and reopened mega quarantine facilities for patients with mild cases of the disease.

From the Visayas and Mindanao 136 doctors and nurses were redeployed to support the operations in 7 DOH hospitals 2 specialty hospitals and 1 regional hospital in Metro Manila.

These measures have not been enough to address the problem of patients who can’t get admitted to hospitals Dans said. Neither would they save hospitals and health workers should another surge overwhelm the country in the coming months.

“The problem is we’re focused on adding resources – in our meetings [with the DOH] that is the focus of improvements. But in our view that will take a while a long time to complete. What do we do with our patients who are suffering now and need help now?” Dans speaking in Filipino said in a recent forum.

Dans a key expert behind the Philippines’ Universal Health Care Law stressed that efforts should also be made towards improving the coordination between hospitals barangay health centers local governments units (LGUs) and the One Hospital Command of the DOH. These entities are currently disconnected from one another forcing patients to navigate overloaded health systems on their own calling busy government hotlines or hospital telephones both in Metro Manila and provinces hours away.

“We think the way to help people now is by improving the efficiency of the current health system we have and improving on the ways people are given care” he added.

What HPAAC has proposed the government to consider is an “incident management team for command and control” of the entire capital region the coronavirus epicenter in the Philippines.

Learning from past disasters

Public health and family medicine specialist Dr Aileen Espina likened it to disaster response measures the Philippines has long been familiar with having been battered by some of the world’s strongest typhoons.

Espina was the head of the Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center when Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) one of the world’s strongest typhoons ripped into Leyte province in 2013. To her the coronavirus pandemic is like being in a perpetual category 5 hurricane she said.

“I can’t help but see the same weakness in our systems now are the very same things I saw during the time of Yolanda. And I can’t help but speak up because for me it is enough that the Philippines had gone through a Typhoon Yolanda-like [tragedy]” Espina said in Filipino.

To address the current wave of patients unable to get care Espina said HPAAC was advocating for the establishment of an incident command center that could coordinate with LGUs and assist local officials in managing the overflow of patients in health centers.

Ideally this would be the “One COVID referral network” the group urged the government to set up last August 2020. The proposed referral network would be an expansion of the existing One Hospital Command Center (OHCC) to include local governments which held the resources for quarantine centers ambulances barangay health centers and hospitals in their areas Espina said.

“There is inefficiency in allocating patients to the appropriate facility because there is no unity of command and effort between LGU-led and DOH-guided responses” HPAAC said.

As it stands the One Hospital Command Center mostly handled transfers of patients between hospitals or sought available beds for the thousands who called their hotlines in hopes of finding a hospital that could admit them. But lawmakers as well as families who tried calling the center’s two cell phone lines and landlines said phones were often too busy to get through and that hospitals were still limited or unable to take patients.

No real-time assessment?

In a press briefing on April 7 DOH’s Vergeire admitted that the health care utilization rate being released by the DOH was not reflective of the current situation of the health systems in the country.

“When we talk about healthcare utilization rate we’re talking about different components of our healthcare utilization system – we have isolation beds ward beds ICU beds mechanical ventilators. Where do we get our data? This is the whole healthcare system starting from infirmaries until level 3 hospitals” she explained.

Vergeire clarified to reporters that what’s currently full are level 3 hospitals that cater to COVID-19 patients.

“Most of them [are] almost full or at that critical risk. But there are still beds available in low level facilities just like the level 1 hospitals. Our level 1 hospitals comprise 60% of all hospitals in the country. This means that if we report a 67% healthcare utilization rate for NCR we know that’s not the real picture because we know that our hospitals are full” she said in a mix of English and Filipino.

Pressed why the DOH does not include only those hospitals capable of treating coronavirus patients Vergeire did not give a direct answer. “That would be the ideal but right now even level 1 and level 2 hospitals are handling COVID-19 cases” she said.

Relatives of COVID-19 patients have turned to social media to seek help in finding available hospitals for admission with some of them narrating how their loved ones died without proper treatment as there was no space left in hospitals.

Vergeire said that they were aware of the current situation but still she was unable to explain clearly why the data on hospital care utilization rate does not reconcile with the current situation on the ground.

“When we saw these kinds of differences we’re now using the ICU utilization as our indicator because we know that this is the most sensitive indicator we can use for now to guide our decisions” she said.

Local health officials pay close attention to ICU capacity as it indicates if many are experiencing severe COVID-19. It also measures the health system’s capacity to manage critically ill patients and prevent deaths.

As of April 15 DOH data showed that 84.5% of ICU beds in Metro Manila were occupied.

Filling in gaps

Espina said this was precisely among the gaps seen in the DOH’s One Hospital Command Center – it had no real-time visual of hospital resources or the kinds of patients it was handling. It also lacked actual assets like ambulances or dedicated beds it could provide patients and no communication system in place with local governments.

A “One COVID referral network” that could serve as an “incident management team for command and control” of patient care in Metro Manila would need to have the following:

Real-time dashboard with data analytics to have an idea of the balance of beds across different Metro Manila cities and how to manage limited space in health facilities.

The data on this dashboard should include the following:

Real-time data on bed occupancy rates and the kinds of cases being handled in all hospitals operating in its area – in this case the National Capital Region.

Bed occupancy rates in temporary treatment monitoring facilities hotels and community isolation units spread out across different LGUs.

Number of patients admitted under home care and are supervised either by their Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams or Telehealth services.

HPAAC said the OHCC would also need its own resources should it expand into a referral network that could manage patients across the entire metro:

At least 2-3 beds dedicated to the OHCC per hospital (this can include 1 emergency room bed 1 COVID-19 ward bed and 1 intensive care unit bed).

A dedicated ambulance service.

More hotlines and call forwarding capabilities. People managing hotlines should also be familiar with the proper management of patients to help determine which facility they could be referred to.

A proposed COVID referral network would also need a communication line to connect with LGUs. HPAAC said the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority could step in here to coordinate between local government units DOH hospitals and other government-owned and controlled hospitals.

But how doable are the group’s proposals?

At least on the part of local government Espina pointed out LGUs were already familiar with the network of health centers in their communities. They already have resources like ambulances.

Charged with implementing government policies and helping their residents cope during the health crisis LGUs would not be starting from scratch as they were trained in disaster risk management and have had to find ways to support constituents over the past year Espina said.

A “One COVID referral network” could bridge and coordinate the efforts of local governments in Metro Manila to manage patients beyond efforts to align curfews or other quarantine policies.

“Let’s not waste what we learned from the time of Yolanda. We need to use those lessons during this time of pandemic” said Espina who is also a local health systems development consultant.

In obtaining access to data needed to put up a COVID referral network HPAAC urged Congress to pass a law that would make the sharing of data on the health system’s capacity mandatory.

The proposed measure would require data from local governments and the private sector to be placed in a central data warehouse with provisions detailing who would be responsible for protecting data and when it would be disposed of.

“We have been pushing for this for the past year…. We cannot fight this virus that is moving at an exponential rate using antiquated manual methods” Espina said in an interview on ANC.

Going forward

With hospitals still under strain from the increase in COVID-19 patients Vergeire said the DOH is looking to set up a “triage system” across local government units to manage the flow of patients needing health care.

Vergeire said the LGU triage system will serve as a “midway point” where local health officials will assess whether patients in need of care can be brought to local quarantine facilities or if they are already in need of hospital care.

These centers will also have ambulance services ready to transport patients from the LGU triage areas to either quarantine facilities or hospitals depending on the assessment.

After introducing the proposed new set up on April 5 Vergeire said the government targeted to have the system up and running within the “next few days.” As of April 17 it has yet to be operational. – Rappler.com",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiIWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhd24uY29tL25ld3MvMTYxODU1NdIBJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhd24uY29tL25ld3MvYW1wLzE2MTg1NTU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Medical access is a human right not a luxury.

'Together for a fairer healthier world'

This was the theme for this year’s World Health Day.

Conventions were held all around the world urging leaders to ensure that everyone experiences living and working conditions that are conducive to good health and that all people can access quality health services when and where they need them.

These demands however were not new.

The World Health Organization (WHO) constitution had already charted the right to health as one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction in 1946. The right was also affirmed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 citing the right to healthcare as a supreme human right.

But in a world that is raging with inequalities of all shapes and forms the right to health and access to adequate medical services seems to have been reserved only for the privileged while the rest are conveniently stripped from this wealth. The situation in Pakistan is not any different.

A year with the pandemic has further exposed and exacerbated the deep-rooted socio- economic inequalities in the country as whilst the virus has hit all regions hard the impact has been harshest on those communities which were already vulnerable and were less likely to have access to quality healthcare.

While the reasons behind this are manifold the most common social determinants of health inequities are poverty lack of education unavailability of adequate healthcare services and the cultural and social stigma attached to certain health complications.

The result?

Despite being a country of more than 200 million people a deplorable minority of the Pakistani population have access to primary healthcare services.

What is HumWell and how is it tackling the problem?

Noting the disproportionate access to medical services and the prevalent healthcare disparities in the country a group of health professionals and technology experts came together and joined hands in a collaborative effort to bring primary health care to the general public at affordable costs.

HumWell a product of their efforts is an all-inclusive online patient care platform that enables individuals from all across Pakistan to reach out to qualified medical practitioners for their healthcare needs right from the comfort of their homes.

Well it was fun while it lasted.

For four years with Donald Trump in office Canada basked in the comparison – peace order and not-so-chaotic government here relatively speaking.

But now with Trump not even 100 days out of office American superiority to Canada is rearing its head again and Canada alas has lost its smugness edge.

In the past couple of weeks two U.S. cable news hosts have taken pokes at how Canada is dealing with this stage of the pandemic.

First it was Tucker Carlson on Fox News. Granted Fox has never been overly friendly to Canada or the current Liberal government but in this particular segment this country was called “dangerously insane.”

That hit was easy to shrug off. It was Fox after all.

But then came Jake Tapper on CNN - yes the network to which so many Canadians were tuned during the Trump years - taking Canada and Trudeau to task on Monday night for what CNN headlined the “vaccine shortage” in this country.

Tapper who was still tweeting about Canada’s vaccine problems on Wednesday has roots here.

“My mom was born in Canada my grandfather fought in WWII for the @RoyalCanNavy my great uncle was killed flying for @RCAF_ARC I still have cousins there and you’re right on our border. Am I not allowed to care that seniors there aren’t getting vaccinated?”

Tapper’s concerns unlike Carlson’s made it to the floor of the Commons this week along with similarly damning articles in the Atlantic and Forbes magazines. Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole has been asking Trudeau how he likes being the target of international ridicule.

Come back Trump – our international self-esteem needs you.

In all seriousness this reversal of roles has kind of crept up on Canada and this country in the past couple of months roughly since Joe Biden came to office. For most of the pandemic Trudeau and all governments in this country could point to pandemic successes here that made the U.S. look like a test case in how not to manage COVID-19.

Where Trump fought with state governments Canada’s first ministers worked together. While Canada locked down and rolled out speedy benefits for its citizens the United States devolved into exploding outbreaks revolts against pandemic restrictions and outright denial of the crisis by the White House.

It’s not Biden’s inauguration that changed all that – it was the arrival of vaccines.

There is no disputing the fact that Americans have been getting vaccinated in larger numbers than Canadians have been. As of Wednesday according to Bloomberg’s vaccine-tracker about 36 per cent of Americans had been given at least one dose compared to just 18 per cent of Canadians. The gap widens for the fully vaccinated - nearly 23 per cent of Americans and just 2.2 per cent in Canada.

Here’s why the vaccine gap is particularly damaging to Canada’s national pride: It’s about health care.

For years even when U.S. superiority was acknowledged in terms of cultural or economic might Canadians always pointed to universal health care as the distinguishing trait of national superiority. Americans may control the airwaves but at least no Canadians went broke when they fell ill.

The fact that Americans are coming out of a health crisis more quickly than Canadians thanks to vaccine-delivery superiority may rattle those historic boasting rights.

Challenged this week in the Commons about how Americans are taking note of Canada’s vaccine problems Trudeau has been accusing his critics to base their arguments on facts. This in turn has prompted the opposition to say it’s Trudeau complaining now about “fake news” – Trump’s favourite name for CNN.

It’s another sign of how the tables have turned in a few short months. Trump did very few favours for Canada while in office but making us look good by comparison was one of them – not a position we now enjoy in the North American vaccination race.

Mr Hansen had earlier delivered a speech unveiling a Services Delivery Indicators Report which addresses core issues the country needs for investing in a workforce it needs for attaining its middle-income dream. Findings of the report suggest that for Tanzania to improve quality in health and education sectors it requires better leadership and management of facilities and enhancement of accountability among all actors. Since the Second Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP II) 2016/17 – 2020/21 insists on transforming the country into a middle-income economy the latest service delivery report means a lot to laying down a foundation for the implementation of the strategy. Mr Hansen offers recommendations on how Tanzania can streamline its healthcare financing situation to ensure quality health services are in place. Excerpts...









Question:Tanzania’s vision to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is manifested in the government’s plan to adopt a ‘Health Insurance for All Citizens’ strategy for ensuring access to healthcare. As you may know only 20 per cent of all Tanzanians have health insurance cover what does the World Bank think is the best approach for the country to achieve this plan?





Answer: Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and health insurance are commendable; and just last year 59 per cent of adults in Tanzania were able to save money.

But health costs can be very catastrophic to them as health shocks can wipe out all their savings.

Every year over 110 people worldwide are forced to become poor mainly as a result of healthcare expenditures and in Tanzania where Out of Pocket (OP) costs are very high this risk is real. So it’s laudable to see Tanzania aspire after health insurance cover for all citizens.

And recently the World Bank commissioned a study of about 2000 countries that are implementing the UHC and findings show a couple of things: First every country can make its own path towards achieving the UHC but there are important lessons some countries can learn from others. Second making things work calls for important building blocks such as countries’ ability to get best performance and capacity in terms of services health facilities provide.

The UHC is quite ambitious and very expensive so you have to ensure people see the value for their money. In this case the government has to be careful to avoid overspending in some areas and under-spending in others.

There is a level of complexity which has to be carefully handled. Therefore this needs good planning especially the forecast of people you expect to be put on health cover you need a good mechanism of processing the payments there has to be a verification of the quality of health services. And the government has to be very careful about the right set of services to provide the people and avoid subjecting them to “shock’ in terms of health spending.





Various reports have praised Tanzania’s performance in immunisation coverage of over 90 per cent which shows to have an impact on the reduction of child mortality from 143 deaths per 100000 live births to 81000 over the past half a decade. However the government still relies heavily on foreign aid to finance its vaccines. How can the country graduate from begging to develop its own capacity to mobilise its resources. And do you think it matters where the money is coming from?

The important point is not what individual items the foreign partners provide in terms of financial assistance but it’s the overall picture that matters.

The thing is: How and where does the financial assistance fit into the Tanzanian Health budget and the country has in fact made considerable headway.

In the last 10 years the overall donor assistance as presented in Parliament has been 40 per cent. This means the country is in the right direction.

It’s true that in health there is still a larger share of funding coming from donor assistance but one of the major reasons why this is so is that foreign partners are more willing to finance health programmes.

Obviously it’s very easy to explain to donors and other fianciers that vaccines are more important in the prevention of diseases. So it’s easier for them to finance this.

It’s not so important where the money is coming from because the progarmmes are still headed and supported by Tanzania and in this case I can see that immunisation programmes and poverty alleviation projects such as Tasaf (Tanzania Social Action Fund) are at the core of the government’s delivery services and in that sense this is very important.

Over time Tanzania can become less reliant and run these progarmmes such that they do not exist because of donor interests.

Some of the pathways the country can become self-reliant is obviously through revenue mobiolisation and right now the share of the taxes in the GDP is about 12 per cent.

There is room for progress there. In general things are headed to the right direction and the programmes are fully owned by the government so the most important thing is for Tanzania to continue delivering.





Human resource gaps in the health sector are still a major obstacle to efforts of controlling maternal mortality as presented in various reports. Owing to its small wage bill the government cannot absorb enough health personnel. Just recently the government ironically said it can only employ 400 out of 1000 newly licensed medical doctors while there is an outcry over the shortage of medical doctors in public hospitals. How can Tanzania get out of this trap in case the World Bank also sees it that way?





The best way would be to see how to work with the current cohort. One way is to ensure equal distribution of health personnel around the country.

Eighty percent of the poor people live in rural areas while only 25 per cent of the health workforce is found in the rural areas. There is a miss-match there.

I wouldn’t necessarily expect a 1:1 ratio because typically the larger facilities are found in urban centres but that’s quite a big discrepancy.

Secondly the focus should be on improving the available staff through continuing with medical education because the Services Delivery Indicators show that health workers can only diagnose the commonest illnesses accurately by 60 percent."

When her father died Linda Hayes said his last request to her was to take care of the vegetable garden he grew for his community at his home in Boxtown Tennessee.

""Two weeks before he passed away he told me he said 'I'm ready to go be with Jesus I’m ready to go home. I want you and your sisters to take care of the garden.'"" Hayes told ABC News. ""I said 'OK Daddy all right' and I know that was my charge.""

Hayes still lives in the house her father built in Boxtown a predominately Black neighborhood in Memphis with railway tracks running through the center. Historically the community was one of the few places where Black Americans could buy their own land -- a reason Hayes said that the garden was so sacred to her family.

""When slaves were freed they migrated to Boxtown and the reason why they call it Boxton is because many of the homes were made out of boxes from the trains"" Hayes said.

But a proposed 49-mile crude oil pipeline connecting a refinery in Memphis to an existing pipeline in Marshall County Mississippi now threatens to cut through Boxtown spurring allegations of environmental racism from community members including Hayes.

The underground pipeline dubbed the Byhalia Connection is a joint venture by Plains All American and Valero Energy Corporation. The current planned route would traverse the Memphis aquifer the city’s water source which critics say poses a risk to drinking water in the event of a leak.

The pipeline could also impact the property values in the neighborhood residents say and is the latest in a spate of industrial projects including an oil refinery a coal ash pond and many more that have been put in their backyard over the past several decades.

""This community is standing up and saying no more we've had enough"" Kathy Robinson a fourth-generation resident of the area told ABC News. ""For the past 50 years this specific community in Memphis has received whatever the rest of Memphis and Shelby County would dare not accept in other places.""

""We know that this is environmental racism"" Robinson added. ""They purposely picked communities where they think that there will be no one that's willing to fight them.""

This time she said ""We’re saying 'no.'""

The 'path of least resistance'

Congressman Steve Cohen D-Tenn. told ABC News that a representative of the pipeline company previously told the community they chose the route ""because it was the ‘path of least resistance.’”

""That makes you wonder whether they're just figuring that the African-American community has less influence less strength"" Cohen said.

Congressman Steve Cohen D-Tenn. discusses the Byhalia Connection pipeline in an interview with ABC News in April 2021. ABC News

In a February letter Cohen urged the Biden administration to direct the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to rescind its permits for the pipeline. Cohen cited the historic nature of communities including Boxtown as well its potential to contaminate the Memphis aquifer.

Cohen said he has not heard back from the administration.

The Biden administration did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. The USACE declined ABC News' request for comment citing ongoing litigation as three local environmental groups have filed a lawsuit over the issuing of the permits.

""What should have been said is that we looked for the path with the fewest collective impacts"" said Katie Martin a spokeswoman for the Byhalia Connection in response to a request for clarification on the ""path of least resistance"" comment.

""We treat our landowners and our neighbors with respect and dignity and we look forward to working with the community members for years to come"" Martin added.

Martin said the pipeline route was chosen ""very carefully and deliberately"" -- avoiding properties with homes on them and emphasizing that ""this pipeline is not about race it's about safety.""

She added that pipelines and aquifers ""coexist safely across the country"" noting that they currently have a pipeline ""operating safely on top of the Memphis Sands aquifer and we expect that our pipeline will be no different.""

Pipeline operators have said the construction will support some 500 direct and indirect jobs in the area as well as provide more than $3 million in local tax revenue along the route each year. Moreover they say they have provided a slew of charitable grants to non-profit organizations that serve communities along the route according to a website set up to provide the public with information on the project.

The website states they are targeting to start construction this year and aims to be in service approximately nine months after construction starts.

'It's more prone to contamination'

The groundwater pulled from the Memphis aquifer is thousands of years old according to Brian Waldron a professor of civil engineering and the director of the Center for Applied Earth Science and Engineering at the University of Memphis.

Waldron said the current proposed path through south Memphis traverses a shallow groundwater system.

""It's not protected by clay"" he said. ""It's more prone to contamination.""

Even along the parts of the route where there is that protective clay layer Waldron said a leak could still potentially impact the drinking water.

""This protective clay layer has naturally occurring holes in it called breeches and that allows for water of poor quality to more readily exchange itself with our drinking water supply"" he said.

Another risk is ""the fact that we are in an earthquake zone a seismic zone"" Waldron added ""the threat of that to underground infrastructure is of concern.""

There are a lot of pipelines already in the area he noted but making sure that there will be no leaks and no impact to the water system is still of paramount concern for Memphis residents.

""I have suggested to Byhalia and others that if you really want to know what's going on in the subsurface whatever path you take you should do a study to make sure that there's no immediate threats in proximity to the pipeline"" he said.

Martin told ABC News that they have spent ""over ten thousand hours"" in the field ""studying and understanding the local geology in the area.""

She expressed confidence the pipeline will not pose a threat to the drinking water saying they have consulted with experts and complied with all requirements necessary for environmental permits.

""And because of that we secured our environmental permits at the state and federal level"" Martin said.

The collective was formed last October following community meetings with representatives of the pipeline company. MCAP is one of the three groups suing the Army Corp of Engineers over the permits for the pipeline.

Pearson said he believes environmental racism is the result of ""decisions that are being made by policy makers to really determine whose lives are expendable in our country.""

""The folks whose lives have been the most expendable have been people of color indigenous communities and the descendants of enslaved people in our country"" Pearson said. ""That's the case right here in Memphis in Boxtown.""

“There are ramifications for that racism"" he added. ""The ramifications for that are in the stories of people like me -- both my grandmothers passed away in their 60s due to cancer.""

A 2013 study from the University of Memphis found that carcinogens in the southwest Memphis air raised the cumulative cancer risk in the area to four times higher than the national average.

""For Black folks it's a slow form of lynching"" Pearson said of environmental racism. ""Our present fight is very much connected to previous fights and struggles that those who come before us fought in order for us to be here.""

""They called our community the path of least resistance"" Pearson said. ""And we're showing them that we're really the path of resilience.""

Hayes said the pollutants in the area posed a challenge for her late father's vegetable garden which is why he would wake up early in the morning to work on it before going to his job as a truck driver.

In 2010 Hayes' father was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died a few years later in 2014.

""There is there is no amount of money that can replace what my dad said to me two weeks before he passed away"" Hayes told ABC News.

""There are a lot of promises but we don't want to take any chances of our community being destroyed especially our water"" she added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL21sazUwLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzE4LzMwLXBpZWNlcy1vZi1zaWx2ZXItdGFraW5nLW1vbmV5LWZyb20tYnloYWxpYS1waXBlbGluZS1hLWJldHJheWFsLXRvLWJsYWNrLWNvbW11bml0eS1zYXlzLXJldi1iYXJiZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'30 pieces of silver': Taking money from Byhalia Pipeline a betrayal to Black community says Rev. Barber,"Rev. Dr. William J. Barber co-chair of the National Poor People’s Campaign speaks during a Memphis Community Against the Pipeline rally at Alonzo Weaver Park in Memphis on Sunday.

The Rev. Dr. William Barber II chastised churches charitable organizations and politicians for accepting donations from Byhalia Pipeline at a rally Sunday at Alonzo Weaver Park in Southwest Memphis. He told them to return the money.

“I don’t care what you are and I don’t care how Black you claim to be. If you took money and you claim to represent Black folk … you need to give it back publicly” Barber told the crowd of about 100 at the rally organized by Memphis Community Against the Pipeline. “You need to come out against them publicly” he said including the NAACP as an example.

“If you took money you’re taking 30 pieces of silver to betray your people.”

Byhalia Pipeline has donated more than $1 million to local organizations including $25000 to the NAACP Memphis Branch. The Memphis Memorial Committee which is raising funds to erect a statue of Black journalist Ida B. Wells on Beale Street accepted a donation but later returned it.

“Give it back because they want to hurt the community and don’t give it back sneakily” Barber said. “Don’t put it in the minutes put it in the paper. Make it a headline. Stand up with the people. We got to stop selling out our community especially selling them out for chump change.”

Van Turner president of the NAACP Memphis Branch and a member of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners did not immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment.

Barber is co-chair of the Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for a Moral Revival a faith-based movement against poverty and systemic racism. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. organized the original Poor People’s Campaign in 1968 the same year he came to Memphis to support a strike by city sanitation workers and was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel.

Gaining national attention

Barber is the second prominent national figure to speak at a rally held by MCAP to oppose the Byhalia Connection Pipeline crude oil project. Former Vice President Al Gore an environmental activist and Nobel Prize winner spoke last month at the same park and called the project “reckless” and “racist.

Byhalia Pipeline — a joint venture of Texas-based Plains All American Pipeline and Valero Energy Corporation — announced its plans for the Byhalia Connection Pipeline in 2019. The proposed route would connect the Valero Memphis Refinery and a Valero facility in Marshall County Mississippi. The route runs through several Black neighborhoods including Westwood Whitehaven and Boxtown.

Pipeline opponents have argued the pipeline would endanger the city’s water supply as it passes through a wellfield and over the Memphis Sand aquifer.

‘Every one of you ought to be bothered’

“Woe unto those who legislate evil and rob the poor of their rights.” Rev. Dr. William Barber II

Barber closed his remarks with the story of Karmen Johnson-Tutwiler a Memphis landowner who is suing the company alleging they took advantage of her medical distress to get her signature on paperwork that sold them an easement on her land. Her exclusive story was featured Thursday by MLK50: Justice Through Journalism.

“Every one of you ought to be bothered ought to be upset ought to be angered that a company would try to trick a woman … who’s in the midst of a medical emergency just so they could steal and rob you of your rights” Barber told the crowd. “Woe unto those who legislate evil and rob the poor of their rights.”

Byhalia Pipeline has filed eminent domain cases to seize land rights from at least 10 Memphis landowners including Johnson-Tutwiler. A judge will hear arguments at 11 a.m. Friday from attorneys representing two landowners and from company lawyers on whether Byhalia Pipeline is allowed to claim eminent domain under Tennessee law.

The Memphis City Council will hold a third and final reading of a proposed ordinance against the pipeline Tuesday. MCAP will lead a march at noon Monday from the National Civil Rights Museum to Memphis City Hall to urge the council to pass the ordinance.

The ordinance stipulates that any pipeline project would have to seek the body’s permission before crossing city property including roads.

El gobierno cubano estableció nuevos precios de acopio para el arroz y la carne y leche de ganado vacuno y bufalino como parte de la estrategia para estimular la producción de esos alimentos básicos en el país.

Según el Acuerdo 9059 del Consejo de Ministros publicado en la Gaceta Oficial No. 31 (Extraordinaria) con fecha del 16 de abril de 2021 quedaron fijados los precios máximos en pesos cubanos (CUP) por categoría para el “ganado bovino en pie (vacuno y bufalino) en el campo con destino a la industria o mataderos autorizados”.

La publicación de los nuevos precios se produce luego de que las autoridades gubernamentales aprobaran el pasado martes la comercialización de carne de ganado menor y mayor a los productores agropecuarios como parte de un paquete emergente de 63 medidas para aumentar la crítica producción de alimentos en el país.

Los precios oscilan desde 3.45 CUP/kg para la categoría de “terneros y terneras de 0 a 12 meses” hasta 40.03 CUP/kg para “torete bovino de 18 a 24 meses Categoría Especial con más de 400”.

Asimismo los precios de ventas para “la leche fresca de vaca y de búfala en el campo o almacén del productor” se modifican a partir de este viernes: van desde 5.50 CUP/litro hasta 7.50 CUP/litro (vaca) y 8.30 CUP/litro (búfala).

El arroz cáscara húmedo en el campo o almacén del productor se acopiará a razón de 6 922.00 CUP/t mientras ese mismo producto “sin aseguramiento de insumos de importación” se valora a partir de ahora a 7 414.26 CUP/t.

En este último caso se aplicará el nuevo precio especifica el acuerdo a “las operaciones realizadas a partir del 1ro. de enero de 2021”.

La cuarta determinación acordada este viernes es “un estímulo a la producción de leche fresca de vaca con cargo al Presupuesto del Estado consistente en un pago adicional de un peso cubano con cin­cuenta centavos (1.50 CUP) por litro por el cumplimiento o sobrecumplimiento del plan mensual de entrega por el productor de acuerdo con lo contratado con la industria y las empresas municipales de comercio”.

Dicho estímulo también se aplica a las entregas de leche desde inicios de este año “previa verificación del cumplimiento o sobrecumplimiento del plan de entrega mensual” y “siempre que no se disminuyan las cantidades de litros de leche contratadas en el plan inicial de entrega mensual”.

El acuerdo rubricado por el primer ministro de Cuba Manuel Marrero Cruz deja sin efecto el documento homólogo con fecha 25 de noviembre de 2020 que normaba anteriormente los precios máximos de acopio de los productos referidos.

En uno de los “por cuanto” planteados por el Consejo de Ministros de Cuba se explicita que “resulta[ba] necesario modificar” dichos precios aun cuando median pocos meses desde la última resolución al respecto.

Más adelante en anexo se aclara que el precio de acopio del ganado bovino accidentado será un 20% menos que el aprobado para cada categoría.

Por otra parte el precio de compra de “ganado bovino (vacuno y bufalino) en el an­dén de la industria o los mataderos autorizados” sumará un 5% de margen comercial para “cubrir gastos y utilidades” por este tipo de operación.

En cuanto a los importes de animales destinados al sacrificio se les aplicarán “descuentos por contenido ruminal del tres por ciento (3%) del peso bruto a los que clasifiquen de primera y del cinco por ciento (5%) para el resto”.

El listado de precios es el primer paso para echar a andar la comercialización de carne y leche de los ganaderos y campesinos privados directamente a centros de venta y población en general.

La venta de carne de res por parte de los ganaderos prohibida durante décadas podrá realizarse después de cumplir con el encargo estatal y siempre que se garantice que no haya decrecimiento de la masa ganadera según las disposiciones del gobierno cubano anunciadas esta semana.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vaGlwZXJ0ZXh0dWFsLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0L3BzNS1kZXN0cm96YS1yZWNvcmRzLWRlLXZlbnRhcy1hLXBlc2FyLWRlLWxhLWVzY2FzZXrSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,La PS5 sigue destrozando récords de ventas a pesar de la escasez,"La PS5 que está próxima a cumplir medio año en el mercado sigue triunfando en gran parte del mundo. Lo anterior tiene mayor relevancia porque es bien sabido que la industria tecnológica está enfrentando una escasez grave de componentes lo cual está dificultando la producción de cientos de productos. Sin embargo la consola de nueva generación de Sony ha salido bien librada de los múltiples obstáculos que se han atravesado en su camino.

De acuerdo a los datos de NPD la reconocida firma de análisis del mercado de los videojuegos en Norteamérica la PS5 ya es la consola más rápidamente vendida en la historia de Estados Unidos. Aunque la estadística solo se enfoca en el territorio estadounidense no debemos olvidar que se trata del mercado más importante de la industria a nivel mundial.

Mat Piscatella analista de NPD mencionó que la PlayStation 5 lidera dos récords: el de las consolas vendidas y el de los ingresos generados durante los primeros cinco meses. Sumando el hardware juegos y accesorios vendidos la PS5 ha generado 5.600 millones de dólares desde su lanzamiento aproximadamente. Ninguna otra plataforma había alcanzado esa cifra durante el periodo mencionado ni siquiera la PS4 o la Nintendo Switch.

Spider-Man: Miles Morales impulsó a la PS5

A pesar de presumir unos extraordinarios números la PS5 no pudo desbancar a la Nintendo Switch como la consola más vendida de marzo. Ojo el dispositivo de Nintendo lleva 28 meses consecutivos siendo el hardware de videojuegos más vendido de Estados Unidos. Para fortuna de los de Kioto se han combinado un par de factores clave. En primer lugar que su plataforma sigue creciendo en popularidad a nivel global. Por otra parte la ya comentada escasez de consolas next-gen y el escaso catálogo de títulos.

Otro dato que resalta en el reporte son las ventas de Spider-Man: Miles Morales uno de los juegos de lanzamiento de la PS5. NPD indica que al título de Insomniac Games le tomó cinco meses superar las ventas totales de The Last of Us: Part II y Ghost of Tsushima los cuales vieron la luz durante la primera mitad de 2020. Todo lo anterior desde luego enfocado al mercado de Estados Unidos. Esto nos deja claro que Spider-Man es un pilar fundamental en los objetivos económicos de PlayStation.

Congreso del Partido Comunista de Cuba (PCC) que se desarrolla en La Habana hasta el próximo 19 de abril.

Según el resumen de la intervención publicado por el periódico Tribuna de La Habana el primer secretario del PCC explicó que “se logró hacer comprender que las ventas en Moneda Libremente Convertible son necesarias y que perdurarán el tiempo que nos tome recuperar y fortalecer la economía y con ello asegurar la real convertibilidad de la moneda nacional”.

El histórico dirigente cubano agradeció en sus palabras a los acreedores internacionales por permitir renegociar las deudas vencidas y a continuación les aseguró la voluntad del gobierno para honrar esos compromisos financieros una vez comience la recuperación de la economía nacional.

Dijo Raúl que fue precisamente “la situación extrema de falta de liquidez” la que “obligó a reintroducir la Moneda Libremente Convertible en una parte del comercio minorista y más adelante del mayorista”. Una modalidad comercial que tuvo el objetivo inicial de asegurar los suministros en el mercado interno de un grupo de mercancías que en los últimos cinco años se dejaron de ofertar por parte del estado “dejando espacio para la actividad ilegal de la compra en el exterior y la reventa de estos artículos con altísimas tasas de ganancia”.

“Ya bajo los efectos de la covid-19 se ampliaron las ventas en moneda libremente convertible hacia otros productos incluyendo los alimentos con el objetivo de incentivar las remesas que los ciudadanos cubanos residentes en el exterior realizan a sus familiares en el territorio nacional” dijo el General de Ejército.

Agregó acto seguido que el gobierno cubano ha erogado una importante suma de divisas para para “garantizar la sostenibilidad de la oferta en pesos cubanos de un reducido grupo de productos básicos de la alimentación la higiene y el aseo personal y se trabaja para restablecer la presencia de los proveedores nacionales en este mercado”.

El primer secretario del PCC reconoció el carácter polémico de las ventas en las tiendas cubanas en Moneda Libremente Convertible (MLC) argumentando que se debió a errores a la hora de explicar la medida al pueblo:

“A causa de una inadecuada política comunicacional y la publicación de enfoques incorrectos en varios de nuestros medios de prensa se generó cierta confusión en algunos cuadros de dirección que arremetieron contra la supuesta desigualdad que emana de estas ventas y reclamaron que todo el comercio interior del país regresara a la libreta de abastecimiento” dijo Raúl citado por Tribuna de La Habana.

Luego indicó que con el transcurrir del tiempo y gracias a “las intervenciones públicas del Presidente de la República el Primer Ministro y otros funcionarios del Gobierno se logró hacer comprender que las ventas en moneda libremente convertible son necesarias y que perdurarán el tiempo que nos tome recuperar y fortalecer la economía y con ello asegurar la real convertibilidad de la moneda nacional”.

And that means my wife and I are going to have to revisit our wireless plan to accommodate a third line of data.

When you've got a kid approaching the age of smartphone ownership you've got a lot of internal debates facing your family. Is my child old enough for a phone? Should I invest in the best parental control apps ? What kind of device is even the right one for a first-time smartphone owner?

Best family cell phone plans: What are your options?

Get one of the best cheap phones for your kids

Against those contentious questions the issue of whether your current wireless data plan is the right one for a family with a growing number of smartphone users seems like it's less rife with the potential for family drama. But it's nevertheless an important question to answer as what you decide will definitely impact your monthly budget.

You could simply call up your current wireless provider and tack on another line to your current plan. (Indeed if you've already got more than two users on one plan that's probably the best course of action.) But the simplest move isn't always the most cost effective one and any change to your smartphone usage is an excellent opportunity to figure out whether you and your family have the best cell phone plan for your needs.

Based on our phone plan deliberations in the Michaels household we're making the switch from Verizon to Visible. Here's why.

Assessing our current family plan

My wife and I currently get by on 3GB of shared data from Verizon a plan we've held onto for the last... seven years? Eight years? It's been so long since I've gone shopping for cell phone plans I don't rightly remember. It was certainly back before phone carriers started doing everything they could to get you to switch over to an unlimited data plan.

The trouble with Verizon is that it's one of the pricier carriers out when it comes to unlimited data.

Now 3GB of data may not seem like enough for two people to use comfortably but it's worked out well for us. My wife and I both work at home so there's no data-sucking commutes and neither one of us does a lot of streaming. A few years back we even downgraded from a 4GB plan when we realized we weren't consuming anywhere near that amount of data each month. I can count the number of times we've been hit with an overage in the last eight years on one hand.

That's going to change once our daughter joins the land of smartphone-toting citizens. For starters Verizon would likely insist that we upgrade from our Obama administration era tiered data plan to a more expansive — and more expensive — unlimited offering. And even when we impose some limits on our daughter's phone usage there's still going to be a notable uptick in data over what we're currently using. That forces us to look at all the best unlimited data plan options out there.

AT&T vs Verizon vs T-Mobile

Before we even start searching for a new monthly data plan AT&T is out of the running. Someone somewhere in my Northern California municipality has built an anti-AT&T defensive shield that begins approximately on my front porch and stretches to my backyard. Save for AT&T erecting a cell phone tower in my kitchen — sorry space is tight enough already — we're not about to sign up for a service we can't ever use.

We could stick with Verizon which offers a number of different types of unlimited plans at various prices. Even better you can mix and match those plans so that my wife — who's more inclined to stream things than I am — gets the Verizon Play More plan while I opt for the cheaper Start Unlimited plan. Play More bundles in Disney's three streaming services so that's another expense we can wipe off the budget.

Additionally Verizon offers a Just Kids option when you've already got at least one line of unlimited data. Just Kids caps talk and text to 20 contacts and includes some parental controls. It also costs less than a full unlimited data plan though not that much less.

The trouble with Verizon is that it's one of the pricier carriers out when it comes to unlimited data. Mixing and matching the plans outlined above would still put a $170 dent in my monthly budget about $80 more than what we're paying now for our tiered plan.

If you get good service from Verizon you can expect similar performance from Visible.

T-Mobile is appealing because its costs are generally lower than Verizon's. Indeed three lines of the T-Mobile Magenta unlimited data plan would cost us $120 a month though it's important to realize that reflects a current promotion where T-Mobile is waiving the cost of the third line. Otherwise three lines cost $140 a month with perks like a free Netflix account. (You may recall we recently cancelled Netflix a move not well-received by the youngest member of our family.)

T-Mobile does not let you mix-and-match the Magenta plan with the cheaper Essentials plan though. There's also no kids plan with a lower cost and any parent-friendly caps like there is at Verizon.

But there are options beyond the major carriers. And the best one for my family means we won't have to stray from the Verizon network that's served us so reliably.

Why Visible works for my family

Visible is a Verizon-owned mobile operator that uses Verizon's network to provide cell phone service. There's no cap on LTE data speeds though I have noticed that Verizon prioritizes its own traffic which means data on Visible can move just a tad slower. (Visible does cap 5G speeds at 200 Mbps and you can only get 5G service on select phones at the carrier.) Basically though if you get good service from Verizon you can expect similar performance from Visible.

And that performance comes much cheaper at Visible. The carrier has a single unlimited data plan which costs $40 a month taxes and fees included. That's half the price of Verizon's best unlimited plan. Even better Visible discounts your per line fee as you add more lines so as a family of three I'd be paying $30 a month — or the same discounted $120 price T-Mobile currently offers.

The perks at Visible aren't plentiful — I'm once again on my own for any streaming services I'd want to pay for. But in the end the lower monthly bill is worth far more to my bottom line.

Bottom line

We're a ways off from my daughter getting her cell phone and data plan prices have a way of shifting. So what looks like a good deal now may be topped by something better once my wife and I are ready to sign off on a phone for our kid.

The point of this exercise though is to show that parents have a lot of different options for family plans beyond just shrugging and adding an extra line to the plan they already have. And if you're willing to go beyond the likes of AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon for service you just might find some real bargains that will keep the cost of your monthly smartphone bill at a reasonable level.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHljYXIuY29tL05ld3MvMjAyMS8wNC8wNC0xOC1CYXJiZXItUmFjZVJlcG9ydNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Palou Holds Off Heavyweights for First Win in Barber Thriller,"By the Numbers: Race Results

When Alex Palou sits back and soaks in the Honda Indy Grand Prix of Alabama presented by AmFirst he can take special satisfaction in knowing he took his first career NTT INDYCAR SERIES victory the old-school way.

He earned it.

Palou held off legends Will Power and Scott Dixon – who have seven series titles and two Indianapolis 500 victories between them – to win Sunday afternoon at Barber Motorsports Park in his debut with reigning series champion Chip Ganassi Racing. Palou held off a charging Power by .4016 of a second – the closest margin of victory in the history of this race – to take the checkered flag in his No. 10 SEGI.TV Chip Ganassi Racing Honda.

“We did it!” Palou said. “It’s amazing. All of the team did an amazing job. We had the best cars. We’re starting strong and we’ll keep it strong.”

Six-time and reigning series champion Dixon helped Chip Ganassi Racing take two of the three podium positions by finishing third in his No. 9 PNC Bank Grow Up Great Honda 2.9881 seconds behind his winning teammate.

NTT P1 Award winner and pole sitter Pato O’Ward finished fourth in the No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet 3.9741 seconds behind Palou as a fascinating duel between series legends and young stars unfolded over the closing laps on the 17-turn 2.3-mile circuit.

Sebastien Bourdais rounded out the top five after starting 16th in the No. 14 ROKiT AJ Foyt Racing Chevrolet.

The race held under sunny skies and before a capacity-allowed crowd of 20000 developed into a clash of strategies for the first 70 laps. Palou Power Dixon and Marcus Ericsson were among the leading lights who opted for a two-stop strategy while O’Ward Bourdais and Graham Rahal were among the contenders who chose a three-stop strategy.

Two stops became the golden ticket as Palou Power and Dixon ended up on the podium. But once each of the contenders had made their final stops regardless of strategy the race became a contest of brilliant driving and deft usage of Push-to-Pass not a game of clever fuel mileage calculations on the pit box.

It was the best of both worlds of INDYCAR.

Power scorched the track with fast in and out laps around his last pit stop in the No. 12 Verizon 5G Chevrolet. Palou led Power by 5.1284 seconds when the Spaniard made his final stop on Lap 60. Power made his final stop on Lap 62 and had trimmed the margin to Palou to 2.3901 seconds on Lap 68 one circuit after Palou took the lead for good when O’Ward made his final stop.

Over the closing laps Power began to nibble at Palou’s lead through pace and more available Push-to-Pass in his No. 12 Verizon 5G Team Penske Chevrolet.

The gap evaporated to 1.8038 seconds on Lap 83 of 90 with Power having nearly twice the Push-to-Pass seconds in his firesuit pocket as Palou. The Spaniard had the further complication of dealing with the turbulence from the rear wing of the No. 20 U.S. Air Force Chevrolet of Conor Daly who was just ahead of him and racing to stay on the lead lap.

Power closed to within 1.1160 seconds with two laps to go but Palou padded that margin to 1.8311 seconds at the white flag and staved off everything Power had over the final lap for victory.

“I made one little mistake in (Turn) 9 but with the amount of Push-to-Pass I had left it could have been pretty good” Power said. “We had to save some fuel but I had enough to use Push-to-Pass the last two laps.

“It just blew my mind how fast Alex was in that first stint. I had absolutely nothing for him. He just pulled away so I figured he was on a three-stop race. I was getting the best lap time I could for the fuel number.”

Said Palou: “It was one of those days when everything went well. We had good fuel mileage good tire management and good pace.”

Palou’s early fast pace after starting third helped him build a lead of 6.6 seconds shortly before his first pit stop on Lap 31 and a gap of 8.4 seconds on Lap 49. His average speed was 110.025 mph in a rapid race that featured 10 lead changes and just two caution periods for eight laps.

One of those cautions occurred on the first lap.

Chaos unfolded when two-time series champion and three-time Barber winner Josef Newgarden got loose exiting Turn 5 in the No. 2 Hitachi Team Penske Chevrolet touched the dirt just outside the racing surface and spun. He collected Andretti Autosport teammates Colton Herta and Ryan Hunter-Reay Felix Rosenqvist of Arrow McLaren SP and Max Chilton of Carlin in the melee.

All the drivers involved in the incident were unhurt but Newgarden and Hunter-Reay were eliminated.

“I got loose coming over the hill” Newgarden said. “I thought I had the car and touched the grass and I think once I touched the grass it pitched me sideways. I feel really bad for anyone that got involved in that. Obviously my mess created a bigger mess.”

The second caution came on Lap 10 when seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson spun in the No. 48 Carvana Chip Ganassi Racing Honda. Johnson recovered to finish 19th in his eagerly anticipated NTT INDYCAR SERIES debut.

Fellow rookie Romain Grosjean finished 10th in his series debut in the No. 51 Nurtec ODT Honda while rookie Scott McLaughlin placed 14th in the No. 3 PPG Team Penske Chevrolet.

The next event is the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg on Sunday April 25 (live coverage starts at noon ET on NBC INDYCAR Radio Network). The first practice starts at 4:15 p.m. (ET) Friday April 23 (live on Peacock).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3Bva2Vtb24tZ28tcHJvbW8tY29kZXMtZnJlZS1zdHVmZi1hcHJpbC0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pokemon GO: Promo Codes for Free Stuff (April 2021),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3Bva2Vtb24tZ28tcHJvbW8tY29kZXMtZnJlZS1zdHVmZi1hcHJpbC0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vZWFybmluZ3MtY2FsZW5kYXItZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrLW9mLWFwcmlsLTE5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings calendar for the week of April 19,"The market rally gathered pace this week amid impressive quarterly results led by the banking sector and positive economic data. Leading stock indexes continued their winning streak with S&P 500 maintaining the uptrend for the fourth week in a row and hitting a new high.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 34000-mark for the first time adding around 150 points in the last session. The sentiment was buoyed by encouraging retail sales data and reports of jobless claims falling.

The first-quarter earnings season got off to a good start with banking giants JPMorgan Chase Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs unveiling their latest financial data mid-week. They were joined by software firm Infosys on Wednesday.

The spotlight stayed on financial services Thursday also when the closely followed reports of Citigroup and Bank of America came out. Delta Air Lines and soft-drink behemoth PepsiCo released earnings on the same day. The first phase of bank earnings concluded on Friday with Morgan Stanley’s blockbuster Q1 report.

It’s going to be mixed bag next week. For instance the companies scheduled to report on April 19 include United Airlines Holdings IBM and Coca-Cola. The important corporate houses preparing to report on April 20 comprise Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson as well as streaming giant Netflix which has been thriving on the COVID-driven boom. The earning reports of superbike company Harley-Davidson and Lockheed Martin are also slated for Tuesday.

The other major companies that can elicit investor interest include Halliburton Verizon Communications Chipotle Mexican Grill and Kinder Morgan – the companies will report earnings on April 21. The next day it is the turn of American Airlines and Southwest Airlines as well as tech firms AT&T and Intel. American Express is probably the only big player to report on April 23.

The market was abuzz with the news of Microsoft’s $20-billion buyout of cloud software company Nuance Communications. In another important deal in the cloud space Datadog completed the acquisition of the SaaS-based security platform Sqreen.

The otherwise quiet M&A market witnessed Dell Technologies becoming two standalone public companies by spinning off its 81% ownership in VMware. The other major deals include Amgen’s $2-billion purchase of Five Prime Therapeutics and the acquisition of Upchain by software firm Autodesk.

After much anticipation Paul and Askren finally stepped into the ring to trade blows. It was one-way action though with Paul winning by first-round TKO at the 1:59 mark after the referee ruled Askren unable to continue despite answering the count following a knockdown.

The cruiserweight bout (190 pounds) headlined the Triller Fight Club event at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The main card aired on pay-per-view.

Paul the YouTuber actor and rapper made his boxing debut in January 2020 with a first-round TKO of fellow YouTuber Ali Eson Gib. His second fight came in November when he beat former NBA player and Slam Dunk champion Nate Robinson with a knockout that went viral.

Now he adds Askren’s name to his resume and he said the next challenge will be a sterner one as he looks to further add to his resume.

Askren meanwhile is likely done in the fight game.

After suffering back-to-back losses to Jorge Masvidal and Demian Maia under the UFC banner Askren retired from competition in November 2019. He subsequently underwent hip replacement surgery and that seemingly put a bow on his time in the fight game.

More than a year later however the opportunity to box Paul arose and he opted to have at it. The result didn’t go his way and the 36-year-old may now be done for good.

EVERETT — The murder of Steven Whitemarsh was “an execution plain and simple” a judge said at his killer’s sentencing Friday.

“I’m quite convinced that if you were released from prison you would do this again” Judge Millie Judge told the defendant Simeon Berkley 75.

Judge sentenced Berkley to 22 years behind bars for a road-rage shooting in Everett that killed Whitemarsh on July 6 2019.

Berkley claimed self-defense but this month a Snohomish County Superior Court jury found him guilty of second-degree murder with a deadly weapon.

Thirty years earlier Berkley claimed self-defense in the shooting of another driver in California. After a near-crash on I-8 Berkley shot and paralyzed Richard Durkin then 31 of San Diego County. A jury acquitted Berkley of attempted murder attempted manslaughter and assault with a deadly weapon according to the Los Angeles Times.

Berkley testified earlier this month in the Snohomish County case. As the only witness called by the defense he claimed he feared for his life when Whitemarsh 49 began tailgating him in a gold Lincoln Navigator on West Mukilteo Boulevard.

The Lincoln crashed into the back of Berkley’s Honda on Glenwood Avenue. Berkley got out of his car and walked toward the Lincoln. Whitemarsh remained in the front seat. According to Berkley’s testimony the other driver did not brandish a weapon or make any threats but Berkley still felt threatened by him. Berkley shot Whitemarsh twice in the head with a .380-caliber pistol.

“You became a vigilante at that moment” Judge said to Berkley and the courtroom. “You walked up to his car you shot and killed him. It’s amazing. He was still in his seatbelt.”

The victim’s brother Matthew Whitemarsh trembled and held back tears as he spoke on his brother’s behalf Friday.

“Today judge I stand before you and ask you: Please consider giving the maximum sentence” he said. “My brother’s killer should never see the outside of prison for the remainder of his time on Earth.”

Berkley in a green striped jail uniform sat 10 feet away. He turned his body 90 degrees to listen better to the slain man’s brother.

Under state guidelines Berkely faced a range of 15¼ to 22½ years behind bars. Deputy prosecutor Matt Hunter asked the judge for a 20-year sentence.

“The cold-blooded nature of his crime coupled with the cold-hearted nature of his testimony cannot be ignored” Hunter wrote in a sentencing memorandum. “While Mr. Whitemarsh’s mother and brother sat in the jury box listening Mr. Berkley described his execution of Steven Whitemarsh without a hint of emotion care or concern.”

Berkley declined to address the court Friday.

His defense attorney Laura Shaver requested a sentence of five years. She argued a longer sentence could mean Berkley would die in prison.

Whitemarsh who lived in Everett was a Safeway manager and father.

“He was a loving son he was a brother and most of all he was a caring and loving father of three wonderful children” his brother Matthew told the courtroom.

The children were uprooted from their father’s home their uncle said. Now they must begin to “try to grieve the one person who was always there for every birthday (every) Christmas.”

“This will never bring back my brother but it closes the chapter of a senseless killing” Whitemarsh’s brother said in court. “Hopefully it will also bring closure to Richard Durkin because he never got that 30 years ago.”

This story has been updated to correctly identify the victim’s brother.

Touro University Nevada is getting a $3 million endowment gift for its autism center from the Middle Eastern nation of Qatar.

The funding for the private Henderson university’s Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities will be used primarily for scholarships for Southern Nevada families who don’t have health insurance or can’t afford to pay for care at the center. The scholarships will be awarded beginning in June 2022.

“Touro has always helped clients if they can’t afford services” said Shelley Berkley CEO and senior provost for the university’s western division. “This will go a very long way to ensure that nobody with autism ever gets turned away from our facility and that we will be able to enhance the types of therapies that we provide for autistic children and their families.”

The university plans to invest the donated money and hopes the interest will be what pays for scholarships for families Berkley said. “We would like to keep the principal so it would be an ongoing endowment that would last forever.”

Touro’s autism center which opened in 2008 serves children from 18 months to 12 years old. In addition to diagnosis it offers services such as occupational physical speech-language and applied behavioral analysis therapies.

Before the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic the center was logging about 535 patient visits per month. But the center closed in spring 2020 and “lost a number of therapists” Berkley said noting it’s now gradually reopening.

“As the restrictions lift and we get back to whatever the new normal is going to be we’re going to be able to hopefully exceed the 535 patient visits” Berkley said adding “If we need more therapists we will hire them.”

Berkley said a hope for the future is to also expand services to include children ages 13 to 18.

Autism spectrum disorder is a condition that can include challenges with behavior and communication and is four times more common in boys than girls according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Qatar’s involvement

Touro’s autism center is one of six U.S. organizations to receive a donation from Qatar announced this month.

About two years ago Berkley received a phone call saying Qatar’s ambassador to the United States was planning to visit Las Vegas and heard about Touro University Nevada’s autism center. She gave him a tour of the campus but primarily focused on the autism center.

“It was very apparently from the beginning that this is where his interests lie” Berkley said.

Following the tour Berkley had limited contact with the embassy for about one-and-a-half years. Then a few months ago she received word the center would receive a $3 million endowment grant.

Autism is not rare in Qatar which had a population of 2.83 million in 2019 according to the World Bank. A 2019 autism prevalence survey conducted in the Persian Gulf nation estimated that about 1 in 88 children there has an autism spectrum disorder.

That compares to about 1 in 54 children in the United States.

The royal family of Qatar also has had “an international footprint when it comes to autism and improving the quality of life for those with autism” Berkley said.

For example she said Sheikha Moza bint Nasser wife of former Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani proposed creating World Autism Awareness Day which is now recognized on April 2 each year.

In a statement to the Review-Journal Meshal bin Hamad Al-Thani Qatar’s ambassador to the United States said the Persian Gulf nation remains committed to increasing international awareness about the disorder.

“Touro University Nevada’s Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities is already doing incredible work for children facing developmental challenges” he said. “This gift will pave the way for patients who may otherwise have seen cost as a barrier to afford treatment at the center which is particularly important as families recover from the adverse economic effects of COVID-19.”

One family’s experience

Henderson residents Gary Haase and Thuan Tong-Haase have been bringing their 6-year-old daughter Akara to Touro’s autism center for nearly three years.

Akara enjoys coming to the center and views it as a fun event Gary Haase said noting she calls it “Touro University playground.”

Haase said the therapies have had an unbelievable effect on his daughter who was diagnosed at age 3.

Pre-pandemic Akara was receiving a few types of therapy — with the exception of speech therapy — under one roof at Touro. Now she’s only receiving applied behavioral analysis at the center since the other therapies aren’t yet back up and running yet due to COVID-19 impacts.

Haase said that in his daughter’s younger years he and his wife weren’t sure what her capabilities would be and as parents were extremely concerned.

“There was a time when she was younger where we didn’t know whether she would be fully verbal or not” he said.

They jumped into trying to find therapy from anywhere they could and went all over town.

“It’s because our little girl needed the help so badly so desperately” Haase said but noted it’s not easy to access services.

After getting recommendations from a doctor the family had Akara on Touro’s waiting list for more than a year.

“We know that Touro is really good and they have many things” Tong-Haase said. The center also provides information for parents she said noting she has learned a lot.

Now Akara has shown she’s probably going to be fully verbal and speaks beautifully with prompting Haase said. She’s also made many physical improvements too he added proudly.

NBC cancelled the show earlier this year after just two seasons since they picked Brooklyn 99 up after its previous home Fox surprisingly pulled the plug after season 5 despite its loyal following.

The currently filming Brooklyn Nine Nine season 8 will air in the 2021-2022 season and personally we just can't wait to see how they plan to wrap up the saga.

Debuting in 2013 Brooklyn Nine Nine quickly took the place of The Office as our most anticipated tv sitcom half-hour and there's barely a bad episode among the 143 that have aired so far.

A massive part of Brooklyn 99's success is Andy Samberg's charismatic and hilarious performance as the cocksure John McClane in Die Hard obsessed Jake Peralta. Samberg's wholehearted gutso in the role is clear for everyone to see and he so often gets the biggest laughs with his eccentricities and outrageous one-liners.

But how well do you remember the antics and shenanigans of Brooklyn Nine Nine's no. 9544 detective Jake Peralta.

As we await hope and pray we get to see Jake Peralta interact with Bruce Willis in the final season... here's our absolute hardest Jake Peralta quiz to pass the time!

That’s according to a report from Fayetteville-based SupplyPike a suite of applications that helps consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies manage their supply chain. The report analyzed data from more than 200 suppliers to Walmart throughout 2020.

The report examined the rise and fall of Walmart’s suppliers’ sales and in-stocks (product on the shelf) in 2020 and created a timeline of coronavirus impacts on retail. Stacy Tan senior director of retail strategy at SupplyPike said the report’s focus was on three of Walmart’s top business units amid the pandemic: general merchandise consumables and food. All units saw growth in 2020 despite high out-of-stock rates through much of the year.

Tan said general merchandise sales grew by 18.87% last year consumables grew 14.31% and food sales rose 15.41%. Across all departments sales rose 17.21% from the prior year.

During the height of the stay-at-home orders general merchandise category sales rose 60% by late May and early June led by unprecedented demand for fabrics crafts media and gaming lawn and garden paint and accessories and furniture.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon recently told the investment community that never in his lifetime did he think Walmart would ever sell out of fabric or adult bicycles that were out-of-stock for months during 2020.

“We were hit hard from an in-stock point of view” he said. “Normally it’s a great thing to have inventory turns and we were managing our supply chain well but we didn’t have these huge stockpiles sitting to the side for the surges that we saw on things like consumables. So I’d never seen anything like what happened in our stores as we went through the year. And it was a real challenge.”

SupplyPike found the sales trends for general merchandise took wide swings last year. Sales fell from the start of 2020 until early April that year when the pandemic began to grip the nation. Demand pushed sales up 60% only to go flat by early June. In the fall as COVID-19 cases again spiked demand for general merchandise surged again in November before falling off in December.

Consumables like toilet paper and aspirin spiked about 20% in late March 2020 and demand kept sales steady with slight increases through November before falling flat in December. Most of the year food sales were elevated spiking 40% in late March 2020 before leveling off at about 10% during the summer. Food sales rose 20% by November before falling flat by year-end.

Walmart has said consumers stocked up early in the pandemic to the point of hoarding some items which kept out-of-stocks problematic during 2020. McMillon has said Walmart’s lean inventory positioning going into the pandemic worked against it as demand soared and shelves stayed empty. He said there was no way to forecast consumers hoarding items such as canned soup or toilet paper.

SupplyPike said panic buying and the rise of virtual offices and classrooms also caused massive out-of-stocks. Tan said combing through mounds of data from more than 200 Walmart suppliers indicated prolonged periods of in-stock levels at 85% or below.

Ahead of the pandemic Walmart was already below 85% in-stock in sporting goods hardware lawn and gardens. By March 2020 when U.S. COVID-19 cases began to spread Walmart saw its in-stock levels for dairy frozen food dry grocery fresh/frozen meat produce snacks and beverages paper goods liquor and packaged deli reach in-stock levels below 85%.

Tan said some stores remained out-of-stock for weeks and the report reflects inventory in all of Walmart’s 4400 stores. Grocery/food in-stocks were below 85% through March 2020 rising slightly during the entire summer before catching up to roughly 98% in-stocks by October. Paper product consumables inventories were challenged through June until suppliers were able to meet demand. Through late summer suppliers were above 98% in-stock but would go short again in December as COVID cases again began to spike.

Tan said pet adoption rose dramatically amid the pandemic and that pressured inventory from May through October with the deepest out-of-stocks occurring from July to October. She said paint and supplies ran short in May and inventory stayed below 90% most of the summer and fell below 85% by September.

Household cleaning supplies were below 85% in-stocks from May to October. Lawn and garden is typically a seasonal business and Walmart was below 85% in-stocks during the summer.

In May the report indicates that Walmart was below 90% in-stocks in 11 of the critical departments of typically fast-turning items. The report reviewed 53 Walmart category departments and in June not a single department was at 98% in-stock levels. Health & beauty and media gaming were the only two departments remotely close to 98% in-stocks in June.

In July the majority of departments were below 85% in-stocks according to the report. By August out-of-stocks were among the highest of the year in most departments. The exception was ladies’ wear with 98% in-stocks. September was much of the same for insufficient in-stock levels at Walmart leaving high demand categories like pets below 85% in-stock levels for four consecutive months and not improving until November.

Tan said suppliers who participated in the report said they were negatively impacted when factories in China stopped production for the U.S. to focus on domestic consumption. She said without parts for things like bicycles assembled in the U.S. plants were forced to close or curb production.

Tan said a perfect storm hit the supply chain when consumers began hoarding imports stopped and Walmart was already working with a lean inventory. She said the supply chain is resilient and gives Walmart praise for restoring in-stocks by the fourth quarter.

Supply chain expert Greg Forbis executive vice president of strategy and development at logistics provider RJW said it’s doubtful Walmart will beef up its inventory. Still there will be added pressure on suppliers to deliver complete orders. Forbis said Walmart lost some market share in the height of the pandemic because of low in-stock levels and some of that was unavoidable. Still now that suppliers in most categories have caught up with production there is little tolerance for not meeting the on-time in-full (OTIF) protocol.

“You are also seeing some suppliers like Clorox even add production capacity because of the pandemic-induced consumer behaviors that are expected to stick beyond the health crisis” Forbis said.

Police in Loveland Colorado dislocated the shoulder of a 73-year-old woman who lives with dementia after she simply forgot to pay Walmart $13.88 on June 26 2020 according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court. The law office that represents Karen Garner released body-cam footage from the point-of-view of the arresting officer.

Video shows the officer in question pulling up to the side of the road and approaching Garner from behind. He told her to stop.

As seen on video the 73-year-old shrugged. According to the complaint Garner lives with cortical dementia. This is characterized by the impairment of at least two brain functions the lawsuit states. On top of that she has sensory aphasia which they described as an “inability to understand spoken written or tactile speech symbols that results from damage to the area of the brain concerned with language.”

“You just left Walmart” said the arresting officer identified in the complaint as Austin Hopp. “Do you need to be arrested right now?”

Garner turned to walk away.

“No no no” said Hopp. He grabbed her from behind and pulled her arms behind her back in order to handcuff her in the grass and dirt.

As seen on video she said she was going home.

“Don’t do that” she said repeatedly.

Hopp called in the arrest.

“Why did you do that?” he told Garner. “I told you to stop. You don’t get to act this way.” He yanked what seemed to be a phone from her hand and threw it to the grass.

Throughout the video Garner said she was going home and Hopp insisted that she was fighting him.

The complaint describes the exact moment the shoulder dislocation occurred:

Accordingly next without warning or justification Officer Hopp took Ms. Garner’s entire bent and restrained left arm with both hands and he shoved it violently forward onto the hood of his car. You can see and hear on his video how this fractured and dislocated Ms. Garner’s shoulder.

“Are you finished?” Hopp said twisting her left arm and he bent her over the hood of his vehicle. “Are you finished? We don’t play this game. You understand me? If you try to kick me oh this is going to be bad.”

Another officer identified in the lawsuit as Daria Jalali arrived and helped in the arrest.

A male bystander was apparently so disturbed by the sight that he drove up and called out to police. He said he wanted to complain to Hopp’s sergeant and to file a report that the officer threw a “little kid.” (The lawsuit describes Garner as just five feet fall and weighing just 80 pounds. Hopp himself later on estimates that she is between 4’10” and 5 feet tall and weighs maybe 100 pounds. He told Jalali that Garner was “like 20 pounds.” Elsewhere he also said she was a “frail little thing.”

Hopp told the bystander that the woman stole from Walmart refused to listen to lawful orders and fought.

“This is what happens when you fight the police” he said. “I have to use force to safely detain her. That’s what this is. This isn’t some random act of aggression. I don’t know if you realize that.”

The bystander continued to question what happened.

“See you don’t know the whole situation” said Hopp. “That’s the thing.” He later told the man to “get all of the facts” before making a “snap judgment.”

All told the lawsuit states Garner sustained a fractured and dislocated shoulder. She also sustained other injuries including scrapes to her face a bloody nose and contusions to her knees.

According the complaint Garner allegedly left a Walmart without paying for $13.88 of merchandise. Employees stopped her took back the items and refused to let her pay when she offered her credit card. She was unable to communicate with them or understand what was happening the complaint stated.

“Forgetting to pay for items at a store is one of the most common and well-known symptoms witnessed in elderly persons suffering from dementia” the lawsuit stated.

Supervising officer Sgt. Philip Metzler is also being sued with the city Hopp and Jalali. He is accused of helping cover up what happened and of making so it Garner was denied access to medical care.

From the complaint:

Ms. Garner’s right to be free from unreasonable seizure and excessive force as described herein was clearly established at the time the Defendant officers Hopp Jalali and Metzler attacked her handcuffed her broke her arm hog-tied her and then kept her in isolation away from medical care in pain and handcuffs for six hours.

The Loveland Police Department said Thursday that they are investigating the incident and said that they only learned about it the day before. Hopp who the department did not name is on administrative leave pending the investigation. Jalali and Metzler also not identified by the department are on administrative duties. Jalali was a school resource officer at least as of 2019.

Example video title will go here for this video

INDIANAPOLIS — Police were called to the Walmart store in Beech Grove this afternoon after shots were fired. The store is located at 4650 S. Emerson Ave. which is just south of I-465.

IMPD said it started with a scuffle over shoplifting. A park ranger was working his off-duty job for security at Walmart. He called for other officers when the suspect resisted and police were already responding when things escalated.

According to IMPD the suspect pulled out a gun and aimed it at the park ranger. That's when a good Samaritan in the store who was licensed to carry pulled out his gun and started firing at the suspect.

That escalated the response for police to a call of shots fired.

The suspect then ran from the store where he was later tackled by another good Samaritan outside and held until police arrived.

He was transported to the hospital with some injuries but not from gunshots. The park ranger also had some injuries also not from gunfire.

No one was actually hit by any of the gunfire.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xNi91cy9sb3ZlbGFuZC1sYXdzdWl0LXVzZS1vZi1mb3JjZS1hcnJlc3QvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBSmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMDQvMTYvdXMvbG92ZWxhbmQtbGF3c3VpdC11c2Utb2YtZm9yY2UtYXJyZXN0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woman with dementia sues city of Loveland police officers alleging excessive use of force in 2020 arrest,"CNN —

A Loveland Colorado police officer is on administrative leave and two other officers have been reassigned to administrative duties after a federal civil rights lawsuit alleging excessive use of force was filed against the city of Loveland and the three officers.

The lawsuit filed April 14 alleges that 73-year-old Karen Garner was forcibly arrested last June for allegedly shoplifting from a Walmart.

According to the lawsuit Garner has dementia and suffered multiple injuries including a broken humerus a dislocated shoulder and a sprained wrist after she was taken to the ground and handcuffed by an officer on June 26 as she was walking along a road.

The complaint described Garner as 5 feet tall and weighing 80 pounds. The suit claims she accidentally left the store forgetting to pay for $14 in items.

According to both police and the lawsuit Walmart employees stopped Garner and took the items back.

CNN obtained the police body camera footage from the office of Garner’s attorney.

The video shows Loveland Police Officer Austin Hopp knocking Garner to the ground within 30 seconds after he first got on scene and attempting to detain her.

Garner repeatedly told Hopp that she was going home as he held her down on the ground alongside the road.

“After a short struggle she is now detained” Hopp says over his radio with Garner calling out “don’t do that” from the ground.

“I told you to stop you don’t get to act this way” he tells her.

Garner was wrestled to the ground within 30 seconds of a police officer exiting his patrol car. Loveland Police/Life & Liberty Law Office

The bodycam footage shows the officer pulling Garner off the ground as he tries to get her into the police car.

“Right now you’re resisting which is not going to fly with me and before that you tried to steal from Walmart and they caught you and took the stuff back” he tells her as he pushes her toward the police vehicle.

Witness attempted to intervene

According to the lawsuit Garner suffers from dementia and sensory aphasia which limited her ability to understand what was occurring.

“I’m going home” Garner continues to insist.

Another police officer arrives on scene and walks up to Garner who is pressed against the police car.

“Quit” the second officer says as Garner slides down to the ground and says “Ow.”

Hopp searches Garner and she struggles with the officers as they try to get her in the car.

A witness attempts to intervene. “Do you have to use that much aggression?” he asks the officers.

“What are you doing get out of here this is not your business” Hopp tells him.

The witness asks Hopp for his sergeant’s name and tells the officer he saw him “throw the little kid.”

“She’s not a little kid” Hopp says adding “I have to use force to safely detain her that’s what this is. This isn’t just some random act of aggression.”

“Before you go to a snap judgment you’ve got to get all of the facts” he tells the witness.

Several minutes later a Loveland police sergeant arrives on scene and speaks to both officers.

“A little bloody a little muddy that’s how it works” the female officer says.

“Is the blood on her?” the sergeant asks.

“Yeah that’s her blood” Hopp replies.

District attorney’s office will review incident

The bodycam video also shows the officers processing Garner at the police station where she repeatedly tells them she was going to pay for the items.

The 8th Judicial District Attorney’s Office of Colorado said a previous administration dismissed Garner’s case and “no investigation regarding any improper use of force has been presented to our office.”

The district attorney’s office said it will review the incident and consider if an independent criminal investigation is needed.

The Loveland Police Department said in a statement that it first learned of the incident via an edited bodycam video posted to its Facebook page on April 14.

“LPD takes very seriously the allegations concerning the arrest of resident Karen Garner and shares with the community the concerns about video images that became public on Wednesday” the police statement said.

CNN has contacted the Loveland Police Officers Association for comment. It’s not clear if Hopp has an attorney and attempts to reach the officer were unsuccessful."

BURBANK CA — Chip Gaines lasted less than a week as head of Walt Disney Imagineering. Disney (the company) spokesperson Jun Disney (no relation) told Uncle Walt's Insider ""Officially Chip is moving on to devote more time with his family."" ""Off the record though"" Disney (no relation) continued ""Chip was less interested in coming up with new attractions and more into completely gutting the Imagineering offices 'to get them ready to flip.'"" [Note to self: look up the meaning of ""off the record"" before publication.] A surprising choice Gaines’ replacement actress and former MMA fighter Gina Carano is a surprising choice. (It says so right above this paragraph.)

This item was not a factual recounting of real-life events. The article originated with a website that describes its output as being humorous or satirical in nature as follows:

All events persons and companies depicted herein including Disney Walt Disney and The Disney Company are fictitious and any similarity to actual persons living dead or otherwise or to actual firms is coincidental. Really. The same goes for any similarities to actual facts.

The satire site's Facebook page carries a similar disclaimer:

Only the most super-reliable theme park news from the most super-reliable theme park gurus. All stories internally peer-reviewed for minimum 17% accuracy.

On Feb. 11 2021 The Associated Press reported that Carano was fired from her role as Cara Dune on the Disney+ series ""The Mandalorian."" Her departure followed a social media post that ""likened the experience of Jews during the Holocaust to the U.S. political climate.""

Lucasfilm said at the time that the company had ""no plans"" for her to return to the series in the future.

In sum the story about Gina Carano Chip Gaines and Walt Disney Imagineering was labeled as satire. For background here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vbGFqb2xsYW1vbS5jb20vZGlzbmV5bGFuZC1wYXJrLXBhcmlzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disneyland Paris: Tips For A Half-Day Visit,"It’s ironic that my daughter has been to every Disney resort in the world because we’re half-day tourists. While we love the park rides and cheerful ambiance we prefer to spend late afternoons resting our feet in a luxury hotel. The good news is that it’s so easy to get to Disneyland Paris from central Paris that you can visit without spending a full day there which works especially for those who are short on time.

There are actually two parks at Disneyland Paris (formerly known as Euro Disney): Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios. Older kids prefer the latter park as it is home to more thrill rides like the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. But we chose Disneyland Park since my daughter loves the usual rides.

Note: This trip was taken prior to park closures and new health and safety measures.

How to Get From Paris to Disneyland Paris

First whatever you do buy Disneyland Paris tickets in advance. With 24 hours of notice our concierge team at Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris secured tickets that we picked up at their desk on the way out the door. Easy.

Because our hotel’s location was epically convenient to everything we needed to do a 5-minute walk down the Champs Elysees landed us at the Charles de Gaulle – Etoile train station. Clear signage enabled a non-French-speaking tourist like me to purchase tickets to Disneyland Paris via the automated machine without complications.

The train you’re looking for is RER A and the stop for Disneyland Paris is Marne la Vallee-Chessy. The trains run every 6-10 minutes depending on the time of day and once onboard it will take about 45 minutes to reach Disneyland Paris. I thought the double-decker trains were clean and very easy to use. So if navigating the train from Paris is holding you back from visiting the park don’t let it. Hiring a car takes the same amount of time and risks traffic.

Once at Marne la Vallee-Chessy you simply follow the signs to the park entrance. You’ll have to pass through park security first which is kind of an unpleasant scrum but. Hopefully you’ll have tickets in-hand so all you’ll need to do next (after walking a few more minutes toward the park) is have them scanned at the turnstiles to enter.

Inside Disneyland Park in Paris

Disneyland Park is laid out in a similar manner to other Disneyland parks but is slightly downsized. The five lands are Main Street U.S.A. Frontierland Adventureland Fantasyland and Discoveryland (the equivalent of Disneyland Resort’s Tomorrowland).

There are 43 rides and attractions and from everything I read not-to-be-missed is Pirates of the Caribbean. And if you like noting subtle differences in rides between parks I would suggest checking out it’s a small world (you’ll see a difference in how the countries are featured) and Phantom Manor their equivalent of the Haunted House. Of course most of the narrative is in French but it doesn’t really matter. The afternoon parades feature introductions in five different languages which is cool.

FastPass is available for several rides but since the French kids weren’t out of school yet and we visited on a weekday lines weren’t particularly long. In fact we waited no longer than 10 minutes with most rides a straight walk on. We arrived at 10:30 a.m. left around 2:30 p.m. and rode:

Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast

it’s a small world

Pirates of the Caribbean

Phantom Manor

In between we explored Sleeping Beauty’s Castle Toy Storyland playground walked pretty much the entire park ate lunch saw a few characters shopped and left. Unfortunately the carousel and Space Mountain were walled up for renovation. It honestly felt like a pretty full itinerary. I have read that people with long layovers in Paris take the train over from the airport just to walk the park.

Navigating Crowds

I do believe we were lucky that we didn’t wait in many or any lines. If visiting during peak times like holidays and weekends you may want to consider booking a VIP tour. At the time of this writing a VIP tour is €900 for up to 10 people for 4 hours and allows you to cut some of the queue (or all of it depending on the ride). I was so fearful of waiting in line that I actually almost booked this and am so glad that I didn’t because our waits were not long.

But if my only chance to experience Disneyland Paris was a Saturday in July I’d probably do it.

Dining at Disneyland Paris

The bottom line is that if time is of the essence you’ll want to eat quickly during your visit unless a dining experience at Disneyland Paris is important to you.

My husband did some financing work for Disneyland Paris back when we lived in London and has been following park news more closely than I have. He said that one of the unexpected revenue disappointments is that guests of Disneyland Paris are not purchasing as much food within the park as originally forecasted. They bring their own and as we were passing through the security line I saw many people with huge backpacks full of chips sodas sandwiches and other sustenance.

However unlike Disneyland Resort in Anaheim the food here isn’t notable and I’m not the only one to say that. With this in mind and knowing we were going to need to eat quickly in order to keep our park visit short I didn’t make reservations anywhere. So we walked into Buzz Lightyear’s Pizza Planet in Discoveryland since my daughter got hungry when we happened to be nearby.

The food was just okay (but was the bathroom was unacceptably gross). It was a not-great-quality buffet of salad pizza pasta and dessert that you’d serve yourself on paper plates and dine with using plastic cutlery. I can’t imagine how much waste this place generates. Also the soda fountain did not have ice available which was odd. They did not sell booze (sad panda). I think it was about €18 for adults and €11 for kids.

That being said I have heard and read great reviews of Walt’s on Main Street should you want a sit-down American meal with French flair and French wine! This is definitely where I would eat next time. Or I would opt for character dining at Auberge de Cendrillon in Fantasyland.

Why We Didn’t Stay at a Disneyland Paris Hotel

I thought long and hard about staying in an official Disneyland Paris Hotel because I am a fan of Extra Magic Hours (early entrance to the parks). But we were visiting in June and the options even with a euro-dollar exchange rate in our favor were quite expensive. And the rooms in all of the hotels frankly looked dated.

Based on our family’s preferences I choose the iconic Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris which at peak summer rates does cost quite a bit but it was only incrementally more expensive than the Disneyland Hotel. For us the choice was a no-brainer.

I can’t say that I’d never stay at a Disneyland Paris hotel but it’s so easy to train in from Paris that it’s not absolutely necessary to stay on the resort. However Extra Magic Hours are between 8:00 a.m. – 10:00 a.m. which is very generous especially on a weekend.

Here’s another tip. When researching Disneyland Paris hotels check several sites as it is my theory (and I’ve spoken to others who have had similar experiences) that availability is often based on where you live. I was able to find availability via the UK site but not on the US one for example.

The Bottom Line

For us a half-day visit to Disneyland Paris was very well worth the time effort and expense.

What are your tips for visiting Disneyland Paris? Have you ever done it in half of a day?

And here we are almost 50 years later!

In October 2021 we are going to be celebrating the 50th anniversary at all the Disney World theme parks — making this Walt Disney World’s biggest celebration yet! We already know the parks will bring special costumes to characters embellishments on Cinderella Castle a new lighting package for Spaceship Earth and more.

But will we see Disney World also improve some of its rides for the 50th anniversary? Here’s why we think it’s possible!

Disneyland’s 60th Anniversary

For Disneyland’s 60th anniversary the parks brought Guests several ride improvements including new (and much more advanced) Abominable Snowman animatronics on the Matterhorn Bobsleds. Additionally the ride comfort overall was improved on this attraction.

Another enhancement that came with Disneyland’s 60th was more Disney magic on Peter Pan’s Flight! Guests were greeted with a reimagined nursery scene and additional special effects on the attraction.

So will Disney World follow in Disneyland’s footsteps for the upcoming 50th milestone celebration? Here’s what is confirmed as well as what I hope will happen.

What Improvements Could Come For Disney World’s 50th Anniversary?

Fantasyland Updates

We already know Disney Imagineers have begun to improve the appearance of several attractions including Prince Charming Regal Carrousel Dumbo the Flying Elephant Peter Pan’s Flight and others to include some updates relating to the 50th — such as gold accents on the outside of Prince Charming Regal Carrousel and repainting of the Dumbo sign.

But aside from the work that is already confirmed will we see actual improvements made on certain rides — similar to Matterhorn at Disneyland? If so here are some of my predictions!

Space Mountain

Personally I would love to see Disney improve the ride track on Space Mountain. Currently the ride-through can get pretty rough so if Disney would improve the ride comfort overall on Space Mountain — similar to what they did on Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland — that would be a great improvement for Guests!

Now I am not saying change any elements of the ride or reimagine the storyline — simply just make some improvements so that the ride itself runs a bit smoother.

Journey Into Imagination With Figment

Over in EPCOT the Journey Into Imagination With Figment attraction has been experiencing some technical difficulties as of late. Back in October 2020 one Guest noticed there was completely no sound over in the Sight Lab. Additionally when I was visiting in March 2021 I experienced the same exact thing — no sound in the Sight Lab.

With this being said it’s pretty obvious that Figment needs some TLC and it would be great if Disney closed the ride for refurbishment to make any necessary adjustments before the 50th kicks off later this year.

Carousel of Progress

Walt Disney and WED Enterprises teamed up and created what is now the longest-running stage show in American theater history — Walt Disney’s Carousel of Progress.

But since this Tomorrowland attraction was created so long ago (for the 1964 New York World’s Fair) it’s safe to say that the last scene of the attraction is no longer “looking to the future” and it no longer shows what the continued “progress” could look like since it’s set more in the present day.

For Disney World’s 50th anniversary it would be great to see the attraction get a little update while still keeping Walt’s legacy of course. I mean what better time is there for a ride improvement than the 50th anniversary? I would love to see the company make some sort of small update to make it more relevant to today.

At this time Disney has not confirmed any of these improvements aside from the Fantasyland work being done on Prince Charming Regal Carousel Dumbo the Flying Elephant and Peter Pan’s Flight.

The Disney Resort categories can help decipher which rooms might provide you with more space with Value Resorts being the least spacious and Deluxe Resorts being the most. But how do you choose between them all? And what if you want something even bigger? Well some of them will cost you a pretty penny but we’re covering where you’ll find the largest hotel rooms for your Disney World vacation! Let’s dig in!

Here’s Where to Find the BIGGEST Hotel Rooms in Disney World!

Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa

Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa is one of the Deluxe Resorts on property and is located on the Magic Kingdom monorail line. If you’re willing to shell out some big bucks then you can stay in a hotel room that is larger than most apartments (and even many houses) at 2200 (!!) square feet. These rooms are located in the main building of the Grand Floridian and are available for those staying Club Level. So you’ll get a big room and quite a few exclusive amenities too.

If Club Level isn’t your preference the Grand Floridian is also where you can find the largest standard rooms at a little over 440 square feet.

Keep in mind that you’ll be paying for that larger standard room; this hotel tends to run upwards of $500 per night. But if you plan to spend a lot of time at the resort then this might be worth the money!

Disney Vacation Club 2-Bedroom Villas at Old Key West Resort

If you’re a Disney Vacation Club member (or if you’ve rented DVC) then you’re probably already used to larger rooms that have a kitchen and more space to spread out. But not all Disney Vacation Club rooms are created equally. The 2-Bedroom Villas at Disney’s Old Key West Resort boast two full bedrooms with bathrooms a big kitchen laundry facilities in-house and a large living room.

Plus because this was the first Disney Vacation Club property the rooms are a lot larger than others. Also because of their age they tend to be a bit more affordable.

Treehouses at Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa

If you’re looking for a big hotel room because you’re planning on bringing a large group with you to Disney World then the Treehouses at Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa are worth checking out. These are literal treehouses located on the Sassagoula River and feature three bedrooms a kitchen and a living room.

Thanks to all the space you can sleep up to nine people in these. Plus they offer a more secluded feel though you still have easy access to all the Disney World amenities and transportation.

Disney’s Polynesian Village Resort

Are you still thinking about Club Level from when we talked about it earlier? Well there’s another hotel that boasts a giant Presidential Suite: Disney’s Polynesian Village Resort. The King Kamehameha Suite is located here and it is so big that it is 2 stories high!

It features a king bed two queen beds a queen pull-out bed plus a living room dining room and kitchen. To stay here you’ll certainly be paying out some big bucks but you’ll have access to all the Club Level amenities like free snacks in the lounge a dedicated Cast Member for your stay and more.

The Cabins at Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort

If you’re willing to stay somewhere without all the glitz and glamor and “rough it” the Cabins at Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort feature a lot of space for an affordable price. And when we say cabins we really mean it! They actually are log cabins!

These feature a full kitchen and living room (with a pull-out bed) a bedroom with a queen bed and bunk beds for the kiddos. Plus you’ll be close to all the unique activities at Fort Wilderness like horseback riding archery and canoeing!

Disney’s Art of Animation Resort

For those looking for a standard hotel room with the most space at a relatively affordable price Disney’s Art of Animation Resort offers a large selection of family suites. These feature a master bedroom with a queen bed a living area with a double-sized table bed a double-sized pull-out sofa and a kitchenette.

Plus the unique part of staying at this hotel is the theming. The three sections that feature family suites are themed after Disney’s The Lion King Finding Nemo and Cars. And you’ll find the largest Resort pool here as well!

Disney’s All-Star Music Resort

Disney’s All-Star Music Resort is another Value Resort option that has select family suites available. These are a little different from those at Art of Animation but still offer more space than other affordable options.

The two-room suite has a queen bed in one room and two pull-down murphy-style beds in the main room.

As you can see if space in your hotel room is a priority then you have quite a few different options when you’re visiting Walt Disney World! Some rooms are certainly more expensive than others but you’ll likely find something that fits your space and price needs to make the most of your Disney vacation.

In Part Two of a two part look at Wheelabrator Westchester’s waste-to-energy plant in Peekskill we examine the costs benefits – and potential alternatives to the current system.

The Frit Pit

From the plant’s opening in 1984 until October 22 2009 Wheelabrator’s ash output had a much shorter journey than it does today. For 25 years the remnants of the waste-to-energy operation were landfilled just four miles from Charles Point at the Sprout Brook Residue Disposal Facility off Albany Post Road just beyond the “rock cut” in Cortlandt. Five days a week trucks brought 400 to 600 tons of ash to the 30 acre county-owned site in the narrow valley just north of Peekskill. According to a 2009 NY Times article on the closure the site took in around 15 million tons of ash in that period.

Locals wryly refer to the massive pile now capped with a protective lining and monitored for offsite leachate as “the Frit Pit.” From the town athletic fields along Sprout Brook Road the “pit” is much more a pile – a light gray butte towering behind a thin strip of forest that disappears into the valley as it extends northeast out of view. The site began as former gravel mines (hence the “pit” moniker) but today the ash pile rises to the height of surrounding ridges – roughly 200 feet based on topographic maps.





At the base of the massive pile Sprout Brook a valley stream which joins Annsville Creek just upstream of the Hudson River winds its way through Sprout Brook Park. The park is a four acre sliver of land wedged between Sprout Brook Road and the ash pile; it was given to the Town of Cortlandt by the county as a token of its appreciation for hosting the final remnants of Westchester’s waste in perpetuity. Unlike Peekskill’s arrangement for hosting the waste-to-energy plant Cortlandt never received direct financial compensation for hosting the ash dump.

At the time of its closure the NY State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) promised to monitor the Sprout Brook Ashfill including adjacent ground water for thirty years. There’s very little publicly available information about the leachate test results other than this table from a 1989 book from samples taken just two years after the facility opened.









A 1993 edition of environmental watchdog publication “Waste Not” mentions that a mile-long pipe was laid “within the past two years” “to run the leachate from the landfill in Cortlandt to the Peekskill sewage treatment center” (which is operated by Westchester County at Annsville Creek). This seems likely to be true given that the Peekskill Sewer District extends beyond the city limits in this area fully encapsulating the ashfill.





Since October 2009 the ash from Wheelabrator’s Peekskill plant has been trucked 150 miles east down I-84 to a company-owned ash monofill overlooking the Quinebaug River in Putnam Connecticut. That facility which opened in 1999 takes in 575000 tons of incinerator ash per year from waste-to-energy plants in New York and Connecticut. Wheelabrator pays around $3 million per year to the town of Putnam for the arrangement.

In 2019 with the monofill expected to fill completely by 2024 Wheelabrator announced a plan to expand the Putnam operation by 68 acres giving it another 25 years worth of capacity. The proposal which includes filling and re-creating a 7 acre wetland caused intense debate in the rural Connecticut town of less than 10000 residents. In the end Wheelabrator offered some concessions including a 48 acre conservation area. The town’s Zoning Commission approved the expansion in September 2020.

Up in the Air

From its 1984 opening Peekskill’s Westchester Resco operation hummed along pretty quietly with little news coverage for the first few years. But in the late 1980s the problems of air pollution and ash disposal from a rapidly growing fleet of “resource recovery” and “waste to energy” incinerators became a topic of increasing debate in the US.



In early 1988 environmental advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund filed a federal lawsuit against Wheelabrator Technologies accusing the company of violating state and federal laws requiring incinerator ash from its Peekskill plant to be handled as hazardous waste. The case ran for over five years and in 1994 the US Supreme Court effectively ruled that incinerator ash is hazardous waste and must be handled and disposed of accordingly.

Others were beginning to look at what was leaving incinerators via their smokestacks escaping into the air. Experts began tracking releases of compounds like hydrogen chloride and dioxins – tiny particles believed to cause cancer even in small quantities.

When the Peekskill plant opened it had relatively simple emission controls – electrostatic precipitators or ESPs – generally considered an effective way to capture small particles like fly ash. But 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act of 1970 established a new standard called MACT or Maximum Achievable Control Technology. According to the EPA “Under MACT standards the technology and work practices in facilities that produce the lowest HAP (hazardous air pollutants) emissions are used to set the standards for the rest of the industry.”

That meant that as new technologies were developed that were more effective at cleaning the gases being released by plants companies like Wheelabrator had a legal obligation to upgrade their equipment. A 1989 Peekskill Herald article covered a protest at the Charles Point plant sponsored by the New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG) with area residents urging the county to not spend millions upgrading the plant but to invest more in recycling.





For this article Wheelabrator told the Herald that during a 1999 upgrade they installed spray dryer absorbers and fabric filters carbon injection and urea injection for NOx control. According to a 2011 case study by Governmental Advisory Associates (GAA) the retrofit cost $75 million with the Westchester IDA covering $64 million and Wheelabrator covering the $8 million balance.

While it’s certain the plant produces less emissions today than it did before the retrofit according to the EPA it is still a significant polluter.

NOx-ious Gases

The most recent emissions data we were able to obtain was from the 2017 National Emissions Inventory (NEI). It’s a comprehensive inventory of virtually all known US air pollution sources (both mobile sources like planes ships cars and trucks; and point source emitters such as airports factories power plants and incinerators). A new NEI is issued every three years but updates to the previous NEI are made regularly. The 2020 NEI is still in development and hasn’t yet been released.

In creating the Emission Facts graphic below the Herald examined all of the EPA’s 2017 NEI emission values for Wheelabrator Westchester and included the most significant releases. To the best of our understanding all of the releases were within the legal allowable limits set by the EPA and the Clean Air Act.

According to the EPA’s “Green Book” which tracks air quality based on the measured amount of CAPs on a county level Westchester County’s air is currently below maximum thresholds for carbon monoxide lead nitrogen dioxide particle pollution (PM10 and PM2.5) and sulfur dioxide. But the county (along with Chautauqua Rockland Nassau Suffolk and the five boroughs of NYC) has failed to meet minimum standards for ozone pollution over the last several years. According to the EPA “Tropospheric or ground level ozone is not emitted directly into the air but is created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). This happens when pollutants emitted by cars power plants industrial boilers refineries chemical plants and other sources chemically react in the presence of sunlight.”

Looking closer at the EPA data for Westchester County the waste disposal sector accounts for around 9.5% of all NOx emissions annually – and Wheelabrator Westchester contributes over 94% of that amount. The 1046 tons of nitrous oxides it released in 2017 represents just under 9% of the county’s annual total NOx emitted from all sources. Combine that with the VOCs – produced mainly by the use of fossil fuels as well as natural sources like trees – and you’ve got a recipe for high ozone levels and poor air quality especially in the summer.



Wheelabrator’s Peekskill facility is a heavy-hitter when it comes to NOx emissions statewide too: in the 2017 NEI the Charles Point plant ranked fourth in New York State after JFK Airport; the RED-Rochester power plant upstate (which has since replaced its coal-fired boilers with natural gas); and Covanta’s waste-to-energy plant in Hempstead Long Island.

It should be noted that the plant’s 2016 permit renewal (which runs through December 2021) allows up to 1066 tons of NOx emissions annually. The 2017 NOx release falls within that limit.



Emission Facts

When it comes to other air pollutants Wheelabrator is one of several contributors in the Peekskill area including the BASF plant less than a half-mile away; and the LaFarge Gypsum plant that manufactures drywall for construction just a mile down the Hudson River shoreline in Buchanan.

For most measured compounds besides nitrous oxides Wheelabrator is a minor contributor. For example in the PM2.5 category (fine inhalable particulate matter 2.5 microns and smaller) at just under eight tons released Wheelabrator didn’t even make the top 50 offenders for New York State in 2017. This at odds with a statistic presented in a November 2020 Tishman Environment and Design Center document claiming that “In 2017 Wheelabrator Westchester was the largest emitter of PM2.5 emitting 15911.15 lbs” According to the NEI Wheelabrator’s seven tons was dwarfed by nine other NY State plants each emitting over 100 tons apiece.

One exception at Wheelabrator Westchester is its output of benzo[a]pyrene a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and known carcinogen that according to Wikipedia “can be found in coal tar tobacco smoke and many foods especially grilled meats.” This is one of the things in cigarettes that makes them cause lung cancer and also the reason you’re not supposed to eat the burnt ends from your weekend barbecue.

The Peekskill incinerator ranked third in the state for emissions of benzo[a]pyrene in 2017 just below the waste-to-energy incinerators in Hempstead and Niagara Falls with 164.6 lbs of the stuff emitted. After the three incinerators nobody else was even close – the next-worst offender International Paper in Ticonderoga released just two pounds of BaP. That said we suspect the 2017 numbers were an aberration: in earlier NEIs from 2008 2011 and 2014 the plant reported outputs of less than a pound a year.

The plant also reported significant (but legally allowable) releases of toxic metals such as mercury cadmium and lead in the four available NEIs.

River Impacts

Like most power plants of its vintage waste-to-energy plants like Wheelabrator were almost always built on the shoreline of a river lake or other body of water. That provides the operation a cheap dependable source of cool water to condense the heated boiler water and produce steam.

We asked Wheelabrator about how the plant impacts the Hudson River in Peekskill and they explained “We draw water in from the Hudson River to cool down the steam from our turbine generator. Following a well-regulated process that establishes guidelines for temperature and volume the water is then returned to the river through a permitted diffuser designed to minimize impacts on the river.”

Dan Shapley of Riverkeeper (an environmental advocacy organization whose main focus is on the health of the Hudson River) provided the Herald with a publicly-available copy of the NY State DEC permit that covers this aspect of the plant’s operation allowing Wheelabrator to intake and expel Hudson River water for cooling. Under the Clean Water Act explained Shapley such permits are supposed to be reviewed every five years – with stricter standards each time to ensure that environmental impacts are reduced over time. But according to what’s publicly available via the DEC’s website Wheelabrator’s permit for the Peekskill operation appears to date back to 1995. The permit is current and valid having been renewed most recently in December 2020 for another five years. But there’s no evidence of any changes or stricter standards implemented since 1995.

The plant’s DEC permit allows the intake of up to 55 million gallons per day of Hudson River water (which is a lot but pales in comparison to Indian Point’s 2.5 billion gallons per day). According to Shapley this sort of intake – especially if the plant isn’t using the most advanced mitigation equipment – typically results in the death of any fish or other aquatic life that gets sucked in by the plant’s water pump. Other larger power plants on the Hudson have been required to install equipment to reduce their impacts in recent decades.





It’s unclear what if any improvements have been made to the plant’s intake systems over the years but based on language in the 1995 permit it doesn’t appear that the plant is currently required to provide any mitigation to protect the aquatic life of the Hudson River.

The river water passes through heat exchangers cooling the plant’s superheated boiler water to produce the high-pressure steam that drives the plant’s generator. In the process the cool river water absorbs some of the heat. Wheelabrator is allowed to return water to the river that’s as hot as 105º F (93.2º F in May and June) – significantly warmer than the river’s natural water temperature which averages in the lower 40’s in the winter and reaches as high the mid-80s in summer. Per Shapley this too has detrimental effects on the river’s ecosystem disrupting the natural environment for aquatic plants and animals.



What’s In It for Peekskill?

According to the city’s 2019 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) Wheelabrator Westchester paid the City of Peekskill $5729068 in payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTs) for their Louisa Street operation. They pay a PILOT rather than traditional property taxes in part because the land on which the plant stands actually belongs to the City of Peekskill Industrial Development Agency (IDA). But PILOTs also are also often used as a financial incentive to lure new businesses and developments: in Wheelabrator’s case the 2019 property tax bill on the plant would have been $12657098; with the tax abatement created by the PILOT Wheelabrator saves nearly $7 million per year.

During the January 26th meeting of the Peekskill IDA it was mentioned that the land at 3 John Walsh Boulevard (the parcel on which Wheelabrator sits) has been carrying an assessed valuation of only $250000 since the early 1980s. The IDA recently had the parcel re-assessed by an independent assessor who valued the property at $10.25 million.



The PILOT is earmarked to support local public schools; around 64% of the annual revenue ($3647022) goes to the Peekskill City School District with the remaining 36% ($2082046) flowing into Hendrick Hudson’s school budget (a portion of the plant lies within the HenHud district). Peekskill’s portion represents about 3.8% of its annual school budget.

It’s unclear why HenHud receives such a significant percentage of PILOT funds from a business that’s fully within Peekskill’s borders. In contrast the Buchanan-centric district funds a third of its budget from a $24 million annual Indian Point Energy Center PILOT – a source from which Peekskill receives nothing. A long time Peekskill resident speculated that the Hendrick Hudson district may have encompassed more of the plant when it was first opened and the borders may have been redrawn in the intervening years.





Energy Justice

Some environmental justice organizations like Energy Justice Network and GAIA believe municipal waste incinerators like Wheelabrator Westchester are destructive relics that should have been retired years ago. At a recent meeting of Peekskill’s Conservation Advisory Committee Energy Justice Network’s Mike Ewall Paul Presendieu and Dante Swinton presented a number of statistics to support their case:

No new municipal solid waste incinerators have been built in the US in 30 years

The average waste-to-energy plant’s retirement age is around 23 years; Wheelabrator Westchester is now 36 years old.

WW’s 10 year contract extension in 2019 means that by 2029 it will be the oldest such operating facility in the US

GAIA a “worldwide alliance of more than 800 grassroots groups non-governmental organizations and individuals in over 90 countries” that advocates for a “zero waste” future has published dozens of fact sheets that seek to refute the idea that municipal waste incineration is a sustainable long-term fix for what they term an “extractive economy”. Their recent report “Failing Incinerators” says that incinerators emit 68% more greenhouse gases per unit of energy produced than coal-fired power plants and also states that approximately eight out of ten US incinerators are located in so-called “environmental justice” communities.

Environmental Justice communities are defined as communities most impacted by environmental harms and risks and generally are areas where negative environmental factors such as pollution intersect with at-risk communities such as the poor minorities and indigenous populations to result in a local population that is often “overburdened” by the combination. One frequent result is higher-than-average health disparities.

Much of Peekskill has been designated a “Potential Environmental Justice Area” by the New York State DEC’s Office of Environmental Justice making those neighborhoods eligible for certain grants and environmental improvement programs.

For Vanessa Agudelo a Peekskill Common Council member and social justice advocate there’s no debate. “Peekskill’s financial gain over the years does not come close to the deadly health and environmental impacts our residents have to live with because of this facility” said Agudelo in an email to the Herald. “As the number one polluter in all of Westchester County by six times this incinerator has greatly contributed to Peekskill’s alarmingly high rates of asthma and infant mortality shockingly disproportionate to that of the rest of the county. Our communities do not need more garbage incinerators. What we need are programs and incentives that promote composting and recycling and substantially scale back the amount of waste produced so that no other community has to suffer from the detrimental long-term effects caused by these harmful facilities.”

What are the Alternatives?

Most agree that burning trash while perhaps in some ways is better than alternatives like landfilling is still not an ideal long-term solution. But what are the alternatives?

The US EPA has published a “Waste Management Hierarchy” – an inverted pyramid that’s sort of a ‘Maslov’s Hierarchy of Trash’. At the top (“Most Desirable”) the largest area is SOURCE REDUCTION (effectively “stop producing things destined to become garbage”) – suggesting that we need a fundamental shift in thinking to solve our waste problem. Next is RECYCLING. Squarely in the middle is ENERGY RECOVERY – which is Wheelabrator’s model. Then TREATMENT – per the EPA “Prior to disposal treatment can help reduce the volume and toxicity of waste.Treatments can be physical (e.g. shredding) chemical (e.g. incineration) and biological (e.g. anaerobic digester)” and finally (least amount least desirable) DISPOSAL which the EPA says usually means putting the remaining waste in “well-engineered monitored” landfills.

Westchester County has made progress in moving some of its waste up the pyramid to source reduction and recycling over the last thirty years. In 1987 the Peekskill Resco plant (as it was called at the time) took in 501581 tons of trash from the 36 communities in the county refuse district. In the last few years that total has been reduced by about 25% while the percentage of county waste that gets recycled has eclipsed 50% of the county’s total waste stream.

Bury or Burn?

Wheelabrator believes waste-to-energy is still the best available option telling the Herald

“The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under multiple administrations has made clear in its waste hierarchy that converting waste to energy is preferable to landfilling. Waste to energy reduces greenhouse gases by approximately one ton for every three tons of waste processed versus landfilling. At the same time waste to energy produces baseload renewable electricity while offsetting the need from energy from fossil fuel sources such as oil coal and natural gas. In addition to the U.S. EPA numerous international governments NGOs and researchers recognize the climate benefits of waste to energy including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) the World Economic Forum the European Union CalRecycle the Center for American Progress and Third Way.”

Indeed most landfills are significant sources of greenhouse gases. Landfills account for 11% of global methane emissions and US landfills give off nearly three times more methane (143 million tons in 2010) than the second-worst offender China. US landfills release a similar amount of CO2 each year as well.

According to the IPCC methane is 28 times as potent as CO2 when it comes to warming the planet over a hundred-year window – and 84 times more powerful when considered over twenty years (methane dissipates after a dozen years or so). So capturing methane from landfills is critical – so much so that the EPA requires operators of very large municipal solid waste facilities to capture their so-called “landfill gasses”.

The former Croton Point Landfill – which Wheelabrator Westchester’s operation effectively replaced – was capturing a million cubic feet of methane per day when it was capped in the mid 1990s. A pilot project to convert the gas to electricity and fuel for park vehicles was apparently scrapped in 1997; today the methane is “flared” or burned off to remove most of the VOCs.

But the methane capture program at Staten Island’s Fresh Kills landfill (now Freshkills Park) produces 1.5 million cubic feet of natural gas per day which is sold by NYC to National Grid and used by Staten Island residents for cooking and heating.



A perhaps less easily-solved problem with landfills is leachate or water that’s percolated through the buried waste often picking up pollutants and toxins along the way. “Modern well-engineered” landfills (as the industry often refers to them) have a composite liner of clay and plastic membrane beneath them to reduce the flow of leachate into nearby ground water. But the EPA admitted in 1988 that “even the best liner and leachate collection system will ultimately fail due to natural deterioration.” Those liners are the main reason retired landfills are seldom covered with trees: the risk of deep roots penetrating the protective liners and causing leachate leaks is too grea

Other arguments in favor of incinerating solid waste versus landfilling are less technical: landfills devour huge areas of open space often in relatively unspoiled remote areas where land is cheap and population density is low. Incineration reduces the volume of trash by 90% or more versus straight landfilling reducing the acreage needed. And as more and more urban and suburban landfills reach capacity or are closed due to environmental regulations (or political will) municipal waste often has to be trucked for hundreds of miles from its urban sources. This often adds more trucks to both interstate highways and rural routes increasing our carbon footprint while degrading our physical environment.

Low-Hanging Fruit

According to a 2020 county-commissioned study “It is estimated that Westchester County disposes approximately 103000 and 85000 tons of food waste per year from the commercial and residential sector respectively. The combined amount of 188000 ton/year represents the total food waste that is potentially available for processing and recycling in the County.” Food waste is a unique portion of the solid waste stream because it can be composted or anaerobically digested to break it down reduce its volume and create valuable natural fertilizer. That makes it low-hanging fruit in the effort to reduce the amount of waste being incinerated at Wheelabrator.





In December Westchester County Executive George Latimer broke ground on “CompostEd” – a “small-scale food scrap composting demonstration and education site” in Valhalla. CompostEd is designed to promote composting and food scrap recycling by county residents. Meanwhile in January the county completed a comprehensive study for a proposed county-wide food waste recycling program. The study looked at a range of options for collecting transporting and “digesting” residential food waste in enclosed anaerobic digesters located within the county.

The report has some elements that are strikingly reminiscent of the 1970s saga that began with a court order to close the county’s Croton Point Dump – and ended with the opening of Peekskill’s Wheelabrator plant. In 2019 New York State passed the Food Donation and Food Scraps Recycling Act mandating that by January 1 2022 virtually all businesses that generate an average two tons or more of wasted food per week must donate all edible excess food and recycle the remainder “if they are within 25 miles of an organics recycler (composting facility anaerobic digester etc.)”





Among the report’s mid-term recommendations is a potential digester to be co-located at either the Wheelabrator plant or Westchester’s water treatment plant – both located in Peekskill. Either option would likely divert up to 10000 tons of food waste from the Peekskill incinerator in as soon as three years. Longer-term the county plans to build a dedicated anaerobic digester likely “through a public-private partnership” – with a likely location near the Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla. The dedicated digester facility could eventually handle up to 80000 tons of food waste per year.

A pilot program is already underway to test the viability of collecting and digesting residential food scraps in Westchester. Peekskill recently joined the county’s Intermunicipal Agreement allowing the city to take part in the county’s Residential Food Scrap Transportation and Disposal program. The Conservation Advisory Council is working with the city to finalize the details which would begin with one or more centralized drop-off locations and could eventually include curbside pickup. In the meantime Peekskill’s CAC is also cosponsoring a program with the Greenburgh Nature Center to offer discounted backyard composters to city residents.

Separate from the county’s plans CRP Sanitation has proposed to build a “source-separated organic composting” facility at 2 Bayview Road just over the Peekskill city line on Roa Hook in Cortlandt. When complete the facility will be able to receive up to 5000 cubic yards of food waste per year to be mixed with “tree debris” i.e. shrubs branches trunks etc. collected by Cortlandt’s DPW. The mixture will be “anaerobically static-pile composted” to create mature compost for use as household fertilizer. Residents will be able to sign up to contribute food scraps and in return receive a certain amount of compost for their own use.



How Else Can We Reduce Our Waste?

Even if every bit of food waste in Westchester county was anaerobically digested or composted and every recyclable item were recycled that would still leave several hundred tons of solid waste per year in need of disposal.

Groups like GAIA promote “Zero Waste” a concept of dramatic overall waste reduction that focuses on “reducing consumption and discards” reuse of products and raw materials and “producer accountability”. Already sellers of items like electronics and car tires often are required to account for the recycling of those items.

Others are concerned with making sure items can be repaired when they break. The “right to repair” movement aims to prevent product manufacturers from restricting consumers’ ability to fix things rather than toss them. When is the last time you had a home appliance or electronic device repaired? Consumer goods have become so inexpensive to purchase – and so difficult to repair – that we’ve gotten used to just putting them at the curb as soon as they stop working and ordering a replacement from Amazon. The model of “planned obsolescence” is a major source of household waste these days.



Another significant part of today’s waste stream is textiles. The “fast fashion” trend of the past twenty years has caused a doubling of the amount of textiles we produce annually from 9.5 million tons in 2000 to over 17 million tons by 2018. Over 66% of that amount was landfilled representing 5.8% of US municipal solid waste that year. The same year 3.2 million tons of textiles were incinerated at waste-to-energy facilities; only 2.5 million tons were recycled.

Aside from just purchasing higher-quality longer-lasting clothing consumers can donate used clothing to charities (though even Goodwill landfills around 11% of donations); sell or give unwanted items to second hand stores; or take last year’s fashions to any of a number of recycling collection points catalogued here by the New York State Association for Reduction Reuse and Recycling (NYSAR).

What’s the Future of Wheelabrator Westchester?

In 2019 Westchester County renewed its agreement with Wheelabrator Industries to operate the Charles Point incinerator through 2029. As mentioned earlier in this piece that would make Wheelabrator Westchester perhaps the oldest continuously-operating waste-to-energy plant in the US.

The Herald spoke to Peekskill Common Council member Dwight Douglas who was Deputy Director of the city’s Planning and Development Department as the Resco plant opened in 1984. We asked him if he thought Wheelabrator would still be around at the end of this decade.

“I was a rookie housing specialist at the time the Resco agreement was done but had moved up to deputy director by the time it opened and the excess 45 acres or so were turned over to the city for redevelopment…now known as Charles Point Industrial Park” said Douglas. “I worked extensively with my colleagues in the department in turning this land into commercial and industrial uses which generate jobs and taxes.”

“I am not up on the technology which would allow us to close the plant. There has been a lot of focus on recycling and composting and cutting down on waste but that still leaves a stream of material to be disposed of and I have no idea how that might feasibly be accomplished with the plant gone. As long as the plant can’t be replaced the focus should be on using the latest tech to clean the air as it is emitted up the stack.”

But other Peekskill residents aren’t so sure. “It’s an urgent situation – not only because our health is being harmed but because the plant is 36 years old and most incinerators are retired after 23 years” said Conservation Advisory Council member Courtney Williams. “This plant is unlikely to survive to complete its contract with the county as it would be tied for the oldest incinerator in the nation if it does. I think we are at the beginning of a concerted county-wide effort to get Wheelabrator shut down – and put in place the processes necessary to to deal properly with our waste stream.”

Next week’s Herald will follow Peekskill’s recyclables from the curb to their ultimate destinations.

(AFP Photo)

Plastic consumption has exploded over the years. This has caused plastic waste production worldwide to steadily increased by 10 million metric tons every year in the last 10 years to reach almost 360 million metric tons in 2018.

The plastic crisis is one of the greatest challenges facing planet earth. According to the Center For International Environment Law (CIEL) up to 12 million tonnes of plastics leak into the oceans annually severely harming biodiversity and killing marine species.

More than 95 percent of global annual plastic waste and microplastics stay on land – which create an expensive waste management burden and social and economic crises for local communities.

The overwhelming amount of plastic waste has now opened doors to criminal networks.

France-based intergovernmental crime-fighting agency Interpol stated that global plastic waste management has found an alarming increase in the illegal plastic pollution trade across the world since 2018.

A 2020 published report titled “Interpol’s strategical analysis on emerging criminal trends in the global plastic waste market since January 2018” revealed that there has been a significant increase over the past two years in illegal waste shipments mainly rerouted to Southeast Asia via multiple transit countries to camouflage the origin of the waste shipment.

Other findings include an increase in illegal waste fires and landfills in Europe and Asia a rise in the use of counterfeit documents and fraudulent waste registrations.

Waste Exports

Some countries especially high-income ones have imposed regulations encouraging the recycling of plastic waste. They have made large investments in recycling and have mature waste treatment infrastructure that allows for collecting and sorting out plastic waste.

However it has also spurred corrupt operators to cash in on an industry that is difficult to police.

“Waste crime is a rising threat with roots in a more fundamental problem: the inability to manage our plastic use and production. We are witnessing the impacts of plastic pollution on marine ecosystems and now the criminal implications of it. Systemic change and greater accountability are the only way to tackle a crisis that transcends national borders” said Eirik Lindebjerg Global Plastics Policy Manager of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

From 1992 to 2018 China imported a cumulative 45 percent of the world’s plastic waste. During that period of time the global plastic waste market was dependent on access to the Chinese recycling sector. However following China’s move to restrict plastic waste imports in 2018 the re-routing of shipments has overwhelmed alternative countries opening the doors for opportunistic crime as noted by the WWF.

Europe and North America are believed to divert most of their plastic waste exports to Cambodia India Indonesia Malaysia Pakistan Vietnam and Thailand. Whereas Australia and New Zealand have increased their waste exports to other Asian countries such as Malaysia while Japan has increased its waste exports to Thailand.

Developing countries especially those with limited waste management and enforcement capacities are increasingly targeted.

Source: Various

As regulations on waste imports are continuously changing and are not standardised across destination countries; exporters and enforcers face challenges in ensuring that plastic waste exports comply with import regulations noted Interpol.

As a result paired with the lack of traceability of plastic waste – individuals or crime groups could take advantage of loopholes information gaps and new trade routes in the plastic waste market that are not entirely monitored.

Recommendations

Following Interpol’s report about increased illegal shipments and criminal activities across global plastic waste trade routes the WWF has issued a call for global cooperation to address the issue.

Some of the recommendations suggested by the WWF in an international response by governments include; accelerating negotiations for a global legally binding agreement with clear national plans and regulations reinforcing existing mechanisms such as phasing out single use plastics and addressing gaps in waste management in economies innovating and scaling up environmentally sound alternatives to plastic and lastly – investing in research and capacity building for enhanced monitoring and enforcement of plastic waste.

Minnesota is no longer the organizational heart that it was after former Norwest CEO Dick Kovacevich moved from Minneapolis to San Francisco in 1999 to become CEO of the merged bank-holding company that took the Wells Fargo name and California headquarters.

Wells Fargo under its third CEO in five years seems to have put behind it billions in fines and years of damage to its reputation that dimmed its star and capped growth and left Minnesota a declining regional hub.

Wells Fargo last week posted a strong $4.75 billion profit in the first quarter. And its stock price which peaked over $50 per share in 2018 when the worst emerged about its fake-accounts scandal has risen from under $20 per share a year ago to over $40 lately.

""I am confident that we are making progress though it is not always in a straight line"" Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf told investors and analysts last week.

Scharf 55 is a New York-based banker a protégé of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon whose single-most important hire may have been Bill Daley vice chairman of public affairs who followed Scharf from New York-based BNY Mellon to Wells. Daley a lawyer who also once worked for Dimon is a former federal official and chief of staff to ex-President Barack Obama. He led Scharf's two-year quest to end Wells Fargo's legal and political problems.

""Nobody is better wired than Bill Daley"" said Jim Campbell Minnesota CEO of Norwest-Wells Fargo until his 2002 retirement. ""He's in New York with Charlie. Let's face it. … Charlie has basically moved the heartbeat of the Wells Fargo enterprise to New York. That's where the major banks are headquartered.""

Wells Fargo which also has a regional hub in Charlotte N.C. is starting to get traction on its recovery.

In Minnesota Wells Fargo since 2018 has been led by Laurie Nordquist who has the titles of CEO in Minnesota and president of the company's Central States region.

Wells Fargo is the second-largest bank in the state with nearly $72 billion in deposits trailing only Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp.

Nordquist has a mandate to increase Wells Fargo's visibility.

""We are going to focus on affordable housing minority small businesses specifically and small business generally and the financial health of our customers and communities"" Nordquist said in an interview.

""We will be part of significant and positive change. Our team member involvement is as important as our dollars.""

Wells Fargo employment in Minnesota has declined from about 20000 to 18000 over the last decade amid its problems but also reflects a streamlining in financial services focused on electronic banking and fewer branch offices.

Yet Wells Fargo also this month announced plans to redevelop its 2020-destroyed office at Lake Street and Nicollet Avenue into a $50 million-plus 200-home housing project including a smaller branch office at a 2.5-acre site that was mostly a parking lot and a drive-through bank.

It's a working-class neighborhood including immigrant and minority entrepreneurs that needs housing. And it may mark better days ahead for Wells Fargo in the Twin Cities.

Nordquist a native of Elbow Lake Minn. and graduate of St. Olaf College noted that Wells Fargo opened a new regional headquarters campus on the east side of downtown in 2016 and made $7 million in ""diverse community capital grants"" to Twin Cities nonprofits in recent years.

Most recently Wells Fargo said it would refund nationally the $420 million it has made for processing SBA payroll-protection loans in 2020.

The first $112 million has been disbursed including $9 million to Twin Cities-area minority-business counselor-lenders such as Meda African Economic Development Solutions Neighborhood Development Center and WomenVenture.

They take fledgling capital-light entrepreneurs and help the most promising grow until they are bankable by traditional lenders.

Twenty years ago Kovacevich sensitive to public perception when he agreed to move the combined Norwest-Wells Fargo headquarters to San Francisco essentially gave Campbell about $280 million to buy renovate and expand the abandoned Honeywell campus into a Wells Fargo regional mortgage campus. Local employment skyrocketed.

Campbell his successor and Kovacevich proved at least for a decade that you could lose your national headquarters to a merger but still grow locally.

A lot of Twin Citians thought Wells Fargo was still based here which is just what Campbell and his colleagues hoped.

Something smells phishy

Security firm Check Point Research just released its latest Brand Phishing Report detailing which companies have been most imitated in the first quarter of this year.

“Two banking brands — Wells Fargo and Chase — are now in the top 10 list as hackers have shifted to capitalize on people filing taxes fielding stimulus checks and ordering home deliveries” the firm said in an email.

“The report goes on to provide two visual examples of an impersonation hackers made of Wells Fargo and DHL. Lastly Microsoft topped the list two quarters in a row as hackers continue to focus on remote workers.”

About 39% of these phishing attempts were related to Microsoft with more remote workers being targeted during the pandemic. Another 18% refer to DHL as people are increasingly reliant on home deliveries. Wells Fargo and Chase join the list as digital payments become more commonplace giving scammers more opportunities to exploit potential victims.

Two common methods of luring victims are malicious files and fake websites. You might receive a message saying you need to download a file to retrieve a package from DHL for example. A link in an email can take you to a spoofed site that looks just like the Wells Fargo website complete with login fields.

Protect yourself

Here are some tips to avoid phishing schemes:

Don’t open any links or attachments from unsolicited emails.

If you don’t know who the sender is avoid the email altogether. Even if it’s a known brand think of your association with it before taking any actions. Why would Chase send you an email when you don’t even bank with them for example.

Keep an eye out for poor spelling and grammar. These are dead giveaways that the sender is not legitimate.

Be very careful about who you share your personal and financial information with.

Before long however the visiting Washington Capitals would be marching off Wells Fargo Center ice with a 6-3 victory in tow as the Flyers made another positive step toward their NHL Draft Lottery fate.

Hayes relayed a perfect pass on the Claude Giroux to Allison who looked like a seasoned veteran on the play. On a team that needs to look toward the future Allison might eventually play a significant role.

“I’m going to have to go out and buy Hayesy a dinner” said Allison playing just his second NHL game. “Because it doesn’t get much easier than that one.”

Flyers forward Oskar Lindblom would love to share a little more of his survivor story to others stricken with cancer.

But with the season winding down Lindblom knows the best he can do right now is stand front and center when the Flyers roll out their Hockey Fights Cancer tribute Sunday night at Wells Fargo Center.

From the collector player warmup jerseys and special edition sticks to be auctioned off the proceeds benefiting local cancer initiatives to the towel giveaway and some words from Lindblom the Flyers have it covered courageously and sensitively as only they can do.

Even the opponent Sunday the Islanders will feel the emotion before they take the ice as it will be obvious how much the backing of the Flyers has helped Lindblom battle through to the other side.

“It meant everything especially at the start” said of the Flyers’ support. “I had a tough time to just live my normal life and stay positive. I can’t thank them enough for what they’ve done for me.

“As long as I can spread the word just a little bit and help some people I’m happy to do it.”

Cindy Stutman the senior vice president of business operations and executive director of Flyers Charities can’t wait for the ceremonies to begin.

“This year for sure it’s a lot more personal” Stutman said on a videoconference call. “Oskar has been successful in overcoming Ewing’s sarcoma and we’re real excited to make him a big part of the celebration because of the great news he’s gotten staying cancer free. It’s going to be a great night.”

""At the moment BlackRock is a major part of the problem"" said Robin Wells an English teacher and activist with Fossil Free London who joined the U.K. city's demonstration in a statement from the global network BlackRock's Big Problem.

""Today we're giving notice that we'll be watching to see if BlackRock will actually pour any water on the flames it has started"" Wells said. ""We're here because we can't fix our planet with promises only action can do that.""

In addition to London activists demonstrated at BlackRock offices in Boston Dallas Miami New York City San Francisco and Zurich.

""CEO Larry Fink talks a big game on climate but the company is the top investor in oil gas and coal"" noted Patrick Houston of New York Communities for Change. ""As the season of shareholder annual meetings looms all eyes are on BlackRock.""

As BlackRock's Big Problem details on a webpage about this year's shareholder season:

In BlackRock's 2021 Stewardship Expectations report the asset manager finally acknowledged that voting against management and supporting shareholder proposals often leads to positive changes at companies. In January 2021 BlackRock expanded its voting criteria and announced that it will hold directors accountable when their companies fail to address climate change in their business plans. In March both BlackRock and Vanguard joined the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative a first move on climate for Vanguard. While acknowledgments and commitments may mark a change in thinking within BlackRock and Vanguard it is action that is needed to curb the climate crisis. So this shareholder season as the world looks toward COP26 their default position must be to vote in favor of pro-climate shareholder resolutions and against corporate boards when a company doesn't have a clear climate transition plan.

The network is focused on eight specific votes. In the oil and gas sector there will votes on resolutions for BP and Shell to set public targets consistent with the goals of the Paris agreement and against ExxonMobil chairman and CEO Darren Woods as well as lead independent director Kenneth C. Frazier for failing to implement plans consistent with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5oC the more ambitious Paris goal.

There are similar plans for financial services--votes on resolutions for Barclays and MUFG to set Paris-related targets and against Wells Fargo chairman Charles H. Noski for failing to implement plans consistent with the 1.5oC goal. There will also be a similar vote against Duke chair and CEO Lynn Good as well as independent lead director Michael G. Browning. Activists are also pushing for a resolution requesting Bunge issue a report about eliminating deforestation in its soy supply chain.

""At this point voting with corporate management to maintain business as usual is an active choice against climate action"" the network says. ""If asset managers continue to choose not to vote for climate action this shareholder season they will be actively working against progress science and the interests of their own clients and beneficiaries.""

While protesters aimed to raise awareness about the upcoming votes some also directed attention to the controversial Line 3 pipeline which opponents have dubbed ""a climate time bomb."" The Canadian company Enbridge is trying to replace a corroding pipeline with a larger one that would carry oil from Alberta through North Dakota and Minnesota to Wisconsin. Construction on the project has been repeatedly halted in recent months by water protectors' direct actions in Minnesota.

""My heritage is of a people whose rights were violently violated. My future is of a planet whose climate is being devastatingly altered. BlackRock should wield its vast financial power to mitigate the climate crisis"" declared 19-year-old climate justice activist Xiye Bastida of the Otomi-Toltec Nation. ""It can start by divesting from Enbridge the owner of the Line 3 pipeline before moving to divest from all tar sands.""

Last month Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) questioned Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on why the federal government hasn't deemed BlackRock ""too big to fail"" and subjected the firm to stricter oversight. The senator said during a hearing that ""it isn't just banks that pose a risk to the economy. In 2008 two investment companies Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers failed triggering the 2008 crash.""

The Biden administration faces mounting pressure to protect U.S. financial institutions and the economy from risks posed by the climate emergency as well as demands that the administration help end the flow of private finance from Wall Street to major polluters. Polling results released Monday show that a majority of U.S. voters support federal government action to prevent future climate-related economic crises.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vZWFybmluZ3MtY2FsZW5kYXItZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrLW9mLWFwcmlsLTE5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings calendar for the week of April 19,"The market rally gathered pace this week amid impressive quarterly results led by the banking sector and positive economic data. Leading stock indexes continued their winning streak with S&P 500 maintaining the uptrend for the fourth week in a row and hitting a new high.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 34000-mark for the first time adding around 150 points in the last session. The sentiment was buoyed by encouraging retail sales data and reports of jobless claims falling.

The first-quarter earnings season got off to a good start with banking giants JPMorgan Chase Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs unveiling their latest financial data mid-week. They were joined by software firm Infosys on Wednesday.

The spotlight stayed on financial services Thursday also when the closely followed reports of Citigroup and Bank of America came out. Delta Air Lines and soft-drink behemoth PepsiCo released earnings on the same day. The first phase of bank earnings concluded on Friday with Morgan Stanley’s blockbuster Q1 report.

It’s going to be mixed bag next week. For instance the companies scheduled to report on April 19 include United Airlines Holdings IBM and Coca-Cola. The important corporate houses preparing to report on April 20 comprise Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson as well as streaming giant Netflix which has been thriving on the COVID-driven boom. The earning reports of superbike company Harley-Davidson and Lockheed Martin are also slated for Tuesday.

The other major companies that can elicit investor interest include Halliburton Verizon Communications Chipotle Mexican Grill and Kinder Morgan – the companies will report earnings on April 21. The next day it is the turn of American Airlines and Southwest Airlines as well as tech firms AT&T and Intel. American Express is probably the only big player to report on April 23.

The market was abuzz with the news of Microsoft’s $20-billion buyout of cloud software company Nuance Communications. In another important deal in the cloud space Datadog completed the acquisition of the SaaS-based security platform Sqreen.

The otherwise quiet M&A market witnessed Dell Technologies becoming two standalone public companies by spinning off its 81% ownership in VMware. The other major deals include Amgen’s $2-billion purchase of Five Prime Therapeutics and the acquisition of Upchain by software firm Autodesk.

So business is booming.,"West Pharmaceutical Services Inc. based in Exton says it is the world's largest manufacturer of rubber stoppers used to seal vials of vaccines and other injectable medicines. The company does not disclose the names of specific customers but the company's CEO said West is ""involved with basically all the vaccines that are in the market."" Here vials of COVID-19 vaccine thaw before a vaccination clinic at the Skippack Fire Co. in Skippack Pa. in February. Read more

West Pharmaceutical Services Inc. is a Philadelphia-area company that most people have never heard of but more often than not one of its products is involved whenever someone gets a COVID-19 vaccine shot.

That’s because West’s leading products are rubber stoppers for vials that hold injectable medicines and rubber tips for syringe plungers. Even before the pandemic the Exton company one of many in the region that serve the pharmaceutical industry manufactured more than 40 billion of those and other components each year.

But now demand has skyrocketed along with the push to vaccinate billions of people around the world against COVID-19 — to the point that the firm expects to generate $260 million in revenue this year just from COVID-19-related products. Last year’s overall revenue was $2.1 billion.

“We’re involved with basically all the vaccines that are in the market” said Eric Green West’s chief executive.

West is among the Philadelphia-area companies playing a background role in the massive rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. PCI Pharma Services in Northeast Philadelphia labels and repackages vials of vaccine that are likely sealed with West stoppers. In Montgomery County Merck & Co. Inc. announced in March that it would help manufacture Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine which has suffered manufacturing issues elsewhere and has been put on hold while the government sorts out blood-clot concerns.

Because of the increased demand West is adding enough new equipment at factories in upstate Pennsylvania and North Carolina to double the company’s capacity for products used with vaccines. The first of the new machines — presses imported from central Europe that trim the molded plugs — were installed last year.

Additional machines are still being installed in Jersey Shore Pa. and are expected to reach full-scale production in the next few months. Green who wouldn’t say how many machines are being added told Wall Street that the additions were already planned over the next five years but moved up in response to the pandemic.

What’s the big deal about West’s rubber stoppers?

It’s the rubber’s coating which prevents interaction between the vaccine or other medication and the man-made rubber. Without the coating the drug might not work as designed.

“These are not just drop-in-the-box” items said David Bergerstock a West vice president. “These are manufactured in a clean-room environment. They are placed in ultraclean sterilizable bags and in some cases they are steam sterilized.”

Wall Street has rewarded West handsomely for that expertise. The company is worth about $10 billion more than it was at the beginning of the pandemic early last year. Its shares closed Thursday at $310.95 up from about $130 in March 2020.

Even before the pandemic West was doing well financially thanks to its leading position in the manufacturing of devices used to inject biological medicines. These require special care because they are often derived from living materials and are more sensitive to damage than traditional medications that are chemically synthesized.

West has a part in 7 of 10 injections anywhere in the world the company said. “We’re involved with basically all the vaccines that are in the market” Green said.

Green said one customer allows him to identify it and a specific product for which West makes an injector: Amgen’s Repatha which is a treatment for heart disease.

Aptar Stelmi and Datwyler a Swiss company that has a plants in Pennsauken and Middletown Del. are West’s two main competitors. Datwyler recently told a Swiss newspaper that it is the second-biggest producer behind West of stoppers and other components needed for injections.

West which got half of its $2.1 billion in revenue last year from overseas employed 9200 on Dec. 31. Of those employees 1200 are in Pennsylvania including 600 at the Jersey Shore factory where production is exploding. A second factory in Williamsport employs 130. Many of the remaining Pennsylvania employees work at the Exton headquarters or in research and development there.

Most of the new jobs in Jersey Shore are for technicians and operators in the molding trimming and packing areas. Starting pay with no experience is more than $17 an hour West said. The R&D division in Chester County looks for people with professional backgrounds in mechanical or biomedical engineering plastics engineering chemical engineering and material science.

Investment analysts such as John Kreger at William Blair are wrestling with whether to expect a drop in business for West and similar companies after the first big push on COVID-19 vaccines is over. “We suspect there will be a need for ongoing boosters to cover future variants but probably with a lower level of compliance” Kreger wrote in a recent note to clients.

West has deep roots in Philadelphia’s manufacturing past.

An accountant named Herman O. West cofounded it at 1117 Shackamaxon St. in Fishtown in 1923 as a manufacturer of rubber grinding wheels used in the dental trade.

West got the idea to go into manufacturing according to a company history while handling the books for S.S. White Co. a Center City dental instrument manufacturer whose building still stands at 12th and Chestnut Streets. Early on West and his partners manufactured droppers plungers and stoppers for the pharmaceutical industry. Insulin maker Eli Lilly & Co. was a major early customer.

West’s factories have moved away from the company’s Philadelphia roots but it retains an important tie to its manufacturing past. West has been making many of the molds for its stoppers and plungers and the sharp tools that trim them into their final shape in the same company-owned shop on West Chester Pike in Upper Darby since the 1940s.

“It’s fantastic that they are able to maintain that in-house tooling capability” said Bill Stockwell chief executive of Stockwell Elastomerics a Northeast Philadelphia company that works with similar materials as West but serves different sectors.

The 18 employees in West’s Upper Darby shop use high-tech machines to supply tooling for 16 of West’s 25 manufacturing sites said Bergerstock the West official who is the company’s global process engineer. A second shop in England supplies other factories.

“Everything starts with the steel” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vbWFya2V0aW5nL3NwZWFrLXVwLWRvYy1iYXllci1zLWFtaS12b2ljZS1hc3Npc3RhbnQtdGFsa3MtcHJlc2NyaXB0aW9uLWRydWctaW5mby1mb3ItcGh5c2ljaWFuc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Speak up docs: Bayer's 'AMI' voice assistant talks prescription drug info for physicians,"Move over Siri—Bayer’s new virtual voice assistant AMI is here.

AMI pronounced as Amy is Bayer's new voice assistant and chatbot that can talk to physicians about prescription drugs when they say “Hey Google talk to Bayer Pharmaceutical” on Google Home.

An acronym for assistant for medical information AMI is meant to offer quick hands-free and on-demand information for busy healthcare professionals. Doctors can ask about prescribing information and other details for two oncology drugs Nubeqa and Xofigo and three women’s health products Mirena Kyleena and Skyla. Bayer plans to add oncology drug Vitrakvi in two weeks and pulmonary hypertension drug Adempas in May to the voice platform.

Bayer is the first pharma to use voice technology to access medical information through Google Home and Google Assistant the German drugmaker noted.

AMI is also an online chatbot at Bayer’s medical information website—which will be renamed “Ask Med by Bayer” next month—where doctors can type in prescription drug questions. The online chatbot AMI covers Bayer’s full portfolio of products.

RELATED: How might pharma buddy up with Alexa? Bayer Consumer's first interactive voice ad is food for thought

Bayer launched AMI last summer both online and on Google Home. But Bayer spent 2020 focused on building adjusting and shaping up the platform.

Now sales reps and field teams are promoting AMI and encouraging healthcare professionals to log in—or just talk. Bayer created cards to hand out to doctors along with a short animated video that shows them how to access and use the system.

The idea for AMI began with Wagdy Youssef a physician and Bayer senior director of medical communications and medical information.

At home he uses Google Home to control his lights and open and close the garage door but he noticed when he tried asking for specific medical information the voice bot pulled suggestions from random websites—sometimes with incorrect information.

So he approached Bayer's chief medical officer Mike DeVoy in 2019 with the idea—a quick ""elevator pitch"" as he calls it—and DeVoy quickly greenlighted it. He even gave Youssef a book about the development of the voice industry.

Youssef then assembled a team from Bayer's information technology compliance medical governance and his own medical information groups to begin weekly planning meetings. The team developed the two environments—text chatbot and voice assistant—as well as devised ways to meet industry regulations incorporate industry standards and adapt machine learning to fit with AMI.

For instance when a doctor calls up AMI by saying ""Hey"" or ""OK Google"" and the key phrase “Talk to Bayer Pharmaceuticals” it responds with a series of questions asking whether the person is a doctor and if the email account associated with the Google Home account can be used. AMI automatically sends a transcript of the conversation to the email after the chat.

Other issues AMI addresses include privacy—she reminds doctors not to reveal patient information as they talk—and adverse event reporting. The bot tells physicians the platform is not geared for side effect reporting but if a doctor continues to try to submit one AMI will redirect them to the appropriate place.

Bayer is launching AMI only to healthcare providers but Youssef’s team is already exploring how it could interact with consumers with a goal to move there next.

One of the challenges Bayer is working on for consumers is machine learning around voice processing. As Youssef noted medical professionals would likely describe headaches for instance in just a few different ways while consumers might say anything from simply ""headache"" to “my head’s going to explode.”

Bayer Consumer Healthcare recently launched its own voice initiative with Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant. An interactive ad allows consumers to buy an OTC product by talking to the Amazon device. While AMI is confined to the Google Home platform for now it will be possible to add the voice assistant to Alexa when and if Amazon opens up its skills to pharma companies Youssef said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2luZGlhLzctcGhhcm1hLWNvbXBhbmllcy1zbGFzaC1yZW1kZXNpdmlyLXByaWNlL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgyMTI0NTIyLmNtc9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2luZGlhLzctcGhhcm1hLWNvbXBhbmllcy1zbGFzaC1yZW1kZXNpdmlyLXByaWNlL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MjEyNDUyMi5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Covid-19: 7 pharma companies slash Remdesivir price,NEW DELHI: In a relief to Covid-19 patients  pharmaceutical companies manufacturing Remdesivir in India have significantly lowered prices of the drug being given to patients with severe infection in hospitals following government’s intervention last week.The price of Remdesivir has dropped to the range of Rs 899-3490 per 100ml vial from Rs 2800-5400 earlier depending on brands.The seven manufacturers have voluntarily reduced the prices in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.The development assumes significance as Covid-19 cases are rising significantly across the country with large number of severe cases in hospitals needing oxygen and ventilator support.Following concerns about shortage and high price of Remdesivir in the wake of a surge in Covid-19 cases the Centre initially stopped export of the drug to cater to local demand. Besides in a meeting with manufacturers last week the Centre also decided to facilitate fast track approval to companies to ramp up production capacities to make around 78 lakh vials per month double the currently installed capacity of 38.80 lakh vials.The government also negotiated with the manufacturers on pricing as they agreed to voluntarily reduce the price to ensure the medicine is adequately available and accessible to people during the pandemic.However some public health advocates raised concerns about a wide gap in MRP of different brands and urged the government to cap the prices using provisions for emergency situation. Cadila Healthcare Cipla  Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Hetero Labs Jubilant Pharma Mylan and Syngene International are the local manufacturers of the medicine.Cadila Healthcare’s Remdac is the cheapest drug at Rs 899 per vial.Used for treating Ebola the anti-viral drug Remdesivir is an ‘investigation drug’ that has shown efficacy in the treatment of Covid-19 patients. However the government has stressed that it is an ‘investigational drug’ and should be used only in hospital setting for Covid-19 patients on oxygen support. Health officials have strongly prohibited the use of the drug by patients at home.,,,,,,

Visitors can take part in off-road walking treks accompanied by the ever-popular animal the alpaca.

Founded in December 2020 by Fred and Francesca Wade the family run firm launched with the hope of diversifying the tourism offering in the local area and promoting an exciting option for the daily socially distanced walk.

As well as 1:1 start-up advice with a business plan routes to funding company regulations and marketing support Business Gateway signposted co-owner Francesca to a suite of digital training programmes such as Google my Business a platform that drives customer engagement.

As a result of these improvements to their online presence West Coast Alpacas experienced a 60% increase in social media engagement and was fully booked until March 2021.

Renowned for being well trained and gentle animals West Coast Alpacas currently operates with eight of them which share a paddock on site and offers two treks on Saturdays and Sundays around the Inverclyde region. The business hopes to add three more alpacas to its family and run seasonal events throughout 2021 – when it is safe to do so.

Francesca Wade West Coast Alpacas said: “Being lovers of the outdoors we wanted to add something special to our local area. We have such a great community spirit here in Inverclyde and we want to encourage people to explore what's on their doorstep.

“From our first conversations with Business Gateway at the end of 2020 we’ve been able to establish our website and social media presence and in a very short time have developed an effective online booking platform EventSmart where customers can easily book a slot to visit.

“Through a range of webinars Business Gateway has equipped us with the necessary skills to increase our customer-base and signposted us to the wider network to secure financial support from the council.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndlc3Rlcm50ZWxlZ3JhcGguY28udWsvbmV3cy8xOTIzNzkxNS5sbHlzLXktZnJhbi1yZXNlcnZvaXItd2lsbC1wcm92aWRlLWVsZWN0cmljaXR5LTMwMC1ob21lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Llys y Fran reservoir will provide electricity for 300 homes,"A hydroelectric generator creates power from water released from the Pembrokeshire reservoir before it continues its journey down the Afon Syfynwy river.

The larger of two turbines is housed in the valve house inside the dam building at the foot of the dam.

It works by using the potential energy of the water stored in the reservoir and generates energy which is both used on-site and exported to the local grid. Together both turbines produce enough electricity for 300 homes.

Though installed in 1972 the turbine has been refurbished as part of the site’s redevelopment.

Llys-y-Frân reservoir is of great conservation importance and is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a site with a Special Area of Conservation.

A new fleet of boats has been procured with electric engines that are more environmentally friendly than traditional fishing boats powered by expensive unreliable and polluting petrol engines.

The goal is to massively reduce the negative impact of fuel emissions into the air as well as reducing oil pollution into the reservoir to minimise the disturbance of local wildlife habitats including otters.

Llys-y-Frân is due to open later this spring following a £4 million major investment to the visitor centre and recreational facilities backed with £1.7 million of European Regional Development Funds through the Welsh Government.

The redeveloped site hopes to attract an estimated 100000 tourists and outdoor enthusiasts each year to the site.",,,

Sign up for our newsletters to stay up to date on the stories that matter.

With less than seven weeks left in their spring session Illinois lawmakers have yet to put up new ethical guardrails in response to the historic Commonwealth Edison bribery scandal that toppled ex-House Speaker Michael Madigan and led to a series of federal indictments.

Given the nature of Madigan’s dramatic and forced departure meting out some kind of meaningful legislative consequences for the powerful utility company’s misconduct would be a logical response for Illinois lawmakers this spring.

A pair of potential rewrites to state utility law give some prominence to ethics reforms related to the revelations in the ComEd probe but nothing under consideration would seriously curb the outsized political influence ComEd has enjoyed for decades in Illinois.

Last summer ComEd admitted to a long-running bribery scheme aimed at influencing Madigan by awarding his political allies with lucrative no-work jobs and contracts. Federal prosecutors say ComEd’s goal was to secure favorable legislation in Springfield including electricity rate hikes.

Apart from the criminal case against ComEd the utility put relatives of politicians on its payroll and filtered money through a foundation to a top utility watchdog that later backed some of its priorities and has been a reliably prolific campaign donor doling out more than $3.1 million in contributions during the nearly decade-long run of corruption.

Despite the scope of the scandal and its fallout — Madigan was long the most powerful politician in Illinois — the prospects for ethics reform this year are now hazy.

The two Democratic legislative leaders aren’t saying yet exactly what reforms if any they’re willing to push to passage. And a May 31 adjournment deadline looms with the ever-present danger that the pandemic could send lawmakers home from Springfield with little notice.

Still a top aide to Gov. JB Pritzker says accountability and reform must be marquee elements of any package if it’s going to be signed into law by the governor this spring or summer. The Chicago Democrat intends to present his own new outline to lawmakers as early as next week.

“Any energy legislation he is going to find worthy of support is going to need to lead with ethics reform” said Deputy Gov. Christian Mitchell Pritzker’s point person on a possible utility omnibus.

ComEd continues to operate with a scaled-back lobbying presence a clear after-effect of the company’s stunning ethical nosedive last summer as spelled out in an agreement with U.S. Attorney John Lausch to defer a criminal probe into the company. ComEd agreed to pay $200 million to the government as part of that deal.

Madigan has denied wrongdoing and knowledge of the scheme. The former speaker and state Democraty Party chair has not been charged.

Even if ComEd is a weakened brand the company’s corporate sister Exelon Generation has kept up pressure on lawmakers for a new bailout for its struggling Illinois nuclear business. It announced late last summer that it would prematurely shut down its Dresden and Byron nuclear plants in northern Illinois. The move would cost 1500 full-time jobs — many held by Democrat-aligned union electricians — and threaten to undermine the Pritzker administration’s aim to wean Illinois from fossil fuel.

The governor’s office has commissioned its own study to determine what kind of subsidies would be necessary to keep the two nuclear plants in operation. A report released Wednesday justified roughly $350 million in ratepayer subsidies to Exelon over five years.

And on a separate front ComEd filed paperwork with the Illinois Commerce Commission on Friday to seek a $51 million rate increase effective in January its first such request in four years.

Lawmaker: “It’s really a shame that we have to babysit” ComEd

There are competing bills in the General Assembly directed at ComEd for its ethical lapses.

In the House state Rep. Ann Williams D-Chicago is carrying legislation to establish a path for ratepayers to win restitution if a utility company engages in criminal wrongdoing. In its deferred prosecution agreement ComEd said its corrupt lobbying yielded legislative victories valued at more than $150 million for the company.

Her legislation also would do away with automatic rate increases for ComEd customers based on a preset formula. It would bar utilities like ComEd from billing ratepayers for charitable contributions or for legal fees tied to criminal investigations.



And Williams’ measure would establish a czar to oversee utility ethics compliance at the Illinois Commerce Commission which regulates utilities.

That czar would have access to a database that ComEd and other utilities would be required to log showing “requests for anything of value” sought by public officials or their staffs. But those records of potential job or contract asks wouldn’t be directly accessible to the public under current language in Williams’ bill — something she said she’s willing to reconsider.

Her legislation also would prevent ComEd-hired lobbyists from subcontracting which the company acknowledged in its deferred prosecution agreement as a way political friends of Madigan’s were funneled rewards. That practice which evaded state lobbying disclosure rules enabled ComEd lobbyists to hire Madigan associates as consultants who did little to no work.

“It’s really a shame that we have to babysit the utilities in this way” Williams told WBEZ. “But unfortunately ComEd has shown us that they were really willing to make a mockery of the legislative process.”

Williams chairwoman of the House Energy and Environment Committee said she intends to ask Democratic House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch’s office for permission to hold a hearing in her committee to delve more deeply into ethics and accountability measures in response to the ComEd scandal.

Her legislation counts Welch of Hillside as a co-sponsor but he hasn’t signaled if her template is the one he’ll seek to pass this spring.

In a statement a Welch spokesman said the speaker “hasn’t been involved” with Williams’ legislation or another one pushed by organized labor.

“His goal is to restore confidence in government and address shortfalls identified following the ComEd issue” Welch spokesman Sean Anderson said in the statement.

Last summer Welch presided over legislative hearings that delved into Madigan’s conduct involving ComEd. But Welch signed off on efforts to shut down the inquiry without any sanctions against the former speaker.

In January with Madigan’s blessing Welch took over as speaker when Madigan couldn’t get enough votes to be reelected largely due to fallout from the still-active federal probe into ComEd’s dealings in Springfield.

In the Senate state Sen. Michael Hastings D-Frankfort has sponsored legislation aimed at making ComEd refund $200 million to ratepayers — the same amount the company paid to settle its federal bribery case with the federal government last summer. It also would establish a utility ethics monitor at the ICC and prohibit ComEd from billing ratepayers for costs associated with a criminal investigation into its conduct and for benefits for any employees convicted of crimes associated with the misconduct.

“I think it’s essential” Hastings said of utility-oriented ethics reforms “and the reason I say that is the public needs to be able to trust their public utility system and their government when it comes down to what I consider essential needs.”

Hastings who is chair of the Senate Energy and Public Utilities Committee and a declared candidate for secretary of state said he could foresee a final ethics package that would encompass the provisions contained in both his and Williams’ measures.

Senate President Don Harmon D-Oak Park would not say if he was satisfied with any of the ComEd-driven ethics reforms on the table so far or outline specific ideas of his own related to the lobbying scandal.



“We are reviewing proposals” Harmon spokesman John Patterson said.

A spokeswoman for ComEd said company executives embrace a retooling of ethics requirements.

“We expect that a variety of proposals will be considered and look forward to discussions with lawmakers and other stakeholders about how best to incorporate ethics requirements into legislation that ensures clean reliable and affordable energy for all Illinois residents” ComEd spokeswoman Shannon Breymaier said in a statement.

“ComEd’s newly implemented ethics policies already prohibit subcontracting of both third-party lobbyists and political consultants and require tracking of all requests referrals and recommendations from public officials” she said.

Those internal procedures have been in place since July 2020 she said shortly before the announcement of the company’s deferred prosecution with the U.S. attorney’s office.

The ethics reforms lawmakers aren’t discussing

The ethics reforms directed at ComEd introduced so far are a move in the right direction but need to carry more bite some consumer advocates say.

“Do I think this is good? I would say it’s a start” said Robert Gallo state director of Illinois AARP which represents 1.7 million seniors in the state and is a major consumer advocate on utility issues. “I don’t think it really answers or addresses the problem and how it started.”

A recent meeting with the speaker has left Gallo feeling encouraged that some ethics measures will advance this session.

“He emphasized his top priority is for the citizens of Illinois to regain trust in government” Gallo said. “I felt he was sincere about that.”

For example no policies under consideration would bar utility campaign contributions. Nor would they impose any kind of lifetime lobbying ban on any utility lobbyists who may be convicted as part of the ComEd investigation or any future corruption probes. Nor are logs of legislative favors publicly accessible.

Additionally there presently are no reforms directed at the Citizens Utility Board which was created as a utility watchdog by the legislature in 1983 and barred from accepting “gifts loans and other aid” from utility companies. Despite that law a WBEZ investigation last September documented at least $11.55 million in funding for CUB that came from a pair of utility-funded foundations during the past two decades.

The practice drew condemnation from consumer groups nationally and in Illinois with Gallo saying last fall that the group had “fed at the utility trough just like the rest of them.”

CUB which has signed on as a supporter to Williams’ legislation has said the money it has accepted over the years from utility-funded foundations has not compromised its independence and that it frequently is at odds with the utility.

More recently Illinois AARP Illinois PIRG and the Environmental Law & Policy Center put together a laundry list of reform demands driven by the ComEd scandal including ratepayer restitution and an end to utility company political contributions. CUB was noticeably absent from the effort.

“Utilities just can’t amass the same level of political power in the future as they’ve had in the past” said Illinois PIRG Director Abe Scarr.

Another aspect of the state’s campaign finance law that merits scrutiny in light of the ComEd scandal is the time-honored practice of public officials who run afoul of the law turning to their campaign funds to pay criminal defense lawyers said state Rep. Deanne Mazzochi R-Elmhurst.

Since October Madigan’s personal campaign fund Friends of Michael J. Madigan spent more than $3.7 million for work by a Chicago law firm specializing in white collar criminal cases. A Madigan spokesman attributed part of that expense to costs associated with complying with subpoenas from U.S. Attorney John Lausch’s office.

A member of the House panel that investigated Madigan last year Mazzochi has sponsored legislation to bar campaign expenditures for mounting a criminal defense or for civil cases “pertaining to misconduct by a person in his or her capacity as a public official sexual harassment claims or discrimination claims.”

Her bill has remained bottled up in the Democratic-led House. Its prospects appear dim.

“This just shows there’s so much power that is put in the speaker’s office” Mazzochi said. “Even when it came to the ways in which [Madigan] was using those campaign funds people still didn’t believe they had any choice but to donate.”

The contours of a legislative response to the ComEd scandal remain murky but Illinois lawmakers should be duty-bound to reel in a powerful utility accustomed to steamrolling its way through Springfield says one leading national watchdog.

“These types of legislative scandals should be easy to stop as long as you’ve got the right kind of comprehensive ethics and lobbying reforms in place” said Tyson Slocum who directs the energy program for Washington D.C.-based Public Citizen which was founded by consumer activist Ralph Nader. “It doesn’t appear as though states are doing enough to establish those standards in the wake of these scandals.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndsdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZWFuLXJheW1vbmQtcmF5LXdlaXItNTUzMjA0MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dean Raymond 'Ray' Weir - Obituary -,"Dean Raymond Weir (Ray) passed away unexpectedly on April 18 2021 at Cariboo Memorial Hospital.

Indigenous nation opposes mineral exploration in culturally sensitive area,"There’s “no way” the Tahltan would ever support a mine there says Chad Norman Day president of its central government

A mineral exploration company with provincial permits to work in Tahltan territory in northwestern British Columbia is treading on sacred grounds an elected leader in the nation’s government says.

Vancouver-based Doubleview Gold Corp. is developing claims in an area north of Telegraph Creek that occupies an important place in Tahltan oral histories said Chad Norman Day president of the Tahltan Central Government.

There’s “no way” the Tahltan would ever support a mine there he said.

“The Sheslay area was a major village site in pre-contact times and even nowadays we have many elders who were born in the Sheslay area. Many of our ancestors are buried out there” Day said in an interview.

“British Columbia Doubleview we should all just save ourselves a lot of time energy and conflict and get Doubleview out of there” he said.

Doubleview has 10 mineral tenures covering about 63 square kilometres where “an aggressive 2021 exploration program is being planned” the company said in an update posted online in February.

It said it expected to give shareholders a more complete assessment of the deposit’s value after verifying the results of

metallurgical sample analysis.

The Tahltan Central Government accuses Doubleview of failing to act in a manner consistent with both Tahltan protocols for the mining sector and with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

The Tahltan made “many reasonable attempts to work with Doubleview in a respectful manner” the central government said in a statement in March.

But the company has a “track record of being disrespectful … including unsuccessfully taking legal action against Tahltan leaders and elders in 2015” it said.

Doubleview “regrets the poor relationship that we have established” with the Tahltan lead director Andrew Rees said in an email when asked about the conflict and the company offered an apology letter after the nation’s public statement.

“Doubleview strives to be a responsible steward of the areas in which we live and operate and continues to seek a positive collaborative productive and mutually beneficial relationship with the Tahltan Central Government.”

The Mines Ministry said Doubleview was first granted a multi-year permit in 2012 in a process that included consultation with the Tahltan Nation.

Laws and legal precedents concerning Indigenous rights and title have changed since then said Day.

The B.C. government is now in the early stages of aligning its laws with the UN declaration after adopting it through legislation.

It requires governments to obtain free prior and informed consent before taking actions that affect Indigenous Peoples and territories — which would include decisions on proposed mines and future exploration work permits.

The statutory adoption of the UN declaration means industry and the B.C. government must start building “processes that seek a genuine consent from Indigenous governments communities and people” Day said.

“And there’s a huge difference between having a conversation and calling it consultation versus having a robust consultation process that is aiming to get consent from Indigenous people.”

The Tahltan Nation has “excellent relationships” with the majority of mining and mineral exploration companies operating in its territory Day noted.

There are three active mines — Red Chris Silvertip and Brucejack — and the nation has impact benefit agreements with each of the companies.

“When you have Tahltan title and rights over 11 per cent of the province and you have jurisdiction over an area the size of Portugal you don’t need to be supportive of projects that are in really culturally sensitive areas” Day said.

The Tahltan has communication agreements with more than two dozen mining and mineral exploration companies allowing it to check in on their work as necessary he said.

Day said Doubleview had refused to sign though Rees said the company is now waiting to hear back from the nation after sending a written response about a communications and engagement agreement.

“We acknowledge that it has taken us much longer to do so than we would have liked and attribute the delay to internal miscommunication and lack of expert resources” the Doubleview statement said.

“Our utmost priority right now remains getting back to the table … and doing so in a respectful and collaborative manner so that we can continue understanding Tahltan Nation’s ongoing concerns which will allow us to collaboratively develop appropriate mitigation measures.”

Day however said the company has “chosen a path of conflict” with the Tahltan and he would oppose any further permits.

It may be time to shake things up and consider tying employees' health plan premiums to their pay.

Today at most U.S. workplaces nearly all employees from the C-suite to the mailroom pay the same amount for health coverage. An alternative to this traditional structure is to set cost-sharing levels or tiers based on employee compensation. That will reduce the amount lower-paid workers must contribute to maintain and use their health coverage at no additional cost to companies. Higher-paid employees will see a moderate increase in their contributions as they effectively subsidize health coverage for lower-paid workers.

""Most employers don't think about shifting from the current one-size-fits-all approach to using a fixed percent of pay for health insurance coverage because they have always done it that way"" says benefits consultant Gary Kushner president of Kushner and Co. in Portage Mich.

But there are several reasons why an employer may want to move to income-based cost-sharing with employees a model that is rising in popularity.









Communication and Competition

First asking lower-paid workers to pay a larger percentage of their pay than higher-paid individuals undercuts efforts to help improve employees' financial wellness and stress levels. Second if cost-sharing is too high employees may avoid seeking needed care because of high out-of-pocket costs thereby risking more-serious long-term health issues.

And for some employers taking a fresh approach to apportioning health care costs is a competitive strategy. Indeed organizations that are having difficulty attracting and retaining lower-paid employees may want to consider income-based health care contributions to stand out in the talent marketplace.

The Small Business Association of Michigan (SBAM) is based in Lansing where it competes for talent against much larger employers including Michigan State University that tend to offer more-generous benefits. As a small organization with 27 employees the association has had to get creative in its benefits offerings.

For nearly 15 years the SBAM has tied employees' health insurance contributions to their pay according to Ann Parker the organization's chief operating officer. Because the SBAM assesses employee contributions as a flat percentage of the total premium it is much simpler to communicate the total cost of health insurance coverage to employees—and how much of that cost the organization is covering.

The SBAM segments employees into four tiers based on their title or role in the organization such as clerk salesperson vice president and CEO. Parker and her team review the structure annually once they know the cost of health coverage for the coming year. When the organization began using this structure employees in the lowest tier paid 5 percent of health insurance costs and those in the highest tier paid 12.5 percent. The 2021 structure ranges from 15 percent to 22.5 percent with employee costs rising 2.5 percentage points from tier to tier.

""We are highlighting that the organization is still taking care of employees"" even as the cost of health insurance continues to increase Parker says. ""People tend to be blind to the costs of health insurance so it's important to give them clear numbers about the value of their plans.""



Not Just Premiums

Of course premiums are just one part of employee health care costs. Some companies have also begun tying all employee cost-sharing to income. JPMorgan Chase & Co. not only sets employee health insurance premium contributions based on income (12 percent of pay for employees making less than $60000 and more than 25 percent of pay for employees earning above that amount) but it also uses income to set deductibles and co-insurance levels for in-network care. (Deductibles and co-insurance are the same for out-of-network care regardless of how much money an employee earns.)

To set deductible levels the company uses the same two tiers it uses to set employee premium contributions. A single employee earning less than $60000 would have a deductible of $1000 for in-network care for example while the in-network deductible for a single employee earning $60000 or more would be $1750 for the same plan.

Co-insurance costs for in-network care are segmented using three income tiers. In-network co-insurance levels for family coverage are $2000 for those earning less than $60000; $3000 for those earning $60000 to $149999; and $4500 for those earning $150000 or more.









Sorting Out the Details

Making the change to income-based cost-sharing should be done carefully and in support of an organization's goals. For example the required changes can be cost-neutral to the employer if designed to reduce premiums for lower-paid employees and increase them by the same amount for higher-paid employees. In a three-tier structure the employees in the middle tier would see no change in their premiums. ""I have not seen employers use this to collect more in premiums just how those premium contributions are allocated"" Kushner says.

Administrative challenges associated with income-based cost-sharing are surmountable. ""Payroll systems can create multiple deductions"" Kushner says. Rather than have one or two flat-dollar deductions for health insurance premiums employers can create deductions for different levels as a percentage of pay. ""There is no difficulty doing it"" he adds.

Even so employers should carefully consider whether this is the right approach for them strategically. ""This should be a talent conversation not a health care conversation"" advises Julie Stone managing director with HR consultancy Willis Towers Watson in the New York City area. ""It requires time and thought about issues like hiring turnover salary levels and talent mobility.""

If the shift to premium tiers turns out to be the wrong approach reverting to the cost-sharing structure will again mean higher contributions for lower-paid employees. Consider the change carefully and be fully committed to it before rolling it out says Nancy Daas executive vice president with benefits brokerage firm Hub International in Chicago.

Stone notes that she knows of one employer with income-based cost-sharing that is moving away from that approach. ""They want to focus on what they can do to drive health care affordability for everyone"" she says. ""They're focused on the need to address the underlying issue of cost instead of shifting cost.""









How Will You Structure It?

While employers could assess income-based premium contributions as a flat percentage of pay most create multiple contribution tiers to ensure fairness and make the changeover cost-neutral. Limiting the number of tiers also makes the change easier to deal with from an administrative standpoint.

When setting up income-based health care cost-sharing employers need to decide how to delineate the various levels. For example some small businesses are able to segment the workforce by title as the SBAM does. However the more common approach is to set the levels based on pay ranges.

Determining how many levels to create will depend on several factors including the number of employees and pay ranges in the compensation structure. ""Are there natural break points?"" Kushner asks. Employers generally subdivide employees by income and charge a set premium for that band or tier. While employers have used two to six bands the most common approach is to use three or four.

Employers can create as many tiers as they want. However more bands add administrative complexity Daas says ""because it increases the number of payroll deductions the HR information system must handle.""



Will the Structure Really Work?

To make sure the switch from a flat contribution rate is cost-neutral employers can evaluate how the new structure will work in a real-life situation.

""Look at current contributions versus future contributions under the new structure"" Daas suggests. What is the resulting total for all employee contributions? ""You want to find out if there are any unintended consequences that run up employer costs or adversely impact employees"" she says.

Understanding the financial impact of cost-sharing changes to individual employees and groups is important Daas adds. If an employer develops a contribution structure that allows lower-paid employees to move from paying 10 percent of their pay for health care coverage to 5 percent of their pay how does that affect pay for the higher-paid employees whose contributions will be rising?

Questions Daas advises asking include ""How many winners and losers will there be among employees?"" and ""Is this reasonable and will higher-paid employees be willing to absorb the resulting X percent increase in health care contributions?""

If contributions start at a relatively low level a 50 percent rise for higher-paid employees may not make much of a difference in take-home pay. However if employees are paying $200 or more per month for health care a sudden large premium increase could be a problem.

""Contribution strategy is always great in theory"" Daas says ""but it can have a big impact in real life.""





​

Is income-based cost-sharing gaining momentum?

It depends who you ask. In general larger employers are more likely to pursue this strategy and its use has been increasing slowly over time. For example the Mercer National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans found a slight increase in salary-based health plan contributions between 2016 and 2020 but only among larger employers. A 2019 survey of 610 large employers by HR consultancy Willis Towers Watson found that 27 percent of employers were planning to base employee health care contributions on employee pay levels in 2020 and 34 percent were considering doing so in 2021 essentially unchanged from the survey’s 2017 data. Add in smaller employers however and the numbers decline. The Kaiser Family Foundation’s 2020 Employer Health Benefits survey of 1765 employers looked at the broader category of total cost-sharing and found that only 7 percent of employers with 50 or more employees have any sort of program that reduces cost-sharing for lower-wage workers.







Communicating the Change

Given the magnitude of this type of plan adjustment communication is critical. Employers need to carefully explain and build their case for income-based health care contributions so that higher-paid employees understand what company leaders are trying to achieve. At the same time communication to lower-paid employees can ensure that the employer gets credit for making health insurance more affordable for this group Daas says.

Before implementing and communicating the change conduct market research to find out what peers and competitors for talent in the same industry or region are doing. This does not have to be limited to companies that use income-based premium tiers for health insurance. The key is to get a clear sense of how much employees at competing companies pay for coverage.

Transparency is also important. Stone at Willis Towers Watson advises employers to communicate the entire strategy around these changes and why employees' cost-sharing levels will be changing.

""This should not be a surprise or a secret"" she says. If the employer differentiates premiums by income or any other means such as geography that should also be clearly communicated. ""Employees should also know or be able to find out the impact on their premium contributions if they get married get a raise or move to a new location.""



Managing Promotions and Pay Raises

The final and perhaps most critical question is how to handle salary increases and promotions that cause employees to move into the next income tier with a higher health care premium level.

Modeling can show how much impact the chosen bands are likely to have as people advance. For example in a band that covers employees making $30000 to $50000 per year someone making $49500 who is expecting a pay raise may find that raise has a smaller impact as he or she moves to another band that requires higher health care cost-sharing.

""This could slash the impact of the promotion or raise"" says Christopher Calvert senior vice president with consulting firm Segal in New York City. The change ""can be difficult to manage and navigate"" without taking steps to neutralize this potential outcome.

Therefore he suggests employers should focus on total compensation not just direct pay. ""It's important to make sure the total pay increase is enough to offset any increase in health care contributions"" Calvert says. ""Or it might make sense to offer a slightly lower increase to keep someone in a lower tier for health care contributions.""

For this reason employers should pay close attention to employees' positions in the cost-sharing structure. ""Don't set it and forget it"" Kushner says. ""Look at the distribution."" If there's a cluster of people at the top of a given band's range for example that can indicate it's time to examine and possibly update the structure.

Posted on: April 17 2021 02:48h.

Last updated on: April 17 2021 04:52h.

A suspected intoxicated driver on the Las Vegas Strip somehow maneuvered a Chevy sedan onto a narrow pedestrian bridge near the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas Friday. The unnamed driver was arrested for DUI.

The bridge is a tight walkway stretching between the Encore’s parking garage and the casino. Cars are forbidden.

The photo of the car went viral Friday night. It also prompted many comments on a Nevada Highway Patrol (NHP) social media site.

He did this while drunk?” a poster named Tyus said on the site. “Wow that’s honestly impressive.”

Another poster JSJ asked “How the hell do you get a car up there?” After seeing the photo Joe responded “Gotta be at least 5 bad decisions to end up like that.”

And Andrew commented “Figures the car is a Chevrolet since their marketing slogan is finding new roads although I don’t believe Chevy meant it literally like this.”

The regional Las Vegas DUI Strike Team made the arrest. The team includes troopers with the NHP and officers with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) and other local departments.

The team says its approach to enforcement has become more proactive. Multiple officers go out at the same time and search for intoxicated drivers.

Under the old way police set up checkpoints in one place. Data on the team’s efforts are promising.

The DUI team created in 2018 made at least 2741 impaired driving arrests as of February according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

Overall the LVMPD arrested 4564 people on impaired driving charges in 2019. There were 4104 arrests in the prior year.

Also the number of fatalities linked to intoxicated divers dropped from 54 to 26 during the two years the Review-Journal said.

Drunk Driving Deaths

But drunk driving injuries and fatalities continue along the Strip. Last November a 43-year-old woman died from chest injuries after the SUV she was in crashed into a wall on the fifth floor at the Paris Hotel & Casino parking garage. The deceased woman was identified as Veronica Acosta.

She was a passenger. The driver was charged with DUI.

Also in September Las Vegas real estate broker Scott Gragson was sentenced to between eight and 20 years in prison for a fatal crash at The Ridges in Summerlin. A mother of three was killed and three others were injured the Review-Journal reported. Gragson pleaded guilty to driving under the influence.

Eleven years ago a study published in the Journal of Health Economics stated that “There is a strong link between the presence of a casino in a county and the number of alcohol-related fatal traffic accidents.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Nhc2lub3MtZ2FtaW5nL3Ryb3BpY2FuYS1pcy1qdXN0LWxhdGVzdC1wdXJjaGFzZS1kZWFsLWluLWJhbGx5cy1zcGVuZGluZy1zcHJlZS0yMzMyMjkwL9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jYXNpbm9zLWdhbWluZy90cm9waWNhbmEtaXMtanVzdC1sYXRlc3QtcHVyY2hhc2UtZGVhbC1pbi1iYWxseXMtc3BlbmRpbmctc3ByZWUtMjMzMjI5MC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tropicana is just latest purchase deal in Bally’s spending spree,"This year Bally’s has finalized or agreed to merger and acquisition deals with three companies and two casinos including the Tropicana in Las Vegas.

From slot machines and fitness clubs to record labels and hotel-casinos the Bally brand has been through many iterations over its nearly 90-year history.

The name was first tied to pinball machine manufacturer — and eventual slot machine maker — Bally Manufacturing Corp. in the 1930s and has since been attached to a diverse mix of industries through spinoffs and subsidiaries. Today the brand is controlled by one of the fastest-growing casino and online gaming operators in the country: Bally’s Corp.

The Rhode Island-based company has been aggressively purchasing properties and online gaming companies in recent months to bring its omnichannel vision to life. This year alone it has finalized or agreed to merger and acquisition deals with three companies and two casinos including the Tropicana in Las Vegas.

According to President and CEO George Papanier Bally’s Corp. is just getting started.

“We are confident that Bally’s will not only be a national powerhouse in the online sports betting and iGaming industry but the overall U.S. gaming industry” he told the Review-Journal. “There is no other operator with such a diverse and expansive portfolio or with the same momentum in the marketplace that we’ve achieved.”

Rapid growth

Before there was Bally’s Corp. there was Twin River Worldwide Holdings Inc.

The company launched in March 2004 and its original portfolio included four greyhound tracks and a horseracing track in Rhode Island and Colorado.

By June 2019 the company owned and operated four casino properties with three casino acquisitions in the works. That’s when Truist analyst Barry Jonas first started covering the property.

Back then he said there were “real concerns” about the company.

Wynn Resorts Ltd. was getting ready to launch its Encore Boston Harbor property the summer of 2019 just an hour’s drive from the company’s two Rhode Island casinos.

“At the time that was really the story. How can they respond to this new competition this new multibillion-dollar property?” Jonas said. “The stock was languished. There was a bit of an overhang there.”

But Twin River leaders proved that they were up for the challenge.

The company started making “very smart acquisitions at very attractive prices” Jonas said. Acquisitions are still top of mind for the company: It has 12 casinos in its portfolio across eight states with four more in the works including the Tropicana on the Strip a deal valued at $308 million.

The timing of the pandemic and Eldorado Resort Inc.’s acquisition of Caesars Entertainment Corp. last year was fortuitous for the growth of Bally’s.

The two Nevada-based companies shed several properties to be Federal Trade Commission-compliant ahead of their $17.3 billion merger in July. The companies — now operating as Caesars Entertainment Inc. post-merger — had agreed to sell six properties to Twin River worth a combined $550 million.

“The pool of acquirers was limited. Twin River had a pristine balance sheet and was the only qualified acquirer out there through COVID” Jonas said. “They turned out to be smart acquisitions.”

Bally’s is still keeping its eyes on potential markets for growth. The company is one of three finalists bidding for a gaming license in Richmond Virginia and it could be in play for a downstate New York license according to Jefferies analyst David Katz.

Bally’s “is currently not present in (Michigan) and (Maryland) but appears to be signaling interest in those markets” Katz said in a Tuesday note to investors. “As legalization for mobile wagering accelerates across states (the company’s) interest could extend beyond the four states.”

‘Unbelievable’ M&A

Online sports betting and iGaming growth has been another major focal point for the company.

In just the past four months the company has initiated or closed the acquisitions of daily fantasy sports platform Monkey Knife Fight free-to-play platform SportCaller and online sports betting operator Bet.Works’ technology platform. On Tuesday the company announced that it had agreed to acquire United Kingdom-based online gaming provider Gamesys Group plc in a deal worth $2.8 billion.

Papanier said the recent acquisitions should complement the company’s long-term partnership with Sinclair Broadcast Group a media company that owns and operates 188 local TV stations and 19 regional sports networks.

That deal announced in November gives Bally’s access to local sports fans across the county in return for sports betting and iGaming content. Also Sinclair’s regional sports networks are rebranding as “Bally Sports” replacing Fox Sports regional logos.

Shares of the company have gone up 92 percent since its partnership with Sinclair was announced.

The growth “is really unbelievable” said Marcus Prater executive director of the Association of Gaming Equipment Manufacturers and a former marketing director for Bally Technologies a spinoff of the original Bally Manufacturing Corp.

“I wouldn’t have given this Twin Rivers operation a second thought a couple years ago — and now look at what they’ve done just in the past six months” he added.

Papanier said the company’s focus on operating with little leverage and high liquidity has allowed it to snatch up a large number of assets in a relatively short amount of time.

“We have always been opportunistic yet disciplined in our (merger and acquisition) strategy” he said.

The power behind the name

Bally’s has had an audacious approach to growth but its most significant acquisition was one that didn’t come with any slot machines sports betting licenses or land — just the Bally’s name.

The company purchased the iconic brand from Caesars in October 2020. The sale allowed it to rebrand all of its portfolio properties under the Bally’s name and logo and maintain the Bally’s name for its Atlantic City property which it agreed to purchase from Caesars months prior.

It also gave it a “single prominent brand” under which its physical and online offerings could unite according to its latest annual report.

The name which used to be attached to the world’s largest slot machine manufacturing company is going through a renaissance under its new owner.

Just turn on a sports broadcast; there’s a good chance now that you will catch the Bally’s brand through the company’s recent rebranding deal with Sinclair.

“It’s almost like somebody flipped on a switch and the Bally’s ‘B’ is everywhere now” Prater said. “It’s now truly in the major leagues. … This is a remarkable extension of what is coming up on a 90 year old brand.”

The brand’s reach should only grow from here on now that Bally’s is gearing up to launch its Bally Bet sports app.

“I think the vision is we will be bombarded with Bally’s as consumers and really associate that name with sports betting as well as just general consumption of sports” Jonas said.

Charlie Lombardo a gaming consultant and a former head of slot operations at Bally’s Las Vegas said the name is instantly recognizable for many — especially along the East Coast home of Bally’s Atlantic City.

“The name was always strong” he said. “I think (the recent purchase by the former Twin River) is nothing but upside for the brand.”

Papanier told the Review-Journal that the brand name has “definitely been an integral component” to the company’s success.

It’s “associated with first-in-class properties and amenities so it aligns perfectly with our platform” he said. “Moreover the brand is proving to be extremely important to our growth and diversification strategy.”

It has yet to be seen just how far Bally’s brand will reach across the gaming space. At this point the company’s growth strategy has no end in sight.

“We are always on the hunt for attractive assets that complement our diverse and expanding portfolio” Papanier said. “Our goal is to become the premier truly integrated U.S. omnichannel gaming company with a (business to business to consumer) business model. … The possibilities are endless.”

Bally shares closed up 1.7 percent Friday to $58.78 on the New York Stock Exchange.

It’s hard to imagine that the betting public would not be able to wager on a sporting event as prominent as the Kentucky Derby.

But with horse racing’s most famous event just two weeks away it’s going to take an affirmative vote on a regulation amendment request next week to enable Nevada sportsbooks to take bets on the first leg of horse racing’s Triple Crown.

Following a public hearing at Thursday’s Nevada Gaming Commission meeting an amendment to Regulation 22 governing race books and sports pools will be considered by the five-member commission. A request to amend the regulation went to the commission in February from the Nevada Pari-Mutuel Association. After the Nevada Gaming Control Board reviewed the request it was set for the Thursday hearing.

If the situation sounds familiar it’s because the same thing happened last year when the Kentucky Derby was postponed to the fall as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Gaming Commission solved the problem the same way it’s been proposed for resolution this year — that sportsbooks be allowed to base race results and calculate payouts on what is presented on national television.

The Nevada Pari-Mutuel Association alluded to last year’s resolution in its petition to amend the regulation.

“Unfortunately since their last off-track pari-mutuel agreement expired in October 2019 the Nevada books have not been able to successfully negotiate another off-track pari-mutuel wagering agreement with Churchill Downs the track that hosts the Kentucky Derby and Kentucky Oaks” the petition says. “And despite good-faith efforts on behalf of the books it appears highly unlikely that there will be an off-track pari-mutuel wagering agreement in place for the 2021 Kentucky Derby or Kentucky Oaks currently scheduled to be held May 1 and April 30 respectively.”

Nevada Gaming Commission Chairman John Moran has been monitoring the situation since the commission was contacted by the association.

“The commission wants to save the horse bettors and the books so they can bet the Kentucky Derby” Moran said in a recent interview. “We don’t want to lose that revenue for the state. And how can we be the gold standard for wagering if we don’t have betting on the Kentucky Derby?”

Regulation 22 requires that a licensed race book shall determine the winners of or payouts on wagers on horse and other animal races only with information the book receives from licensed disseminators.

Moran said he was at a loss as to why it has been so difficult for Churchill Downs to reach an agreement with a licensed disseminator.

“You’d have to ask them” he said.

Requests for comment from Churchill Downs have been unanswered.

But fortunately for the affected race and sportsbooks — the association says there are 68 association member books in the state and 53 more affiliated through operator William Hill US — the solution to fix the problem is relatively easy.

The association through attorney Marc Rubinstein drafted an amendment to Regulation 22 that will be reviewed and considered by the commission.

The amended text lists exceptions to the rule that only licensed disseminators can provide race results. The amendment says:

■ The book must file a request with the Control Board chair at least seven calendar days prior to the races taking place for permission to determine the winners of specific races based on nationally televised broadcasts.

■ There is no off-track pari-mutuel wagering agreement in place between the track where the races are being held and any licensed race book or the Off-Track Pari-Mutuel Wagering Committee.

■ The book stops accepting wagers on each of the races at the time the first horse or other animal enters the starting gate.

■ The book shows the nationally televised broadcast of the races live at the book.

■ The book ensures an employee of the book other than a betting ticket writer monitors the nationally televised broadcast records the outcome of the races with the conclusion of each race and records the time the outcome of each race occurred.

■ The chair upon a finding that the request is consistent with the public policy of the state of Nevada as set forth in Nevada Revised Statutes 463.0129 approves the request subject to any limitations or conditions the chair deems appropriate.

Hundreds of thousands are expected to place bets on the Kentucky Derby next month. With a positive outcome at Thursday’s commission they will include Nevada residents.

Colorado’s slow rise to the top of the NHL has been impressive to watch. They’ve always played fast especially since drafting Nathan MacKinnon they’ve always had high-end talent but it took a few years for things to come together. MacKinnon went from a very good player to an elite player Mikko Rantanen became a perfect fit on his wing their defense went from Erik Johnson & A Bunch of Guys to one anchored by Samuel Girard & Cale Makar. Thus they’ve been one of the top teams in the Western Conference (if we’re still calling it that) for the past two years.

They’ve made a habit out of running up the score and the shot count against almost everyone this year controlling over 60 percent of the Expected Goals at five-on-five and averaging over three goals per 60 minutes. Stats that are comparable to the likes of the 2009-10 Chicago Blackhawks and 2007-08 Detroit Red Wings. The one team that has given Colorado trouble this year is the Vegas Golden Knights who own a 3-3 split of the season series and are similar to the Avs in a lot of ways. Not just statistically but stylistically.

If you’ve watched any games of these two teams you know that they’re both fast run-and-gun teams that like attacking off the rush. Using some of the zone entry & passing data from the All Three Zones Project we can quantify just how good both these teams are. Unsurprisingly they are the top two teams in the league in creating shots off the rush and among the best in the league at creating scoring chances after carrying the puck in.

Basically they’re getting through the neutral zone and making their possessions count. Even if they’re not scoring off the rush the strength of both teams is just how long they keep opponents pinned into their own zone. They not only lead the league in rush shots but shots off the forecheck or the cycle which means that they’re versatile and spending a lot of time not having to defend. Again the volume of shots here compared to the rest of the league is something to behold.

Data from All Three Zones Project

When the game is at even strength they’re usually the ones with the puck or controlling the run of play. The intra-divisional play is obviously a factor here but it’s still hard not to be impressed at how both of these teams have gone about their business this year.

What stands out for Colorado is who they’ve been able to do this while dealing with a barrage of injuries especially on their blue line. It’s been a problem all season but the biggest challenge was when Cale Makar was out of the lineup in early March and the team was dressing as many as four AHL regulars on defense. Colorado still continued to roll teams going 7-2-1 without Makar while also dealing with season-long injuries to likes of Bowen Byram and Erik Johnson.

What’s interesting is that some of the replacements thrived in big minutes when they were called upon the best example being Jacob MacDonald a 28-year-old with only two games of NHL experience to his name before this year. Starting the year on the taxi squad he found himself contributing in big minutes alongside Girard & Toews. While some of their younger players struggled to play higher in the lineup MacDonald remained a fixture positing very good on-ice results and earning a regular roster spot after Makar & others got healthy. Regardless of whether or not you think MacDonald is the one driving the bus there is something to be said about the Avs making it easy to integrate defensemen into their lineup. Just ask Ryan Graves another AHL vet who found a home in Denver.

In theory it should be easy for a defender to play for a team like the Avalanche. The play is usually in front of you and everything is going downhill fast so there’s not a lot of times where you’re in a high stress situation especially when you’re playing behind forwards like MacKinnon & Kadri who can carry the play.

This isn’t always how the game always works though. You’re going to have to play some shifts in your own zone & it also takes certain skills to work in a system like Colorado because your decisions have to be quick and your passes have to be on point otherwise you might be looking at a turnover the puck coming back at you at the same rate of speed. Yes they control the play most games but you have to be looking for an open play instead of banking the puck off the boards or the glass as your first option if you’re going to fit in with Colorado. This is no problem for a player like Makar or Girard. Youngsters like Byram & Timmins are still finding their way so what has MacDonald done that made him fit in?

Jack Han illustrated some of the strengths of the Avs system here with the main component being how their D (or the first player to retrieve the puck in the defensive zone) is instructed to beat the first forechecker to create an odd-man situation up the ice. It can be by skating a good stretch pass or a well-designed breakout with support. MacDonald might not have much NHL experience but he has a solid offensive track record in the AHL and has adapted to the Avs system seamlessly.

You wouldn’t expect MacDonald to be among the league leaders in shots produced off the rush but this clip shows a good example of how he’s gotten acclimated to how the Avs play. Notice how tight him & Toews are on the Kings forwards as they try to work the puck behind the goal line. They create a 2v1 for Colorado which leads to a loose puck & a breakout for MacDonald. Meanwhile the right winger (Burakovsky) is reading where the puck is the entire time & is already in a great position to receive the pass to exit the zone. Notice how MacDonald immediately starts skating out of the zone after making the pass to Burakovsky this gives him a passing option after entering the zone while Brandon Saad drives the net. The Kings have to backup because MacDonald had a step on the backchecking Kings players & Colorado gets a good scoring chance out of it.

If you’ve watched any Colorado game you’ll notice that all of their defensemen are active & involved but they don’t always lead the rush like you see Roman Josi or Miro Heiskanen do. Instead they act more as a trailer while their forwards do most of the legwork up the ice. You could argue it’s better to have your D involved like this because the whole point of having them involved is to create a numerical advantage at the line or in the offensive zone. If the defender is leading the rush usually a forward has to stay back or stationary at the line to cover. If they’re activating as a trailer like MacDonald in the clip above it’s usually a reaction to three forwards getting caught deep or a situation where the player knows there’s an opening they can exploit. When broadcasters say a defenseman has the “green light” this is what they mean.

This also applies to cycling the puck & attacking from high to low in the offensive zone. Every team wants their team to be aggressive & having their defense pinch to keep pucks alive or disrupt exits is nothing ground-breaking. How Colorado’s defense works in rotation with their forwards however is another story. What separates the Avs (and Vegas) from some other teams that like to attack off the rush is that they have a forecheck/cycle component to their game that is tough to defend. They like to cycle the puck high have their forwards rotate with their defensemen often & try to create space down low or in the slot through deception or defenders getting lost with all the player movement going on up high. Sometimes they’ll have a defenseman loop out of the zone for a quick second so there’s enough space for him to skate into a shot around a defender from the faceoff circle. It’s easier to play in the offensive zone but it requires a lot of coordination smarts & teamwork to execute it the right way. One could argue it’s tougher than breakouts or defending because a misplay or a bad pass high in the zone is one way to giftwrap a breakaway for the other team.

Watch Girard (left) & Toews (right) read off what the forwards do. At first it looks like Toews is trying a give & go play with the high forward but Rantanen sends the puck into an open corner & Toews has to back off while MacKinnon retrieves the puck & goes up high. Look at all the space that opens up while MacKinnon carries the puck & makes the switch with Rantanen. Toews has to leave the zone for a split second & takes advantage of the open space created by the forwards to get a scoring chance. He gets a second chance because MacKinnon stays high & the Blues have to change personnel when they finally get possession of the puck. Colorado’s defense is known for dancing with the puck & doing spin-o-ramas to get away from attacking forwards and while those are fun to watch the subtle off-puck plays are just as effective. It’s also a reason why Toews is a 24-minute a night player in Colorado instead of just second pair/power play weapon that he was perceived as with the Islanders.

Sometimes the defense activating serves as a distraction.

The forward Compher (37) and the defenseman Timmins (22) are the ones to watch here. Nothing really special happens here except Timmins goes to retrieve a loose puck along the boards. Compher goes up high to cover for him & then immediately goes to the front of the net while all three Blues forwards are fixated on what’s going up on high. Compher ends up unmarked in front of the net & scores off the rebound of Timmins shot. The Blues might have gambled with trying to block the shot or kill the play at the point but it’s always risky to do this against the Avs even if it is their fourth line. Timmins is one of the few blue liners who has had a tougher learning curve compared to others so it will be interesting to see how he improves in this system especially with the team relatively healthy on defense now.

When your depth players are creating situations like this it’s usually a good sign. Colorado checks most of the boxes for a contender so their playoff fate is going to rest on their goaltending and how they respond to mistakes. Colorado can play this style better than any team in the league and it’s tough to defend if they’re on their game. It’s just that there are moments where things go haywire & even with Colorado’s improved defense there’s going to be a few slip-ups because that’s just the nature of the beast. They learned that the hard way in last year’s playoff run with their Murphy’s Law type of run of injuries. The Avs already survived one injury spell using almost every defenseman in their system and came out stronger on the other side. Still not fully healthy this defense corps has been battle tested more than almost any other team this year and the Avs have done a great job of fitting everyone in.

Later that day less than 24 hours after helping the Wildcats to their first-ever state championship game appearance in their first-ever state tournament appearance Lamb packed his hockey gear and left Byron for Green Bay.

The next day he was on the ice with the Green Bay Gamblers of the USHL.

It’s been a whirlwind of a month for the University of Minnesota commit but he’s enjoyed every step of the process even when he hasn’t had much time to sit and let what he’s accomplished sink in.

“I think he’ll look back as he gets older at what he’s done for the entire program and for Dodge County hockey both boys and girls the younger kids too” Dodge County boys hockey head coach Nick Worden said. “He probably doesn’t fully see it yet but he will down the road.

“Not at all to diminish the success of our other good hockey players but when you have a player like Brody… he has injected another level of excitement.”

Lamb told the Post Bulletin this week that he’s “90 percent certain” that he’ll forego his senior season of high school hockey to play in Green Bay next season. If so he leaves the Wildcats program as unquestionably the best player to ever pass through it.

He brought the Wildcats to new heights and has garnered plenty of awards along the way including being named a First Team All-State forward and the Associated Press 2021 Minnesota boys hockey Player of the Year.

He led the state in goals (52) points (87) short-handed goals (10) and points per game (3.62) as a junior. He’s also the Post Bulletin All-Area Player of the Year.

Going into Friday’s Gamblers’ home game Lamb had played in six games this season for Green Bay. He recorded his first USHL point an assist in last Saturday’s victory against the U.S. National Team Development Program U17 team which features former Rochester Mayo standout Maddox Fleming.

“Obviously it’s faster and stronger players at this level” Lamb said. “That’s probably the biggest difference. You have to make quicker plays you don’t have as much time. They want me to score goals but that’s not a given in this league. I have to work my hardest work in the defensive zone and do the little things and the goals will come.

“I’m just getting used to the league getting my feet wet at this level and hopefully can help them make a deep playoff run.”

Deep playoff runs are nothing new to Dodge County and Lamb whose dad Jeff played at Rochester Mayo High School then played four years of Division I hockey at the University of Denver.

The Wildcats went to a state tournament two years ago as Bantams. Last year they earned the No. 1 seed in the Section 1A playoffs only to get knocked off by Mankato East in the semifinals. That drove Lamb to return to high school hockey for his junior year in hopes of helping the Wildcats reach another state tournament.

They did just that going 19-4-1 and beating Mankato West 4-3 for the Section 1A championship on March 24 at Dodge County Ice Arena in Kasson. The following week the Wildcats beat Hermantown and Little Falls to reach the state championship game where they fell to powerful Gentry Academy.

Lamb was the talk of the state though during the tournament. He scored 10 goals in three games including six in the state quarterfinals win against Hermantown.

“It’s hard to put into words what he’s meant to our program” Worden said. “I knew when he was coming up — Jeff and I had good discussions about him playing for Dodge County versus going to a Shattuck St. Mary’s or going up to the metro — and Brody wanted to be here with his buddies and be part of the Dodge County program.

“It was a neat opportunity for him to be the star here in Dodge County and to help a bunch of kids along too.”

After the Wildcats fell to Gentry in the Class A championship game they remained in St. Paul and watched the Class AA championship game when Eden Prairie topped Lakeville South in double-overtime.

The next afternoon Worden received a text message from Kasson-Mantorville activities director Broc Threinen who said there were about a dozen kids in the street near his house playing street hockey dreaming of being the next Wildcats to play in a state tournament.

“Our youth numbers are growing and kids are excited” Worden said. “Our stamp has officially been put on Dodge County hockey.”
