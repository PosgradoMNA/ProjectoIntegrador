The film was made by DoorDash  one of a number of film screenings in recent weeks that was made or sponsored by a brand.

""Brand films"" aren't a new concept but they are gaining cachet as marketers increasingly seek ways of reaching consumers who are trying to avoid advertising and consumers increasingly seek out brands that appear to share their values. A recent Advertiser Perceptions study found more than half of advertisers surveyed view and treat branded or sponsored content as more important now than it was before the pandemic.

This type of content is not necessarily a glorified commercial full of product placements. Notable examples include Patagonia's documentary-style films about issues like land use or Dove's sponsorship of the Oscar-winning animated short ""Hair Love"" without any stipulations around product placement.

The recent examples are many: Last week NBCUniversal said it was working with sponsor Target and producer Will Packer on short films from emerging Black filmmakers to run on NBCU's channels and digital platforms. Companies like Indeed 3M and HP showed off films this week around the Tribeca Film Festival. On Friday top executives from brands like Google and Walmart gathered for Tribeca X a one-day conference about the combination of advertising and entertainment including formats like brand films. Roku  the conference's sponsor also just launched its own brand studio to produce creative ad formats and programming tailored for marketers.

""I think this is a huge trend"" said Tim Calkins a marketing professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. ""The core challenge for brands now is that it's very difficult to reach people. The decline in television advertising has taken away one of the main ways that brands would tell their story and help people learn about their business. And as a result brands are looking for ways to help people understand what their brand is really all about.""

DoorDash's film ""Soul of the City"" features New York City restaurant owners. The company had identified restaurants around the city that had been closed or were struggling due to the pandemic then worked to help them to open. The company worked with partners including Interpublic Group 's The Martin Agency on the film.

Before long DoorDash VP of marketing Kofi Amoo-Gottfried said the marketing team was doing all sorts of new functions.

""There's people on my team that were figuring out how to buy a smoker"" he said. ""Things that are not marketing's job but it became our job.""

Though DoorDash is running paid advertising behind its film on channels like YouTube the video contains little branding and focuses far more on the restaurateurs than itself.

""Brands for all intents and purposes are relatively self-serving organisms right?"" Amoo-Gottfried said. ""I think the thing that's been super clarifying for us at DoorDash… is we've always said we're in business to support local economies.""

And yes if restaurants and communities are thriving that's good business for DoorDash.

""If you look at the DoorDash spot that's not going to encourage anybody to rush out at that moment and order delivery or takeout"" Calkins said. ""So they don't drive short-term action. It's all about the long-term brand … it's a different sort of investment.""

But it's an investment brands seem to be increasingly making.

""As audiences continue to change as there continues to be a proliferation of streaming options and choice in what people watch and how people watch brands are looking to find breakthrough ways of reaching audiences that feels authentic because they know that that authentic connection with the brand is more powerful than than just one single tactic"" said Steven Rummer SVP of strategy and creative partnerships advertising & partnerships at NBCUniversal.

He said NBCUniversal's research studies have found 81% of people are more likely to buy or use brands who help others when it's needed most and that 79% of consumers are more loyal to brands who prioritize communities' well-being over business as usual.

""We have all this great research that shows the power and impact of doing these longer form brand films or branded content and the connection that it has with actual results on the advertiser side"" he said.

Of course this content actually has to be good Marcus Peterzell CEO of entertainment marketing agency Passion Point Collective said during a panel at Tribeca X.

""It's gotta be a great film. And if any consumers..."" (he paused to twist his face into a grimace) ""...because there's a Samsung phone stuck in their face you lose. A good film is a good film. It doesn't matter if Sony funded it or HP funded it. It's still a great film.""

Peterzell used the example of 3M's new film ""Not The Science Type"" which discusses stereotypes and how they can hurt STEM diversity equity and inclusion. He said that there are plenty of great film ideas out there and if a brand is the catalyzing force for making an important film happen ""that alone is a win for a brand.""

With so many options a brand film has to be something someone will press play on despite infinite options.

""When you think about creating content with a brand or for a brand how do we make sure it's entertaining first and actually content first"" said Chris Bruss head of the Roku Brand Studio said in a panel during Tribeca X. ""If it's not entertaining then it can't appropriately live on a Roku Channel or a Hulu.""

FORMER Celtic loanee Diego Laxalt is on his way to Russian outfit FC Dynamo Moscow and will have a medical tomorrow according to reports.

The Uruguayan left-back was hit-and-miss during his time at Parkhead and was dropped towards the end of the season by interim boss John Kennedy.

We told you earlier this month how the 28-year-old was at the centre of a three-way battle across Europe for his services.

Turkish powerhouse Besiktas Portuguese giants Porto and Dynamo all made enquiries about the full-back who can also play on the left side of midfield.

According to Tuttosport in Italy the Russian club are preparing to welcome Laxalt to Moscow tomorrow for a medical before completing a €3.5m (just over £3m) switch from AC Milan.

It's believed the versatile Uruguayan will sign a four-year deal.

Laxalt started life brightly at Celtic and some thought the Hoops would be more than tempted to trigger his release clause and look to make his loan permanent.

But as Celtic's season worsened so did Laxalt's and he was less than a bit-part player in the last weeks of the campaign.

Indeed he only got back into the side at all after Christmas when Greg Taylor picked up an injury in the 1-0 defeat to Ross County in late February.

Laxalt made 26 appearances in all competitions for the Hoops last season with his one goal coming against Hibs in the Premiership as the sides drew 2-2 at Easter Road in November.

He joined Celtic in October last year after fellow left-back Boli Bolingoli was shipped out on loan to Istanbul Başakşehir following his Covid jaunt to Spain flouting government guidelines at the time.

Meanwhile Celtic and Scotland star Ryan Christie is a potential 'signing target' for two French Ligue 1 clubs according to reports.

The attacking midfielder's contract runs out in January and that means he is able to discuss a move with suitor clubs this summer.

Given the 26-year-old's unusual deal at Parkhead it's believed that will pressure the Hoops into accepting an offer before the window shuts in September rather than risk losing him for free.

According to the Sunday Post Ligue 1 duo AS Monaco and Nice have been credited with 'interest' in the Scotland ace currently on Euro 2020 duty.

Previously Burnley Norwich City and Southampton were thought to have been the main contenders for the attacking midfielder's signature.

But it's said Christie would actually prefer a move to France over the Premier League.

Abbott as 'career politician' vows to try to close all Mexico border crossings if elected,"“My opponent’s a career politician and [after] 31 years in office he's interested in his career” Huffines said on Sunday's Inside Texas Politics.

DALLAS — Don Huffines vowed to close all border crossings across the Rio Grande River if elected as Texas' next governor to force Mexico to address undocumented immigrants that are crossing into the United States.

Huffines a former Republican state senator from Dallas is campaigning against Gov. Greg Abbott in the upcoming Republican primary for governor.

“There’s 25 crossings over the river that Texas has. I'm going to close every single one of those in one day because I'm the actual Republican running and I'm actually going to solve this problem once and for all"" Huffines told Inside Texas Politics.

The candidate said he believes that by closing the crossings the economic impact that would have would force Mexico to act.

""[I’m] going to close all the crossings down for all inbound commercial traffic from Mexico. We're going to make Mexico acquiesce economically to secure their side of the river and stop these cartels.""

To be clear though the ports of entry are operated by the federal government not the state.

But attempting to suspend commercial traffic between the two countries would hurt Texas businesses since Mexico is the state’s largest trading partner not to mention exacerbate the already strained supply chain.

Huffines believes that by putting the pressure on though he could achieve results.

“Yes but in Texas here's the thing. I'm going to communicate to Mexico and they know it they need us a lot more than we need them and this is a proven tactic that can work” Huffines explained. “We don't have an option. We have to secure Texas’ border and stop these cartels and this invasion and I'm not going to be asking permission from the federal government to do that.""

Huffines is ramping up his campaign to challenge Abbott in the Republican primary next year. Huffines opened a campaign office near DFW Airport and said he has more than 30 staffers already.

During the television interview Huffines attacked Abbott for being a career politician.

“Republicans are tired of being lied to. We're just tired of broken and empty promises. The border is just not secure. Our property taxes keep going up and up we don't have confidence in our election"" Huffines said. ""Look I can go on and on but the bottom line is my opponent’s a career politician and 31 years in office he's interested in his career.""

One of the first announcements that Huffines made after declaring his candidacy was that he would have the state build its own border wall along the Rio Grande.

A border wall is red meat for Republican primary voters. Former president Donald Trump campaigned on extending a border wall and making Mexico pay for it. During his term Trump got 80 miles of additional fencing built but U.S. taxpayers ended up footing the bill not Mexico.

Last week Abbott took Huffines’ idea and made it his own.

In a news conference the governor announced that Texas would build its own border wall. Abbott said he would take $250 million from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice’s budget to begin the design phase. Abbott then asked for public donations to pay for more of it.

But the governor acknowledged a reality in this bid for Republican primary voters. Texas does not have any land along the Rio Grande River to construct more border fencing. Abbott asked private landowners to donate that too.

Huffines was asked on Inside Texas Politics how he would acquire the land to erect a new wall.

“Well Texas does have condemnation authority of course. We condemn for highways. First we'll work with landowners that want to cooperate but this is not an option we have” Huffines told the television program.

Huffines said Abbott stole his campaign idea for a state-constructed wall.

“Well he certainly did. He really did. This is my idea to secure the… border is just resonating so well for Republican voters because not only do we want to I want to finish Trump's wall or build a Texas wall but I'm going to do whatever is necessary to secure our border” Huffines added.

But Abbott now has a head start with this issue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIxLzA2LzE5L3RleGFzLWdvdi1ncmVnLWFiYm90dC12ZXRvZXMtcGFydC1idWRnZXQtZnVuZHMtbGVnaXNsYXR1cmUvNzc1Nzc5ODAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Gov. Greg Abbott vetoes part of budget that funds Legislature after Democrat walkout,"Gov. Greg Abbott has vetoed the part of the state budget bill that would fund the Texas Legislature.

The action came after Abbott had threatened to do so at the end of May after the legislative session ended abruptly when members of the Texas House Democrats left the chamber causing bills including an election reform bill he strongly favored to expire.

""Texans don’t run from a legislative fight and they don’t walk away from unfinished business"" Abbott said in a statement late in the day Friday. ""Funding should not be provided for those who quit their job early leaving their state with unfinished business and exposing taxpayers to higher costs for an additional legislative session. I therefore object to and disapprove of these appropriations.""

The budget is to take effect Sept. 1. Abbott is expected to push the voting restrictions bill again during a special session.

""Texas has a governor not a dictator or emperor"" House Democratic Caucus Chair Chris Turner D-Grand Prairie said in a statement after the veto. ""The tyrannical veto of the legislative branch is the latest indication that Governor Greg Abbott is simply out of control.""

In addition to cutting the $600 monthly salaries for lawmakers Abbott's veto of Article 10 of Senate Bill 1 also cuts the budget for thousands of employees at agencies that support efforts at the Capitol including legislative staff support services the Legislative Budget Board Legislative Council and the state auditor's office.

""By placing a termination date on the employment of all legislative staff the governor is cutting off services to millions of Texans” Turner said adding that the caucus is exploring every option including legal action.

Abbott said last week he would bring lawmakers back to Austin for a special legislative session in September or October for redistricting after census data is released in August and to allocate roughly $16 billion in federal coronavirus relief money. The governor has signaled he expects lawmakers to pass the elections bill and legislation intended to change the state's bail system when they reconvene at an as yet unscheduled earlier special session.

The elections measure known as Senate Bill 7 in the regular session would end drive-thru voting and overnight voting and it would limit early voting on Sundays and mail-in balloting. Democrats said it would disproportionately affect Black Latino and older voters; Republicans say the measure would protect election integrity and reduce opportunities for voter fraud.

In an interview June 2 with the USA TODAY Network Abbott said lawmakers could restore legislative funding during a special session before the two-year budget kicks in on Sept. 1. That means that if Democrats again boycott the special session on the elections measure to again thwart its passage Abbott's spending veto would stick and that no one who works in the legislative branch of government would be paid after Sept. 1.

House Speaker Dade Phelan R-Beaumont told the Texas Tribune on Friday that a veto of the entire Legislature’s budget would hurt the wrong people while lawmakers whose $600-per-month pay is written into the Texas Constitution would still get their paychecks.

“My concern is how it impacts staff especially those who live here in Austin which is not an inexpensive place to live and raise your family and children” Phelan a former legislative staffer told the Tribune. “And the agencies it impacts — Sunset Legislative Reference Library Lege Council — I’m just concerned how it impacts them because they weren’t the ones who decided that we were gonna break quorum it wasn’t their decision right?”

Rep. Donna Howard D-Austin is among those questioning the constitutionality of Abbott's veto.

""Abbott’s irresponsible veto of funding for the legislative branch of state govt is political theater w/ serious consequences for >2000 state employees who help #txlege members do their jobs and also threatens our democratic form of govt based on 3 equal branches"" Howard tweeted.

But the Tribune reports that courts in other states have upheld vetoes of legislative budgets by governors of both parties. Two states Hawaii and Michigan have constitutional statutes that bar governors from vetoing or reducing legislative or judicial appropriations according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Texas does not.

In his first College World Series at-bat the light-hitting catcher for Virginia homered for the first time this season. Jeff Michaels a three-year pancreatic cancer survivor was there to see his son do it — and more — in the Cavaliers' 6-0 victory over Tennessee.

After the game television cameras showed a beaming Jeff Michaels holding the treasured ball in the stands behind the Virginia dugout.

“For someone to bring him the home run ball and obviously for it to happen on Father's Day and at the College World Series — definitely a special moment for our family and for my dad and I” Logan said.

Logan Michaels hit Chad Dallas’ hanging breaking ball out to left in the second inning for only his second homer in 343 at-bats since he joined the Cavaliers in 2019. His RBI single to center began a four-run seventh inning and he singled and scored the Cavs’ final run in the ninth.

“When I hit that over the fence I instantly started thinking about my dad” Logan said. “I was sitting in the dugout after it happened and I got pretty emotional. For him to be here for what he went through in the past just for him to be able to see that I couldn’t ask for any more.”

While Michaels provided a good portion of the offense Andrew Abbott was at his best on the mound. The senior left-hander pitched six shutout innings and Matt Wyatt finished against what had been a powerful Tennessee offense averaging eight runs with 16 homers in its first five NCAA Tournament games.

“Andrew made some big key clutch pitches with runners in scoring position in multiple innings” Virginia coach Brian O'Connor said. “That’s what your Friday night guy your leader your All-American needs to do to win in Omaha.”

Virginia (36-25) continued its improbable postseason surge after making the tournament as a No. 3 regional seed. The Cavaliers are the first team since 2008 to make it to Omaha after losing openers in regionals and super regionals. They had to win six elimination games to advance to the CWS for the first time since they won the 2015 national championship.

Tennessee (50-17) the No. 3 national seed came to the CWS off a six-home run game in a 15-6 super regional-clinching win over LSU. Against Virginia the Vols had no extra-base hits struck out 13 times and were held scoreless for the first time since April 16.

Abbott (9-6) allowed five singles walked two and struck out 10 as Virginia posted its sixth shutout of the season and second of the tournament. Dallas (11-2) went 6 1/3 innings and took the loss.

“There were some moments whether it be on the mound or at the plate that we lacked conviction and it cost us a little bit” Tennessee coach Tony Vitello said. ""Toward the end when the sore wasn't the way we wanted it we uncharacteristically lost our edge a little bit. Vols fans deserve better but it wasn’t like there wasn’t some try-hard and preparation. If anything there may have been too much.""

Tennessee at the CWS for the first time since 2005 had runners on third base three times with less than two outs but couldn't push across a run. Abbott got a couple strikeouts to get out of the first inning and second baseman Max Cotier saved a run with a leaping catch of a liner and shortstop Nic Kent pick up a grounder in the hole to throw out a runner in the fifth.

In the sixth Tennessee's Luc Lipicus got caught looking at strike three and Jordan Beck went down swinging at a belt-high fastball.

“I got in more jams than I would have liked to make things interesting” Abbott said. “Having the team defense behind me and having (our) hitters stepping up at the plate made the difference.”

The day belonged to Michaels and his father.

Michaels came into the game batting .240 (6 for 25) in seven tournament games and .242 for the season. Jeff Michaels has been able to attend a few games each season including super regionals last week.

No one would have envisioned Logan putting on the performance he did though he said someone had asked him Saturday if he was going to hit a home run against Tennessee.

“I wanted to say yes” he said.

O'Connor paused and was a bit choked up when asked about Michaels' game.

“There was a time three years ago I didn’t know if Logan Michaels would show up to campus with what he was dealing with with his father” O'Connor said. “This day is special for all of us but for him I’m just elated for him that he can perform for his team and his father can sit there and watch him do it.”

The 21 largest firms on the Business Journal’s annual list reported a 3.7% decline in consultants to 1515 and a 4.7% drop in OC employees to 3841 compared to year-ago levels.



Two years ago the ranks of local consultants represented on the list approached 4500.



Management consultant firms provide an array of specialists in information technology operations strategy and mergers and acquisitions aimed at improving the performance of businesses.



No. 1 Accenture which has an Irvine office reduced its headcount by 13% to 295 compared with a 3.4% increase in the prior year. Its OC employee count also fell 3.7% to 340.



Marty Hodgett is the new officer managing director for Southern California taking over for David Wolf who left earlier this year for an executive position at GlobalLogic.



Deloitte LLP which has an office in Costa Mesa fell 10% to 277 consultants placing it at No. 2.



The New York-based firm which can still claim the title of largest OC accounting firm has a new managing partner Marshall Solomon.



This week’s list ranks the largest management consulting firms with a minimum cutoff of 10 area consultants. The list includes management consulting firms with headquarters in Orange County and others with operations here.



Irvine is clearly the city to be a consultant as 13 reported its offices here followed by Newport Beach with three offices and Costa Mesa with two.



Only seven of the firms reported an increase in consultants compared to 11 on last year’s list.



Five reported declines while nine had no change.



Companywide firms grew 6.3% to 1.5 million employees similar to a 6.1% growth a year ago.

Notable Changes



• The biggest increase by the number of employees was Irvine-based Blythe Global Advisors LLC which jumped 76% to 79 workers. The company ranks No. 8.



Its companywide count also climbed 29% to 99. A year ago its headcount fell 22% to 45 consultants.



• The biggest decline was No. 11 Moss Adams which fell 38% to 31 consultants. Its OC employee count increased 6% from a year ago to 283.



• No. 9 Resources Global Professionals also known as RGP (Nasdaq: RGP) continued to reduce its OC consulting workforce as consultants went down 16% to 76. A year ago it had trimmed 14%.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vZXJwLnRvZGF5L3otemFocmEtYmFocm9sb2xvdW1pLWNlby11a2ktc2FsZXNmb3JjZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zahra Bahrololoumi CEO UK&I Salesforce,"A 22 year veteran of consulting giant Accenture Zahra Bahrololoumi – or Z as she is known to her friends – has made the monumental leap from consultancy to vendor and now finds herself sitting at the top table within the world’s most progressive software company – Salesforce.

In 2018 Salesforce announced it would invest heavily in the UK market – some $2.5bn – over the next five years. That commitment was backed up by the announcement of a further $2bn investment in Ireland along with a pledge to create 1500 new jobs within the same timeframe. Salesforce which had always derived the vast majority of its revenues from the US market was getting serious about the UK.

However Bahrololoumi isn’t the first person to have taken the job on. In 2019 when Salesforce first ramped up its commitment to the UK it appointed Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia as the UK CEO. Gadhia was the former CEO at Virgin Money and held a number of government advisory positions. Whilst Gadhia is one of the best-known female leaders in the UK and shares many of the same principles as Bahrololoumi in terms of advocating diversity and equality they were two very different appointments.

Gadhia arrived at Salesforce as a seasoned CEO with government-backed credentials whereas Bahrololoumi brings a much richer and more relevant toolkit in the form of front-line digital leadership customer value creation and deep technical knowledge. Gadhia was a statement signing that made sense at the time and gave Salesforce’s play some gravitas. Bahrololoumi is an entirely different proposition and provides the hands-on experience that will be needed to guide both Salesforce and its customers through the digital revolution.

22 years at the world’s biggest consulting firm (by number of employees) had seen Bahrololoumi rise up the ranks since joining the firm as Andersen Consulting in 1998 through to her departing role as UK&I technology and consulting lead. During her tenure she gained significant transformation experience with a number of blue-chip clients across several industries including retail oil and gas banking healthcare and telecoms. She pioneered a number of ‘firsts’ – from convening the UK technology ecosystem at the award-winning Kaleidoscope to patented uses of cloud technologies. She was also the driving force behind several of Accenture’s marquee acquisitions and oversaw the growth of its technology and consulting unit to become the deepest in terms of talent and expertise in the UK. She is a former vice chair of the Prince’s Trust Technology Leadership board and currently sits on the boards of techUK and Movement to Work.

A long list of accolades and achievements which I know from our time together embarrass her as much as they instil a sense of pride.

Bahrololoumi is a well-known and equally well-liked personality within the enterprise tech community. In researching for this article I couldn’t find a single person who had anything negative to say and all who know her describe a fun energetic highly articulate and capable leader. Liked by colleagues customers and partners alike – Bahrololoumi brings something to the world of enterprise tech that is noticeably lacking in many interactions – authenticity. It’s a word that is bandied around by corporate PR teams but is rarely evident and Bahrololoumi has it in spades. Her open and approachable manner is perfectly tempered by her indisputable knowledge authoritative yet calm demeanour and unmistakable passion for doing the right thing.

These are all admirable and highly desirable qualities but as I was driving through rural Northamptonshire on my way to ‘Bahrololoumi Towers’ for the interview – I couldn’t help but keep asking myself the same question: how big of a step up is this job? Sure Accenture isn’t exactly small fry and her role there was very senior – but Salesforce? In a CEO role? Knowing all the complexities that CEOs have to deal with and understanding the dramatic differences in culture between the two organisations I wondered – was she going to be up to it?

In late May as some restrictions to civil liberties were lifted I popped round for a cup of tea to ask her exactly that and to discuss her heritage responsibilities challenges and ambitions as she takes on her new role.

Zahra Bahrololoumi’s (from here on Z) ascension to the role of EVP and CEO UK&I at Salesforce is nothing short of meteoric and is some achievement for a girl who was once told by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) that she couldn’t fulfil her dream of becoming a diplomat because her skin was the wrong colour.

Born to Iranian parents Z’s family came to the UK in the early 1970s and the hostilities and hardships endured by her countrymen and women had a profound and lasting effect.

Conflict was the backdrop to much of my youth. Although I wasn’t living in it I have family there so it was a reality albeit a distant one. I felt very passionately about peace which sounds really naff but that’s how I’m wired. I think I’m a good collaborator and I can see things from lots of different angles. I talked about it quite a lot with my Dad and my dream was to make a career in diplomacy and to do my bit towards bringing peace to the world.”

Of course times have changed and the recruiting policies of most organisations have improved significantly since the days when an employer could determine your suitability for a job based on where your parents were born. But the FCO’s loss was Accenture’s (Andersen Consulting) gain and in 1998 Z started her career in technology.

However she was somewhat of a reluctant employee to begin with: having completed a degree in Management Science at Brunel University it seemed an obvious path to fall into management consulting. A high achiever throughout school and university Z had all the credentials that the blossoming consulting world was looking for. However she was adamantly not interested in a career in management consulting and insisted on being employed in a technical capacity despite having virtually no technical skills.

When I was interviewing at Andersen Consulting they offered me a job in what was then change management and is now considered management consulting. I said ‘Thanks but no. Unless I can join technology I’m not joining.’ And they said ‘Well you’ve got no technology skills.’ And I’m like ‘Yeah I know that but it’s the future and I really want to learn.’ I knew Anderson would give me a great platform so I took the job and the rest is history.”

The following is taken from our Q&A during a COVID-secure interview at her home.

Usually when a person commits two decades to an organisation they are often there for life. Z had served 22 years for Accenture so the two burning questions have to be: ‘why leave and why join Salesforce?’

ZB “Leaving Accenture wasn’t an easy decision because I was really happy. Accenture’s a wonderful place and it still is really close to my heart but the opportunity to work inside Salesforce was just too compelling to ignore. When I think about Salesforce it’s a leader in its field and it’s so purpose driven and value led. The values they’ve got – trust customer success innovation and equality – they really chime with me.

“They haven’t just pivoted to these values they were always very purposeful in their leadership and I wanted to experience it for myself. I knew this was another experience to have in my lifetime. So it was an easy choice to join Salesforce but it was less easy to say goodbye to the wonderful Accenture.”

Everyone likes a bit of gossip and I guess they’d like to know about how you actually got the job. I’m assuming that you didn’t put your CV on Indeed?

ZB “Ha! Not exactly. I was approached by a headhunter. Initially I was quite dismissive not because I was dismissive of Salesforce – I really loved the company – I was just very happy at Accenture. I started to have informal conversations with leadership at Salesforce and the only way I can describe it was a very warm embracing hug. The recruitment process was fascinating. It didn’t feel like I was being grilled through a series of interviews. It felt like there was a two-way conversation to allow me to test whether this was the right company for me. I’m extremely loyal – 22 years in one place. You don’t walk away from that easily or lightly.”

I knew this was another experience to have in my lifetime. So it was an easy choice to join Salesforce but it was less easy to say goodbye to the wonderful Accenture.”

I mentioned your experience with the FCO in my introduction which must have been an upsetting and disappointing experience. But how challenging was it to break into consulting in 1998 for an Iranian girl with dark skin and no tech skills?

ZB “My heritage wasn’t necessarily the big thing that was on my mind – it was the lack of technology skills! However I was one of only two women in my technology start group and there was no one that looked like me! I was the only dark girl in my intake and at the time Andersen Consulting didn’t have the kind of policies and outlook that we have today.”

How has your gender and heritage impacted your career? Do you think it’s helped or hindered you?

ZB “I definitely don’t feel like I was hindered. Anderson Consulting [and subsequently Accenture] have matured and now they really are world class in terms of their stance and their impact in the space of inclusion and diversity. I’ve been part of that journey and I feel really proud of what Accenture does today. Even at the start I was pleasantly surprised at how egalitarian Andersen was. You did good work you proved yourself you delivered and you were recognised for it.”

What’s been the biggest changes you have seen in the enterprise tech world during your 22 years – apart from the technology itself?

ZB “We were quite constrained in the ‘90s and we were very formal. You were in suits there was a certain polish and I think things relaxed post the dot.com boom. I think that dot.com boom paved the way for people to become more themselves.”

Yes suddenly success looked very different – how did that impact you and your career?

ZB “I still have a slide that I use when I talk to folks about my career journey. It’s from pre 2000 and everything is black and white and sepia and then literally after the dot.com boom everything was multicoloured. It’s like the tech world specifically moved into colour overnight.”

What drove you in those early days to become successful?

ZB “The main thing that fuelled my drive influenced my progression and set me apart was the influence of my parents. I remember growing up my parents always said to me ‘you have to work twice as hard as everyone else; first of all you’re a woman and secondly you’re a brown woman’. My parents sacrificed so much to stay in the UK and help me forge my career – so of course I had to succeed. They never pressured me not once but it is my life’s work to prove their decision to stay was the right one and to make them proud.”

And how did your early career at Andersen progress?

ZB “I was really fortunate that I got accelerated through pretty much every promotion point. I ask myself ‘why was that?’ I think my drive and focus I think anyone will tell you that I haven’t changed in 22 years. Some of the nicest things that friends and people have said to me that I’ve worked with over that period of time is that irrespective of your role you’ve been the same Z. And I think that is something I’ve held quite dear.”

You spent 22 years at Accenture and you were head of technology and consulting when you left. You now find yourself with a CEO title. Is this job a big step up for you?

ZB “Yes and no. If I consider the traditional dimensions of scale and the impact the roles are quite similar. It was a very large part of the business that I ran and was responsible for within Accenture. The customer accountability that I had and the customer responsibility was very similar.

“I think the thing that is different within Salesforce for me personally is the profile and the responsibility is a step up. There’s a deep sense of responsibility – the stakes that we have in powering the economic recovery – I feel an overwhelming sense of duty. As the face and the most senior individual across UK and Ireland that is very different that has a different profile for me and I love it. It weighs heavy but it’s rewarding.”

Salesforce on the other hand operates in a space where organisations can differentiate themselves by building unique relationships.”

How different is it being on the other side of the consulting vendor dynamic?

ZB “I constantly weigh this up and of course you can’t avoid the comparison. I think number one both Accenture and Salesforce are very purpose led and value driven. I think that remains the same on both sides.

“I think the key difference is within Accenture you have a customer base that sits within a specific profile. And within Salesforce what I absolutely love is that it serves so many different types of customers.”

You must be dealing with lots of companies that you wouldn’t have dealt with before; smaller SMBs right through to global enterprises.

ZB “That’s it. So that whole spectrum is a massive learning opportunity for me and you get to see different challenges across these different segments of the market. That’s been the biggest difference. The pace in each of the segments is so different and I’m finding that really mind-blowing and incredibly dynamic.”

What’s the best thing that you’ve learned about Salesforce that you didn’t know before you joined?

ZB “Oh so many things. I am blown away by the responsibility that Salesforce takes for enabling customers to be self-sufficient and successful. The whole Trailblazer programme that Salesforce runs the mentality of making sure that customers are adequately skilled and able to really get the value out of the solution sets I think has really opened my eyes. The other thing that I didn’t really count on was the heartbeat that comes from HQ. I think it is really quite strong and I’m learning so much from that. I thought we would be an outpost but everybody’s so integrated. It’s a large company yet it feels very intimate and accessible.”

How challenging has it been coming into this role during a global pandemic?

ZB “It’s a good question and of course during my first few weeks I couldn’t go and meet anyone so I did all my first meetings and customer engagements remotely. In those first couple of weeks I felt like I didn’t fully understand the context of my role in relation to everybody else. Even though I had the title you live your role by how you interact with others and how people respond to you. I could not get that sense for the first couple of weeks.

“However what really jumped out of the screen was just how alive the culture was. People were reaching out to me and I was given a really warm welcome. My onboarding was unbelievably world class. I’m a structured person but this was on another level.”

In Salesforce the mission is absolutely focussed on customer success and value and good things come from that if you focus on the greatest need.”

It hasn’t always been a priority for Salesforce has it? The investment in the UK and Ireland is fairly recent and hasn’t been a priority market until recently.

ZB “I think it’s always been an important market but the new commitment and allocation of investment is quite significant. There are lots of traditional measures that we’ll have to measure our success but I think there are three key metrics.

“Firstly customer success and that’s my number one priority. We are supporting our customers through their digitisation challenges and helping fuel the economic recovery. I think if we can do that successfully and I can see that we’re delivering the value then that is my first and actually my most important measure of success.

“The second thing is upholding and expanding the Salesforce culture. It is such a unique environment with innovation and purpose at the heart of everything it does. So upholding that ensuring that we have the right impact both internally and externally is something that I take very seriously as a priority.

“The third thing is something that is actually keeping me quite awake and that is the skilling of people that we need to do within UK and Ireland. The Salesforce ecosystem will create 143000 new jobs by 2024. You look at that and you think ‘wow that’s really amazing’. But the question is ‘who’s going to fill those jobs?’ We’re not short of people we’re short of skills and I don’t think Salesforce is unique in that. We’ve got this amazing platform called Trailhead. It’s a free platform that allows people to skill themselves and get certified. Upskilling reskilling and making sure we have the talent pipeline to fulfil our objectives is a key focus for us.”

And finally what milestones have you set yourself to measure your own performance?

ZB “As a Salesforce CEO because the chain is quite clear if we’re able to make our customers successful Salesforce will be successful. And if Salesforce is successful then personally I’m successful and my teams are successful. In my opinion that is the correct chain. In Salesforce the mission is absolutely focussed on customer success and value and good things come from that if you focus on the greatest need.

“It is the one thing I talk to customers about the most – focus on the greatest need. Solve that problem and then move to the next greatest need. It’s a common thread through my career. Every career stage or client environment I was in there was always a big need somewhere. It was either recovery get this delivered by tomorrow or sell more. If I focussed on that then the success would follow. That is the key to unlocking customer value and that is the single biggest focus for me my teams and Salesforce.”

So what did I learn from my time with Z and what are my big takeaways?

There is no doubt that Zahra is a competent gracious and technically-minded leader. In terms of her personality and character I can see the fit with Salesforce working hand in glove. She is a strong advocate for many of the values that Salesforce has been built on and the entrepreneurial environment will allow her to flourish to full potential.

The skills shortage is a concern but the main challenge will be to carve out an identity for Salesforce in the region. Salesforce is a very American company and although there is nothing wrong with that the new UK&I CEO will need to find a way to put her own stamp on this market and bring the Salesforce brand to life for UK customers.

I have no doubt that Zahra will succeed. As I said earlier she brings something to a leadership role that very few manage to execute – a combination of authenticity knowledge empathy modesty and purpose. Her relaxed personality should not be confused with being easy going or lax – but who doesn’t want to have fun while they are saving the world? Watch this space for great things from Salesforce in the UK and Ireland…

The main thing that fuelled my drive influenced my progression and set me apart was the influence of my parents”

A bit about Salesforce

So what do we need to know about Salesforce? Well pretty much everyone recognises Salesforce as a CRM vendor – that’s customer relationship management – and companies of all shapes and sizes use their products and services to manage sales opportunities and marketing activities. Unlike most other proprietary software vendors the Salesforce offering cuts across geographies industries and size of customer and boasts more than 150000 customers worldwide.

Salesforce was one of the original cloud companies set up by Marc Benioff and a small cohort of software engineers in February 1999. The firm’s base of operations was a one bedroom apartment in San Francisco and was launched with the aim of becoming ‘a world-class internet company for sales force automation’ or to bring about ‘the end of software’ depending on whether you reference Benioff’s original marketing statement or the one currently on the SFDC web site.

Salesforce.com (SFDC) business model was truly revolutionary. The proprietary software industry had been selling business applications as locally hosted products for more than 50 years but Benioff et al conceived a better way to deploy and manage business technology by extending the concept of application service providers to a fully remote provision of applications as a service.

From the outset Benioff and the other co-founders believed in an obligation to develop a company built on principles”

Not only was the technical deployment of these applications a radical shift from the norm so too was the pricing model. Benioff believed that subscription billing which goes up as customers use more and down if they use less was a far more equitable way to charge for services. Allied to this avant-garde approach to products and pricing SFDC was one of the first companies to be born out of purpose. From the outset Benioff and the other co-founders believed in an obligation to develop a company built on principles – what we call today corporate social responsibility. The founders wrote their V2MOM (Vision Values Methods Obstacles and Measures) strategic plan in late 1999 and was designed to provide employees with a clear vision for the business and align the organisation around common goals. In true start-up fashion the original draft was written on the back of an envelope and even today V2MOM remains at the core of how SFDC runs its business and continues to guide the decisions they make.

Salesforce is the number one CRM worldwide and its focus on industry specific solutions will only solidify its position as the benchmark. It currently offers 12 vertical clouds that provide purpose-built functionality data models and processes all designed by industry experts. It ranks as number one on the new Cloud Wars Industry Cloud top 10 list and boasts an impressive industry cloud run rate of more than $2bn some way ahead of its nearest rivals: Google Oracle SAP and Infor. In 2020 Salesforce significantly expanded its industry-specific product portfolio acquiring Vlocity and adding four more industry products in media communications energy & utilities as well as new public sector solutions.

Our view is that Salesforce will become more dominant and relevant in the near-term as it offers something that very few other software vendors can – differentiation. No enterprise can carve out a niche through core ERP applications – one finance module is the same as the next and core ERP (other than equally vertical-specific offerings) are soon to become commoditised solutions which add very little in the way of contrast. Salesforce on the other hand operates in a space where organisations can differentiate themselves by building unique relationships delivering personalised services and driving sales with both new and existing customers. As businesses rebound from the last 18 months the emphasis on growing sales maintaining customer relationships and delivering unique and personalised services will intensify. Creating seamless experiences and developing new and innovative ways to attract and retain customers will be the number one priority for enterprise leaders and Salesforce is uniquely positioned to capitalise on that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhhbnNpbmRpYS5jb20vbmV3cy9jaXRpZXMva2hhbW1hbS9raGFtbWFtLXNiaXQtc3R1ZGVudHMtc2VjdXJlcy1qb2JzLWluLWFjY2VudHVyZS1jb21wYW55LTY5MTY3M9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhhbnNpbmRpYS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvY2l0aWVzL2toYW1tYW0va2hhbW1hbS1zYml0LXN0dWRlbnRzLXNlY3VyZXMtam9icy1pbi1hY2NlbnR1cmUtY29tcGFueS02OTE2NzM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Khammam: SBIT students secures jobs in Accenture company,"Khammam: Nine B.Tech students of Swarna Bharathi Institute of Science & Technology (SBIT) secured jobs in noted MNC Accenture informed the College Chairman Gundala Krishna ( RJC Krishna).

InDesign supports not only INDD and INDT but also InDesign Book (INDB) QuarkXPress (QXD and QXT) InDesign CS3 Interchange (INX) and other InDesign file formats like INDP INDL and IDAP. You can also use a JOBOPTIONS file with this program.

How to Convert an INDD File

Using an INDD viewer or editor from above will let you convert the INDD file to another format but as you'll see below some conversions require a bit more work.

The most common file type to convert an INDD file to is PDF. Both InDesign and WeAllEdit can do that.

Also within InDesign under the File > Export menu is the option to export the INDD file to JPG EPS EPUB SWF FLA HTML XML and IDML. You can choose which format to convert the INDD file to by changing the ""Save as type"" option.

If you're converting INDD to JPG you'll see that there are some custom options you can pick from like whether to export just a selection or the entire document. You can also change the image quality and resolution. See Adobe's Export to JPEG format guide for help understanding the options.

You can also convert the INDD file to a Microsoft Word format like DOC or DOCX but the formatting differences will likely make the result look a bit off. However if you want to do this you should first export the INDD to PDF (using InDesign) and then plug that PDF into a PDF to Word converter to finish the conversion.

InDesign doesn't have a specific INDD to PPTX export option for using the document with PowerPoint. However similar to what's explained above for how to use the file with Word start by exporting it to PDF. Then open the PDF file with Adobe Acrobat and use Acrobat's File > Save As Other > Microsoft PowerPoint Presentation menu to save it as a PPTX file.

If you need the PPTX file to be in a different MS PowerPoint format like PPT you can use PowerPoint itself or a free document converter to convert the file.

iXentric SaveBack converts INDD to IDML if you need to use the file in InDesign CS4 and newer. IDML files are ZIP-compressed Adobe InDesign Markup Language files that use XML files to represent the InDesign document.

If you're on a Mac the file can be converted to PSD for use in Adobe Photoshop. However you can't do this with InDesign or any of the other programs mentioned above. See How to Save InDesign Files as Layered Photoshop Files for information on a Mac script that can make this happen.

You might be able to repair a corrupt INDD file with Stellar Phoenix InDesign Repair. It should help you recover any layers text objects bookmarks hyperlinks and the like.

Still Can't Open the File?

If none of the programs mentioned above let you open the file you have it's possible that it's in a different format and just looks like an INDD file.

For example PDD and IDX share some of the same file extension letters but they're in entirely different file formats. Just because they appear similar to INDD doesn't necessarily mean that they can be opened with the same programs.

Many other examples could be given but the idea is the same: make sure the file extension actually reads as ""INDD"" and not just something that looks similar or shares some of the same file extension letters.

If you don't have an INDD file research the real extension for your file to learn more about its format and the program(s) that's capable of opening it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vYmFjaGVsb3JldHRlLWdhcnJldHQtc2Nod2FydHotaW5zdGFncmFtLWpvYi1ob21ldG93bi1mYW1pbHktZmFjdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bachelorette: Garrett Schwartz's Age Instagram Job Hometown & More,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vYmFjaGVsb3JldHRlLWdhcnJldHQtc2Nod2FydHotaW5zdGFncmFtLWpvYi1ob21ldG93bi1mYW1pbHktZmFjdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3RoZWNpdHlsaWZlLm9yZy8yMDIxLzA2LzIwL2plZXAtc3VyZi1yYW5jaC1wcm8tcHJlc2VudGVkLWJ5LWFkb2JlLWhlYXRzLXVwLXdpdGgtZmlyc3QtZWxpbWluYXRpb25zLWZpbmFscy1kYXktZHJhdy10YWtlcy1zaGFwZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeep Surf Ranch Pro Presented by Adobe Heats Up with First Eliminations Finals Day Draw Takes Shape,"Gabriel Medina Clinches Place in WSL Final 5

The Jeep Surf Ranch Pro presented by Adobe the sixth stop of the World Surf League (WSL) Championship Tour (CT) witnessed its first eliminations on day two with Johanne Defay (FRA) and Filipe Toledo (BRA) topping the women’s and men’s leaderboards.

Competition sizzled through the remaining heats in the Qualifying Round and the first of the Bonus Runs an additional two waves awarded to the top 12 ranked women and 24 ranked men and one last chance to secure a place in the Semifinals.



A dominant performance from Johanne Defay (FRA) the 2019 event runner-up saw her finish the day in first place on the event leaderboard. The Olympic qualifier and current World No. 5 earned an 8.50 and an 8.13 and moves one step closer to her place in the Semifinals which will be decided after the women’s Bonus Run.



“It feels good to get some good scores” said Defay. “There was no wind at that moment so the wave was really good” said Defay. “I’m excited for tomorrow. I want to be able to show a bit more in the next round.

The four-time reigning WSL Champion Carissa Moore (HAW) built her scoreline and after her second run of the Qualifying Rounds and concluded the day in second place on the event leaderboard.

“It’s been a really fun season so far” said Moore. “People tell me I have a big lead but actually it’s not that big of a lead if you do the throwaways. I still have work to do I need to keep the foot on the gas and keep giving my best.

Sally Fitzgibbons (AUS) and Tatiana Weston-Webb (BRA) sit in third and fourth place respectively with Caroline Marks (USA) just below the Semifinals cut line in fifth place. The top six will look to improve their scores when they start Day 3 with a Bonus Run.

Surfers sitting below the Top 12 cutline for women at the end of day were eliminated from competition including Amuro Tsuzuki (JPN) and Brisa Hennessy (CRI) who will now refocus on surfing’s Olympic debut in Tokyo next month.

Two-time WSL Champion Gabriel Medina (BRA) became the first surfer to clinch their spot in the WSL Final 5 and will officially be competing for the World Title at the Rip Curl WSL Finals in September.

“It feels amazing! I feel blessed to have put in some good performances in Australia and now here” said Medina. “This year’s been an amazing journey I’m enjoying every moment of it and I’m so ready for the finals. It was my goal this year so I’m glad I got it. See you soon Trestles!”

With a combined score of 17.00 (out of a possible 20) Medina finished Day 2 in second place on the event leaderboard behind fellow Brazilian Filipe Toledo who held onto the top spot with an excellent 8.93 in his second run.

“I’ve won here at Surf Ranch before so I know how the waves are here” said Medina. “My boards are really good right now which gives me a lot of confidence. I’m taking it wave by wave and I’m ready to put in a good show tomorrow.”

Kanoa Igarashi (JPN) Yago Dora (BRA) and Owen Wright (AUS) held onto their place in the Top 8 heading into the final day of competition alongside Brazilian World Champions Adriano de Souza (BRA).

The Bonus Run saw Ethan Ewing (AUS) improve on his score and jump up into the Top 8 pushing 11x World Champion Kelly Slater (USA) into 10th place just below the Semifinals cutline.

“I feel pretty good” said Ewing. “It feels amazing to finish a left because I’ve been really struggling with that it’s really hard. Hopefully I can stay in that Top 8 it sounds really good to be in the finals day.”

On the final two waves of the day Griffin Colapinto (USA) served up a pair of sevens to move up into fourth place on the event leaderboard displacing reigning WSL Champion Italo Ferreira (BRA).

“I love the pressure situations and there’s so many thoughts going through your head which you’re trying to decipher” said Colapinto. “Getting into the Final 5 goes through my head every day people are lying if they say it doesn’t. It’s just how you handle it and it’s a fun game.”

The Bay Area’s largest city can now be a top-notch performer measured by much more than its status as the only municipality in Northern California with a population of 1 million or more people.

“The stars are aligning for downtown San Jose” San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said in an interview. “They are aligning around public sector infrastructure investment and private sector investment.”

San Jose’s downtown is dwarfed in size by the downtowns in Oakland and San Francisco when measured by square footage. Yet more towers have begun to sprout lately including multiple residential highrises and two office towers one being constructed by tech titan Adobe and another by veteran developer Jay Paul Co. Many more highrises are in the works.

Transit links are plentiful with a train hub at the Diridon Station that connects to Caltrain Amtrak ACE Train Capitol Corridor and light rail. Two BART stops including one at Diridon Station are planned and a high-speed rail line might also zoom into downtown someday.

Years ago San Jose soared past San Francisco in population but despite that claim to fame San Jose consistently lingers in the tower-high prestige shadows cast by San Francisco.

A population boom ushered in by decades of sprawl and annexations a proclamation of San Jose as “The Capital of Silicon Valley” the headquarters of Adobe better weather lower office rents and a more liveable city all weren’t enough for San Jose’s downtown to be deemed a major urban core with everything that other lively downtowns can boast.

But in late 2016 the purchase of an old bakery building near the train station followed by a string of purchases of other unassuming properties in the same area became the prologue to a potentially stunning transformation of the western edges of downtown.

One of the world’s most famous companies — search titan Google — was behind the purchase of scores of properties needed for a transit-oriented neighborhood of offices homes hotel facilities shops restaurants cultural centers and open spaces now known as Downtown West where the tech giant could employ 25000 people.

“News of the demise of the downtown in America has been greatly exaggerated and has been particularly exaggerated in downtown San Jose” Mayor Liccardo said.

Google’s involvement in such a high-profile way has in turn unleashed a modern-day Gold Rush by a host of developers large and small in the city’s urban core.

“It’s San Jose’s turn now” said Gary Dillabough a principal executive with developer Urban Community. “If we do our job correctly and create the right environment in San Jose the downtown is going to really take off.”

Still the path to success could be tricky according to some property experts.

Chief among the obstacles: Rents for prime office buildings in downtown San Jose haven’t topped the benchmark of $4.25 a square foot a month. Experts believe rents would have to be more in the range of $5.25 to $5.50 a square foot to generate enough leasing income to justify the cost of construction of brand-new offices.

Another potential problem: The economy could tumble again as part of a normal upswing and downturn cycle that has nothing to do with the coronavirus or other extraordinary events which would cause tenant demand to fade.

But for now the South Bay city’s modest skyline and relatively plentiful surface parking lots and under-utilized sites may be among the factors that have attracted the attention of a unique mega-developer.

Westbank is a real estate firm that concentrates its endeavors in only a few cities rather than the patten often exhibited by global developers that have projects in every market in a country or a continent. Westbank which has teamed up with Dillabough is now focusing on downtown San Jose.

“What interests me in San Jose is that there is a canvas where we can make a meaningful impact relatively quickly” said Ian Gillespie Westbank’s chief executive officer.

Canada-based Westbank also prefers to launch an in-depth commitment to a city rather than build one project and head to the next market. Besides San Jose Westbank’s focus has been on the Canadian cities of Vancouver and Toronto Seattle and in Japan.

“This is not a one-off with a few projects” said Andrew Jacobson who is heading up Westbank’s San Jose initiative. “We will have a presence over the long term. We put 150% effort into everything we do. We go deep into a market.”

Similarly Google seeks to produce a major positive difference for San Jose as it creates a transit-oriented neighborhood.

“We have sophisticated players making multi-billion-dollar bets on downtown San Jose’s future” Mayor Liccardo said.

Despite the push toward remote work encouraged by the pandemic experts believe downtowns remain in vogue and office centers will be the primary place where employees congregate and work.

“The office is no longer just a place where you have a computer” said Shawn Kellenberger an executive managing director with Newmark a commercial real estate firm. “You have to create offices in a place that draws employees.”

Increasingly downtown San Jose is becoming a magnet for that new kind of workplace.

“The office has to be in a place that has energy grit amenities public transportation and vibe” Kellenberger said. “Downtown San Jose has that now.”

Besides the global players such as Westbank and Jay Paul and tech titans Adobe and Google local players such as the Sobrato Organization KT Urban DiNapoli Cos. Urban Catalyst and Dillabough’s Urban Community have jumped into the downtown market.

“The momentum is starting to build on itself” said Shawn Milligan a partner with KT Urban which has proposed the development of a pair of 20-story office towers on the southern edges of the downtown near Interstate 280. “You are starting to see some critical mass in the downtown.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbnVyc2luZ25vdGVzLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvbmV3LW5hdGlvbmFsLW51cnNpbmctdW5pZm9ybXMtY291bGQtYmUtcm9sbGVkLW91dC1ieS1uZXh0LXN1bW1lci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New national nursing uniforms could be rolled out by next summer,"Nearly half of those asked said smart scrub tunics were their prefered choice.

New national uniforms for nurses and other healthcare workers in England could be rolled out by next summer according to the NHS Supply Chain.

Currently staff uniforms vary significantly between NHS organisation leading to confusion from patients and some healthcare workers. A survey of the public undertaken before the consultation revealed that 88% of patients think that the same uniforms should be worn nationally with 55% claiming they were unable to easily identify senior members of staff from their uniforms.

Following a seven-week consultation smart scrub tunics were most popular with 49% of those taking part in the consultation preferring them – this was followed by a normal tunic with 32% and normal scrub with 19%.

A massive 82% of the 50798 people who responded said they were in favour of a national nursing union being used across NHS hospital and other care settings in England.

The consultation document reveals that a blue “smart scrub tunic” was shown to be favoured by nurses in recent workshops moving from pale blue for junior staff to dark blue for the most senior. Other colours have been suggested for matrons specialist nurses advanced clinical practitioners and heads of nursing.

Producing a final design.

The NHS Supply Chain will now enter talks with other stakeholders to help decide what a national uniform should look like.

NHS Supply Chain hotel services director Kevin Chidlow said the consultation findings will be used to help produce a final design.

“This will evolve during the tender process and will include comprehensive wearer trials and feedback before a final design is agreed. We will continue to engage across the NHS to finalise design and colourways” he said.

When the consultation was announced Chief Nursing Officer for England Ruth May said: “Patients have told us that for them contact with several NHS professionals in a hospital setting can sometimes feel confusing frequently due to not knowing who does which role.

“We want patients and the public to be able to easily identify which nursing midwifery or care professional is providing their care. Keeping patients and staff safe is fundamental to this consultation so please have your say.”"

The W6600 version boast 8GB of GDDR6 memory while its big brother the W6800 comes with 32GB of memory. The AMD Radeon PRO W6600 will replace the previous W5700 model that is an option on current 2019 Mac Pro models. So does it mean Apple will soon offer more options for Mac Pro owners? Let’s take a closer look at it!

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and 3070 Ti GPUs were announced at the beginning of this month and it didn’t take long before AMD responded. Indeed AMD recently launched two new GPU options which will be good news for Mac users since NVIDIA ones have not been supported (natively) by macOS for quite some time now.

AMD Radeon PRO W6000 series

The AMD Radeon PRO W6000 series of GPUs are based around the AMD RDNA 2 architecture with a 7nm fabrication process. All graphics cards feature a PCIe 4.0 x16 connector and GDDR6 memory.

Also all cards support DirectX 12 OpenCL 2.1 and OpenGL 4.6. As a bonus you’ll get native support for 4K H264 encode and decode AV1 decode and H265/HEVC encode and decode capabilities. You got it these cards are mostly made for content creators in quest of a lot of computing power.

AMD Radeon PRO W6600 features

Let’s start with the AMD Radeon PRO W6600 which is the “less powerful” GPU of this new series. The AMD Radeon PRO W6600 is a desktop graphics card but a mobile version the W6600M has the same specs.

This W6600 card uses AMD’s Navi 23 GPU it features 28 compute units it has a total of 1792 cores 32MB of Infinity Cache and 8GB of GDDR6 memory.

Image credit: AMD

At the back of the card you’ll find four DisplayPort 1.4 with DSC connectors. According to AMD you can plug in up to four 5120x2880px (5K) displays or one 7680x4320px (8K) display to the card.

As you can tell the specifications of this AMD Radeon PRO W6600 card are pretty decent and a good update over the previous W5700 GPU that can be purchased as an MPX module for the Mac Pro. If Apple continues to produce the Intel-based Mac Pro in the future and update its machine I wouldn’t be surprised if the W6600 becomes the new “most-affordable” GPU upgrade for Apple’s flagship computing monster.

AMD Radeon PRO W6800 features

The AMD Radeon PRO W6800 is the flagship model of the W6000 series of GPU. Indeed this card is based on AMD’s latest Navi 21 GPU and it has very serious specifications:

32GB of GDDR6 RAM with ECC support and 128MB of Infinity Cache.

60 compute units and 3840 stream processors.

Image credit: AMD

At the back of the card you’ll find six Mini-DisplayPort 1.4 with DSC ports.

The Radeon PRO W6800 supports up to six 5120x2880px (5K) displays or two 7680x4320px (8K) displays.

You got it this GPU is a true workhorse and it could be a nice alternative to the very expensive Radeon Pro Vega II currently found inside Apple’s 2019 Mac Pro. Indeed according to AMD this new Radeon PRO W6800 is 79% faster compared to GMCN-based cards – like the Radeon Pro Vega II – so you should get a significant performance improvement in software like DaVinci Resolve or Adobe Premiere Pro.

Price and availability

The AMD Radeon PRO W6600 should be available during Q3 2021 for $649. The high-end Radeon PRO W6800 is available now for $2249.

Despite falling short against Chan Sung Jung Dan Ige hasn’t given up on his championship aspirations.

Ige (15-4 MMA 7-3 UFC) dropped a unanimous decision to “The Korean Zombie” in the main event of UFC on ESPN 25 on Saturday. He found early success on the feet but ultimately was outmatched on the canvas.

The 29-year-old will go back to the drawing board following his loss to Jung (17-6 MMA 7-3 UFC) but is confident he can make the necessary adjustments to help propel him to the upper echelon of the featherweight division.

“I went out there I fought my best” Ige said in his post-fight interview in the cage. “I came in at my absolute best. I have no excuses. The ‘Zombie’ is an absolute legend. I’ve been watching this guy since I graduated from high school. I was watching him from the WEC days to here now in the UFC and he’s still one of the best in the world – and that’s all I want. I want to test myself against the absolute best in the world. I truly believe I can still be a champion. I just have little small things to work on. I’ll be back better and stronger.”

A marked-up Ige took to Instagram just hours after his fight and appears to be in good spirits.

“Love you all. I’ll be back. God is good.”

Telling PEOPLE about life as a new mom McCain said in February that she ""can't believe how much I like motherhood honestly.""

""I was really back and forth about whether or not I was even going to do it and I can't believe how obsessed with it I am"" she said at the time adding ""I feel like the universe is laughing at me because I was so scared of having kids and so reluctant and so on the fence about it. Even when I was pregnant I was like 'I don't know we'll see how this goes.' ""

For years the California hairstylist experienced nosebleeds lightheadedness hot flashes and rosacea as a result of the harsh chemicals used in hair color services. But now she refuses to use such chemicals and after arriving for work at Phenix Salon Suites in Santa Barbara she dons a mask rubber gloves and a face shield and switches on an air purifier to counteract the chemicals used by a coworker. She feels safer this way and not just from the virus.

“I would love to see hairdressers wearing their masks even after the pandemic”

Workers across the cosmetology industry including spa hair and nail salon employees have expressed workplace safety concerns before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. According to complaints filed by cosmetology workers to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) between January 2015 and July 2020 — obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests in partnership with the Economic Hardship Reporting Project and then shared with Vox — exposure to these chemicals especially in salons with poor ventilation or whose owners failed to provide PPE resulted in burning eyes breathing problems rashes and more.

Now that salons have reopened and the CDC updated its guidelines to say fully vaccinated people can resume activities without practicing social distancing or wearing masks cosmetology workers must navigate both the immediate threat of Covid-19 and the ongoing risks of cosmetic chemical exposures.

“Employees are exposed to the hair straightening products without proper ventilation causing eye blisters and respiratory problems” one OSHA complaint reads. “Employees are exposed to chemical fumes and are having trouble breathing” reads another. “Employees are not provided with personal protective equipment.”

Potentially hazardous working conditions were already in place when the deadliest pandemic in a century landed in the US. Covid-19 left salon owners and workers facing the immediate health risks of a deadly airborne disease that required social distancing forcing salons to upend their practices as shifting regulations left them open and shut. It also exacerbated the economic issues already confronting salon employees often women of color working without safety nets. As people in various industries assess the harsh working conditions of their employment some salon workers are examining the risks that have been part of their jobs all along.

The health hazards associated with cosmetic chemicals are well-documented. Alexandra Flamm assistant professor of dermatology at Penn State University says her cosmetologist patients often suffer from contact dermatitis “an itchy rash in the eczema family.”

Exposure to sprays and other personal care products make the eyes vulnerable to irritation or infection adds Barbara Horn immediate past president of the American Optometric Association Board of Trustees and irritants landing directly on the eye can potentially cause keratitis a condition the American Association of Ophthalmology defines as an “open sore on the cornea.”

Found in keratin treatments formaldehyde is especially problematic with the National Toxicology Program classifying it as a known carcinogen. What’s more even short-term exposure to formaldehyde “is associated with eye nose and throat irritation shortness of breath and wheezing” per the Environmental Working Group (EWG) a health and environmental nonprofit and the National Cancer Institute concurs.

Such risks are exacerbated by the lack of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. The FDA has been aware of the dangers of formaldehyde in cosmetic chemicals since 2016 but has yet to ban the chemical according to documents obtained by the Environmental Working Group via FOIA and reporting from the New York Times. An FDA spokesperson said the agency continues to examine the safety of formaldehyde and will not discuss ongoing investigations or future plans.

Congress has repeatedly considered updating cosmetic chemical regulations but so far the bills haven’t gotten very far. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) introduced the Cosmetic Safety Enhancement Act of 2019 in December of that year while Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Susan Collins (R-ME) introduced the Personal Care Products Safety Act on Thursday for the third time after doing so first in 2015 and again in 2019. But the industry has successfully lobbied in the past for the ability to self-regulate said Melanie Benesh the EWG’s legislative attorney. However some companies now recognize the need for more regulation and are aware that consumers are beginning to care more about the ingredients in their products Benesh added.

The cosmetics industry “did a very good job even back in 1938 [of] carving themselves out of the law and really limiting the FDA’s regulatory authority” Benesh said. “Even the authority that’s written into the 1938 law is very limited.”

Dung Nguyen program outreach coordinator of California Healthy Nail Salon Collaborative (CHNSC) said that she has heard concerns from workers who worry about their ability to recover from Covid-19 due to respiratory issues stemming from the products they use.

“We’re starting to see the disparities that Covid is affecting poor folks way more than it is affluent folks” says Nguyen. “And it’s because of the poor folks who are working low-wage jobs where they have to work with all these chemicals. Just because I’m poor doesn’t mean I deserve to die and that my life is not worth as much as yours.”

Worker protections depend on whether a worker is classified as an independent contractor or an employee notes ReNika Moore director of the ACLU’s Racial Justice Program. As the pandemic unfolded she says federal agencies mostly introduced general recommendations and guidance for worker protections. Basically the federal government has “dropped the ball” Moore says.

She pointed to the National Employment Law Project’s warnings about the shortcomings of America’s safety net during Covid-19 protections that previously excluded independent contractors from benefits like paid sick leave family leave and unemployment insurance all of which have become acutely necessary as workers weather the economic uncertainty and health risk of working during the pandemic.

In April 2020 the US Department of Labor issued additional guidance regarding the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program that extended benefits to all independent contractors who have experienced “a significant diminution in work due to Covid-19.”

Another challenge for salon workers: Given the close-knit nature of the nail salon industry in particular workers may fear retaliation for speaking out against unsafe working conditions says Preeti Sharma an assistant professor at California State University and co-lead author of the 2018 report “Nail Files: A Study of Nail Salon Workers and Industry in the United States.” Given that fear it’s critical for worker organizations to inform salon workers of their available safeguards if they speak out against poor working conditions she says.

But protections against such retribution only apply to employees not independent contractors Sharma adds. Regardless as salons adjust to the changing regulations surrounding Covid-19 salon workers shouldn’t be solely responsible for enforcing mask-wearing or other precautions; strong health and safety guidelines as well as diligent owners and compliant customers keep everyone safe she says.

“Financially it’s a lose-lose situation and health-wise it’s a lose-lose situation”

Not surprisingly a majority of those who responded to a June 2020 survey of nail salon workers and owners in California during Covid-19 were concerned about whether it was safe to return to work. The survey found that 61 percent of workers (and 43 percent of salon owners) were concerned about safely reopening. It also found that 43 percent of workers (and 63 percent of owners) were worried about their finances.

“Financially it’s a lose-lose situation and health-wise it’s a lose-lose situation” Sharma said. “You don’t have the resources to stay home but to go back to the workplace is unhealthy.”

“There really isn’t an afterthought of ‘I don’t really want to do that. Is there something else I can do?’” added CHNSC’s Nguyen. “It comes from this survival nature: ‘What can I do here and now to provide for my family as quickly as possible?’”

On May 13 the CDC updated its guidelines to say that fully vaccinated individuals no longer need to wear masks or practice social distancing except where required by law leaving states municipalities tribes and territories to determine protocols. As a result salon workers are weighing the risks of Covid-19 along with the long-term cosmetic chemical exposure.

Kimberly Bell a hairstylist working in Fort Lauderdale Florida says that performing keratin straightening treatments caused her to experience nosebleeds breathing problems and rashes on her neck chest and forearms. These symptoms drove her to try wearing surgical and gas masks before the Covid-19 pandemic began. Once salons reopened she continued to wear face masks.

Though the masks she wears can conceal the smell of hair coloring chemicals such as bleach the gases released during keratin treatments still manage to creep in she says.

“You get headaches a lot because you have these masks on for hours upon hours throughout the day and then you have all the chemicals that are around you” Bell says. “It’s a combination of stress chemicals and breathing our own carbon dioxide.”

“It’s a combination of stress chemicals and breathing our own carbon dioxide”

The CDC’s revised guidelines have left Bell conflicted. On one hand keeping herself and her clients safe during the pandemic has been a priority. However she is at greater risk for cosmetic chemical exposure during her workdays and is concerned about fumes getting into her mask. According to a 2019 CDC evaluation of four nail salons surgical masks aren’t considered respiratory protection and don’t protect against gas vapor exposures or particulates in the air. And while N95 masks don’t protect against gases or vapors they do protect against dust created while doing clients’ nails per the CDC.

“I’ve given the mask question ‘to wear or not’ many sleepless nights and have come to a decision that will minimize risk to myself and my clients” Bell said. “Wearing a mask only exacerbates the health challenges as the fumes flow up and are trapped. You can imagine how debilitating breathing toxins all day is and creates irrefutable health risk and damage.”

Making sure clients are safe and comfortable was paramount for her before the coronavirus was a concern. Now that she’s fully vaccinated she said she will wear a mask if clients are comfortable with her doing so. But if her clients are okay with her not wearing a mask she will service them without one and continue her temperature checks she said.

Ortiz said she’s fine with the CDC guidelines as long as people continue to get vaccinated but she will continue wearing a mask because she knows clients who aren’t getting vaccinated.

“I’m trying to feel things out with everything. It’s a little new to me [to go] from masks and shields to no masks” Ortiz said.

Nguyen hopes that the health disparities the pandemic has revealed will lead to laws that will change what substances are allowed in beauty products. History has shown that this will more likely happen at the state level. Congress has not passed new legislation to regulate the cosmetics industry since the 1938 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act but “states have been the leaders on chemical consumer policy changes in the law” said the Environmental Working Group’s Benesh.

In September for instance California passed legislation requiring cosmetic product manufacturers to disclose fragrance ingredients or flavor ingredients starting in 2022 and banned the manufacturing and sale of products containing formaldehyde quaternium-15 and other toxic cosmetic chemicals beginning in 2025.

“We think the California legislation really is important as sending a signal about what kinds of chemicals we won’t tolerate in our cosmetics. We certainly hope it inspires movement at the federal level” Benesh said.

Other states including Minnesota Michigan and Massachusetts have enacted or introduced their own cosmetic chemical regulations from banning toxic chemicals in children’s personal care products to requiring disclosures of ingredients in cosmetics.

As for Ortiz after visits to multiple doctors failed to pinpoint the source of her nosebleeds dizziness and skin irritation a holistic doctor finally advised her to stop working with chemicals and diagnosed her with lupus an autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system attacks the organs. (While studies published in Cutaneous and Ocular Toxicology in 2012 and Toxicology Reports in 2015 indicate that cosmetic exposures could exacerbate lupus symptoms the studies concluded more research needs to be done to determine cosmetic chemicals’ effect.)

Though Ortiz has given up working with toxic chemicals she’s concerned about her salon colleagues navigating both the risks of coronavirus and cosmetic chemicals. She adds: “I just think Covid and chemicals is a bad recipe.”

This time it was Egypt’s turn. The most populous Arab nation is planning to invest up to $4 billion in a project to create hydrogen through electrolysis powered by renewable energy Egyptian Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy Mohamed Shaker said on June 14.

The disclosure follows a flurry of announcements last month including Oman’s plan for the biggest green hydrogen plant in the world to be built over the coming 27 years along with 25 GW of solar and wind power.

Also in May Dubai launched the region’s first industrial scale solar-powered green hydrogen plant a demonstration facility built by Siemens Energy and Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA).

Later in the month Abu Dhabi got in on the act as it revealed plans for a $1 billion facility with capacity to produce 200000 tons of green ammonia from 40000 tons of green hydrogen (hydrogen is turned into ammonia for long-distance transport before being transformed back for use).

As for Saudi Arabia it unveiled plans in July last year for a green hydrogen facility powered by 4 GW of wind and solar the world’s largest such project at the time. The $5 billion plant will be built by Air Products ACWA Power and Neom and will be capable of producing 650 tons of green hydrogen a day enough to run about 20000 hydrogen-fueled buses.

“The Middle East has joined the green hydrogen wave with mega project announcements” said Flor Lucia De la Cruz a senior research analyst for hydrogen and emerging technologies at Wood Mackenzie. “The Middle East has now positioned itself to become a key player in the green hydrogen economy leveraging its solar and wind capabilities and strategic position in between the European and Asian markets.”



The region has the potential to be one of the most competitive globally for green hydrogen production thanks to its abundant wind and solar resources industrial infrastructure and its location as an export hub Dii Desert Energy and Roland Berger said in a report on the industry this month.

The Gulf alone could create a $200 billion green hydrogen industry by 2050 generating up to one million jobs the report said as it predicted a long-term renewable energy deployment of up to 1000 GW 500 GW of electrolyzer capacity producing 100 million megatons of hydrogen.

“The GCC region is on the verge of a new era similar to the discovery of oil decades ago” Vatche Kourkejian a partner at Roland Berger wrote in the report. Green hydrogen could allow the Gulf to continue being the main energy supplier to the world in a sustainable manner he said.

The majority of the world’s hydrogen today (about 95 percent) is considered brown or gray in that it is produced by steam reforming of natural gas partial oxidation of methane or coal gasification. While the end product is a clean fuel the production process uses huge amounts of energy and creates significant amounts of carbon dioxide.

So-called blue hydrogen uses the same process as gray hydrogen but captures the carbon. Green hydrogen creates the gas through splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen via electrolysis and powering the process with renewable energy leaving no dirty byproducts.

As well as allowing for the storage of intermittent wind and solar power hydrogen can also be used to heat homes and cook as a replacement for natural gas power vehicles including planes and ships as well as cars trucks and trains and be used in industry to reduce the environmental impact of making metals chemicals and refining oil.

However the Middle East is not the only region looking to green hydrogen for future industrial development.

So far 17 countries (including Japan South Korea Canada and UK) have announced a hydrogen roadmap strategy or vision according to Wood Mackenzie.

Last year the EU’s Green Recovery Package earmarked €150 billion ($178 billion) for green hydrogen including targets for 6 GW of electrolyzer capacity in the first phase between 2020 and 2024 with 40 GW to be installed by the end of the second phase in 2030.

“The last year has seen a decisive pivot toward decarbonization globally which is extremely positive for zero-carbon technologies” said Ben Gallagher lead analyst emerging technologies at Wood Mackenzie. “Green hydrogen is a key beneficiary with this pivot pushing it to the fore ahead of other methods for producing the gas. In fact electrolysis-based low-carbon production now makes up 67 percent of the overall pipeline for hydrogen.”

Find articles like this there.

We know: it’s tough to think green – or really think at all – when we’re sweating our brains out in the Singapore heat. There’s a reason why Lee Kuan Yew once said that air conditioning enabled Singapore’s success after all.

But while the aircon might be a building block of our humid red dot it’s no secret that it’s not so cool for the earth.

The facts: air-conditioning accounts for nearly 20 per cent of Singapore’s CO2 emissions  with a standard two-kW aircon unit in your room producing 1.4 tonnes of earth-warming emissions a year – and that’s if you use it just 20 days a month.

Worldwide air-conditioning emits a hefty two billion tonnes of CO2 a year. But if you want to keep cool at home while keeping the planet cool in the long run the good news is you can – it just calls for something out-of-the-box.

Now that we’re all working from home here’s a look at some eco-friendly aircon alternatives that might just slash your utility bills too.

1. For the whole house: Solar-powered aircon

Sunshine is one thing Singapore has no shortage of and one locally invented aircon is turning it into a superpower. Recently developed by Ecoline Solar in collaboration with engineers from the National University of Singapore their game-changing hybrid aircon is powered by solar heat.

Vacuum tubes on its surface filled with a novel medium absorb solar energy and ambient heat harnessing them in place of electricity to compress refrigerant gas. Not only does this mean a lower carbon footprint your electricity bills will thank you in the long run too.

Companies like Starhub and NCS Singtel have already hopped aboard the green bandwagon and they’ve got a range of products suitable for homes too including wall-mounted systems and portable options.

2. For the whole room: Air coolers

Think of air coolers as the overlooked middle child between the aircon and the humble fan. This portable appliance draws on water for cooling as opposed to aircon refrigerants like HFCs – the latter being an industrial chemical that also happens to be a potent greenhouse gas.

In air coolers an internal fan drives hot air through a filter soaked in cold water or ice-packs causing water to evaporate and cool the air.

This means less electricity used and lower greenhouse gas emissions as well as less waste heat – aircon compressors produce warm exhaust air that add to urban heat.

The caveat: air coolers unlike aircons do nothing to reduce the amount of moisture in the air which is what really makes you sweat in a humid place like Singapore. It’s a tough price to pay for a greener world but it’s likely worth it.

Check out air coolers from most major appliance stores including BEST Denki and Courts .

3. For a cooler workspace: House plants

Indoor plants are basically nature’s air coolers. As plants transpire they release moisture into the air for a surprisingly powerful cooling effect – they’re estimated to lower temperatures in a room by as much as ten degrees!

Those packing high water content in their leaves do it best – aloe vera for one is a hardy succulent that thrives in direct sun.

Other fuss-free potted greens for a Singapore home include bamboo palm peace lilies and the aptly named mother-in-law’s tongue. Talk about a lush way to refresh your workspace – combine that with a good fan and you’re in for a chill time.

4. For your personal bubble: Close Comfort

A startup based in Singapore and Australia Close Comfort’s portable air-conditioners function with a sustainable twist. Their flagship product Cool Focus ($649) is a personal aircon which runs on the standard compressor refrigeration.

But where most portable aircons expel hot air out the window through an exhaust hose Cool Focus directs it at the ceiling instead – much like a fridge. Rather than striving to cool the whole room then it simply directs a stream of cool air at you to create your own personal bubble of chill.

The upshot of this is lower energy consumption – Cool Focus runs on only 300 watts of electricity around three times less than your average portable aircon.

Not only is it earth-friendlier it saves you a pretty penny too – the brand’s bold claim is that running it for eight hours will set you back less than 50 cents in electricity. Perch it right beside your desk and you’re cool for the whole workday.

5. Home improvement: Cooling paint and window films

We love a good dose of natural light but not when it comes with a hefty helping of heat too. The solution? Solar window films. These micro-thin layers of film reflect heat and UV rays keeping your home cool in the day while allowing it to stay bright.

We aren’t just talking tinted film either – 3M’s Sun Control Window Film Prestige Series  for instance keeps your view clear while reducing up to 78 per cent of the sun’s heat. Meanwhile SuperCool’s window films run the gamut from entry-level to heavy-duty each finely coated with reflective metal molecules.

If your home is a private property solar reflective paints are your best friend. When applied on exterior walls and roofs such paints effectively reduce a building’s absorption of heat by creating a reflective barrier.

Gaz Spec’s Heatex Thermal Insulation Coating  for one harnesses nanotechnology to create a hardy heat-resistant ceramic coating suited for any surface.

That would be no accident.

After all if a global tech giant can’t successfully scrub the Internet of most traces to said exposé — replacing such damaging publicity with the sudden launch of a $25 million refugee fund fed straight to People magazine on Friday hey they’re just here to help! — such a company wouldn’t exist in the first place.

“Airbnb’s Nightmare” this week’s cover story in Bloomberg Businessweek details the inner workings of the company’s secret global crisis team — deployed for years to cover up murders rapes shootings at least one crime against a child and other unspeakable acts to the tune of $50 million annually in payouts and non-disclosure agreements.

It’s a department known as “The Black Box.”

Former Black Box employees who have dealt with victimized Airbnb users — the first mandate they tell Bloomberg is to keep such reports from ever hitting the news let alone the courts lest the company’s $90 billion market value be impacted — say the work leaves them traumatized.

“I had situations where I had to get off the phone and cry” said one ex-employee. “That’s all you can do.”

Take the case of an Australian woman then 29 staying in a highly popular Airbnb rental in New York City a first-floor apartment on West 37th Street. It was 2015. She and her friends had arrived for New Year’s Eve celebrations.

They picked up their keys to the Airbnb at a local bodega. That simple: No questions asked no IDs taken.

After the ball dropped the woman left her friends at a bar and went back to the rental.

Hiding inside in the dark was a man with a knife. He allegedly raped her.

When the police arrested him hours later guess what they found on his person?

A set of keys to that same Airbnb rental. How he got them remains unclear but as any New Yorker knows all it takes is a trip to the hardware store and $2 to copy almost any key.

Sure Airbnb could mandate or even encourage most hosts to have digital keypads to change the code after each rental for everyone’s safety and security.

But profit margins you see.

The morning after this 29-year-old woman was raped Airbnb’s crisis manager Nick Shapiro — once deputy chief of staff at CIA and former National Security Adviser to President Obama — got a call.

Brian Chesky co-founder and chief executive officer of Airbnb Inc. speaks virtually during the company’s initial public offering (IPO) at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York U.S. on Thursday Dec. 10 2020. Bloomberg via Getty Images

Shapiro told Bloomberg that learning of the rape “brought me back to feelings of confronting truly horrific matters at Langley and in the situation room at the White House.”

Within hours Airbnb moved this young woman to a hotel flew in her mother then flew them both back home to Australia promising to cover any trauma-related costs. Within days the company was scouring court documents to see if Airbnb was mentioned.

It was not.

Somehow the story never made news. Two years later Airbnb paid the woman $7 million in exchange for her silence.

For all the constant talk in D.C. of breaking up Big Tech — which we all know will never happen — why won’t the federal government shoot a little lower? How can it be legal or at least not illegal for an American company such as Airbnb to actively conceal felonies?

Bloomberg reports that less than 0.1% of stays out of more than an annual 200 million have a troublesome outcome. But that is according to Airbnb itself and that’s still 200000 complaints per year.

Consider superstar investor Chris Sacca’s response when invited to join as an early investor: “Guys” he said “this is super-dangerous. Somebody’s going to get raped or murdered and the blood is going to be on your hands.”

It goes on: Bloomberg’s Olivia Carville writes of a 2011 attack in which a Barcelona host lured two American women to his home and raped them. A police search uncovered hundreds of pictures of other rape victims.

A serial rapist active on Airbnb. He got 12 years in prison. The women got an undisclosed amount from Airbnb.

Make no mistake: This company has made the internal calculation that spending $50 million a year to shut victims up is cheaper than making things right.

“The money cannon” one former safety agent calls it.

Guests cowering in closets while assailants try to sniff them out; crews dispatched to clean up blood and other bodily fluids patch up bullet holes or soothe the poor soul who stumbles upon dismembered human body parts — such are the horror stories common to Black Box staffers.

Airbnb went public last December. Its stock opened at $146 per share making it the biggest tech IPO of our pandemic year. With more global listings than the top five hotel brands put together Airbnb now has more dominance than it does responsibility or culpability.

The Cliff Dweller a unique stay on Airbnb is a perfect stay for people who love a bit of adventure (and a chance to unplug from city life). This home is bolted high above the canopy suspended from a cliff above Red River Gorge Kentucky.

In order to access this home you actually have to journey up ""several hundred"" stairs which means in addition to being a breathtaking view at the top it's also a stay that is more appropriate for adults who are comfortable with some exercise. Luckily by the look of the photos on Airbnb they are not too steep of a climb and there is a landing area where you can take a break before continuing to the top.

But once you're at the top you'll be rewarded with a beautiful view of the gorge and a comfortable modern house that has all the comforts of home. The home has one bedroom with a queen-sized bed and another queen-sized bed in a common area making it an excellent stay for two but with room for four. There's even air conditioning.

The bathroom is outfitted with a standing shower and the kitchen comes with all utensils and dinnerware a refrigerator and a hotplate for cooking. There is also a small seating area in the kitchen.

Plus above the bedroom you can climb up a ladder to a rooftop that makes for a great viewing area. It's no wonder why this place has a five-star rating by past guests. And if you're looking for a working-vacation this stay also has a dedicated workspace. It is important to note that Wi-Fi is not included so bringing a personal hotspot may be required — in case you don't want to totally unplug.

Courtesy of Airbnb

Nightly rates for this stay begin at $323 and long-term stays are allowed. There is limited availability in June and July with more open availability starting in August (at the time this article was written).

Despite falling short against Chan Sung Jung Dan Ige hasn’t given up on his championship aspirations.

Ige (15-4 MMA 7-3 UFC) dropped a unanimous decision to “The Korean Zombie” in the main event of UFC on ESPN 25 on Saturday. He found early success on the feet but ultimately was outmatched on the canvas.

The 29-year-old will go back to the drawing board following his loss to Jung (17-6 MMA 7-3 UFC) but is confident he can make the necessary adjustments to help propel him to the upper echelon of the featherweight division.

“I went out there I fought my best” Ige said in his post-fight interview in the cage. “I came in at my absolute best. I have no excuses. The ‘Zombie’ is an absolute legend. I’ve been watching this guy since I graduated from high school. I was watching him from the WEC days to here now in the UFC and he’s still one of the best in the world – and that’s all I want. I want to test myself against the absolute best in the world. I truly believe I can still be a champion. I just have little small things to work on. I’ll be back better and stronger.”

A marked-up Ige took to Instagram just hours after his fight and appears to be in good spirits.

“Love you all. I’ll be back. God is good.”

We ASX investors love our Australian shares. And fair enough too. The S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) has been a great place historically to find great companies to invest your money into for long-term gains. However like any index the ASX 200 isn't perfect. It's heavy on ASX banks and miners and light on tech companies. At least where it counts: market-capitalisation weighting.

That's where the US markets can come in handy. Not only is America home to some of the best companies in the world such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). it also offers ASX investors some exposure to trends and sectors that the ASX 200 just can't.

So here are 3 ASX exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have the potential to easily expose any ASX investor's portfolio to the US markets.

3 ASX ETFs that can offer ASX investors easy US markets exposure

iShares S&P 500 ETF (ASX: IVV)

Here we have a simple cheap US-based index fund. The S&P 500 Index (INDEXSP: .INX) is one of the largest and most-tracked index in the world. It holds 500 of the largest companies in the US. That's everything from Apple and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) to Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE). This is the index that IVV tracks. This ETF has been an objectively solid performer over the past 10 years returning an average of 17.93% per annum. it also has one of the lowest management fees of any ETF on the ASX at 0.04% per annum.

BetaShares Nasdaq 100 ETF (ASX: NDQ)

Another US-based index fund here. But instead of the S&P 500 NDQ tracks the Nasdaq-100 (INDEXNASDAQ: NDX). This index is a little different holding only the companies that list on the Nasdaq exchange. The Nasdaq is one of the major stock exchanges in the US but it's a lot newer than its main rival the New York Stock Exchange. As such it tends to house mostly tech companies. It's largest holdings are Apple Microsoft and other tech giants like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX).

NDQ charges a management fee of 0.48% per annum and has retuned an average of 20.94% per annum since its inception in 2015.

VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (ASX: MOAT)

This ETF is a little different from the above examples as it is not an index fund. Rather it can be described as an 'active ETF'. That's because it invests in companies that meet certain criteria – that of a wide economic moat. VanEck works with Morningstar to identify a concentrated portfolio of at least 40 US shares that show signs of a 'wide moat'.

'Moat' is a Warren Buffett term that describes a company's intrinsic competitive advantage. This can be in a powerful brand cost advantage or other factors that enable a company to stay on top of its competition. Some of MOAT's top holdings include Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) and Buffett's own Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). MOAT charges a management fee of 0.49% per annum. It has returned an average of 20.38% per annum since its inception in 2015."

Have you always wanted to write a book? If so you probably figured it would be a labor of love something that would earn very little or you might even have to pay to get it published.

While that certainly used to be true for most non-household name authors it isn't true anymore.

These days many people are making a good living up to $10000 a month or even more as independent authors publishing their books on Amazon even though they aren't famous and don't have decades of experience in the publishing world.

The key is to write books that people enjoy reading publish them quickly in a series and apply a little smart marketing so that readers will be able to find them.

Here's some advice from some authors who've done it themselves.

1. The more books you write the more books you'll sell

This absurdly simple concept is behind the highly popular Facebook group 20Booksto50k begun by indie author Michael Anderle author and co-author of multiple book series and now CEO of LMBPN Publishing which publishes both his books and those of other authors.

The idea came about when Anderle was writing the third book of his first series the Kurtherian Gambit vampire thriller series in Mexico. He'd published the first two as Amazon Kindle books and as Kindle Unlimited books (free to those with a Kindle Unlimited membership) a popular choice among indie authors. Amazon invites indie authors to publish Kindle books for free and keeps 30 percent of the sale price paying the author the other 70 percent.

At the time those first two books were earning him between $7 and $12 a day Anderle explained in a video interview at the 2019 London Book Fair. Some authors might have been disheartened but he had learned that he and his wife could sell their Texas home buy a condo in Mexico and retire there on $50000 a year. ""If I could hit 20 books"" he said ""I could hit $50000 a year and then we could retire early.""

In fact he did much better than that. He published his first book in the Kurtherian Gambit series in November 2015 and by the time he published the fifth book in that series in January 2016 he was making five figures per month he said. ""By the twelfth and thirteenth month I was doing six figures per month.""

Publishing books in a series in rapid succession is key to financial success Anderle tells Business Insider. ""Fans of the series push the latest book up into the top of the charts and that in turn causes potential readers to notice the latest book and then go look for book one in the series and start there.""

A similar approach works for non-fiction books said Sally Miller a former business analyst and project manager and now stay-at-home mom and coach who has published 15 books about how to make money in various ways such as Airbnb podcasting blogging and--yes--as an author. Miller now makes between $6000 and $8000 a month from royalties and that number should continue to grow as she publishes more books.

2. A little marketing goes a long way

""It takes a solid marketing plan to make all the pieces fit together and it's more than one thing that has made me somewhat successful"" said Tracy Fredrychowski author of five books in the Amish/Christian fiction category.

Fredrychowski has a marketing company but she also found widespread readership for her blog and short stories about Amish lifestyles and values in Western Pennsylvania where she lives.

When readers asked if her stories were available in book form Fredrychowski published them as a book with a vanity publisher — and wound up selling less than 100 copies.

Because of her marketing background she knew she could do better on her own and she began self-publishing on Kindle. Five books into her series she's making around $4000 a month and with three more books coming out in 2021 she said she's on track to double those earnings in 2021.

""I'm on the cusp of being able to hand over the reins of my digital marketing company to write full-time"" she said.

To market her books Miller has a professionally designed website and a professional looking newsletter that she sends to the 8000 readers who have signed up for it. ""I offer a freebie"" she explains. ""If somebody signs up for my email list I give them a free book to put them on the journey and then in the back of that book they can find my other books.""

When it comes to advertising successful indie authors recommend one very effective tactic. Temporarily drop the price of a book or books to 99 cents and then advertise it on book promotion websites such as AuthorsXP or BookSniffer which send out lists of 99-cent book specials to tens of thousands of voracious readers.

Fredrychowski also uses that sale time to run ads on Amazon Facebook Twitter and elsewhere. ""Normally I don't pay more than $25 to $75 for an ad"" she said. The promotion usually pays for itself. ""Even though I've dropped my price to 99 cents for those days my book sales are jacked up because I promoted that sale for five days in five different places.""

3. Write a book people want to read

All the marketing in the world won't help you if you don't write compelling books that readers enjoy and want to read more of.

If you're writing how-to books make sure they clearly and concisely teach the reader whatever he or she needs to learn in a straightforward and readable way. If you're writing fiction ""you need to engage your reader immediately"" Anderle said. ""If a reader isn't engaged with your story in the first 3000 words figure out why. Because it's too easy for them to drop a book and move on.""

He recommends having at least six or seven people read the first 3000 words of your book and then give it one of three ratings: ""I want to read more"" ""I'm noncommittal"" or ""It's not working for me.""

Beyond that he said if you're working in genre fiction (such as romance or fantasy) learn the rules and tropes of that particular genre or you'll leave readers unsatisfied. ""For example the romance trope requires a happily-ever-after. If it does not have that it is not a romance."" Anderle recommends using the TV Trope wiki to find tropes for the genre you're writing in.

Advertisement

It's also important to have your book cover professionally designed and have your text professionally edited he said.

""Solid covers can be had for around $100 to $200 or even less if you look around"" he said. ""The cost of editing can vary depending on where you look as well. There are companies and resources around the world that can deliver good quality at a reasonable price.""

You need all these things for a successful series he adds. ""The cover sells the book. The story sells the next book in the series. If your read-through rate is less than 63% from book one to book two or less than 86% from book two to book three there are problems. Figure out what they are and fix them.""

4. Be patient

Those who've done it warn that it can take time to find the right formula and momentum that not every book will be a success and that if your goal is to make a living from your books it can take perseverance — and many many hours spent writing — to get there.

""Don't assume that it's too late to get into this game"" Anderle said. ""Success may happen fast but it might not. Be prepared to learn to grow to be patient and figure out how to enjoy the trip.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9yZXRhaWwvMjAyMS8wNi8yMC9pdHMtbGlrZS10aGlzLWV2ZXJ5LWRheS1hbWF6b24tZnVsZmlsbG1lbnQtY2VudGVyLWluLWRhbGxhcy1mb3JjZXMtdHJ1Y2stZHJpdmVycy10by13YWl0LWZvci1ob3Vycy10by11bmxvYWQv0gGyAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3JldGFpbC8yMDIxLzA2LzIwL2l0cy1saWtlLXRoaXMtZXZlcnktZGF5LWFtYXpvbi1mdWxmaWxsbWVudC1jZW50ZXItaW4tZGFsbGFzLWZvcmNlcy10cnVjay1kcml2ZXJzLXRvLXdhaXQtZm9yLWhvdXJzLXRvLXVubG9hZC8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘It’s like this every day’: Amazon fulfillment center in Dallas forces truck drivers to wait for hours to,"Chito Peppler had been sitting in his truck for over 12 hours by the time he reached the front of the delivery line at Amazon’s fulfillment center on Interstate 20 and J.J. Lemmon Road in Dallas.

It was 3:30 a.m. and the truck driver hadn’t gotten any sleep since he’d arrived earlier that afternoon. Peppler had to stay awake so he could inch his truck upward every half hour or so. In his trailer were pallets of Pringles that were supposed to have been offloaded at 11 p.m.

“I don’t mean to complain but there was a lot of commotion going on” Peppler said. “I tried to doze off but you can’t sleep because once the truck moves you have to move.”

A line of semitrailers is always waiting to get into the fulfillment center named FTW1 in Amazon parlance. It stretches from the warehouse entrance all the way down a frontage road off I-20.

With Amazon’s annual blockbuster Prime Day sale taking place Monday and Tuesday the company has been stocking up its fulfillment centers for the two-day event that’s expected to generate $12 billion in sales up from $10.4 billion last year.

Advertisement

But delivery lines at this fulfillment center are constant regardless of the time of year.

The line takes up one of the two frontage road lanes. Both lanes are one-way so other vehicles can get by. After delivering their loads drivers then park behind the 500000-square-foot warehouse and along nearby roads to wait to pick up their empty trailers.

Drivers say they wait for hours to drop off deliveries of merchandise that range from food to electronics to small household goods.

Advertisement

The drivers who get paid by the hour said it’s boring but they don’t mind. Those paid by the trip however see their per-hour pay drop with every passing minute.

“I would say about $400 to $500 was wasted in lost work” Peppler said of his 12-hour wait at the facility.

When Kevin LeDee picked up a load from a warehouse only 15 minutes away from the FTW1 fulfillment center on a Thursday evening he thought he was in for an easy night.

He pulled up to the center which he’d never delivered to before at 6:30 p.m. and didn’t reach the front of the line until just before midnight. It was there that warehouse staff told him he had been waiting at the wrong place — and that he’d have to drive back to the end of the correct line.

At 11:30 a.m. the next morning LeDee was still seven trucks away from the warehouse entrance. His eyes were bloodshot from the lack of sleep and he still had hours to go before he could drop off his trailer pick up another load and drive back to Houston where he’s from.

By noon that day 32 trucks were waiting to enter the facility. They were getting close to backing up onto the bridge that connects J.J. Lemmon and the frontage road.

“It’s like this every day. I’m always driving past here” said David Allen of Arlington who was waiting to drop off his trailer carrying vacuum cleaners. He arrived Thursday night at 11 p.m. for his Friday 8 a.m. drop-off time.

At 11:30 the next morning he was only the fifth truck in line just a couple spots ahead of LeDee. The facility has been one of his destinations the past two years and he said he always thinks “I hope I never have to go here again.”

The Dallas County Sheriff’s Department is as familiar with this Amazon fulfillment center as the truck drivers who frequent it.

Officers work out of a substation not far from the warehouse and drive past it regularly. Sgt. Adam Arista said the department gets recurring calls that the frontage road outside of the entrance is blocked by the trucks making it difficult for other vehicles to pass by.

“It’s hard to always determine when these backups will occur or not” he said. “I would say it started maybe a year and a half ago or so. It definitely picks up before the holidays.”

Eventually Amazon hired part-time traffic control personnel to try and mitigate the risks posed with having trucks lining the side of the road.

“It does create a hazard if you have a row of large 12-foot-in-height trucks backed up down the road” Arista said. “They can’t see what’s coming southbound on J.J. Lemmon as they exit onto it to leave the plant.”

One Dallas County sheriff’s officer who was hired part time to work traffic control at the warehouse was struck by a passing vehicle on the bridge where J.J. Lemmon Road crosses I-20. Fortunately the officer did not sustain serious injuries.

Another risk that worries Arista is the potential for waiting trucks to block emergency response vehicles from getting to accidents and medical events. Without adequate access to the frontage road or J.J. Lemmon Road officers are limited in their ability to reach stretches of the interstate.

“It’ll affect our response times to major incidents at least on the westbound side of 20” he said.

Amazon seems to be the shining example of efficiency and customer service. It’s the logistics master shipping up to 1 million packages a day during the peak holidays from just one of its robotics-driven fulfillment centers. J.P. Morgan predicted that it could leap over Walmart to become the largest U.S. retailer in a couple of years.

So why does this one facility which has been open since 2015 have chronic scheduling issues?

The FTW1 warehouse is one of eight such operations in Dallas-Fort Worth and one of more than 100 in the U.S. that takes in merchandise and fills customers’ orders. This facility is on the small side for Amazon. Most local Amazon fulfillment centers are about 1 million square feet like the 855000-square-foot fulfillment center in Arcadia Park in West Oak Cliff. The company opened another center that big last week in Forney.

Customer packages leave the fulfillment center in semitrucks and go to two other large buildings one in Irving and one in Wilmer where packages are sorted by ZIP code.

Local orders are packed and taken to delivery stations nestled closer to where people live. That’s where those dark blue Amazon vans with the light blue smile logo load up and head out to neighborhoods.

This year Amazon is adding six new delivery stations to the seven it already has in North Texas. There’s one in fast-growing Frisco off PGA Parkway that opened last year and four under construction in Arlington Mansfield and two in Fort Worth.

It all seems to hum pretty consistently.

Peppler who writes a trucking blog under the name “18 runner” called the fulfillment center “an atrocious operation” in a recent post after his visit to the warehouse.

“Amazon has booked way more loads than they can handle” he wrote. “Doing so means trucks have to park out on the street resulting in a hazard to themselves and others or even a ticket from Dallas police. There’s an easy solution to this problem — just reduce the number of bookings.”

Amazon said the company is aware of the problems at FTW1 and is actively working to correct them by fixing the warehouse’s scheduling and increasing sorting capacity.

“This site fluctuates in inbound freight volume which sometimes impacts wait times for trailers entering our yards” Amazon said in an emailed response. “This is a known issue in the industry that is not unique to Amazon and we are looking for ways to identify a solution.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1hbnVhbC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi9hbWF6b24tcHJpbWUtd2FyZHJvYmUtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We Tried Amazon Prime Wardrobe for a Week.

Final Verdict?

I initially thought there would be a ton of no-name ill-fitting knockoffs that would fit like a vacation t-shirt boxy and thick and I’d have to send them back a John Kerry-quantity of greenhouse gasses emitted over the whole waste of time. Well approaching a week of trying clothing that runs the gamut I’m shocked to report that I was completely wrong. And if Amazon wants its items back it can peel them from my cold well-dressed back. (But they’ve already got my credit card information so the joke’s on me).

How Amazon Prime Wardrobe Works

Launched in 2018 Prime Wardrobe allows shoppers to select up to eight eligible articles of clothing which range from jeans and pants to t-shirts jackets button-downs and shoes and then try them out in the comfort of their home for seven days. At the end throw whatever you don’t want back in the box seal it up slap on the included label and drop it off at your nearest UPS paying only for what you keep. T0 clarify one of the many many points on which I was wrong it’s not no-name makers. Amazon flexed its muscles establishing relationships with just about every major fashion brand including Ray-Ban Levi’s UGG Lacoste Danner AX and many many more. All told the company claims hundreds of thousands of men’s styles across more than a thousand brands. The best part? If you’re already an Amazon Prime member you’ve already got Wardrobe.

I started out wide-eyed looking for the first thread on which to pull to make my picks. For people like me who don’t exactly play jazz with their wardrobe Amazon makes it easy. While you could just tap on the “Delivery” filter and select “Prime Wardrobe Eligible” getting smacked in the face by hundreds of thousands of options I selected from one of four curated men’s style silos which include Casual Sporty Cool and Classic. I’m a neat-whiskey black-coffee kind of guy so I went with Classic perusing around 150 items loosely based around the theme. Distressed denim leather jackets classic sunglasses silhouettes and well-tailored basics were all mixed together.

Fashion Brands on Amazon Prime Wardrobe

Like I said there are plenty of brands available that I already like but I have a few pair of Levi’s so instead of staying conservative with my picks I elected to try only Amazon house brands which include Goodthreads launched the year before Wardrobe in 2017 and its Essentials line. (With my vacation t-shirt assumption in tatters I could at least trash the company if I ended up looking like I came out of a discount department store.) I selected a fitted t-shirt a slim pair of stretch jeans an M65-like field jacket a button-down Oxford a thin Italian merino V-neck sweater and a buffalo-check plaid shirt — you know the basics you’d wear every day during a work-from-home life. I worried that they wouldn’t couldn’t be too great because they were pretty affordable compared to other basics makers. But once again I was pleasantly surprised. All fit good-to-great with some options like the Oxford in the excellent category.

(A word about tall skinny men like myself: When buying a button-down unless you’re talking super high-end usually you have to select either a slim fit in the chest or sleeves that extend past mid-forearm. You cannot have both. All praise to Goodthreads which makes a Medium-Tall that’s slim in the body and goes past the wrist bones. Jeff Bezos is a genius.)

The beauty of Wardrobe is that unlike my usual one-off purchases of items its eight-article policy allows you to select entire looks. The name therefore is not far off: The program is more of an overhaul than a supplement major surgery rather than triage making it the perfect upgrade for the changing of the seasons or your own personal Queer Eye rebranding. And as a bonus its house brand articles are a fraction of the cost of others while usually coming in a rainbow of options which allows you to select multiple colors of items you’ll wear a lot.

Room For Improvement

There are some things I wish were better. Even within the style silos some colors or finishes of items aren’t uniformly available through Wardrobe. For instance my current Clarks chukkas are on their last legs so when I saw the company’s name on the list I selected a fresh beeswaxed brown option. I could not get it in the Wardrobe cart no matter how hard I tried. Later I’d discover that at least one of the chukka model colors was available but not my preference. I’d never been so close and yet so far which can be frustrating when you’re assembling an entire look.

The other question mark was availability. I made my picks during a peak shopping period and many colors were sold out in my common size. (I’m not saying I don’t love my new navy field jacket but come on everyone knows they’re traditionally O.D. green.) Fewer sold-out options would have been nice but I made do.

Final Verdict?

I think I’ll return a henley which was described as “washed black” but in person seems something more Affliction than American Apparel. But I’m wearing that Oxford at my desk now its well-fitting sleeves unbuttoned and rolled like a real man-of-the-people Mayor-Pete look. And I’ve worn the jeans since the day they came rediscovering the joy of stretch when compared to my normal selvedge.

There’s one more thing.

While seven of my eight items were all Amazon house brands that eighth was all for me. As the days get longer and the sun finally breaks through the clouds I’ll be shading my eyes behind a brand new pair of polarized Ray-Ban Aviators  gold with the traditional green lenses a real Joe Biden look. Sure I could have reinvented myself with Wardrobe. But classics are classics for a reason and you don’t mess with a good thing.

In the past 18 months getting a box on the doorstep has offered convienance on another level.

The thrill of anticipation goes into overdrive on Amazon Prime Day when the nation’s largest online retailer offers some very deep discounts.

Behind every box and envelope are men and women packing up wants and needs. An Amazon spokesperson said while the company may cut prices it's not cutting corners when it comes to the health and wellness of the people working to get these deals to customers.

Within the last month as Governor Roy Cooper relaxed COVID-19 restrictions the mega online retailer allowed TV cameras into the Garner Fulfillment Center for the first tour since the start of the pandemic. The Garner plant opened in August 2020. Until now outsiders haven’t been able to go inside.

The company has a program called Working Well and the main objective is to protect employees from workplace injuries. By protecting workers the company is protecting itself and its customers.

The distribution center is 640000 square feet of machines and manpower. As senior operations manager Thomas Denny climbs up the stairs of the four-story labyrinth all the time. Denny broke down how the operation works.

""We will go through the processes of how we fulfill our customer orders"" Denny said. “Once we come out we are gonna go to our right to station 3170. This is how we get our inventory into our bins.”

Rows of people toil at each work station throughout the massive site in central North Carolina. Bonnie Keen is one of them you can find at any time. Keen said she started in October of last year. As part of her daily routine she incorporates exercises from the working well program into her shift. “

I love it. I do because that way you can warm up and go ahead and get situated for your job” Keen said.

During her warm-up she rolled her wrists in a circular motion and lunged her legs forward one after the other. The company debuted the program in 2019. In the middle of the current pandemic workers were expected to keep up with increased demand. For example online orders shot up nationwide at the height of lockdown. The program seems to be successful at the Garner center.

“Say I clock out at lunch. When I clock back in you’re doing the same exercise but just different ones. I do that twice a day"" Keen said.

There are multiple components to the Working Well initiative. Keen is a mother of six who said she likes to feel fresh on the job. One specific area of the wellness strategy she practiced often is a 'Mind and Body Moment'. A screen prompted her with a guided tutorial that targets muscle and mental fatigue by coaching a person through breathing techniques and various movements.

“It’s just relaxing. I love what I do. This way it gives you a little time to warm up to get into the groove of it"" Keen said.

Officials say the goal of the program is to reduce muscular sprains and strains. The rollout came as the giant faced continuing scrutiny for how it treats employees on the floor. The relentless nature of the fulfillment line often forces workers to handle new orders almost every 30 seconds.

There are also health and safety huddles offered as part of the program.

In these sessions crew members physically group to learn the best ways to use their bodies. The innovative robotic technology handles thousands of details a day as synthetic arms scan and stamps each package.

About 6% of the airline's mainline schedule or 190 flights were canceled Sunday according to flight tracking site FlightAware. The airline said that equaled about 3% of its total flights including those operated by regional carriers. An internal company list which was viewed by CNBC showed about half of those were because of unavailable flight crews. On Saturday about 4% of its mainline schedule or 123 flights were canceled and 106 on Monday FlightAware showed.

American said it is trimming its overall schedule by about 1% through mid-July to help ease some of the disruptions some of which it said resulted from bad weather at its Charlotte North Carolina and Dallas/Fort Worth international airport hubs during the first half of June. The planned cuts amount to about 950 flights in the first half of next month.

Airlines are scrambling to keep up with a spike in air travel demand as governments lift pandemic-related restrictions and allow more attractions from concerts to restaurants to theme parks to reopen after spending much of the past year trying to reduce staff. Some returning travelers have complained about hourslong customer service hold times.

American said it's in the process of hiring hundreds of customer service agents after about a quarter of its customer service agents took voluntary leaves of absence or buyouts. Delta Air Lines is in the process of hiring about 1300 people for these positions spokesman Morgan Durrant said. Both carriers said they are reaching out to people who took leaves or buyouts to help cover demand.

The Transportation Security Administration said it screened more than 2.1 million people on Sunday the most since March 7 2020 but 23% below the 2.7 million people screened two years ago months before the Covid pandemic began.

""The bad weather combined with the labor shortages some of our vendors are contending with and the incredibly quick ramp up of customer demand has led us to build in additional resilience and certainty to our operation by adjusting a fraction of our scheduled flying through mid-July"" said American Airlines spokeswoman Sarah Jantz in a statement. ""We made targeted changes with the goal of impacting the fewest number of customers by adjusting flights in markets where we have multiple options for re-accommodation.""

Bad weather has impacted flight crews' ability to get to assigned flights and storms and other weather can mean that crews can fall outside of the hours they are federally allowed to work the spokeswoman said.

Dennis Tajer spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association which represents American's roughly 15000 pilots said the company should offer more overtime in advance to encourage staff to fill in as well as more flexibility in pilots' schedules to cover staffing shortages.

""They're trying to put a Band-Aid on something that needs stitches"" said Tajer who is also a Boeing 737 captain.

American is also racing to train all of the pilots it furloughed in between two federal aid packages that prohibited layoffs as well as its aviators who are due for periodic recurrent training. Jantz said American is on track to finish training furloughed pilots by the end of this month and added the company is offering overtime because of its operational issues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA2LTIwL2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWZsaWdodC1jYW5jZWxsYXRpb25zLXNldC10by1jb250aW51ZS1tb25kYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Flight Cancellations Set to Continue Monday,"The series of flight cancellations from American Airlines this weekend will continue to plague Monday travelers.

American Airlines said its average passenger weights had risen by eight pounds.

But experts say airlines are unlikely to weigh passengers before they board their flights.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Airlines could hike charges on overweight baggage as they try to account for heavier passengers an industry expert told Insider.

American Airlines confirmed to Insider on June 10 that its average passenger weights had increased while airline officials told the Wall Street Journal that average passenger and baggage weights had risen between 5% and 10% but did not say over what period.

Henry Harteveldt president of travel research firm Atmosphere Research Group told Insider that he wouldn't be ""surprised if airlines use the higher passenger weight estimates to charge passengers more money.""

Airlines might reduce their weight limit for checked bags increase charges for overweight luggage or both he said.

""Somewhere in the bowels of an airline's headquarter building a zealous financial analyst is licking her or his lips relishing the chance to use this as an opportunity extract more money from that airline's passengers.""

Weight estimates are used to calculate the weight and balance of the aircraft before take off - vital data needed to ensure the plane can fly safely. Keeping within weight limits can be harder in hotter climates and at higher altitudes where more energy is needed to lift the plane requiring more fuel.

Airlines had until June 12 to submit new average passenger and baggage weight estimates to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) the government body that regulates commercial airlines the Journal reported.

An American Airlines spokesperson told Insider that its average passenger weight was 182 pounds in summer and 187 pounds in winter ""an 8-pound increase for both seasons."" The spokesperson also said that American expects carry-on baggage to be five pounds heavier in new estimates and checked bags to be 4 pounds heavier.

American told Insider it plans to use larger aircraft for flights where it anticipates there may be weight issues and limit ticket sales ""if necessary."" It added however that most of its flights are able to accommodate heavier passengers. A company spokesperson said there would be no change in customer experience following the weight changes.

Harteveldt said airlines ""constantly"" look for ways to reduce aircraft weight for example by buying lighter seats scrapping in-seat entertainment hardware and reducing the size of toilet cubicles.

Harteveldt added that he has even known airlines to buy lighter cutlery and cups to save weight and stocking the plane with fewer food and drink items.

Helane Becker airlines analyst and managing director of investment bank Cowen told Insider that the ""trend in heavier people has been going on for years"" and that she expected airlines to both change overweight bag charges and accept less mail and fewer small packages.

Southwest Airlines told Insider that the FAA had approved its submission in early June and had no plans to ""increase overweight or oversized baggage fees.""

Industry body Airlines for America which speaks on behalf of 10 major airlines also said that it doesn't ""anticipate there will be any noticeable changes"" for customers in an emailed statement.

Delta Air Lines said they had developed an ""implementation plan"" to minimize any impact on customers although did not share any details.

So much so that we may well imagine that Deep Thought’sanswer today to Life the Universe and Everything might plausibly be “EV.” But as Douglas Adams would surely have asked if electric vehicles are the answer what is the question?

Let us imagine the “perfect” EV: solar powered efficient reliable and affordable. But is it sustainable? EVs powered by renewable energy may help reduce the carbon footprint of transport. Yet the measure of sustainability is not merely the carbon footprint but the material footprint: the aggregate quantity of biomass metal ores construction minerals and fossil fuels used during production and consumption of a product. The approximate metric tonne weight of an EV constitutes materials such as metals (including rare earths) plastics glass and rubber. Therefore a global spike in the demand for EVs would drive an increased demand for each of these materials.

Every stage of the life cycle of any manufactured product exacts environmental costs: habitat destruction biodiversity loss and pollution (including carbon emissions) from extraction of raw materials manufacturing / construction through to disposal. Thus it is the increasing global material footprint that is fundamentally the reason for the twin climate and ecological crises.

The global material footprint has grown in lockstep with the exponentially rising global economy (GDP) since the industrial revolution. This is largely because of egregious consumption by the super-affluent in a socioeconomic system founded on growth without limits. Can we resolve this fundamental conflict between the quest for limitless growth and the consequent environmental destruction?

ENTER TECHNOLOGY

Technological innovation and efficiency improvements are often cited as pathways to decouple growth in material use from economic growth. While technology undoubtedly has a crucial role to play in the transition to a sustainable world it is constrained by fundamental physical principles and pragmatic economic considerations.

Examples abound. The engine efficiency of airplanes has improved little for decades since they have long been operating close to their theoretical peak efficiency. Likewise there is a hard limit on the efficiency of photovoltaic cells of about 35 percent because of the physical properties of the semiconductors that constitute them; in practice few exceed 20 percent for economic and pragmatic reasons. The power generation of large wind farms is limited to about one watt per square meter as a simple yet utterly unavoidable physical consequence of wake effects. The awesome exponential increase in computing power of the past five decades will end by about 2025 since it is physically impossible to make the transistors on the computer chip already roughly 5 percent of the size of the coronavirus much smaller.

Whether it is principles of classical quantum or solid state physics or thermodynamics each places different but inexorable constraints on technological solutions. Basically physical principles that have allowed incredible technological leaps over the past century also inevitably limit them. We might consider that extensive recycling of materials would offset efficiency limits. Recycling is crucial; however while glass and metals can be recycled almost indefinitely without loss of quality materials such as paper and plastic can be recycled only a few times before becoming too degraded.

Additionally recycling itself may be an energy- and materials-intensive process. Even if physical laws could be broken (they cannot) to achieve recycling with 100 percent efficiency added demand from the imperative for economic growth would necessarily require virgin materials. The key point is that efficiency is limited by physics but there is no sufficiency limit on the socioeconomic construct of “demand.”

Unfortunately the situation is even more dire. Economic growth is required to be exponential; that is the size of the economy must double in a fixed period. As referenced earlier this has driven a corresponding increase in the material footprint. To understand the nature of exponential growth consider the EV. Suppose that we have enough (easily extractable) lithium for the batteries needed to fuel the EV revolution for another 30 years. Now assume that deep-sea mining provides four times the current amount of these materials. Are we covered for 120 years? No because the current 10 percent rate of growth in demand for lithium is equivalent to doubling of demand every seven years which means we would only have enough for 44 years. In effect we would cause untold perhaps irreversible devastation of marine ecosystems to buy ourselves a few extra years’ supply of raw materials.

Exponential growth swiftly inevitably swamps anything in finite supply. For a virus that finite resource is the human population and in the context of the planet it is its physical resources.

The inescapable inference is that it is essentially impossible to decouple material use from economic growth. And this is exactly what has transpired. Wiedmann et al. 2015 did a careful accounting of the material footprint including those embedded in international trade for several nations. In the 1990–2008 period covered by the study no country achieved a planned deliberate economywide decoupling for a sustained length of time. Claims by the Global North to the contrary conceal the substantial offshoring of its production and the associatedecological devastation to the Global South.

Recent proposals for ecocidal deep-sea and fantastical exoplanetary mining are an unsurprising consequence of a growth paradigm that refuses to recognize these inconvenient truths.

WHAT IS SUSTAINABILITY?

These observations lead us to a natural minimum condition for sustainability: all resource use curves must be simultaneously flatlined and all pollution curves simultaneously extinguished. It is this resource perspective that allows us to see why EVs may help offset carbon emissions yet remain utterly unsustainable under the limitless growth paradigm.

THE REAL QUESTION

We have argued that the inextricable link between material consumption and GDP makes the infinite-growth paradigm incompatible with sustaining ecological integrity. Thus while EVs constitute a partial answer to the climate question within the current paradigm they will only exacerbate the larger anthropogenic crises connected to unsustainable resource consumption.

The real question is this: how do we transition to alternative economic paradigms founded on the reconciliation of equitable human well-being with ecological integrity?

Expect the worst from

power grid this summer

So right after the Texas Legislature demonstrated it doesn't have the guts to regulate the electrical grid or force the energy companies to disgorge ill-gotten profits the state is facing possible rolling blackouts because generators are down for unplanned repairs and maintenance. Before summer has even started.

In other words the energy companies now know they can profit from artificial shortages with no consequences.

Look for rolling blackouts this summer as the energy companies reap the rewards of nonexistent government oversight and the ""lawmakers"" continue to cash their checks.

Charen comes up short

in defending democracy

Re: June 14 commentary ""Don’t cry for H.R.1.""

It’s obvious Mona Charen hasn’t had the epiphany experienced by her fellow “never-Trumpers” lifetime Republicans Stuart Stevens and Max Boot.

She needs to read Stevens’ book “It Was All a Lie: How the Republican Party Became Donald Trump” and Boot’s “The Corrosion of Conservativism: Why I Left The Right."" Stevens’ book is a mea culpa a confession his decades-long career spent electing Republicans was a fraud and laid the foundation for Trump.

Charen’s column throws rocks at both House Resolution 1 and the John Lewis Act the Democratic Party's attempt to right the horrors of anti-democratic election laws passed by Georgia and other Republican state legislatures. These are the most recent deployments of Richard Nixon’s successful 1968 racist Southern strategy.

What does Charen suggest to stop these egregious attacks on our democracy? Amending the 1887 Electoral Count Act! Really? She is complicit to The Big Lie she ostensibly condemns.

Not so much in other cities. Often I don't dine in. I know that every one of you to a man would declare me insane if I walked into a restaurant and yelled ""I have rights. All of you put out your cigarettes so I can eat here!""

How sad it is that in this Trump era of demanding one's ""rights"" many have settled on what should be the most uncontroversial truly life-saving device conceived during this pandemic.

The professor Paul Wellstone had co-authored the book in 1981 with his Carleton College physics colleague Barry (Mike) Casper. Powerline recounts the fierce protests in the late 1970s by western Minnesota farmers against the construction of a 430-mile 400-kilovolt powerline called the “CU Project” that ran from a coal-fired power plant in central North Dakota across agricultural land to a substation outside Minneapolis.

Wellstone and Casper had coached the powerline protestors and documented their stories. The alliances they forged helped lay the groundwork for Wellstone’s 1990 election to the U.S. Senate where he served as its most liberal member until he was killed in a plane crash in 2002. I wonder what Wellstone and Casper (who died in 2007) both champions of renewable energy and environmental sustainability would make of today’s brewing energy wars over proposals such as President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan to expand high-voltage long-distance transmission lines. A massive build-out of the grid has become central to strategies for decarbonizing the electric sector electrifying the economy and meeting net-zero carbon-emission targets by 2050. Commentators usually present the barriers to such expansion as “financial and administrative.” An equally large barrier however is likely to be political resistance to powerlines like the revolt in rural Minnesota forty years ago.

Powerline is a classic David-versus-Goliath morality tale. The Goliath electric utilities and state government officials possessed the power of eminent domain -- the right to take private property for public use. Their allies in state courts and law enforcement enforced government decisions and protected the line. The dairy farmer Davids in Grant Pope and Stearns counties by contrast had little voice in the process of granting the “certificate of need” for the line and determining where it would be located. Neither non-violent nor violent action could stop the project. The lesson my classmates and I took away from the book was “fight the power!”

Lost on us at the time though was the complexity of the power struggle. The developers of the CU Project were not the investor-owned “private power” companies long distrusted by farmers but two associations of rural electric cooperatives the kind that rural Americans fought for under the 1936 Rural Electrification Act. In the early 1970s the price paid by the cooperatives for electric power skyrocketed. Coal-fired power was by far the cheapest option for new electricity generation and one promoted heavily by the Ford and Carter administrations. As interviews from the Minnesota Powerline Oral History Project reveal the cooperatives viewed the CU Project as a way of increasing control over energy costs to their members many of whom favored the line. But those supporters did not have easements forced on them through eminent domain.

For those who did the powerline represented an assault on their way of life a government intrusion into how they managed their privately owned land. Many also alleged that electrical and magnetic fields emitted from high-voltage lines caused cancer and other ailments allegations that have since been disproven. After exhausting their options through the legal and political system the farmers’ initial efforts at non-violent civil disobedience turned violent. Protestors pulled survey stakes destroyed concrete tower foundations toppled transmission towers (fourteen in all) and shot at private security guards.

In Powerline Wellstone and Casper justify these acts of violence and sabotage as the farmers’ only recourse in the face of “increasing centralization of energy facilities and energy control.” They conclude that the powerline would not have been needed had the utilities followed the “soft energy path” toward conservation and local renewable generation. They argue that the $1.2 billion in low-interest REA loans for the CU Project would have been better spent on home insulation wood-burning stoves and solar-water heaters. Taking cues from Powerline a recent history of the 1970s “rural revolt” goes so far as to depict the powerline protestors as budding renewable energy advocates.

That depiction is far-fetched. These farms averaging 300-400 acres in size consumed enormous amounts of electricity fuel oil propane diesel fuel and gasoline. Small-scale solar installations would not have powered their dairy poultry and crop operations. These protests were driven by concerns not about energy but about land. As the Powerline Oral History project shows the protesting farmers resented the use of eminent domain to force easements across their land against their will. They seethed at state and federal environmental laws that prevented the siting of utility lines through wildlife areas and along highway rights-of-way but not across farmland.

The farmer’s revolt did not prevent the CU powerline from entering into operation in August 1979. It still delivers electricity today. However the revolt did win important reforms for future projects. Minnesota passed a “buy-the-farm” statute that guaranteed more public involvement in energy siting decisions and strengthened landowner rights in eminent domain proceedings. The state later amended eminent domain law to increase condemnation payments to property owners. Congress also revised the Highway Beautification Act to make it possible to build powerlines within highway rights-of-way. These reforms smoothed the way for the 2017 completion of the CapX2020 transmission project a system of eight hundred miles of new transmission to bring electricity from the Dakotas across Minnesota.

Still property rights challenges to the construction of energy infrastructure are gaining force echoing the complaints from the Minnesota plains in the 1970s. The context this time is different mainly due to the issue of climate change. As part of their “keep it in the ground” strategy to reduce carbon emissions climate activists oppose the use of eminent domain when it comes to oil and gas pipelines. Such opposition however also feeds resistance to high-voltage powerlines whether transmitting electricity from fossil fuels or renewable sources.

Whereas climate activists may distinguish between fossil fuels and renewable energy when it comes to enforcing eminent domain their property rights allies in pipeline fights do not. Like the Minnesota farmers in the 1970s rural Americans are intent on guarding their land and they object more to infrastructure above ground than below. In 2016 Iowa farmers challenged the granting of eminent domain for the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). Although supported by the Sierra Club these Iowans were not concerned about DAPL’s climate implications but by what they viewed as an unconstitutional taking of their property. The Iowa Supreme Court denied the challenge but the state legislature in 2017 acknowledged this property rights insurgency by banning the use of eminent domain for siting overhead electricity transmission lines.

Recently developers have sketched out many large-scale transmission projects to integrate dispersed wind and solar power into regional grids. Property owners across the United States are fighting to stop them. The now-debunked claim that power lines cause cancer still fuels opposition. As Russell Gold’s Superpower recounts Clean Line Energy Partners worked fruitlessly for years to overcome landowner objections to powerlines that would bring wind energy from Oklahoma to Tennessee and from Kansas to Indiana. Those regions along with Iowa and Nebraska are precisely where wind energy is needed the most to meet net-zero goals. Battles have been joined in New Jersey New Hampshire Illinois and Wisconsin to block other transmission projects. In addition much opposition has mobilized against wind projects across the Northeast and Midwest including Minnesota.

In some places there are options for running lines along railway or highway rights-of-way to avoid eminent domain proceedings. Transparent and inclusive transmission planning exemplified by CapX2020 has proven that landholders can be won over in some regions. Nevertheless achieving carbon-reduction targets will require many wind farms solar arrays and transmission lines across the land of rural Americans. Will some end up resisting in the way that many Minnesotans did in the 1970s? Would Paul Wellstone and Mike Casper support such resistance now if it undermined national climate action?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwOTU5NjUyNjIxMDExNDA50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Estimation of industrial emissions in a Latin American megacity under power matrix scenarios projected to the year ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652621011409 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwOTU5NjUyNjIxMDExNDA50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

This can be a great way to take a break from the work-from-home grind and explore a new country (or revisit an old favorite).

Switzerland and the U.S. are well-connected by air. Numerous U.S. airlines fly to Zurich (ZRH) and Swiss flies from both Zurich (ZRH) and Geneva (GVA) to major U.S. cities. In a recent hunt for award space I found that Swiss and United Airlines have wide-open business class award space from the U.S. to Zurich this summer and early fall. Most space is from New York City but others have open business class seats as well.

You can book these award tickets with United MileagePlus miles or any major Star Alliance transfer partner. This includes American Express Membership Rewards partners like Air Canada Aeroplan and ANA Mileage Club and Avianca LifeMiles. You'll get a great deal on a comfortable flight to a newly reopened Switzerland regardless of how you book.

So if Switzerland has been at the top of your travel bucket list now's the time to book your flights. I'll give you a closer look at open award space and how to book award flights to Switzerland in this article.

How to book: Find award space with your favorite Star Alliance search tool and transfer points to book your ticket.

If transferring Amex points you'll find the best points pricing with ANA Mileage Club but will pay high fuel surcharges on Swiss tickets. Consider booking Swiss-operated tickets with Aeroplan or LifeMiles at a higher mileage rate to avoid paying these surcharges. Or book United-operated tickets with ANA.

You can also book with United miles. These transfer in from Chase Ultimate Rewards. Unfortunately Untied charges the highest mileage price for transatlantic awards booked with partner airlines like Swiss.

Pay Taxes/Fees With: The Platinum Card® from American Express (5x on airfare booked directly with the airline; on up to $500000 on these purchases per calendar year) Chase Sapphire Reserve (3x on travel) or Chase Sapphire Preferred Card (2x on travel) for travel protections on the award flight.

Round-trip tickets from the U.S. to Zurich (ZRH) and Geneva (GVA) typically cost thousands of dollars. For example this round-trip ticket from Newark (EWR) to Zurich (ZRH) in United Polaris business class costs $4443 round-trip.

I expect premium airfare to stay high from the U.S. to Switzerland through the summer due to the country's reopening. So your miles have the potential to save you some serious coin on your transatlantic journey.

For example if you book a United round-trip award by transferring 88000 Amex points to ANA you'll get 4.9 cents per point in value. TPG values Amex points at 2.0 cents per point so this is an excellent redemption.

Of course a country's reopening plans can change at the last minute. Make sure you fully understand the change and cancellation policy of the loyalty program you book with if you need to make changes at the last minute. Of the airlines on this list you'll find that Aeroplan and United offer the most generous flexibility while LifeMiles charges a fee to change or cancel.

Final Thoughts

As American Express continues to expand its partnerships with lifestyle organizations this presents a solid opportunity for those who have been interested in ONDA or even for those just hearing about it for the first time to try out its services and locations for a few months to see if it’s a good fit for them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vYW1leC1vZmZlcmluZy0xMDAtYm9udXMtbWlsZXMtd2hlbi1yZWZlcnJpbmctdG8tZGVsdGEtY2FyZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amex Offering $100 + Bonus Miles When Referring To Delta Cards,"Well hello there Mr Benjamin!

American Express has been running some great referral offers this past year with the signup bonuses often being better when signing up using someone’s referral link than when going directly to Amex.

Amex is now enhancing things on the referrer side too. If you have a Delta card they’ve added a $100 incentive on top of the bonus SkyMiles that you earn as standard.

The Deal

Refer friends & family from Amex Delta credit cards and get a $100 statement credit when making a Delta purchase in the 3 months after your first friend is approved on top of the bonus SkyMiles you’ll earn.

Key Terms

Refer friends to apply by August 25 2021.

Quick Thoughts

This isn’t the first time Amex has offered the opportunity to earn two different types of referral bonuses at the same time. For example just recently you could refer someone to a new Amex card and get 4x/4% back at home furnishing stores on up to $25000 of spend on top of the bonus points you’d earn as standard.

This is the first time I remember seeing them offer a $100 statement credit to the referrer on Delta cards though. The key thing to be aware of is that there’s an additional requirement in order to earn the $100 statement credit – you have to make a Delta purchase in the 3 months after your friend is approved.

When this kind of statement credit deal has been offered for people applying for the card themselves the statement credit has been awarded for something as cheap as the $5.60 taxes and fees on an award flight – you’ve never had to actually spend $100 with Delta.

I’ve also been able to trigger one of those statement credits in the past by buying a $50 Delta gift card from this page. Note that Delta has three different gift card landing pages – the one I’ve linked to there and two run by CashStar. The CashStar pages won’t work as they’re a third party and so those purchases don’t show up as a Delta purchase. I can’t guarantee that buying a Delta gift card directly from them will still trigger statement credits; if you do decide to go that route buy the gift card on desktop rather than mobile because mobile purchases seem to code different and could affect whether or not Amex sees it as a Delta purchase.

Something else worth noting is that Amex specifically states that you’ll get the $100 statement credit “after your first friend is approved”. That certainly makes it sound like you’ll only get one opportunity to earn a $100 statement credit even if you refer two or more people to a new Delta card. That’s a shame but an extra $100 is better than nothing.

These increased bonuses for the referrer only seem to be available on personal Delta cards right now; if you try referring from a Delta business card of some variety the extra $100 isn’t listed.

It’ll be interesting to see if Amex decides to offer something similar on other cobranded cards like Hilton and Marriott.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMTkvYnVzaW5lc3MvZGVhbGJvb2svY29ycG9yYXRlLWFjdGl2aXNtLWxldHRlcnMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corporate America's Favorite Type of Activism,"The DealBook newsletter delves into a single topic or theme every weekend providing reporting and analysis that offers a better understanding of an important issue in the news.

Opinion columnist

Joe Biden has had more foreign policy experience than any other president in U.S. history. When he entered the Senate and began dealing with global issues it was 1973 and Leonid Brezhnev was chairman of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The previous most experienced among our presidents when it came to foreign policy was George H.W. Bush. Add up his time in Congress as ambassador to the United Nations head of the U.S. Liaison Office in China head of the CIA and vice president Bush became president with 17 years of foreign policy experience.

That is a third of the foreign policy experience Biden has had.

It is probably unfair to compare Biden's early performance to the first months of Donald Trump the only president in U.S. history to have had zero public service experience of any kind before he took office. In fact it’s probably unfair to compare him with any of his predecessors since the senior Bush. Former Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton former Texas Gov. George W. Bush and freshman Sen. Barack Obama all came into office with little or no international affairs experience. And it showed.

First-term foreign policy fumbles

George W. Bush oversaw the beginning of the worst foreign policy calamity in U.S. history –– the unwarranted and disastrous U.S. invasion of Iraq. As hard to imagine as it is his decisions in the global arena were even worse than Trump’s.

Clinton’s first-term foreign policy fumbles ranged from the Black Hawk down incident in Somalia and failing to act swiftly enough to stem the genocide in Rwanda to unsteadily handling the first challenges posed by the Balkan war and a misguided overly optimistic view of post-Soviet Russia. The U.S. intervention in Haiti backed the wrong horse (Jean-Bertrand Aristide); his Iraq policy was muddled; and the Oslo Accord between Israel and the Palestinians in the end did not work. And I say all this as a former member of the Clinton administration.

Obama who was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for no apparent reason other than not being George W. Bush gave some uplifting speeches in the early days of his administration – promising a different view toward the Arab world and an end to nuclear weapons. Ultimately reality did not live up to his vision. He pledged to get out of Iraq and Afghanistan and failed at both. For example in Afghanistan he ignored the advice of then-Vice President Biden and bought into a surge strategy that did not work. His vaunted “reset” with Russia – proposed during an early visit to Moscow – flopped.

By virtue of his long experience Biden’s first months in office have been far more successful. He rapidly put together a respected team of foreign policy veterans. He quickly undid Trump policy errors bringing America back into international groups like the World Health Organization and international accords like the Paris Agreement. When crises erupted in places like Ukraine and between the Israelis and Palestinians he intervened with a sure touch and helped avert escalation.

Jennifer Granholm: China profits off our passivity. Biden's American Jobs Plan would change that.

Biden's recent trip to Europe is among the most successful ever for a new president. He launched a refresh of the Atlantic Charter with the United Kingdom reengaged with the Group of Seven industrialized countries and played a leading role in an unprecedented commitment of vaccines to needy nations. He led an effort to reshape NATO priorities got agreement to cite both Chinese and Russian threats and reasserted America’s absolute commitment to Article 5 NATO members' principle of collective protection in the event of an attack.

At a summit with European Union leaders a major trade issue was resolved and a long list of new initiatives was undertaken. And in a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin Biden laid out America’s concerns underscored our resolve in standing up to future Russian abuses helped usher in a new focus on cybersecurity threats and sought areas of potential cooperation such as restarting the Iran nuclear deal.

Biden vs. Bush 41 is a fair comparison

That is why of all the presidents across the past 32 years the only one to which Biden can fairly be compared is to George H.W. Bush. Eastern and Central Europe were in the midst of deep unrest when Bush took office. His first two years saw an unprecedented wave of revolutions that ultimately led tothe fall of Berlin Wall in November 1989 and shortly after the end of the Soviet Union. The Tiananmen uprising camethat summer in Beijing. Effective well-managed diplomacy was required to usher in what became known as “the new world order.”

Bush’s experienced team showed it was up to the task – not only in how it handled the end of the Cold War but also with its management of Operation Desert Shield. The administration accomplished its goal of driving Iraq out of Kuwait and did not prolong the war or destabilize the Middle East by going after Saddam Hussein.

Restoring America's role:Biden warns Putin on human rights and cybersecurity in Geneva. US moral clarity is back.

Leaving Geneva last week Biden dismissed the idea that foreign policy is “a great great skill that somehow is sort of like a secret code.” He argued that it was a “logical extension of personal relationships. It’s the way human nature functions.”

While he was certainly right about that he downplayed another fact: In complex affairs of state experience matters. If Biden’s record stands the test of time perhaps his and Bush’s relative success – contrasted with the struggles of less experienced presidents – will put an end to the notion that on-the-job training is adequate for the toughest job in the world.

Blue Ridge-class command and control ship USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) and Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Roosevelt (DDG 80) and USS Thomas Hudner (DDG 161) arrived in the German Naval Base after working with 18 nations and more than 40 ships 60 aircraft and 4000 servicemembers during the 50th exercise Baltic Operations (BALTOPS).

“Every BALTOPS we increase our capabilities as an Alliance maintaining an asymmetric advantage” said Capt. David “Crusty” Pollard commanding officer of Mount Whitney. “Our logistics stop in Kiel enables continued presence in the Baltic and reinforces the bonds we build at sea.”

Radio plays!) to the changing landscape. With the light now at the end of the proverbial tunnel those schools are deftly mapping out the path back into the classroom. (Columbia is even throwing in a free year.) What the pandemic year has proven is that the appetite for content — and the actors necessary to bring it to life — has never been stronger. As training grounds brace for a sharp increase in applicants The Hollywood Reporter consulted with insiders alumni and casting pros for its annual ranking of the best places to earn an acting degree.

Juilliard (New York) Classes have been conducted in person since November 2020 at Juilliard where a four-year BFA acting program and a four-year MFA acting program are offered. Students from both levels of this most elite of conservatories cross paths in studio work (voice movement scene study etc.). Recent grads include In the Heights‘ Corey Hawkins and Search Party‘s Brandon Micheal Hall. On the faculty end a nine-month search led to the hiring of Derrick Sanders founder of Congo Square Theatre dedicated to work “rooted in the African diaspora” as the new associate director of the school’s drama division. Students recently made waves protesting a planned $2000 tuition increase to about $51000. The final year’s tuition is waived for grad students. (All tuitions cited are annual.)

Yale (New Haven CT) The school which operates in partnership with the Yale Repertory Theatre offers a three-year acting MFA only and features one of the starriest lists of graduates — including WandaVision‘s Kathryn Hahn Watchmen‘s Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and 2021 Oscar winner Frances McDormand. Tuition is $34000 — but the school boasts that 85 percent of students receive financial aid.

NYU - Tisch (New York) Image Credit: Ella Bromblin/Courtesy of School. As New York theater and TV and film production perk back to life after a year of stasis this school which is actually two separately run schools — Tisch Drama and the Graduate Acting Program — benefits greatly from being right in the heart of the action. Tisch has a proven track record at both the undergraduate (My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend‘s Rachel Bloom) and graduate level (Moonlight‘s André Holland). Carl Cofield joins the latter three-year program this fall as department chair. He was previously associate artistic director of the Classical Theatre of Harlem. A new performance facility at 181 Mercer St. is nearly complete and will feature NYU’s first professional-level proscenium a fly-loft theater for student production plus rehearsal and training spaces. Tuition for undergrads is $59000; grad school is $65000 with financial aid available (on average students receiving aid are responsible for covering 30 percent).

University of North Carolina School of the Arts (Winston-Salem North Carolina) The four-year undergrad program is among the premiere training institutions to offer a BFA in acting. The program was among the most innovative in getting its students on their feet throughout the pandemic with a combination of filmed theater radio plays and socially distanced in-person shows. Anthony Mackie (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) and Billy Magnussen (Made for Love) are alums. Tuition is $23000 for out-of-state $6500 for in-state with scholarships available.

UC San Diego (San Diego) Graduate students work closely with the top-ranked La Jolla Playhouse at UCSD where Toby Onwumere (The Matrix 4) got his MFA. The school puts a strong emphasis on mounting new plays working in close partnership with the Wagner New Play Festival. B.A.s in theater are also offered and students have access to the school’s five theater spaces (four of which are shared with the La Jolla Playhouse). Undergrad tuition is $15000 for California residents and $45000 for out-of-state; grad students have their tuition waived and are given a monthly stipend of $2500.

London Academy of Music & Dramatic Art (London) 12 Years a Slave‘s Chiwetel Ejiofor and Stranger Things‘ Joseph Quinn both graduated from this institution the oldest drama school in England (founded 160 years ago). Three degrees are offered to prospective students: a three-year B.A. in professional acting a two-year MFA in professional acting and a one-year M.A. in classical acting for the theater. Tuition is about $30000.

Carnegie Mellon (Pittsburgh) The first school in the United States to offer a degree in acting remains one of its very best. Only a BFA in acting is available — a four-year program with an emphasis on musical theater that boasts Gary Kline one of the finest vocal teachers in the world on the faculty. Matt Bomer (The Boys in the Band) and Ming-Na Wen (Mulan) are graduates. An assistant dean for diversity equity and inclusion Valeria Martinez has been appointed to oversee representation at the university’s College of Fine Arts. Tuition for undergrads is $58000; grad school is $36000 with some scholarships and aid available.

Guildhall (London) Another of London’s vibrant training grounds has put its graduate program on hold as it reconfigures a new version “eligible for U.K. government funding” to make it more affordable. But its B.A. in acting is still going strong — an intensive three-year cycle that has produced the likes of Michaela Coel the powerhouse behind HBO’s I May Destroy You. Tuition is $30000.

The Old Globe & USD (San Diego) This MFA program accepts just seven students per class for a two-year year-round immersion into classical and contemporary theater studies. During the pandemic year Sam White artistic director of Shakespeare in Detroit directed A Midsummer Night’s Dream via Zoom — the virtual production was viewed by public schools throughout San Diego and Detroit. Tuition is fully covered for each student accepted and a monthly stipend is given to help toward living expenses.

Brown University (Providence Rhode Island) The MFA’s usually the thing at Brown where students tread the boards at the affiliated Trinity Rep. But grad admissions are on pause for the 2021-22 school year as the school gets back up to speed post-COVID-19. (Second-year and third-year students continue in their training and are offered an additional year of schooling at no cost.) The undergrad program is in full swing however and the school has produced the likes of Laura Linney and John Krasinski a playwriting major who graduated in 2001. The drama school is the only Ivy League institution that fully covers tuition for graduate students. Undergraduates can expect to pay $58000 however.

UCLA (Los Angeles) Image Credit: Courtesy of UCLA Though the MFA acting program is not accepting applications for Fall 2022 the four-year B.A. in Theater remains open. This remains the best L.A.-based degree acting program where everyone from Jack Black to Chad‘s Nasim Pedrad has studied. Graduate tuition is $11000; undergrad is $13000 for California residents $43000 out-of-state.

Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (London) Taron Egerton and Cynthia Erivo are just two of the multitalented stars to come out of this famed conservatory which offers a three-year B.A. in acting and a one-year master’s acting lab.

American Conservatory Theater (San Francisco) The MFA program is on hiatus (in-person training for its class of 2022 continues however) but for those dying to get their feet wet at the school that trained Brie Larson and Zendaya this West Coast institution is offering 15-week programs called “San Francisco Semester” that will return to in-person instruction in Fall 2021. Tuition is $30500.

USC (Los Angeles) USC’s proximity and deep ties to Hollywood mean students there might get a visiting lecture from someone like Lisa Kudrow Bryan Cranston or Tony Shalhoub all of whom have stopped by to share some wisdom. The school offers a B.A. in theater and an MFA in acting. New Amsterdam star Ryan Eggold Saturday Night Live‘s Beck Bennett and Ozark‘s McKinley Belcher III all attended. Tuition is $58000.

National Institute of Dramatic Arts (Sydney) This force from Down Under produces some of Hollywood’s biggest talents — from Baz Luhrmann to Cate Blanchett and Succession‘s Sarah Snook. The program is three years and offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts. It also gives students an Australian actor’s union membership the equivalent of an Actors’ Equity card in the U.S. meaning grads can immediately work professionally in both countries. Twenty-four students are accepted. Tuition is $24000.

Columbia University (New York City) This MFA program gave every student in the acting department a year on the house due to COVID-19. It has also beefed up its BIPOC faculty hiring Scott Whitehurst to oversee its Shakespeare in the Schools initiative and Nikkole Salter to teach text analysis. Recent grads making it in the biz include Tamera Tomakili (currently shooting HBO’s Showtime) and Marcel Spears (a series regular on CBS’ The Neighborhood). Tuition is $72000. In the third year it drops to roughly $14000.

Case Western Reserve (Cleveland) Image Credit: Courtesy of Case Western Over 1100 hopefuls audition every year to land one of eight coveted spots in this MFA program which offers students professional stage opportunities at the affiliated Cleveland Play House. It’s a three-year intensive program that features a strong lineup of guest artists (playwright David Henry Hwang for example). A new performance space the Maltz Performing Arts Center opens later this year. The program is tuition-free plus a stipend is offered.

Cal Arts (Santa Clarita) This Is Us star Ron Cephas Jones joined the faculty this year to teach acting at CalArts where Cecily Strong Alison Brie and The

Chi’s Tiffany Boone studied. A four-year BFA and three-year MFA program are offered and professional opportunities are available

Florida State University (Sarasota FL) A three-year MFA program operating in conjunction with the Asolo Repertory Theatre the program chooses 12 students each year to participate in a rigorous training and performance schedule. The Asolo season has already been announced beginning in November with Everybody a modern spin on the 14th-century morality play Everyman. Upon graduation all students will walk away with an Actors’ Equity card. Tuition is $19000 out-of-state and free for graduate students.

Northwestern (Chicago) An undergraduate theater major and two-year MFA in acting are available with grad students performing annually at a Summer Stage season at the school’s Evanston campus. Billy Eichner got his B.A. in theater there in 2000; four years later Lily Rabe (appearing next in American Horror Story: Double Feature) did the same. Tuition is $57000.

Southern Methodist University (Dallas) Brian Baumgartner acquired the building blocks for what eventually would become The Office‘s Kevin at this institution’s Meadows School of the Arts. No time was wasted during the pandemic year either as SMU and Clark Atlanta University collaborated via Zoom on Good Trouble a cycle of six original short plays about race that premiered virtually in April. Tuition is $45000 for undergrads. A full-ride scholarship is offered to all grad students plus a stipend.

University of Missouri - K.C. (Kansas City MO) Chicago Med star Nick Gehlfuss trained at this conservatory MFA acting program among the strongest in the Midwest (a B.A. in theater is also offered).

Tuition is $25000.

Savannah College of Art and Design (Savannah GA) The School of Entertainment Arts at SCAD puts a big emphasis on its facilities and has undertaken the construction of a “Hollywood-style film backlot” on its 10-acre campus. The BFA and MFA programs have produced a striking number of working actors including recent grads MK Smith Charmaine Shaw and Christian I. Noble all of whom can currently be seen in Barry Jenkins’ The Underground Railroad for Amazon Prime. (A total of 70 SCAD alumni and current students worked on the production in some capacity.) Tuition is $38000.

Purchase College SUNY (Purchase NY) Edie Falco Parker Posey and Stanley Tucci are just three of the starry names to attend this school’s Conservatory of Theatre Arts which offers a BFA in acting that gives students performance opportunities at the Purchase Repertory Theatre. Recent grad Colby Hollman was plucked out of rehearsals for his final student production to appear in AMC’s Fear the Walking Dead. Out-of-state tuition (including room and board) is $33000; New York residents pay $23000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC9uZXdzL2Jlbi1icmVyZXRvbi1jaGlsZS1jb3BhLWFtZXJpY2EtMjQzNTU3NzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remarkable story of English-born Ben Brereton who faced Lionel Messi with Chile,"The Blackburn Rovers striker was a youth team international for England but scored the winner for Chile in Friday night's Copa America group victory over Bolivia

It may turn out to be a quiz question in years to come: which British-born player was the first player to score on the night England played Scotland in Euro 2020?

The Three Lions played out a drab scoreless draw against Steve Clarke’s side at Wembley - a game high on emotion and tension but with little clear-cut goalmouth action.

However the European Championships are not the only international competition being played out this summer with South America’s equivalent - the Copa America - also being staged.

Lionel Messi Neymar Luis Suarez and Alexis Sanchez are among the notable stars playing at the tournament but there is another forward who will also be familiar for many fans of English football.

Blackburn Rovers striker Ben Brereton represented England up to Under-20 level - and starred for his nation at the Under-19 European Championship in 2017 joint top scorer in the tournament which his side won - but is now playing in the Copa America - for Chile.

Brereton’s mother Andrea moved to England as a child but here roots in the South American nation have allowed Ben to be legible to represent La Roja.

The striker played in the same England youth teams as Reece James Mason Mount and Aaron Ramsdale but whilst that trio are involved for the Three Lions at Wembley this month - Brereton is playing 6000 miles away.

Despite his exploits at youth team level and establishing a strong career for himself as a regular in the Championship - firstly at Nottingham Forest and now at Ewood Park - it did not appear likely his international career would be resurrected.

His first call-up to the Chilean squad came last month for the World Cup qualifiers against Argentina and Bolivia and then he was called up to the squad for the Copa America.

Brereton recently told an interview with The Lancashire Telegraph : ""I have been learning keywords. They also provided me with the basic football words and my understanding with my team-mates has been very good.

Can Ben Brereton become a key player at international level for Chile? Comment below

""Everyone has received me very well both players and coaching staff.

""Obviously I have talked more with [ Watford defender] Francisco Sierralta who speaks very good English and plays in the same division as me.

""I have also spoken a lot with [Monterrey defender] Sebastian Vegas because I was with him the first night and he also speaks very good English but in general I have got along well with everyone.""

Brereton made his debut for the nation in their tournament opener against Argentina in which his side earned an admirable 1-1 draw before finding the net for the first time on Friday night against Bolivia - scoring decisively in a 1-0 victory for Martin Lasarte’s side.

After the game Lasarte said of the striker who when playing for Chile is named Ben Brereton Diaz: ""I think that for Ben it was an important occasion it is difficult to play as a starter in a team where he does not speak the language.

""The team-mates are collaborating a lot. For him it has been a very motivating situation from the point of view of anxiety.

""The role that Claudio Bravo plays like others is that he is close to him communicating trying to set guidelines for him on an idiomatic and cultural level as well.""

Despite his attributes Brereton is not a prolific scorer - he has just 18 goals in 145 first-team appearances for Forest and Rovers - but has already begun his tally at senior international level.

He did bag seven goals for Blackburn last season along with providing four direct assists and the Stoke-born forward now looks set to be a key figure for the South American nation.",,,

White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a disease that affects hibernating bats and is caused by a fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans or Pd for short. Sometimes Pd looks like a white fuzz on bats’ faces which is how the disease got its name. Pd grows in cold dark and damp places. It attacks the bare skin of bats while they’re hibernating in a relatively inactive state. As it grows Pd causes changes in bats that make them become active more than usual and burn up fat they need to survive the winter. Bats with white-nose syndrome may do strange things like fly outside in the daytime in the winter.

White-Nose Syndrome was discovered at Devils Tower National Monument in April of 2021.

How deadly is WNS for bats?

This disease does not affect humans however it has killed millions of bats since it was found in the United States in 2006 in New York. Prior to the discovery of WNS in North America this disease was unknown to science. Researchers began testing bats globally and found it on bats in Asia and Europe although those bats did not appear to get as sick from the Pd fungus.

At some North American sites WNS has killed 90-100 percent of the bat population. There are currently twelve known North American bat species that are affected by WNS across 35 states and 7 Canadian provinces. Two bat species that are hit particularly hard by this disease are the Little Brown Bat and the threatened Northern Long-eared Bat both of which call Devils Tower National Monument home.

There is currently no cure for WNS but scientists all accross the world are working to study the disease how it spreads how it affects different bat species and what we can all do collectivly to help control it. One thing that is known of WNS is that humans can transmit the Pd fungal spores to unaffected regions on their skin clothing or gear if not properly decontaminated after recreating in WNS postive areas.

AWK,American Water Works,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8xOS9jYWxpZm9ybmlhLWhlYXQtd2F2ZS1kcm91Z2h0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Severe heat and drought are the hallmarks of a changing West,"LAKE OROVILLE Calif. – The work had to be done quickly as water vanished to vapor in the early summer heat. Hauling giant houseboats some 50 to 60 feet long from this lake became urgent just a few weeks ago.

In all the Oroville Lake Marinas company removed 130 houseboats; floating recreation palaces such as the Monte-Carol and La Bella Vita now sit in a parking lot on stacks of pasteboard props. The lot stands where the lake’s high water mark would usually be — 900 feet. It is now 700 feet and falling fast.

The man-made lake which helps to irrigate thousands of acres of crops through the elaborate State Water Project is now so low that it is impossible for the marina to remove more of the large boats even as dun-colored islands begin to pop up. The launch ramp no longer reaches the water which will keep disappearing amid a summer of record heat including the “mega-heat wave” currently scorching much of the West.

“I’ve seen it like this before but only at the end of summer never this early” said Aaron Wright the area’s public safety chief who has worked in and around Lake Oroville — the state’s second-largest reservoir — for that last eight years. “This low will be historic.”

Much of the American West  from parched Northern California through Arizona and New Mexico is drying out at a record pace.

The onset of this severe drought was far quicker than previous ones — the result of a meager Sierra Nevada snowpack and early seasonal heat that evaporated the runoff needed to fill the reservoirs and rivers.

“It’s difficult to point to one occurrence and say ‘Hah this is climate change’’’ said John Yarbrough the assistant deputy director for the State Water Project with the California Department of Water Resources.

But this year — the second consecutive that the nation’s most populous state will be in drought — has been different from previous ones. Yarbrough said that only 20 percent of the expected runoff from an already well-below average snowpack arrived in reservoirs. The rest evaporated during the unseasonably warm spring.

“The relationship broke down” Yarbrough said. “It is unlike anything we have seen.”

Managing emergency

The heat and drought have forced decisions from farmers and policymakers far earlier than in years past — what crops to grow what fields to fallow how much to spend to protect the state’s $50 billion agricultural industry.

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has declared a drought emergency in 41 of the state’s 58 counties covering about a third of the state’s population and set aside $5.1 billion to manage some of the immediate consequences. On Thursday Newsom declared a state of emergency because of the heat wave a move that makes more energy available within the power grid.

There are many in Lake Oroville and across the region.

More than half of the western United States is in the grips of “extreme” or “exceptional” drought indicating widespread water shortages and major impacts on crops and pasture. In California Arizona and Utah the period between June 2020 and May 2021 has been the driest ever recorded.

“Every dry year is not the same as every other dry year and every drought is not the same as any other drought” said Felicia Marcus a visiting fellow at Stanford University’s Water in the West program. “This one’s come on hot and quickly. And that has created an acceleration of the problems you might otherwise see in part because our ecosystems our forests our groundwater resources haven’t recovered from the last one.”

The heat and drought are hallmarks of climate change.

Human activities have already raised global average temperatures more than 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. In many western states the increase is close to 2 degrees Celsius — a threshold the United Nations associates with catastrophic warming.

[Dangerous new hot zones are spreading around the world]

Unless people drastically reduce planet-warming emissions the world faces a future of increasingly frequent and severe environmental disasters: coastal flooding mass extinctions deadly hurricanes uncontrollable wildfires.

For much of the West the future is now.

Last year wildfires burned more than 4.3 million acres across California — the most in state history — and now at least one-quarter of the state’s residents live in high fire risk zones according to state fire officials.

Phoenix now experiences more than 100 days of triple-digit temperatures every year. Mountain snowpacks which provide most of the region’s water have declined 15 to 30 percent since the middle of the century and water levels in Lake Mead — the country’s largest reservoir — have never been this low.

Under a worst-case scenario in which emissions continue to increase scientists anticipate that Western summers could warm by as much as 4 degrees Celsius. Drought severity will triple. Wildfire “season” will become a year-round event.

If the nation is forced to put restrictions on water from the Colorado River farmers in Arizona will be among the very first to see cuts. In a decades-old deal the state agreed to claim the most “junior” rights to the river if the federal government helped build an aqueduct to transport water to cities and fields across the state.

Now those growers of produce hay and cotton may see their entire allotments cut.

“They’ll likely … have to fallow up to 40 percent of what was being grown before” said Stefanie Smallhouse a fifth generation Arizona rancher and president of the Arizona Farm Bureau Federation.

Her organization is one of some 200 signatories on a letter asking that $49 billion worth of water-related investments — canal repairs recycling projects ecosystem restoration — be included in the federal infrastructure package.

“We’re used to dryness” Smallhouse said. “We live in the Southwest and we try to plan for it. But these prolonged periods are just very difficult to plan for. You really have to have to be looking at more broad infrastructure type solutions which involve more than just one ranch and one farm. We can’t do it on our own.”

On Smallhouse’s own ranch outside Tucson her husband and 14-year-old son spend every daylight hour hauling water. The family is constantly looking for leaks in the irrigation system that waters the alfalfa they need to feed their cattle.

“Physically it’s exhausting” Smallhouse said. “And mentally? It’s tough. Because you just don’t know what’s going to happen.”

Even desert plants and animals — creatures that evolved to withstand water scarcity — are unable to cope with the ongoing drought. Smallhouse described seeing creosote and mesquite bushes wither. Giant saguaro cactuses are shriveling in the heat.

Last fall wildlife biologists were shocked when migrating birds began dying by the hundreds of thousands. When Martha Desmond examined the carcasses she found the animals were “emaciated.”

Years of drought had so depleted their food supply that birds were breaking down the muscles in their wings just to maintain enough energy to fly. A freak windstorm over Labor Day weekend and one of the worst fire seasons on record likely sealed the animals’ fates.

“We’re really setting ourselves up to be in the same situation right now” said Desmond a New Mexico State University ornithologist who studied last year’s die-off. “These are dangerous times for animals.”

New rules

In recent weeks several Northern California counties and cities have begun imposing water-saving regulations. Marin County just north of San Francisco was among the first to do so prohibiting most outside water use in residential areas.

Healdsburg in Sonoma County wine-growing country imposed a mandatory 40 percent reduction in use compared with last year on all residents. The city took the step earlier this month after it became clear that it would not meet the initial 20 percent conservation target set in the spring.

Farmers have been told that state and federal water allotments will be curtailed and hundreds of growers who have rights to draw from the nearby Russian River were informed this week that they would likely not be allowed to do so this year.

“Big agriculture will find a way to survive they have the resources and flexibility” said Sarge Green a water management specialist with the California Water Institute at the California State University at Fresno.

Large growers have the resources to drill deeper groundwater wells and the deeper they go in California’s San Joaquin Valley the saltier the water is. There is talk of trying out desalination techniques to remove the salt from the deep-well water making it useful for crops of almonds pistachios lettuce and others.

That is a longer-term idea. Right now Green predicts that California agriculture will take a 20 to 30 percent financial hit this year.

“It’s going to be a big hurt” Green said. “And it’s the small towns that get the hardest hit in times like this.”

A dangerous wave of heat

At the same time more than 40 million Americas are facing dangerous triple-digit temperatures this week as the summer’s first major heat wave sweeps across the West.

Long-established records were tied or toppled as the mercury spiked to 107 degrees Fahrenheit in Salt Lake City 108 degrees in Billings Mont. 121 degrees in Needles Calif. Facing surging electricity demands Texas grid operators asked residents to turn down their air conditioning.

In Lake Oroville the dam which at 770 feet high is the nation’s tallest and its electricity production could soon be affected.

Another 60 feet or so of evaporation which could come within weeks will drop the water line below the turbines that provide power to the broader grid. Power companies across the California are preparing residents for a summer of rolling outages.

The extreme heat and drought have turned much of the West into a tinderbox.

Parched vegetation combusts more easily giving wildfires more energy to burn. Already firefighters are battling about 15 blazes in Arizona at least nine in New Mexico and over two dozen more across other Western states.

In the mountains outside Phoenix the Telegraph and Mescal fires have consumed over 200000 acres. Through the haze of smoke accumulating high in the atmosphere the sky has the dull yellow tinge of an old bruise. The sun is a scorching red sphere.

This week’s extreme temperatures have made the fires dangerously unpredictable. On Tuesday morning the Telegraph fire jumped a fuel-free barrier built to contain it prompting the rapid evacuation of three mountain communities.

“The fact that it is so hot makes things more difficult for firefighters on the ground” said Barb Satink Wolfson a fire ecologist at Northern Arizona University and program coordinator for the Southwest Fire Science Consortium. “Fire behavior is elevated. The effects on the landscape are more severe.”

Nights offer no reprieve. Falling temperatures and rising humidity after dark typically tamp down fire behavior giving firefighters a chance to get their bearings and get the blaze under control. But overnight lows in the region are not expected to drop below 90 degrees this week.

It’s not clear whether the state’s monsoon season which lately has run from July through September will bring any relief. The seasonal rains have disappointed two years in a row; 2020 was the Southwest’s driest monsoon season on record.

“We called it the ‘nonsoon’” Wolfson said. “Really at this time of year we’re all sort of holding our breath just hoping for rain.”

Adapting in wine country

Driving west toward California wine country the effects of the drought and the decisions being made around it are evident.

Green flourishing fields are separated from fallow ones by a road or a fence line. “For sale” signs stand along the road at some farms. The dry hot wind blows a fine dust through the orchards and rows of crops.

In Sonoma County one of the first that Newsom declared to be in a drought emergency grape growers are deciding how to plant and where to do so with water at a premium. There are 18 distinct growing regions within the county most famous for its chardonnay.

The recent extremes endured by the county winegrowers most of whom are small farmers with 20 acres or fewer under cultivation can seem apocalyptic by outside standards.

In 2017 and 2020 two enormous fires burned through parts of Sonoma County the latter ruining much of the county’s red grape harvest. In between during the single wet year that separates the current drought in California from the last one vineyards flooded when more than three times the average amount of rain fell.

Last year Sonoma winegrowers experienced a 40 percent decline in business.

“Every year our farmers tangle with Mother Nature” said Karissa Kruse president of Sonoma County Winegrowers a marketing arm for the local industry that has in recent years also expanded its water-related expertise to help advise growers. “Every year it’s adapt innovate and survive.”

Duff Bevill manages 1200 acres of grapes across the county. Now 70 Bevill arrived in Sonoma in a van in the mid-1970s around the time of another severe drought in wine country. He has worked in the industry ever since.

This year Bevill said he has already decided to cut grape production by half at some of his farms simply because there is not enough water to go around. It is called “pruning” and it is happening across the county.

“These are all extremes we’re dealing with now” said Bevill a true graybeard of the local industry. “Very seldom do you have something like the Titanic hit the iceberg and it sinks. Typically it’s an accumulation of these events that start stacking up and you just survive one or two then you’re beat down again. And so this accumulation is what the risk is.”

Steve Dutton represents a fifth generation of Sonoma County grape growers — a family that was among the first to plant chardonnay grapes in the Russian River Valley. He manages about 1200 acres of vines also some sitting on strong groundwater wells and others relying on pools and ponds for irrigation.

Last year Dutton invested $250000 to build a five-acre storage pond at one of his farms. It was in recognition that the nascent drought might be around a while. But the payoff has been negligible: This year rain filled the pond to one-fifth of its capacity.

But Dutton 54 is pushing ahead despite the drought.

This week on two of the hottest days of the year he and workers planted vines that had been in the planning phase for two years. He had no choice but to do so.

And on another of his farms he has enough water in a storage pond for one irrigation which he is waiting as long as possible to conduct. He usually irrigates his vines three times a season and a fourth time after the fall harvest.

“I do nothing the same way my father did and I do almost nothing the same from one year to the next now” Dutton said. “But we need this to be a good year.”

Published: Sat 19 Jun 2021 12:28 PM

The Ministry of Health and Prevention has recently approved the registration and use of Amgen’s lung cancer drug Lumakras following the approval of the US Food and Drug Administration. This step will give lung cancer patients in the UAE early access to this innovative drug in order to help speed up their treatment plan and improve the quality of their life.

LUMAKRAS is supplied as film-coated tablets for oral use containing 120 mg of sotorasib. The drug is prescribed to adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received at least one previous cancer therapy.

The approval of this innovative treatment in the UAE to treat lung cancer as the world's second country comes a week after the UAE has approved the emergency use of a highly effective new treatment for Covid-19 becoming the first country in the world to register the drug following the FDA approval. This would help enhance the competitive position of the UAE in establishing quality and safety for therapeutic healthcare and pharmaceutical systems.

This is in line with the UAE Centennial vision said Dr. Mohammed Salim Al Olama MoHAP Under-Secretary and Head of Board of Directors of the Emirates Health Services .

Amin Hussein Al Amiri the Assistant Undersecretary of MoHAP’s Public Health Policy and Licenses pointed out that the ministry is keen to enhance its partnerships with global pharmaceutical companies to make great progress in providing cancer patients with the best means of treatment and healthcare.

This would help mitigate the burden on the healthcare system reduce the number of critical cases and provide new therapeutic options that contribute to improving the health of patients with lung cancer and reducing their need for medical treatment abroad.

Al Amiri noted that the approval of new medicines in the UAE runs according to a well-thought-out mechanism for drug evaluation and registration expressing his pleasure with the outstanding outcomes of the national indicators of cancer disease in line with the UAE National Agenda.

Dr. Ahmed Mostafa country manager of Amgen in GCC said: ""We are extremely proud of the UAE's approval for Lumakras drug making it the second country in the world after the USA that approves and licenses the medicine. Lumakras is a unique and unprecedented treatment for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.”

This comes as part of the UAE's keenness to attract and provide medicines that prove effective and efficient and adopt them as treatment protocols which greatly contributes to the development of the drug system in accordance with the best international practices.

The medicine registration comes in the wake of the application of MoHAP’s innovative mechanism for its accelerators to evaluate and approve the world’s breakthrough drugs in accordance with the Fast Track/Accelerate Process system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybm5ld3NjZW50cmUuYWUvbmV3cy91YWUvaW5ub3ZhdGl2ZS1sdW5nLWNhbmNlci1kcnVnLWFwcHJvdmVkLWluLXVhZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Innovative lung cancer drug approved in UAE,"www.lumakras.com

The UAE has become the second country in the world to approve the new lung cancer drug 'Lumakras'.

The Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) has cleared the registration and use of the drug which recently received the approval of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

It will help speed up the treatment plan of patients in the UAE and improve their quality of life.

Lumakras manufactured by Amgen is prescribed to adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received at least one previous cancer therapy.

Whether you’re away on vacation or you just installed outdoor lights having an electrical outlet timer can make your life a lot easier in a variety of ways. Here’s everything you need to know.

Electrical Outlet Timer Buying Guide

The best electrical outlet timers are great to own if you want them for security reasons or to regulate energy costs making sure that nighttime appliances and electrical gear like humidifiers and heaters shut down in the morning or just making sure the TV switches off after you fall asleep. Some units take the extra step of monitoring the energy consumption of the device that’s plugged into it and can keep a running record of the stats for years or even decades.

Many new picks let you set multiple time periods or a regular recurring schedule. The old-school dial models are still available but modern timers mostly have LCD screens now displaying clear numbers to make no mistakes when programming it. It’s a little more complex to learn than a click-wheel timer so if you’re not a tech-savvy person or have little patience to deal with it a manual analog model may be the better option. For the opposite end of the tech spectrum smart timers are compatible with your Alexa and Google Home and may not even have a screen or dial at all since it’ll be programmed through an accompanying app or remote.

If you’re looking to use this outdoors or to regulate appliances that’ll be outside you’ll need one that has grounded outlets and is protected against shorting out. It’s not just for gardening gear like pumps and grow lights (though they work great for those) — instead think holiday lights or even setting up a backyard projector. It’s also a good idea to go for one with a built-in surge protector if you’ll be plugging in expensive or important items to protect them at all costs.

Timers even have the option of their own individual settings for different days of the week and separate commands for different outlets. And if this will be part of your permanent setup options that screw into the wall for added stability are a strong choice.

Some are more precise than others so if you’ll need it to be accurate down to the minute (or even the second) be sure to check how deeply it can pinpoint.

Apple Settles It: The CAFC is Suffering from a Prolonged Version of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome,"“The syndrome has recently reached an acute stage which if applied consistently to all similarly situated patents with similarly drafted claims would result in many hundreds of thousands of clearly tangible inventions that one can actually hold in one’s hand being mysteriously declared to be ‘abstract.’”

Alice in Wonderland syndrome is a medical condition for which there is no known treatment. It causes a disturbance of perception and has a serious impact on the life of those afflicted and I suspect on those who surround those afflicted. Of course those in the patent community who work on software implemented innovations know all of this too well.

Think this is a joke? Sadly no. Alice in Wonderland syndrome is a real thing.

A Disturbance of Perception

According to Wikipedia Alice in Wonderland syndrome is named after the Lewis Carroll character because the distortions of perception and size experienced by Alice are reminiscent of those experienced by individuals afflicted with the syndrome. For those unfamiliar with the connection to patent law Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank is the case of seminal importance where the Supreme Court most recently announced the patent eligibility test for computer implemented innovations better known as software.

“Alice in Wonderland syndrome is a disturbance of perception rather than a specific physiological condition” Wikipedia explains. “[T]hough the symptoms may acutely impact the patient’s life while they are present Alice in Wonderland syndrome typically resolves itself within weeks or months.” If only that were similarly true in the legal sphere!

Unfortunately the Federal Circuit seems to be dealing with an exceptionally prolonged and worsening version of Alice in Wonderland syndrome. The syndrome has recently reached an acute stage which if applied consistently to all similarly situated patents with similarly drafted claims would result in many hundreds of thousands of clearly tangible inventions that one can actually hold in one’s hand being mysteriously declared to be “abstract” by the Federal Circuit.

And as previously mentioned according to Wikipedia “[a]t present Alice in Wonderland syndrome has no standardized treatment plan.”

‘Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast’

In addition to a litany of inventions that have fallen as patent ineligible under the Supreme Court’s Alice-Mayo framework the Federal Circuit recently ruled — over a strong dissent by Judge Newman — that a digital camera was both abstract and patent ineligible. Remarkably the claim in Yu v. Apple 2020-1760 (Fed. Cir. June 11 2021) recited image sensors lenses that are mounted to the image sensors a digital image processor and even analog-to-digital converting circuits. How could the claim be abstract? How can a claim that recites circuitry be abstract? Moreover this claim went the final mile to recite the delivery of a tangible application namely the delivery of a resultant digital image.

Yu did not argue that it is well known to use multiple pictures to enhance each other but rather argued that claim 1 was directed to a patent eligible application which by its express literal terms it is. Nevertheless Judge Prost (who was joined by Judge Taranto) found that the components used were conventional and there was nothing unique about the claimed configuration of the lenses and sensors.

The only conclusion is that the Federal Circuit judges are experiencing the world as Alice’s White Queen who was known to have sometimes “believed six impossible things before breakfast.”

‘Curioser and Curioser’

What is interesting is that in reaching the patent eligibility determination under 35 U.S.C. 101 Judge Prost reviewed the specification to find that the configuration for which the inventor described uniqueness compared with the prior art was a version of the invention containing 4 lenses and 4 sensors which she wrote made claim 1 overbroad because it only required 2 lenses and 2 sensors. Such a determination however is really a matter properly decided under 35 U.S.C. 112. Indeed the only way one can truly appreciate the scope of a claim vis-à-vis the specification is to undertake a proper and thorough claim interpretation which did not happen here and is for reasons the Federal Circuit has not explained not required for a 101 inquiry. A complete and thorough claim interpretation is however required for analysis of claims under 35 U.S.C. 102 103 and 112 because those sections relate to invalidity.

In Yu the district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss—a motion that is supposed to have all inferences drawn in favor of the non-moving party (i.e. the patent owner). And still the Federal Circuit stretched to find that while the specification does explain the invention is unique compared to the prior art the scope of claim 1 is too broad and therefore patent ineligible? Simply stated this is not a proper 101 analysis period.

If we must live under the fiction foisted upon us by the Supreme Court that their patent eligibility jurisprudence is perfectly consistent and specifically that Diamond v. Diehr has not been overruled then that has to mean the Federal Circuit does not have the authority to ignore the explicit teachings from Diehr. And Diehr is extremely clear — you cannot collapse the patentability inquiry into a single question under 101 period. In Diehr then Associate Justice Rehnquist wrote that the other sections of the statute must be allowed to do their work which makes perfect sense otherwise those sections become superfluous which violates basic canons of statutory construction.

‘We’re All Mad Here’

Can’t we all at least agree that when a claimed invention is concrete and tangible enough to when thrown at your head leave a scar upon impact it cannot possibly be abstract? Apparently not because we are told by the Federal Circuit that no amount of tangibility allows a claimed invention to escape the clutches of an abstract idea designation! And they say that with a straight face as if we are supposed to believe it simply because it has been spoken by those wearing black robes. Madness.

Whatever the Supreme Court’s patent eligibility jurisprudence is or means at this point determining breadth of a claim pursuant to 101 without a proper claim construction is wrong. Making such a determination based on a specification the court itself recognizes as explaining that the invention is unique (i.e. not conventional not routine not well established) compared to the prior art shows the very reason for requiring a proper claim construction in the first place. Claims are to be interpreted in light of the specification not in spite of the specification.

It is a basic tenet of patent law that one cannot understand what a claim covers unless and until the claims the specification and the prosecution history are all reviewed. A complete claim interpretation can even include expert testimony to explain what someone of skill in the field would understand since the relevant question isn’t whether a judge on the Federal Circuit understands or thinks the scope is too broad but whether the specification explains the claimed invention to the relevant technical audience.

Perhaps at the end of the day these claims should be found invalid having been improvidently granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. But there is no way Judges Prost and Taranto can know that now based on the obvious cursory review they have given this case the lack of any claim construction and the confusion of 101 and 112. It is long past time to stop with the shortcuts and start treating examined and issued patents with the presumption of validity they deserve.

This allows Apple Card users to add a co-owner and authorized users with Apple’s Family Sharing platform including support for Daily Cash rewards. Since Apple Card Family launched last month however it appears many users are unable to access Apple Card rewards among other quirks.

A number of users have taken to Reddit threads to report this issue. It appears that new co-owners for Apple Card are not receiving Daily Cash rewards for their purchases. Daily Cash should be deposited to each Apple Card user’s Apple Cash balance everyday once transactions are finalized.

One user on Reddit says:

Hello I was recently added as a Co-Owner and am not receiving daily cash for my purchases. Anyone else having the same issue? My Apple Cash card is set up as I have been using it for years. Thanks!

Furthermore affected users are apparently unable to pay their Apple Card balance using their Apple Cash balance. Instead they have to use a bank account. Other quirks include co-owners and authorized users not receiving notifications for purchases and discrepancies around credit limits.

Affected users have reportedly repeatedly reached out to Apple and Goldman Sachs about this issue but without a resolution. Instead the companies simply say that they are aware of the problem and that engineering teams are working on a fix. One user on Reddit has a workaround:

There’s a small workaround if you need the Daily Cash on short notice: go to https://card.apple.com and after you login go to Settings. You’ll see your Daily Cash has accrued there instead and you can apply it to your Apple Card balance. It seems to be a backend issue probably something to do with the Apple Cash card not properly linking to the Apple Card. Best thing to do for now is to call Apple Support ask for an Apple Pay Senior Advisor and have them file a case with engineering. After that contact Goldman Sachs and have them open a case as well.

Wrap up

Apple Card launched without any sort of family sharing or co-owner support. This changed with last month’s release of iOS 14.6 which allows Apple Card owners to share their card with up to five different people in their Family Sharing group. Those over the age of 18 can also be added as a co-owner to the card.

Coming in July Apple Card is also adding support for merging two individual accounts into one co-owned account. This feature however is not yet live and it’s clear Apple still has some quirks to work out in the features that are currently available.

Apple is currently beta testing iOS 14.7 so it’s possible that a fix will be included when that update is released to the public. In the meantime let us know if you’re experiencing issues with Apple Card Family Sharing down in the comments below.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvanVuLzIwL2dvb2dsZS1zdG9yZS1tYWtlcy1ueWMtZGVidXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google store makes NYC debut | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"Google has opened its first retail store in New York City highlighting the internet giant's effort to promote its consumer hardware devices.

The store in Manhattan's trendy Chelsea neighborhood opened last week the Mountain View Calif.-based company said in a blog post. The shop which is a block away from rival Apple Inc.'s 14th Street store occupies part of the first floor of Google's New York offices.

Google began experimenting with pop-up stores in 2016 the same year it debuted its Pixel smartphone and Nest smart home speaker. In the years since the company has introduced a plethora of hardware devices and hosted subsequent pop-ups to learn more about what consumers expect from a retail store said Jason Rosenthal Google's vice president of direct channels and membership.

""It's like walking into a dream"" Ivy Ross vice president of design user experience and research for design and services said during a virtual tour. ""I hope customers feel the same way. I want them to be happy and inspired like I am being in here.""

Ross oversaw the planning for the store.

The store was designed like a social space with sitting areas tables and other furniture that invites a level of public intimacy and intermingling that has been a rare experience during the covid-19 pandemic. The company said it will limit the number of people who can be in the store at once and that associates as well as customers will have to wear masks inside.

The furniture including sofas and oval-shaped tables is made of blond wood and cork -- neutral colors so the products would stand out Ross said. The company also wanted customers to see what Google's products would look like ""in context"" so in the store speakers may be placed next to piles of books and other design knick-knacks to give it more a feel of being in someone's home. Phones tablets and other devices are operational and untethered so visitors can fiddle around with them.

Ross said there's a children's room to ""park your children while shopping."" There's also a space where people can use the Pixel phone's Night Sight feature to take images in the dark and email the photos to themselves. There's a room where three people can play video games through Google's Stadia streaming service. And there's the Imagination Space -- partially enclosed by a 17-foot-tall glass round structure with screens inside.

When you walk by it’s not a Quantum Leap to another timeline or slide to an alternative future but it looks like it at first glance.

What is Yext?

Yext –

Yext is a New York City technology company operating in the area of online brand management. It offers brand updates using its cloud-based network of apps search engines and other facilities. The company was founded in 2006 by Howard Lerman Brian Distelburger and Brent Metz. Recent figures showed a market capitalization in 2019 of more than $2.0 billion and a revenue of $354.7 million for the 2021 fiscal year.

For folks who are familiar with NeXT (or if you are not) –

NeXT Inc. (later NeXT Computer Inc. and NeXT Software Inc.) was an American computer and software company founded in 1985 by Apple Computer co-founder Steve Jobs. Based in Redwood City California the company developed and manufactured a series of computer workstations intended for the higher education and business markets. NeXT was founded by Jobs after he was forced out of Apple along with several co-workers. NeXT introduced the first NeXT Computer in 1988 and the smaller NeXTstation in 1990. The NeXT computers experienced relatively limited sales with estimates of about 50000 units shipped in total. Nevertheless their innovative object-oriented NeXTSTEP operating system and development environment (Interface Builder) were highly influential.

NeXT’s logo was designed by Paul Rand –

In 1986 Steve Jobs paid renowned graphic designer Paul Rand $100000 to create a visual identity for his computer company. Rand developed a unique 100-page proposal book for the NeXT logo that walked the reader step-by-step through the conceptual process to the final outcome.

Here is the NeXT logo side by side with Yext. It’s the e and the XT that really hits ya.

I like to imagine NeXT continued on in another timeline and they’re making NeXT_pHONES and NeXT-paDs … but that’s not what happened anyway – someone else also noticed this logo similarity a year ago when you search for #yext on Instagram.

(NYSE:AJG) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions as insider selling can have various explanations. However shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.

Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.

The Corporate VP & Chief Human Resource Officer Susan Pietrucha made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.2m worth of shares at a price of US$212 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$206. We generally don't like to see insider selling but the lower the sale price the more it concerns us. In this case the big sale took place at around the current price so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).

Alors que le journaliste a quitté la chaîne pour rejoindre LCI c'est quelques mois plus tard que le quotidien suisse Le Temps publiait une enquête contenant plusieurs témoignages de personnes assurant avoir été harcelées sexuellement par Darius Rochebin. Après avoir contesté fermement s'être livré à des actes pénalement répréhensibles le journaliste avait déposé plainte contre le quotidien pour diffamation en décembre 2020. Alors que la SSR a livré dans son rapport d'enquête qu'"" aucun des témoignages recueillis ne permet de conclure à des actes relevant de harcèlement sexuel ou psychologique d'atteinte à la personnalité ou d'une quelconque infraction pénale "" c'est dans un entretien accordé au Journal du Dimanche que Darius Rochebin a accepté de se confier pour la première fois.

Évoquant la façon dont il a vécu cette affaire le journaliste a confié : ""J'ai simplement attendu les conclusions de l'enquête indépendante menée en Suisse. Elle a confirmé tout ce que je disais depuis le début. Pour moi cet épisode est refermé. Et je suis très content de pouvoir retravailler pleinement."" Alors que certaines personnes estiment qu'il aurait pu parler avant Darius Rochebin a expliqué : ""J'attendais sereinement l'issue de l'enquête. Je salue d'ailleurs la qualité la rigueur de ce travail mené en Suisse. Je n'ai pas voulu ni à l'époque ni maintenant ajouter des commentaires. S'en tenir aux faits est la meilleure des réponses."" Alors que Le Temps a maintenu ses accusations il a ajouté : ""Une procédure en diffamation contre Le Temps suit son cours. Mais sur le fond l'enquête indépendante est catégorique. Je n'ai d'ailleurs jamais fait l'objet de la moindre plainte pénale ou administrative.""

Darius Rochebin est persuadé que cette histoire n'a pas terni son image

Si le journaliste faisait l'objet d'accusations graves il a assuré dans les colonnes du Journal du Dimanche qu'il avait toujours de bons rapports avec le groupe TF1. ""J'ai échangé dans un très bon esprit avec toute la maison. J'ai été très frappé de la solidité du groupe TF1 qui comme moi a attendu patiemment la conclusion de l'enquête"" a-t-il révélé.

Sacré au Mondial-2018 comme remplaçant le ""Général"" Presnel Kimpembe a débuté l’Euro fort d’un statut de cadre de l’intraitable défense des Bleus avec un jeu ""plus simple"" et plus rassurant pour le sélectionneur qui a trouvé un successeur à Samuel Umtiti.

Après le succès initial mardi contre l’Allemagne (1-0) Didier Deschamps a relié la solidité de son arrière-garde au fait que ses quatre piliers étaient ""les mêmes"" qu’en Russie il y a trois ans. Avant de se reprendre : ""J’ai dit une petite erreur en disant que Kim était là pour la Coupe du monde c’était Sam.""

Anecdotique cet épisode n’en révèle pas moins à quel point le Parisien de 25 ans s’est imposé dans l’esprit du sélectionneur ces derniers mois. À Munich il a ainsi enchaîné un quatrième match d’affilée comme titulaire. En équipe de France comme en club Kimpembe n’a pourtant pas toujours rimé avec sérénité. Mais le ""Titi"" du PSG a su apprendre de ses erreurs et encaisser les critiques même lorsqu’elles venaient de haut. En octobre 2018 Deschamps l’avait par exemple sermonné publiquement pour avoir tardé à dégager un ballon relativement anodin sur lequel s’étaient jetés les Islandais pour marquer (2-2) en amical à Guingamp.

""Jouer plus simple""

""J’ai beaucoup échangé avec le coach ici qui m’a dit de jouer plus simple de prendre mon profil de vrai défenseur"" rappelait-il récemment en conférence de presse assurant avoir progressé dans ""la concentration et la maturité"" grâce notamment aux joutes disputées en Ligue des champions.

Mardi malgré les assauts parfois brutaux de la Mannschaft ""Presko"" a tenu la baraque.

L’Équipe l’a trouvé ""très concentré intense dans le duel lucide sur les moments où il devait sortir"" et auteur de multiples dégagements ""par un placement très juste"". ""À part une relance ratée heureusement sauvée par Kanté et une action où il oublie Gnabry il n’a pas raté son deuxième match dans un grand tournoi"" a écrit Le Parisien.

Le premier c’était celui des ""coiffeurs"" (surnom des remplaçants) terminé sur un fade 0-0 contre le Danemark en conclusion du premier tour de la Coupe du monde russe. Le reste du tournoi il l’a passé sur le banc à regarder Umtiti régaler les Bleus. ""Même si comme tout le monde j’aurais aimé faire davantage ça m’a appris à grandir ça a forgé encore plus le mental que j’ai déjà"" a-t-il raconté durant la préparation à l’Euro.

Chez les Bleus le défenseur central aux 18 sélections (dont 14 comme titulaire) n’est plus seulement l’ambianceur en chef à l’humeur toujours égale qui a séduit ses partenaires en dehors du terrain. Sur le rectangle vert il fait maintenant partie des meubles.

""Avec Presnel on a des qualités complémentaires on parle beaucoup avant le match à la mi-temps sur le terrain pour savoir qui est en couverture au marquage. Plus on joue ensemble plus on a d’automatismes… On se motive l’un l’autre"" a décrit mercredi Raphaël Varane son binôme de la défense centrale.

Sur sa gauche ""Presko"" peut également compter sur une relation de confiance avec Lucas Hernandez commencée chez les Espoirs en 2016. ""Presnel c’est un très grand joueur je le connais depuis longtemps"" a expliqué jeudi le latéral du Bayern Munich. ""Sur le terrain il m’aide beaucoup il me donne des conseils sur quand je dois sortir ou rester.

He’s not planning to give that up for the 2026 World Cup.

When the stadium is handed over to FIFA for the tournament co-hosted by Mexico Canada and the United States Ruano expects the world soccer body to respect a deal dating from the stadium’s construction six decades ago that gave box owners unlimited access to their seats for 99 years.

“We’ve already paid for the right to be there when we purchased the title and there can be no restrictions for us” says Ruano 61 the spokesman of an association of 134 box owners. “We have a title to support us. It’s not up for debate.”

It’s unclear whether the stadium owner and FIFA see it that way.

FIFA wants full control of the World Cup stadiums 30 days before the first match and seven days after the last. But the peculiar history of how the boxes were purchased at Azteca makes things complicated.

To help finance the construction of the stadium in the 1960s Mexican businessman Emilio Azcárraga Milmo sold boxes to private investors for 115000 pesos or about $9000 at the time giving the owners rights to use them for 99 years. That included access to soccer matches concerts and other events including the 1970 and 1986 World Cups in Mexico Ruano says.

“There were no issues in 1970. For the 1986 World Cup they wanted us out and we met with FIFA officials and they allowed us to use our place without extra pay so there’s a precedent for it” he adds.

The Azteca boxes are a top commodity in Mexico City. The current asking price for a 20-square-meter (65-square-foot) box ranges from 15 million to 25 million pesos ($900000 to $1.5 million). Some owners rent them out for specific events.

The 83000-seat stadium will host five games during the 2026 World Cup including the opening match.

Ruano whose father bought the title for the box said he was hopeful the box issue would be resolved after talks with stadium officials last week though no concrete proposal was on the table yet.

Emilio Azcarraga Jean the owner of the stadium through multimedia company Televisa and the son of Emilio Azcárraga Milmo says he expected an agreement soon.

“For my father at the time it was very important to sell the boxes to finish the construction and so far there has not been a previous issue with the box owners. We will try to find a solution” Azcarraga Jean told W Radio which is owned by Televisa.

Asked for comment FIFA says it is collaborating with all 16 host cities of the 2026 World Cup including on remodeling plans for Azteca Stadium which is set to go down in soccer history as the first venue to host games in three World Cups.

“Specific details on fan access and other match information will be announced in due course” FIFA says.

The details of the Azteca remodeling plans are unclear but Ruano says some box owners outside of his association have agreed to release their seats for the 2026 tournament in exchange for upgrades of their boxes and other benefits.

“Every owner has the right to see what’s best for them” he says. “But that’s not my case I have the right to be there and nobody can force me out. It would be like someone forcing me out of my own home.”

A sterile corner office overlooking Arkansas' Bud Walton Arena is for now a muted tribute to what is about to take place.

""They've got this a little bit like a dentist's office so I apologize"" John Calipari says stepping out from behind an empty desk.

Things will soon be cluttered complicated and all-consuming for the Hogs' new basketball coach — just not today. Coach Cal has his first new job in 15 years. He must meet people reveal the personality that comes up on you like a three-quarter court press. Not all of those people are the much-scrutinized recruits who are populating that empty roster Calipari referred to in his introductory press conference.

Some of them are holy.

""We sleep pig and wake pig"" said Father Jason Sharbaugh who has already spotted Cal on campus at mass. ""It's all the more sweet having Coach in.""

Some of them are tolerated. For now the hall-of-fame coach is sharing a temporary condo with his son Brad near the center of the campus entertainment district Dickson Street.

""They said to me 'It may get a little loud. It's down by the strip' Calipari explained. ""I was there Monday Tuesday Wednesday. No problem. Friday? One place has live music the other has karaoke the other has a DJ.

""The whole room is like shaking from [the noise]. I'm sleeping with ear plugs.""

Some — well one — is a billionaire.

""One of the things Coach Cal does is he out-cares any coach in America"" said John Tyson chairman of Tyson Foods close friend and driving force behind Calipari taking the job. ""If you do it the right way the derivative of that is you might win the national championship.""

That's really what this is all about isn't it? Not just the possibility of a natty the actual documented proof of concept. Calipari has won one among his 855 career victories. His bona fides also include six Final Fours 12 Elite Eights and 15 Sweet 16s.

None of them lately of course but at age 65 Arkansas has become the next podium from which Cal can preach. Yes Calipari has reached retirement age but looks 55 and has more left in the tank than an Escalade. Never one to leave flair on the bench the coach's departure from Kentucky was as shocking as his arrival here was spectacular.

It was both the suddenness — and the destination — that astounded. Arkansas? Hogs everywhere love their hoops.

""I grew up on that action"" said Sharbaugh pastor of University of Arkansas Newman Center Parish. ""I just love the game. Next to Jesus it's the hottest thing in the universe.""

But it's also fair to point out Arkansas' place in the sporting universe. The Razorbacks last won 11 football games in 2011. A few months later coach Bobby Petrino crashed his motorcycle with a woman on board from the staff who was not his wife. Scandal ensued.

Nolan Richardson won Arkansas' last and only basketball championship in 1994. Eric Musselman contributed two Elite Eights in five seasons before leaving last month for … USC.

""You could see that coach Musselman had a desire — if maybe the right job opened up on the West Coast — to go home"" Tyson said.

It's additionally fair then to assert this is the biggest hire in the school's athletic history. Arkansas coaches have come from Kentucky (John Pelphrey played for the Wildcats) and gone to Kentucky (Eddie Sutton) but there has been nothing like this.

The likes of Frank Broyles Sutton and Richardson pretty much made their bones here. Lou Holtz won a conference title but bolted to Minnesota before finding the crest of his career at Notre Dame.

Legends all of them but Calipari comes prepackaged — oozing championship pedigree. He's got the blueprint stored in the synapses somewhere underneath that perfectly quaffed 'do. Just step aside and let him show you. It's expected actually.

""I made the analogy this like you have a worldwide company and it's in New York … and you're being encouraged by another area"" Calipari told CBS Sports. ""So you move the headquarters.""

From CBS Sports' Matt Norlander to Jay Bilas virtually all the game's tastemakers hailed Calipari's move as a multi-level win — for Cal for Arkansas for Kentucky — for college basketball.

All of them got a reset. Of course Cal's move can't be recounted without a reminder that a sizable amount of Big Blue Nation wanted him gone. To that well Calipari can't wait to respond.

""I think some people were happy"" the coach said of his departure from Kentucky. ""[Some were saying] 'We've had this guy 15 years and we've only won 500 games.' [Actually 410] We only won one national title and four Final Fours and eight Elite Eights? What the hell is going on here?'""

The sarcasm might as well be dripping from the ceiling. Calipari then launched into slice-of-life memories from going back to Lexington Kentucky for a day before his exit. Folks were yelling ""We love you."" A couple pulled their car over to wish him well. At Panera ""one of the ladies came from the back in tears to hug me"" Cal said.

And now he is theirs again only here.

""I'm a poor miserable sinner"" Calipari said. ""Please That's who I am. I hope I have a good heart for kids and their families. I'm not a magician and I don't have a magic wand.""

If not he's got rights to the best set of card tricks ever seen.

Regardless Arkansas has proved it is all in. There is already talk of a monster NIL war chest. As of Tuesday the once-depleted Arkansas roster now includes seven scholarship players. Two Kentucky players have transferred to Arkansas — Adou Thiero and Zvonimor Ivišić. FAU transfer Johnell Davis one of the best talents in the portal led the Owls to the 2023 Final Four. Tennessee transfer Jonas Aidoo averaged 11 and 7 for the Vols. 247Sports currently has Calipari's first Arkansas class No. 6 nationally third in the SEC.

Think of what is at stake not only Arkansas' basketball future but Kentucky's basketball brand. What if the Hogs edge past the Wildcats on the national scene at some point with Calipari?

The transition has been swift and impressive. It was made clear by Cal there will be competition at Arkansas for a tight rotation. The Division I maximum is 13 scholarships per team. Who actually plays is another thing.

""I enjoyed coaching last year. I had a ball but that was hard"" Calipari said. ""Then Reed Sheppard decides to become [SEC] Freshman of the Year. I asked him after the season 'How much did you expect to play?' He said 'Ah I thought I'd be carrying water.' Did you expect to leave here after the season? He said 'Coach I expected to be here all four years.' ""

That's a roundabout way of Cal saying he still has it. Sheppard left for the NBA after a year and is projected as a top-10 NBA Draft pick.

""My thought was 'We're going to get this' and we had a good group coming in … "" Calipari continued. ""It wasn't like we were 15-15. But there's an expectation where it's only winning championships and winning that 'ship.

Arkansas fans couldnt wait to meet new basketball coach John Calipari. Getty Images

The Calipari rollout came on a recent rainy Wednesday night at Bud Walton. Calipari looked out of place at his introductory press conference. Watching him wear red Arkansas gear was like watching Derek Jeter in a Padres uniform instead of pinstripes. Some things just need getting used to. This was life-changing in a basketball sense. Ted Owens the 94-year-old former Kansas coach who gave Calipari his first job signaled that by making the trip over from Tulsa Oklahoma.

The only thing missing was Cal's first public calling of the hogs. That's coming too and will be a major event in these parts.

""It gave [fans] a chance to really thump their chests and say 'Hey we got a blue blood's head coach to come to our university and coach our men's basketball team'"" Arkansas AD Hunter Yurachek said.

An athletic department whose budget was 10th among 14 SEC teams last year has a modern superstar on the bench. A state of only 3 million people is hungry to rally around a gregarious legend from Moon Township Pennsylvania who was once fired by the New Jersey Nets.

""I'm not going to try to get spiritual"" Calipari said. Then of course he did.

""Something nudges you and you don't know what it is"" the coach continued. ""But I've been there [at Kentucky] 15 years. Maybe it's 'You've done what I needed you to do there for the kids for the state. Now I need you to do something down there [at Arkansas].' ""

The earth-bound driving force behind the hire certainly doesn't want to be considered the driving force behind the hire. Tyson 70 is certainly the basketball patriarch of this endeavor. Yes he is the money man of many things in Arkansas. This one happens to be personal.

This is Tyson's second run at Calipari. While Calipari was at Memphis in 2007 Tyson and Broyles reached out. Calipari couldn't make himself leave his players — especially Derrick Rose — back then. Memphis then played for a national championship in 2008.

""I think we were close [to getting him] but that's when Cal said 'I'm committed to my kids' Tyson said. ""Back then kids couldn't move. Nowadays kids can move.""

Which kind of explains the game the climate and the reason for the move.

Neither Calipari nor Tyson can remember the circumstances of their first meeting two decades ago. They bonded over talk of leadership. Tyson oversees a global food company headquartered in Springdale Arkansas that is second nationally in the processing of chicken beef and pork. He reminisces lovingly about his late father Don who admired Harry Truman so much his office is built in an oval shape for two reasons.

That imitates both Truman's Oval Office and the shape of eggs laid by chickens that are so important to the company.

Calipari specializes in shaping 18-year-olds into champions for the one of the biggest brands in college basketball. His players have signed NBA contracts worth more than $4 billion.

That should be relatable to any CEO — or recruit. When Kentucky came to town Calipari would go out of his way to have Tyson at his courtside seat. Never mind Tyson being a huge Arkansas benefactor.

""He's my friend first"" he said of Calipari.

They call each other youthful nicknames of endearment — Johnny. That's why when Tyson said it's fair to say things had gotten stale between the two parties at Kentucky it means something.

""I talk to my folks around here. There are cycles"" Tyson said. 'Don't tell me you're going to retire at 65. There are business cycles. When we get to the end of the cycle do you want to sign up for another cycle?' ""

You don't have to be dunked on to get the connection. Cal has signed up for another cycle at Arkansas. And stale has different definitions. Calipari once consulted former Kentucky coach Joe B. Hall who lasted 13 years in the Big Blue maelstrom.

""I stayed three years too many"" Calipari quoted Hall as telling him.

Cal stayed at Kentucky two years beyond that. At the end of last season Tyson estimated there were three options for his friend – stay with the Wildcats chase a championship elsewhere or go do TV.

""But he's a competitor"" Tyson said.

""Last year revived me. I had so much fun with those kids and they celebrated each other"" Calipari said. ""The way it ended … I'll just say sucks.""

The first-round loss to Oakland marked the third straight year UK finished short of the Sweet 16. The last time that happened was 2006-2008 under Tubby Smith and Billy Gillespie.

The Arkansas' hiring process took less than three days. On April 4 Yurachek was in Phoenix for the Final Four. About 1 pm PT Musselman informed the AD he was taking the USC job.

Tyson first called his coaching friend to ask if he'd speak to Yurachek about vetting candidates. Yurachek called Calipari that night.

At some point Yurachek cut to the chase and asked Calipari if he was interested.

""In my judgment as a businessman either you go big [or not]"" Tyson said. ""When we were talking big I threw out three names. I said 'Do you call Bill Self? Do you call Danny Hurley or do you call Coach Cal?

'Or do you [hire] Chris Beard Jerome Tang. In the business world you call that a lateral move. You go get somebody who knows how to do the business. You're probably going to have to pay them a little more.""

It wasn't until Yurachek and Calipari talked that they found out they were in the same city for unrelated reasons. Cal was in Phoenix for an NABC meeting. (He is the current president of the coaches' organization.) Yurachek was also there for a meeting as a member of the College Football Playoff selection committee.

Calipari said any face-to-face meeting would have to happen quickly.

Tyson then told Yurachek he'd better have a plan. That is aligning the support and resources of the university to make such a hire. In other words John Calipari doesn't have to interview for the job. He just has to want it.

""Swing big … who would you hire?"" Tyson emphasized. ""Coach Cal of course.""

The two sides connected. Calipari vetted Yurachek with Houston coach Kelvin Sampson who had worked under Yurachek the former Cougars' AD.

Cal didn't want the news to leak that he had been talking to Arkansas stealing the spotlight from the Final Four. Then of course it leaked.

""I'm not mad about it"" Calipari said ""but it wasn't me and then it was like an avalanche.""

Speculation and anticipation ran wild. By that Saturday night an oral agreement was close. Only a tight circle knew – Yurachek Calipari Cal's lawyer Tom Mars and an Arkansas board member. That in itself was unique. Yurachek had once been named in a lawsuit filed by Mars who was representing former football coach Bret Bielema against the Arkansas Razorback Foundation.

""Hunter was a real pro. He was hands-on. I guess he forgave me for all the horrible things I said about him in the Bielema lawsuit"" Mars joked.

Attorney Matt McCoy who oversees athletic department legal affairs was looped in.

""We just kept at it and got the contract finished Monday night"" said a source involved in the talks. ""A land-speed record.""

It helped that Cal didn't have an agent a rarity for someone of his stature. An agent would have taken approximately $1.225 million of the $35 million Calipari is earning over those five years in fees. An agent would have possibly extended the negotiations by weeks.

Arkansas was indeed all in. The basketball world — no American sports — gasped. Dickson Street had a new inhabitant.

In the middle of the interview in that sterile office a familiar face ducked in the doorway.

""You good?"" he said.

It was not some assistant doing a preplanned drop by to make sure the interview didn't run too long. This was Brad Calipari that 27-year-old coaches' son and roommate who has moved over from the staff at Vanderbilt.

John Calipari indeed was good. For now.

""His mom is telling him to check on me every 30 minutes to see if I'm still alive"" the coach said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbGlzaC5jb20vZm9vZC1uZXdzL2E2MDc0NDU5NS90cmF2aXMta2VsY2UtY2xhaW1zLWFsd2F5cy1kcnVuay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travis Kelce Is Clapping Back At Claims He's 'Always Drunk',"Earlier this week country singer and actor Jana Kramer took to her podcast to well slander Travis Kelce's name. The iHeart Radio host dissed the Kansas City Chiefs tight end for his drinking habits and claimed he's ""always drunk."" Now Kelce is hitting back via multiple insiders.

""He was taken aback as he’s never met her and is just living his life"" the source told Page Six while ""emphatically"" denying any suggestion the athlete has a drinking problem. ""That guy is under a microscope basically being watched everywhere he goes. Of course you're going to see him drinking"" the source said.

Kramer even took aim at Kelce's influence on his girlfriend Taylor Swift arguing that he has encouraged the singer's consumption habits.

""I see her drinking more now. Like the company you keep"" Kramer alleged while also calling Kelce out for his ""aggression"" with coach Andy Reid during the Super Bowl. It ""rubbed [her] the wrong way.""

The same insider went on to argue that if Kelce did have a drinking problem it would be impossible to hide given his status and constant

""It’s not like he’s passed out somewhere. If he was passed out somewhere I would totally understand but that’s not the case whatsoever"" the source adds while noting that he's just a ""normal human being"" who is ""doing the same thing"" as everyone else...only ""in the public eye.""

The three-time Super Bowl champ is reportedly ""in training right now"" to prepare for another season with the Chiefs. ""If he was drunk it would be a bigger problem"" the source said.

This isn't the first time Kelce has come under fire for drinking. During his honorary graduation ceremony for his ""New Heights"" podcast Travis accepted the diploma he never picked up in the first place before chugging a beer in celebration. However big brother Jason was quick to his defense.

""I know it looks like a graduation from the video but this was actually at the end of a New Heights Live podcast that we put on to raise money for the University’s NIL"" the older Kelce said according to People Magazine. ""The university did this to poke fun at my brother and I for never really picking up our diplomas.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYmEtcGxheWVycy13aXRoLWF0LWxlYXN0LTMtbXZwc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NBA players to win at least 3 MVP awards,"Beginning in the 1955-56 season with Bob Pettit of the St. Louis Hawks the NBA has doled out a Most Valuable Player award.

From Wednesday May 15 through Friday May 17 there will be one lane of northbound Red Arrow Highway open to traffic and southbound Red Arrow Highway will be detoured on westbound I-94 to John Beers Road Exit 22 then back to Red Arrow Highway.

On Saturday May 18 both northbound and southbound Red Arrow Highway will reopen to traffic; however the Red Arrow Highway ramp to westbound I-94 will be closed for rebuilding.

This work is part of MDOT’s three-year $204 million project to rebuild 8.5 miles of I-94 and four bridges as well as repair nine other bridges between Puetz Road and Britain Avenue in Berrien County. All work is weather dependent.

Based on economic modeling this investment is expected to directly and indirectly support 2468 jobs.

Funding for this project is made possible by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's Rebuilding Michigan program to rebuild the state highways and bridges that are critical to the state's economy and carry the most traffic. The investment strategy is aimed at fixes that result in longer useful lives and improve the condition of the state's infrastructure."

Do I really need to yell at my lightbulbs? Will automating my toaster make life better? We’re here to answer those burning questions and help you figure out whether home automation is a good fit for your household.

Before we dive in we should point out that while it may seem very futuristic smart home tech is here now and will soon be standard in most every electrical household item you buy. Connecting appliances thermostats kettles TVs and lighting to each other and the internet provides an extra layer of convenience to you today but tomorrow this Internet of Things will allow our homes to learn our patterns and respond to our needs without us lifting a finger.

The key will be the data each device collects which a controller in our home can analyse and respond to that will transform an automated home from a mere collection of remote-controlled gadgets and gizmos into a truly “smart” home. One that makes your everyday life easier helps reduce your home’s use of precious resources such as energy and water and connects it with the larger Internet of Things to enable truly exciting advancements for our world.

What is a smart home?

A smart home is one outfitted with wirelessly connected gadgets that can do things for you that make you think “Oh gosh well isn’t that smart?” From simple actions like lights turning on when you enter a room to more impressive ones such as your house shutting itself down at night – locking the doors closing the curtains turning down the thermostat and switching off all the lights.

Largely this is still all home automation where you need to tell the home to do these things through a pre-set trigger there’s not a lot of advanced artificial intelligence in play – although it’s coming. The 'smart' in smart home actually stands for Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology which means a smart home is a step beyond simple automation.

Each connected device can monitor itself and report back to a central hub or control platform which can then act appropriately. Think of it like a basic alarm system – when a door sensor is triggered it tells the alarm to make a noise – only it can do so much more.

There are several home automation platforms you can use to make your home smart and each one uses programming – known variously as Routines Automations and Scenes – to help link your devices together into a smart home.

These programs can be triggered by a number of things: a voice command – “Turn on the lights”; your location – unlock the door turn on the lights open the garage door and adjust the thermostat when I drive into the driveway; and time of day – turn down the heat close the curtains dim the lights and lock the door at 7pm every evening.

What can I automate in my home?

Smart lighting

The easiest and most impactful place to start automating your home is with smart lighting. Lighting you control with your voice on a schedule or based on a door opening or closing is convenient can save energy and looks really cool. Smart lighting also brings tons of features to your home’s lighting scheme without having to hire an electrician.

A smart bulb can be dimmed have tuneable white light (go from cool white to warm white depending on whether you want to be energised or relax) and even throw in colour-changing options to really amp up the ambiance. Smart switches are another simple way to connect a whole room of existing lights bringing dimming and scheduling features as well as voice and remote control. Finally you can throw in a few smart plugs so that lovely lamp Aunt Iris gave you for Christmas in 1989 can enter the 21st Century unscathed.

Smart locks

A smart lock will transform the way you get into and out of your home as well as making it much easier and more secure to let in visitors or service people like dog walkers or cleaners. You can ditch your keys – no more hiding it under the flowerpot – and instead use your phone your fingerprint or a code to get into your house.

You can also give this type of electronic access to others and revoke it when you no longer want them to visit (much less expensive than changing the locks). Smart locks can also connect with other devices in your home such as lighting and heating turning everything off when you leave and lock up and then back on when you unlock the door and return home.

Smart heating

Intelligent control of your heating can save energy without the need for extra blankets. A smart thermostat knows when you're home or away (by using presence sensors geolocation of your and your family’s smartphones and/or triggers from other devices such as your door lock) and can adjust by a few degrees to save energy automatically.

As well a connected thermostat can communicate with other things in your home like door and window sensors smart blinds and local weather stations to know when to turn down the heat because there’s a window open because the Sun is warming a room or because the thermometer is going to hit 22°C this afternoon.

Smart Security

While most of us don’t already have our home’s kitted out with CCTV cameras the smart home makes it much easier to keep eyes on things if you want thanks to inexpensive wireless Wi-Fi cameras.

These easy-to-install and simple-to-use devices can be put inside or outside your home to alert you to any problems through motion-activated recording and let you see a live or recorded video of your home on your smartphone.

Many can be set to only wake up and record if they spot a person animal vehicle or package or can tell you about all and any activity in its view. They can be programmed to automatically turn off when you come home or during the day so you don’t inadvertently record yourself.

This type of surveillance is handy for security as a deterrent to burglars and as evidence if there is a break-in. But it also has many other uses such as keeping an eye on your pets when you’re at the office or checking in on older children or elderly relatives who are home alone. Our favourite type of security camera is a video doorbell this dual-purpose device acts like voicemail for your front door – as whoever visits can leave a video message when you’re out – and also helps keep tabs on the main entry point to your home.

Finally smart security cameras work brilliantly with smart security systems which you can again easily install yourself and monitor from your smartphone. Most also offer professional monitoring of your alarm system for a monthly fee and when tied into security cameras can allow for visual verification when your alarm is triggered potentially helping get the emergency services there more quickly.

Smart entertainment

Smart speakers and smart TVs are already pretty ubiquitous in our homes – in fact you literally cannot buy a 'dumb' TV anymore – and smart speakers from the likes of Amazon Google and now Apple are so insanely cheap and do so much cool stuff it’s hard to find a reason not to get one.

From playing any song you can think of on demand with just a few words to connecting to your smart TV so you can stop worrying about finding the remote and just tell your telly to put on EastEnders smart speakers – and the digital assistants that power them – are the fire that is fuelling the current smart home explosion.

With the artificial intelligence of Alexa Siri and Google in them your speaker can tell you the weather set a kitchen timer find you a recipe read you the news call a friend and – crucially – control any connected smart home devices with just a few words from you.

What are the benefits of a smart home?

The main benefits of putting all these connected gadgets in your home are convenience security and energy savings.

Convenience

By automating many everyday chores smart home devices can help your home run more smoothly. Robot vacuum cleaners can keep the floors clean an automated “Good Morning” routine can start your coffee maker turn your lights on set the radio playing to your favourite station even get your shower running for you as soon as your alarm goes off.

Security

Via your smart home’s connection to the internet you can always know what’s going on in your home even if you’re not there. A smart security camera lets you see a live feed from your living room or backyard on your smartphone. Smart sensors can send an alert to your phone if there’s motion in your house or when a door opens. A smart door lock can tell you who arrived home and when (handy for keeping track of latchkey kids – plus no need to worry about them losing the keys).

Energy savings

While the smart thermostat may have started the second coming of the smart home with its promise of slashing your energy use thanks to smart algorithms ultimately the smart home is all about efficiency.

Thanks to a connection to the internet you can manage all your energy-consuming devices easily from your smart phone. Put high-use appliances on schedules so they run only when energy is cheap manage each room in your home so it’s only bright and warm when in use and monitor how much energy your home is using with smart plugs so you can see where to cut costs.

How does a smart home work?

A smart home relies on wireless communication. This is what makes it simple enough to install smart devices (no need to run wires through your walls) and advanced enough to do smart things such as turn all your lights off and turn the thermostat down when it senses no one is home.

There are a few different wireless radio protocols used in the smart home. Z-Wave Zigbee Bluetooth Wi-Fi and the newer Thread protocol are the most common. Each facilitate communication both between your smart home devices and out to the internet more commonly called the Cloud.

While some smart home devices talk to each other locally using a hub with the relevant radios squeezed in many rely on the Cloud for processing commands and storing data such as video footage and send that data to the Cloud using Wi-Fi.

Almost all devices need an app for setup and control usually installed on a smart phone or tablet. The app is the main way you interact with the gadget and set things like schedules or connect it to your smart home ecosystem of choice so you can create Routines and Automations for all the smart things in your home.

How do I choose a smart home ecosystem?

While you can purchase a smart gadget like a robot vacuum or video doorbell and have it do its job all on its lonesome a smart home sings when it’s got more than one gadget in it. But – and this is a big but – it’s important that your gadgets are compatible with each other so you can set up those handy Routines awesome Automations and create other cool smart home interactions.

For this you need a smart home ecosystem – one place all your devices can connect to where they can be controlled programmed and put together into useful Routines.

Currently there are four mainstream smart home ecosystems: Apple’s HomeKit Amazon’s Alexa Google Home and Samsung’s SmartThings. These can be easily set up and installed by even the most tech-challenged individual although you can get professional installation for most devices.

If you already have a digital assistant in your home tied to one of these ecosystems then that’s a good place to start. Another thing to consider is what you want your smart home to do most. Are you keen on lighting? Really just want smart control of your heating? Look for the device you’ll need to do that find the ecosystem that supports it and build out from there.

The good news is that the majority of devices work with more than one ecosystem the hardware you need to control it (a hub or smart speaker) is relatively inexpensive and the apps are all free. This means you can chop and change pretty easily and (if you’re feeling adventurous) even use more than one ecosystem at a time (some are actually designed to work together). This is thankfully not a VHS versus Betamax scenario.

Here’s a quick run-down of some of the pros and cons of each smart home ecosystem.

Apple’s HomeKit

Pros

Apple’s HomeKit platform is the simplest most reliable smart home ecosystem. It’s also very secure and a good option for those concerned about privacy and the smart home as all data related to your home is processed locally and encrypted before being sent to the Cloud.

It works with all your Apple devices so you can control your home with your iPhone iPad Mac computer Apple Watch and use Siri for voice control.

HomeKit uses Bluetooth Wi-Fi and recently Thread for its wireless communications.

Cons

There are far fewer devices compatible with HomeKit than with the other ecosystems although the list is growing rapidly.

The Home app you use to control and set up HomeKit devices only works with an iPad or iPhone – you can’t use an Android device. You also need to buy an Apple hub to make the system work optimally such as Apple TV or HomePod Mini – making this the most expensive option (no surprise there).

Amazon’s Alexa

Pros

Amazon’s Alexa smart home system is based around its eponymous AI voice assistant. It is the broadest most compatible least expensive smart home ecosystem – more devices work with Alexa than with any of the others. Now that the flagship Echo speaker has a Zigbee radio in it alongside Wi-Fi and Bluetooth it can work with even more devices like motion sensors and light bulbs.

Alexa itself is built into a multitude of smart speakers starting as low as £25 as well as smart displays and even a smart thermostat and smart light switch. In short it’s everywhere making it really easy to set up a responsive voice-controlled smart home.

Cons

So many things “Work With Alexa” but not everything works well. It’s a very wide-open ecosystem that’s not tightly controlled so you need to do your research before buying any device to make sure it works how you want it too. Alexa is also not easily accessed on a smartphone unlike its two major competitors.

Google Home

Pros

Google Home is Google’s smart home ecosystem and the name of the app you use to control it on your smartphone. Google Assistant is its digital assistant that lives in almost as many speakers and smart displays as Alexa does (but not quite) to use for voice control of your devices.

Google Assistant can also live natively on your Android smartphone or smartwatch making it easy to summon its services wherever you are. The Google smart displays – Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max – also offer a touchscreen control panel for adjusting lights thermostats locks and speakers when you don’t want to use voice.

Cons

Google is still behind in the number of smart home devices that work with it (but catching up fast) and more crucially in how it can control your home. Currently you can only use voice commands the location of your phone or a schedule to automate your routines. It’s not possible to use sensors or other devices to trigger a routine as you can with all of the other ecosystems.

It also doesn’t have support for Zigbee or Z-Wave only Wi-Fi Bluetooth and Thread.

Samsung SmartThings

Pros

One of the original smart home hubs SmartThings works with the largest number of smart home devices including nearly all Samsung electronics and appliances (TVs washing machines fridges). It’s also the only ecosystem here that can control Z-Wave devices alongside Zigbee and Wi-Fi.

Z-Wave is a much lower-powered alternative to the other protocols which means devices can be smaller because they don’t need big batteries. Z-Wave like Zigbee doesn’t need to talk to the Cloud at all just to its hub so can be more reliable and faster to respond.

SmartThings also supports Samsung’s Bixby voice assistant however you can connect SmartThings to Alexa to combine the power of both ecosystems.

Cons

SmartThings is the most complicated system to use on our list and Z-Wave and Zigbee devices in particular can be tricky to 'pair' to it. But this is partly because it is the most powerful system here with the ability to do more complicated home automations.

How do I build my own smart home hub?

If you don’t like the idea of Big Tech nosing about in your home you can build your own smart home hub using a Raspberry Pi and some open-source software like openHAB or Home Assistant to control your gadgets.

It won’t be as smooth an experience as using some of the commercial options and is strictly for the type who likes to build their own computer. But if that’s you it’s a lot of fun you can build it to fit your needs and all your data stays with you.

How do I add voice control to my smart home?

Whichever system you choose (yes even the Raspberry Pi option) it can be controlled with your voice which is one of the main benefits of a smart home. When you hit the couch after dinner rather than having to get up and turn the lights off just say “Alexa lights off.” Feeling chilly in bed at night? No need to get frosty toes on the way to the thermostat just shout “Hey Siri turn the heat up.” Need some music to set the mood? A quick “Hey Google play my Focus Playlist from Spotify” and you’re away.

The best experience for voice control is with a smart speaker. Each voice assistant has its own selection of speakers – Alexa has the Echo Google has the Nest line and Apple the HomePods. As we’ve mentioned many of these speakers have radios for the various wireless protocols used in the smart home built-in so by adding a speaker to your smart home you’re not only getting voice control: you’re also adding capabilities to your setup.

You can also find the digital assistants in your smartphone tablet smart watches and in other smart speakers from companies like Bose and Sonos. Apple’s Siri is the only one that shows up in a computer (Mac only).

The key to using voice control in your smart home is to have a speaker in every room. Most are smart enough to know which room they’re in so when you walk in you can say lights on and it will just turn on the connected bulbs in that room.

How do I connect it all together?

Once you have your smart home devices in situ you’ll want to start setting up those Routines Automation and Scenes we’ve been talking about. How exactly you do this depends on which ecosystem you are in but overall they use similar solutions all set up in their respective apps.

First you choose your trigger – what will cause the automation to happen. This could be location (you arrive home) a time of day (either an exact hour or sunrise or sunset) or something happening (a door opening or a light being turned on).

Next you choose when it will happen – everyday just on weekends just when you are home or just when you are away. This is also known as a “condition” and in some ecosystems you can set multiple conditions – such as “when I am home and it’s a Wednesday and it’s raining and the alarm is set”.

Then you choose what will happen. It could be a camera turning on a door unlocking a thermostat adjusting or lights turning on – or all of the above at once. In some systems you can set up a Scene – a pre-set collection of actions – to be triggered. Scenes can also be turned on by pressing a button in an app or using a voice command – such as A Movie Scene that dims the light turns up the heat and starts Netflix on the TV.

Some good automations to start with are setting up a Goodbye Routine a Welcome Home Routine a Goodnight Routine and a Good Morning Routine each of which can be customised to your needs and based on what devices you have and which ecosystem you are using.

The beauty of the smart home is that it is designed to work for you to make your life easier more comfortable more secure and a little bit more fun.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9zdXBlcmlvci1wZXJzb24tbmFtZS1yZWNvZ25pdGlvbi13aXRoLXByZS1idWlsdC1nb29nbGUtYmVydC1lNjIxNTE4NmVhZTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Superior Person Name Recognition with Pre-Built Google BERT,"Superior Person Name Recognition with Pre-Built Google BERT

One of the first vendors to see near the corner of Union Avenue and S. Dunlap Street Jamerson 58 has made a no-frills ritual of grilling a past time begun when he was young and starting fires for his mom's smoker in North Memphis.

Under the company name ""Lick the Bone"" Jamerson lives in Cordova and can usually be found selling ""whatever people like"" — ribs chicken shoulder smoked sausages — along Germantown Parkway and will be at the Southern Heritage Classic in September.

As the smell of barbecue wafted from Jamerson's set-up so did tunes of his favorite musicians among them Sam Cooke and Bobby ""Blue"" Bland. It was Jamerson's first time grilling at a Juneteenth festival as it was the first time for Memphis' Juneteenth festival to take place in the Health Sciences Park. The Juneteenth Urban Music Festival has historically been held at Robert R. Church Park downtown and at Douglass Park before that.

Juneteenth in Memphis:Looking to celebrate Juneteenth in Memphis? Here's what the 901 has to offer

Memphis Juneteenth Festival:'This is a celebration' Memphis Juneteenth Festival kicks off weekend of comradery

Although the park's plaza area closest to Union Avenue was still gated during the two-day festivities the remains of Nathan Bedford Forrest and his wife were removed from the area earlier this month. The remains of the infamous Confederate general slave trader and early leader of the Ku Klux Klan will be reassembled in Columbia Tennessee at the National Confederate Museum at Elm Springs along with his statue removed from the park in late 2017.

Perhaps symbolic to some the timing of the exhumation just in time for Juneteenth was coincidental said Shelby County Commissioner Van Turner who also runs the Memphis Greenspace nonprofit that has had ownership of the park since the statue was removed.

""We wanted this process to be respectful to be something that healed divisions"" Turner said during a recent press conference describing a similarly ""full circle"" moment of having a Juneteenth celebration on the heels of the exhumation a celebration of emancipation at a park that once did not allow Black people and has recently symbolized Memphis' divisions.

Since the exhumation Juneteenth became a federal holiday commemorating June 19 1865 the date when enslaved people in Galveston Texas were officially told they had been freed by President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation two years earlier. The holiday gained more recognition during last summer's racial reckoning as thousands protested the deaths of George Floyd Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery and injustices Black Americans face.

Some are at odds with declaration of the federal holiday recognized at a time when many states including Tennessee have attempted to halt school discussions of the long-lasting effects of slavery and systemic racism through bans of critical race theory.

Federal holiday:Juneteenth is now a federal holiday. This year's celebrations come amid a culture war.

Connita Hill sells T-shirts under her business SistaStyle with the most popular ones showing African proverbs commemorating Black history like Tulsa's Black Wall Street and others with lighthearted funny sayings.

At the front of Hill's booth she framed a history of Juneteenth a detailed addition to the festival's outdoor museum with a timeline of events that walks through the beginning of slavery in America to the day's Juneteenth Festival. Though her shirt business is about a year old she's been making them for a while often making combination birthday-Juneteenth shirts for her oldest grandson who turned 15 this June 19.

She learned more about Juneteenth as an adult eager to share history with her kids and grandkids. A few years ago she preached about Juneteenth to her own congregation.

""I figure we got to start somewhere and even if this is a minor step for some — which to me it's a major step"" Hill said of the federal holiday recognition. ""If this is a minor step to some all steps all successes start in minor steps one at a time. We got this now let's work on the rest.""

More recently Hill has been learning about her family's history tracing lineage on her side of the family to her great-great grandmother whose grandfather's land was in part purchased and in part taken next becoming the Mississippi University for Women in Columbus Mississippi.

""(I've been) tracing back to my great-great-great grandparents and making sure my grandchildren know them"" Hill said. ""Even to the point where from time-to-time I will make them repeat the names of the people. It means nothing to them now but later on when they start having children it's going to be a big deal.""

Some of the festival's Saturday vendors were young kids — Leniya Kimbrough 12 was selling shirts and drinking glasses in the holiday's signature black yellow red and green and Ilana Kai Flynn 7 was with her mom selling clothes for ""Kai's World Kloset.""

Ilana Kai's favorite items included press-on nails a fidget-spinner type toy hair bows and miniature backpacks all among several other children's clothes.

""I actually have more people that help (with my store)"" she said. ""My god momma so shout out to my god momma shout out to my granny and shout out to my mom.""

The idea for Kai's World Kloset started last July and ""it's hard work"" she said.

""I was seeing everybody else have all their shops"" Ilana Kai said ""and I was like 'I'm bored. I want a shop. We have to start selling stuff.'""

In 2021 he'll have some work to do to get on the field but he also has a legitimate chance to make an impact.

After being selected near the end of the 2020 NFL Draft Thakarius ""BoPete"" Keyes will have to climb the depth chart in order to see the field for the Kansas City Chiefs in 2021. It won't be an easy path but an opportunity could certainly open up for the second-year cornerback.

Keyes was one of those guys who general manager Brett Veach decided to throw a dart at late in the 2020 NFL Draft. Veach traded a 2021 sixth-round pick to jump back into the seventh round and select the overlooked cornerback out of Tulane.

Keyes started 23 games in his final two collegiate seasons racking up a personal-best 47 tackles in his senior season. He has good size standing at 6-foot-1 and weighing 202 pounds. Keyes possessed the tools that gave him an opportunity to put himself in a position to make the roster and contribute on special teams and as a depth piece in his rookie season.

Keyes didn't flash much in his first year playing mostly on special teams finding the field for 13% of KC's special teams snaps. He was able to start in the season finale against the Los Angeles Chargers as the starters were being rested for the playoffs.

Keyes will likely have a similar role heading into the 2021 season. In order for him to make a big second-year jump he will need to work his tail off throughout the summer and make big strides to overtake playing time from guys ahead of him on the depth chart. It will likely take injuries for him to see significant playing time at the cornerback position.

However without Bashaud Breeland in the mix the Chiefs do have more unknowns at the cornerback position. While Charvarius Ward L'Jarius Sneed and Rashad Fenton are all likely safely ahead of Keyes there's a chance that Deandre Baker Mike Hughes and the rest of the corners are in a similar boat in terms of finding consistent playing time in Steve Spagnuolo's defense.",,,,,,,,,,,,
BALL,Ball Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzdS5lZHUvdG9kYXkvc3RvcnkvYXNrLWFuLWV4cGVydC0tLXdpbGwtd2UtaGF2ZS1iZXR0ZXItYWNjZXNzLXRvLWhvbWUtY2FubmluZy1zdXBwbGllcy10aGlzLXllYXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ask an Expert - Will We Have Better Access to Home Canning Supplies This Year?,"Not only did 2020 have a negative impact on small businesses employment and school schedules it also had a negative effect on home food preservation supplies. This was due to the sharp increase in people wanting to become more self-reliant combined with manufacturing plants that either completely shut down or operated with a significantly reduced workforce.

From the consumer standpoint there were at least four major challenges related to home food preservation equipment and supplies. Below are updates and safety guidelines.

1. Canning jars and lids – Demand for canning jars and screw-on rings was much higher than supply last year. This year they should be more available at big box stores supermarkets and hardware/agricultural businesses. Remember to purchase approved brands that will withstand the high temperatures needed for water bath and steam pressure canning.

Finding new canning lids however continues to be a challenge this year. The following statement was issued by the manufacturer of Ball® and Kerr® products:

Ball® brand home canning products are currently only sold through authorized third-party retailers and not our website FreshPreserving.com or the Ball corporation site Ball.com. For your convenience we’ve included a select list of authorized retailers who are currently carrying genuine Ball® brand home canning products. When purchasing online use caution if the product is sold or shipped by another entity other than the authorized retailer.

A list of retailers can be found at https://www.freshpreserving.com/where-buy.html. You can also contact your local USU Extension office for more information.

2. Reusing lids – Resist the urge to reuse single-use lids. It is impossible to recreate the same strength as the original seal once the sealing compound has been softened. Lids marketed as reusable do not have a high success rate for creating a strong seal and they are not recommended for pressure canning.

3. Price gouging and knock-offs – Prices for online purchases vary greatly so be sure to do your homework and shop around. One online search found a retailer selling canning lids at a reasonable $2.99/dozen but another was charging nearly four times that amount.

Last fall many disappointed online shoppers ended up with mislabeled boxes and oddly shaped lids even though the label said it was a recommended brand. If you received and used such lids some of them may have created a strong seal but then buckled. If the lid obtained a strong seal where it cannot be opened without the use of a can opener the food should still be safe to consume.

4. Food preservation equipment and parts – Last year it was nearly impossible to find new canners or replacement parts. Of those found online prices were much higher than before the pandemic. A challenge this year similar to last year is that many stores carry regular mouth lids but no other sizes. However as the economy stabilizes consumers should see availability and affordable prices for canning equipment and supplies return.

Though the news isn’t all positive progress is being made and hopefully the availability of sought-after supplies will improve as harvest time nears.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Half of American hotel markets are in a recession or depression. And California is expected to lose more than 150000 hotel jobs from 2020 through 2021 with bankruptcy hitting large establishments like the Fairmont San Jose and San Mateo’s Holiday Inn & Suites. Who would open a hotel in this dismal climate?

Berkeley it turns out.

This October a 16-story Residence Inn will open its doors at 2121 Center St. becoming the city’s third-tallest building behind two other high-rises on the same downtown corner. Managed by Pyramid Hotel Group the Marriott-branded hotel will include 331 extended-stay suites 15000 square feet of meeting space and a rooftop bar and restaurant. The structure which is LEED Gold certified will be wrapped in colored glass that mimics the fetching skies over the San Francisco Bay.

It’s only about two-dozen years in the making.

“We’ve been trying since 1997 to get that spot taken” says Barbara Hillman president of Visit Berkeley the organization that markets the city to the world. “I worked with the Office of Economic Development to designate that particular area as a hotel-and-conference center and we had several bites but it seemed as one bite progressed there was a downturn in the economy. This is the most recent bite coming to fruition and I’m excited because it’s something Berkeley has needed for a long long time.”

The hotel goes some of the distance toward completing Berkeley’s 2012 Downtown Plan which set forth design guidelines to make the district denser and more attractive for visitors and locals. The plan envisioned bringing in taller-than-usual buildings especially hotels if they deliver “significant additional public benefits.” The Residence Inn is one of these high buildings; an 18-story housing development that’s been going under the name of Shattuck Terrace Green Apartments is another. The developer for that project has changed since it was conceived and no construction has begun; it’s still just a Walgreens. There was also supposed to be an 18-story housing project on Harold Way but that was canceled last year due to financing problems.

At 168 feet the Residence Inn will sit slightly in the shadow of the Wells Fargo Building at 176 feet and the SkyDeck building the city’s tallest at 186 feet. Rates aren’t yet available. But a one-bedroom studio with a king bed and kitchen in the Residence Inn closest to Berkeley in Walnut Creek goes for about $270 a night in October according to its website (or about $200 a night if you rent by the week).

Hillman hopes the hotel will help stanch the bleeding-out of visitors and convention attendees in Berkeley. “We have the No. 1 public university in the world. People come and want to hold meetings there but we just didn’t have the space to accommodate them so they would go over to San Francisco and Oakland to hold their conferences. We turned a lot of business away.”

The hotel owes its existence partly to Jim Didion a former real-estate adviser to UC Berkeley and the late brother of writer Joan Didion. “Jim was the first individual who saw the site saw the opportunity contacted us as architects and said let’s put a plan together” says Edward McFarlan principal of JRDV Urban International in Oakland.

The site was previously a Bank of America in a low-rise building with a distinctly suburban-looking front lawn.

“It used to be 15 tellers lined up and everyone would have to come in and do their personal business” says McFarlan. “Well that went away because a lot of people do online banking. It was empty all the time. It was this giant wood frame 1970s – you know some people could call it ugly some people could just call it a very unnoticeable building on the most prominent corner of downtown Berkeley. The bank realized that too. That’s why they said ‘Yeah let’s sell it.’”

Boston-based Pyramid Hotel Group started to pursue the project in 2014 but told the city a couple years later that due to a regional building boom and rising costs it might have to cancel the project. The city council granted the developer about $13 million in tax abatement in 2018 and construction started that year. The city says there have been no changes to that tax agreement. The developer wouldn’t comment on the final costs of building the almost-finished hotel which in 2018 were estimated at $125 million.

The Residence Inn is expected to employ about 110 people by next year and along with Berkeley’s other hotels and motels will eventually chip in transient-occupancy taxes to the general fund. In 2018 the city estimated it would bring in $4 million a year a figure that hasn’t been recalculated since the pandemic.

Berkeley has dozens of hotels and motels that funnel in not just occupancy taxes but sales and property taxes. (They occasionally provide other civic benefits; last year Alameda County leased two Berkeley hotels through Project Roomkey to provide lodging for unhoused people.) In a good year these taxes would amount to several million dollars. With COVID-19 the city expects to collect only about $2.2 million for the 2022 general fund according to preliminary budget figures. Still the Residence Inn will likely become a large tax contributor in decades to come given its size and the brand’s reputation for high occupancy rates that industry experts put in the 75%-80% range.

The hotel arrives among other recent enhancements to the downtown area including a renovated BART plaza and a reconfiguration of Shattuck that brought in new sidewalks and traffic calming.

“I think people want to stay in hotels where there’s a lot of vibrancy and choice” says John Caner CEO of the Downtown Berkeley Association. “If you were a parent or visiting scholar or tourist wouldn’t you love to stay in downtown Berkeley and be able to BART into San Francisco or Oakland or rent a car and go up to wine country?”

‘Very conservative … not love and crazy at all’

The original concept for the hotel was a little too risque for downtown planners according to architect McFarlan. It had a three-dimensional art wall with variously colored apertures and glass that seemed to float over the street.

“You think about it as UC Berkeley and radical and all the leftists activists are there and that’s one of the things we love about Berkeley. … But over time we realized we weren’t getting support and it wasn’t clear why” he says. “I finally realized that actually with Berkeley the zeitgeist they operate on is very conservative in their view of their city. It’s not love and crazy at all which is OK. They really love their tradition as I do – I love downtown Berkeley and the traditional buildings. The only question you ask yourself is ‘What’s a new building have to be to complement that?’”

McFarlan and his colleagues settled on a more traditional brick-and-stone design with glass and white-metal detailing hinting at a modern playfulness. They included sophisticated solar technology with preheated water a green roof a rainwater-harvesting system that feeds the building’s vegetation and a publicly accessible roof deck which McFarlan’s particularly proud of. “It’s going to be the hangout because it looks out over the UC campus over the hills downtown Oakland and you can see pieces of the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco.”

There will be a new street-level restaurant and a second-floor parking garage with spaces designated for Bank of America which is moving back into its historical home on the first floor. There will be four ATM vestibules in the branch and one in the lobby plus expanded office space for bankers to meet with clients according to Bank of America executive Nitu Nanda.

The Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive which sits directly east of the hotel is pumped about the possible boon to art tourism.

“While BAMPFA has deep roots in our local community we’re also proud to serve a large audience of arts lovers from outside the Bay Area who will now have an inviting new accommodation option that’s literally right next door to the museum” says BAMPFA director Julie Rodrigues Widholm.

Planning for a bounce back

Will a sweet exhibit of Gandharan Buddhist sculpture and a free breakfast buffet be enough to draw in visitors when new and more gnarly-sounding COVID-19 variants seem to pop up every moon cycle? The hotel industry certainly hopes so.

“I don’t have the numbers back to the Great Depression but this makes all of our other downturns and recessions pale in comparison to the complete loss of revenue in the hotel business” says Alan Reay president of Atlas Hospitality Group a hotel brokerage-and-research company in Irvine.

Some hotels are seeing a comeback particularly those in “drive-to” markets like coastal communities and wine country as people look to finally escape the house. “A number of our clients (in those markets) have had the best May on record” says Reay.

The problem is hotels in downtown areas and business districts are still struggling. “It’s going to take them longer to come back just because you can’t flip a light switch and expect people to have meetings and conventions.”

Dhruv Patel president of Ridgemont Hospitality predicts local hotels will see a gradual rebound through 2023 but won’t be back to normal until an astonishingly late date of 2025. “We’re heavily reliant not only on corporate and group travel but international inbound. And while America is well on its way to controlling the pandemic we know what’s going on overseas” says Patel whose company operates six hotels in the Bay Area.

The fortunate thing is Berkeley’s newest lodging specializes in extended stay a category that’s done remarkably well during the pandemic. Extended-stay hotels are popular among nurses and first responders and the inn’s location near the university perhaps will entice students who need a place to live while finding more permanent housing. The suites also include kitchens an appealing feature for folks who’ve spent an entire year honing their cooking-at-home game.

“We opened an extended-stay hotel in Alameda in October and that actually outperformed our entire portfolio through the pandemic” says Patel.

The area certainly could use more visitors; foot traffic is still down by about two-thirds compared to pre-pandemic levels according to Caner of the Downtown Berkeley Association. “Our poor merchants have been under such financial duress during COVID” he says. “I’ve been saying to so many people ‘If we can just hang on until August students are going to return people are going to come back to offices and with the hotel we are going to bounce back so much faster than I think other downtowns will.’”

Perhaps the true test of downtown’s comeback will be how well UC Berkeley’s football does. In normal years the games typically draw in huge crowds of spend-happy visitors from Southern California Oregon and Washington.

So far all signs point to a roaring season according to Herb Benenson the university’s associate athletic director for communications. “I do know that nearly 95% of our 2019 football season-ticket holders have renewed their seats for this season and demand for new season tickets is strong.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50Lzg5NGFlYjc3LThiYzQtNGMwNS1hNDkxLTdjZmI1NmU3OTM1ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top tech groups try to dilute ESG disclosure rules,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The Wales-based distillery—the country’s first in over a century—found itself among much bigger whiskey brands with more name recognition and outsold them all. As one drinker sipped Penderyn on that warm California day he remarked that it was a “sunshine whiskey.”

“The name stuck” says Bethan Morgans Penderyn’s commissioning distiller. “It’s such a lovely way to describe our whiskey. And I think it just explains exactly what it is—something very light and delicate that can be enjoyed in the sunshine.”

Whiskey is often thought of as a winter drink for warming up cold nights while seated by the fireplace. And though some are best for chilly weather many are lighter-bodied smooth and refreshing and actually perfect for drinking all summer.

Below find seven of the best bottles to mix into cocktails or drink neat—as long as the sun is shining.

Penderyn “House Style” Madeira Finish: The distinction of being the first distillery to open in Wales in over a century gives Penderyn based in the village of Penderyn in South Wales a certain liberty to forge its own path. And it has. The all-female team of distillers—Laura Davies Aista Jukneviciute and Bethan Morgans—use a unique Faraday still for many of their expressions including the “house style” Madeira finish.

While most single malt whiskey is distilled twice in pot stills the Faraday method enables the spirit to be distilled only once; the design’s perforated copper plates help remove sulfites and other impurities producing a spirit that clocks in at 92% ABV (alcohol by volume). And even at this high ABV the Madeira finish—aged in two types of casks first matured in ex–bourbon barrels and finished in ex–Madeira wine casks—is smooth and lighter-bodied with hints of vanilla and a crisp fresh finish.

Morgans recommends trying the whiskey alone to get an appreciation for it first. “Even if you choose to add something to it whether it be water ice or a mixer I always recommend trying it neat first” she says. “Due to the distillation process it’s very light and easy to drink.” Suggested retail price: $70

M&H Distillery Classic Single Malt Whisky: Israel’s first whiskey distillery M&H (Milk & Honey) opened in 2012 and launched globally last year. The brand’s Classic Single Malt Whisky is finished in ex–bourbon barrels as well as in red wine STR (shaved toasted re-charred) casks and has racked up awards already including gold medals at the International Spirits Challenge 2020 and Frankfurt International Trophy 2020.

“Our M&H Classic is a whiskey that was matured under the Tel Aviv sunshine a five minutes walk from the beach” says Tal Chotiner the distillery’s VP of international sales. “It is a whiskey for everyone with light-bodied light vanilla notes a fresh spicy scent and balanced sweetness.

These light and balanced characteristics make it a sunshine whiskey best drunk neat or with one ice cube if it is boiling outside.”

Another summery way to drink it? In a Mediterranean julep: That’s two ounces of M&H Classic Single Malt poured over one-quarter ounce of simple syrup muddled with mint leaves; finish with a squeeze of fresh lime juice and a dash of bitters. SRP: $55

Catoctin Creek Roundstone Rye: Catoctin Creek chief distiller Becky Harris made history in Loudoun County Va. as its first female whiskey maker in nearly a century. In 2009 she and husband Scott Harris founded the county’s first legal post-Prohibition distillery where they make among other spirits Roundstone Rye. The state’s most awarded whiskey Roundstone is crafted with 100% rye and aged for a little under two years in new Minnesota white oak casks.

“Many people feel that whiskey is only a fall or wintertime beverage but at Catoctin Creek we beg to differ” says Scott cofounder and GM who points to the Roundstone Rye as proof. “Our original flagship single-barrel expression is perfect for summertime sipping. It is light and easy drinking fruity and nutty and quite perfect for cocktails along with sipping neat.” Scott recommends mixing the spirit into a whiskey sour or a Horse’s Neck which calls for two ounces of Roundstone Rye poured into an ice-filled rocks glass with a dash of Angostura bitters. Top with ginger beer and garnish with a long strip of lemon peel. SRP: $45

Starward Two-Fold: “Two-Fold” refers to the double grains used in this expression from Melbourne whiskey distillery Starward. Malted barley gives Two-Fold its depth while Australian-grown wheat makes it aromatic. Aging happens in barrels once used to make Australian reds (Pinot Noir Shiraz) and the result is a smooth lightly spiced whiskey with notes of ripe banana berries and a hint of vanilla. Two-Fold just took home a silver medal from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition and the brand prides itself on being a go-to refresher for Australian summers. Plus at around $35 per bottle the affordable price point makes this your approachable go-to whiskey.

“Two-Fold’s orchard fruit aroma and tropical fruit notes combine to naturally fit into a refreshing cocktail” says Jake Hukee Starward brand ambassador. “If it’s just a simple highball with a citrus wedge or a more complex build involving passion fruit and pistachio orgeat ultimately refreshing fruit flavors always prevail to quench the palate on a warm day.”

Other cocktails to try: the Two-Fold and tonic replacing gin with the complex whiskey for a fast and refreshing summer cocktail. Or go full tropical with a passion fruit mojito. SRP: $35

High West Distillery Rendezvous Rye: The flagship whiskey from High West Distillery Utah’s first legal distillery since 1870 the Rendezvous Rye is made with a blend of straight rye whiskeys. According to High West beverage director Steve Walton this season’s Rendezvous Rye includes notes of poached pear bitter orange ground ginger lavender wet sandalwood and tanned leather. “It is my favorite bottle to enjoy whilst sitting on the deck as a perfect summer’s day comes to an end” he says. “As the sun sets on the horizon drop in a good size ice cube and let the drink open up.” SRP: $70

Fukano 2020 Edition: A fifth-generation family-run distillery Fukano is located on the Japanese island of Kyushu in Hitoyoshi a city in Kumamoto prefecture. Because Japanese whiskey is distilled once says Sam Filmus president of spirits importer ImpEx Beverages it has an umami sweetness. “Using rice creates a style of whiskey that’s soft smooth and pleasantly delicate” he says. Aged in ex-sherry red wine and oak casks and made using a combination of malted and unmalted rice the Fukano 2020 Edition has an aroma of apple and rose with notes of white tea and honey and a finish of coconut and banana. Because the distillery is small each whiskey release is a limited one making every bottle all the more special. SRP: $90

Benriach Original Ten: The Speyside region of northern Scotland is a protected region for Scotch whisky—home to dozens of distilleries among them Benriach.

“Single malt Scotch whisky has such a diverse range of flavors making for an incredible versatile spirit” says senior brand ambassador Greg King. “Many including myself choose their dram based on mood time of day and time of year.”

The more than century-old distillery uses casks sourced from all over the world and the Original Ten draws on a mix of ex–bourbon barrels sherry casks and virgin oak resulting in an exceptionally smooth well-balanced scotch with layers of ripe orchard fruit French vanilla and toasted oak. King prefers the Benriach Original Ten for his go-to summer whisky using it in a classic Penicillin cocktail to allow for “so many of the flavors we typically associate with warmer months to all harmonize together. Notes of honey and lemon complement perfectly the ripe apple and pear orchard fruits that make up the Benriach distillery character.” SRP: $50"

Parker at River Road

NORTH BRUNSWICK – Michele Hirshman ascended the stairs to the stage and approached the dais taking her place in history as the first woman to finish at the top of her graduating class at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.

Once on stage she saw the hand reaching out with her diploma belonged to none other than her own father Harold Hirshman.

""I can remember looking at her with such pride"" said Harold Hirshman who served for decades as a high-ranking administrator at Rutgers. ""As a father I was bursting with such happiness. I knew the dean well and he knew she was graduating first in his class so he let me hand her the diploma. I’ll always be thankful to him for that.""

Father’s Day will be a time when Michele as well as her brothers Elliot and Ken will reflect on all the ways their lives were shaped by their father Harold — a cerebral tireless and gracious man who led by example. His children often watched him working late at night at the dinner table or making deliveries for the Meals on Wheels program. Harold also served for five years on active duty in the U.S. Navy and decades more as a reservist.

But Harold who lives at the Parker at River Road nursing home in Piscataway says his children have already said ""thank you"" this Father’s Day in the best way possible.

""They have gone on to live great lives and become very successful good people and good parents"" he said. ""What more as a father could you ever want?""

Michele is a Yale-educated partner in the litigation department for Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP where her clients have included 21st Century Fox Bank of New York Mellon and Columbia University.

Elliot who earned his Ph.D. in cognitive psychology from the University of California became the seventh president at Stevenson University in Maryland in 2017. Prior to that he served as president of San Diego State University for six years.

Ken earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Johns Hopkins before serving as a CEO for many years.

They grew up in the township where one of the most important lessons they learned from dad was to always make time for family.

That was no easy task for Harold. As the associate vice president for Registrar and student services at Rutgers University Camden his responsibilities included everything from admissions to financial aid to student disciplinary issues.

Ken who was a collegiate football player said his dad and mom Edna May attended every game for four years except the one that fell on Yom Kippur the Jewish Day of Atonement.

""I can remember he was somewhere maybe like New York or Boston and he had a meeting on a Friday or Thursday and I had a game Friday night or Saturday"" he said. ""Somehow he made it. That was really impressive how he would do that.""

Michele remembers how her dad made it a point to be home every night for dinner with the family.

""There would be some late nights where I would come down for a drink of water"" Michele said ""And he would still be at the dinner table doing work.""

About five years ago the man who was always there for them needed their support.

Michele said Harold’s diagnosis of prostate cancer when he was 85 shook the family.

""The doctors told us they weren’t going to do anything unless it would give him another five years to live"" she said.

The radiation was effective on the cancer but the treatment and a series of back surgeries seemed to have potentially precipitated the onset of dementia Michele said.

Soon after Harold moved into Parker at River Road in October 2017 the family noticed his spirits rising.

""He and my mom made friends with other couples and my father has totally regained his mental faculties"" Michele said. ""He's totally cognitively well. He knows exactly what's going on in the world and with his family.""

""Mr. Hirshman is a very special dad; he loves and encourages he is the maker of the biggest laughs and has the kindest heart. It’s an honor to have Mr. Hirshman his wife Edna May and their children to be a part of the Parker Family"" said Sonam Naik administrator of Parker at River Road.

Harold proudly displays photos of his kids his seven grandchildren his three great grandchildren and of course Edna.

The former captain of the Rutgers baseball team still keeps up with his beloved Philadelphia Phillies in the summer and the Philadelphia Eagles when the calendar rolls to fall.

""You see these?"" Harold said holding up some newspapers. ""My daughter gave me these sports sections from various papers. I like to read them because it keeps my mind sharp. My kids are the best. What more can I ask?""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy9wYXNzaXZlLWludmVzdGluZy13b3JsZC10dXJuZWQtdXBzaWRlLWRvd24tYXMtYWN0aXZlLWZ1bmRzLWJvb20vYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODM2Njc0MDcuY21z0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL3N0b2Nrcy9uZXdzL3Bhc3NpdmUtaW52ZXN0aW5nLXdvcmxkLXR1cm5lZC11cHNpZGUtZG93bi1hcy1hY3RpdmUtZnVuZHMtYm9vbS9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODM2Njc0MDcuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Passive investing world turned upside down as active funds boom,"You Might Also Like: Which are the best sectoral bets to play on economic revival?

Not so long ago actively managed ETFs were rare. Now they’re being created at twice the rate of their passive rivals.Inspired by the success of Cathie Wood ’s ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK ) exchange-traded fund issuers have this year launched 115 active products versus just 51 passive funds  according to data compiled by Bloomberg.That’s the first time active launches have ever outstripped passive and it’s powering the $6.5 trillion ETF market toward its busiest 12 months on record.It’s a comeback of sorts for stock pickers and in an unlikely corner of Wall Street. Most active managers fail to beat their benchmarks net of fees -- a fact that has seen passive ETFs lure roughly $3 trillion over the past decade while active funds gained only about $200 billion.But a combination of new rules and the enduring popularity of ETFs with investors means a slow but major shift is underway.“It’s almost impossible to start a small to medium hedge fund as a single manager” said Nathan Miller portfolio manager for New York-based Emles Advisors. “So we thought why go launch another hedge fund? Let’s launch an actively managed ETF.”The Emles Alpha Opportunities ETF (EOPS) which packages fast-money strategies in an exchange-traded wrapper is one of the more recent active arrivals. It listed less than two weeks ago and already has about $66 million in assets.Major rule changes in late 2019 paved the way for funds like EOPS. It became easier to deploy stock-picking strategies in an ETF and new structures evolved that would help keep exact investment strategies hidden.Active funds remain a small slice of the industry and their assets make up just 3.4% of the overall ETF market. But that’s up from 2.7% a year ago. And in a sign the trend could continue several large Wall Street firms who long held-out against ETFs are now embracing them.Firms are also ramping up their thematic offerings which invest according to compelling narratives like autonomous driving or sports betting.A record 22 thematic funds have launched since the start of the year including Wood’s $619 million ARK Space Exploration ETF (ARKX) and BlackRock Inc. ’s $1.4 billion U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness ETF (LCTU) which set a record in April with the industry’s biggest-ever launch.Roundhill Investments’ MVP ETF which is focused on companies that own or support professional sports teams Defiance’s Hotel Airline and Cruise ETF (CRUZ) and Bitwise Asset Management’s Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) were among other thematic debuts.For many the aim is to tap the boom in retail investing that has seen individuals grow to comprise more than 20% of equity trading participation according to Bloomberg Intelligence “That’s really been a catalyst to help get some of these thematic ETFs off the ground quickly” said Ben Slavin head of ETFs for BNY Mellon Asset Servicing.Although not technically classified as a thematic fund the retail-friendly VanEck Vectors Social Sentiment ETF (BUZZ) made waves earlier this year when it launched with an endorsement from Barstool Sports Inc. founder Dave Portnoy.The fund posted one of the best debuts in the industry’s history in March and currently has more than $243 million in assets.As the new-arrival count surges the number of exiting funds has plunged.So far this year only 19 ETFs have liquidated or delisted according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with 104 in the first half of 2020 and 79 during the same period in 2019.Much of that endurance can be attributed to the bull market. Stocks have been repeatedly breaking records and cash has been flowing readily through the market. About 67% of U.S.-listed ETFs have taken in cash so far in 2021 according to Bloomberg Intelligence -- meaning issuers are less likely to pull the plug.“There’s generally increased optimism as we come out of the pandemic and people are more excited and feeling more optimistic about their business development” said Amrita Nandakumar president of Vident Investment Advisory. “Fundraising is easier in a bull market.”",,,,,,,,,

Then it went bankrupt and now the shares are worth zero though you can find contrarian views.

These stock sales always struck me as extraordinarily cynical: Bed Bath pretty much knew that it would be filing for bankruptcy with no recovery for shareholders but it went out and raised a few hundred million dollars from meme-stock retail investors to hand directly to creditors.

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

BATH Maine — To address a growing need for diverse housing options a new affordable apartment complex was built in Bath and on Wednesday locals got to take a look during a grand opening.



Made possible through several tax credits and the guidance of MaineHousing the new 60-unit complex was developed by The Szanton Company and sits on the corner of Front and Summer streets.



Forty-two units will be reserved for those 55 and older and cost between $800 and $1500 a month to rent according to the developers.

The building also features several community spaces a rooftop deck and some mixed-use retail spaces some of which have already been renting before renovations and changes. Bookstore owner Jim Rice said as a retail and housing tenant seeing more affordable housing come to the downtown area is much-needed.

""Bath is in demand. It's really popular now and it's gotten more expensive"" Rice said. ""For me being right by the bookstore is ideal.""

Russell will start for Bath at number 10 alongside Ben Spencer at scrum-half when the team travels to bottom-of-the-league Falcons for the first of their final two regular-season Premiership matches.

Bath are third in the table one point behind Saracens in second and five points off leaders Northampton as they aim to secure a top-four spot and place in the play-offs.

According to Reuters the sale has a silver lining for HSBC allowing it to “end its long struggle to dispose of the business as it focuses on Asia.”

Cerberus a US-based private equity fund already has stakes in other European banks including Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. With this latest deal My Money will acquire HSBC’s 244 branches roughly 3900 employees and 24 billion euros in assets effectively creating what the company calls a new challenger bank in France.

My Money will also bring back the Credit Commercial de France (CCF) brand and invest 200 million euros in the HSBC unit’s technology infrastructure.

“The deal marks HSBC’s second exit from a major Western market this year after it sold its US retail banking businesses as Chief Executive Noel Quinn cuts his losses in markets where HSBC has long struggled to be profitable” reports Reuters. “HSBC put its French retail business under ‘strategic review’ in September 2019 with a sale launched in December the same year as it abandoned a long struggle to generate sufficient profits from the unit.”

HSBC made a loss before tax of 288 million euros for the financial year that ended Dec. 31 2020. Reuters notes that the bank had trouble attracting bidders who balked at the possibility of restructuring and dealing with local regulators.

On this day five years ago LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers completed one of the most memorable comebacks in NBA history.

Down 3-1 after four games to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals James and Kyrie Irving used a strong Game 5 performance to accumulate momentum for the final two games.

In Game 6 James led all scorers with 41 points to go with 11 assists and eight rebounds as the Cavaliers won 115-101. After just one quarter Cleveland developed a 31-11 lead.

Then in Game 7 on the road James and Irving delivered incredible moments.

James had the sensational chasedown block on Andre Iguodala’s layup attempt. Irving drilled the stepback three over Stephen Curry with less than a minute remaining in the fourth quarter to seal the game.

James led Cleveland with 27 points 11 rebounds 11 assists two steals and three blocks in 47 minutes. Irving dropped 26 points and six rebounds in 43 minutes.

Draymond Green led the Warriors with 32 points as he hit six 3-pointers on eight attempts. Curry and Klay Thompson however combined to shoot 6-of-24 from deep.

The Cavaliers won 93-89. The title marked the franchise’s first in its history and James came through on his promise to bring a title to his home team.

James reflected on the moment on Twitter:

We ASX investors love our Australian shares. And fair enough too. The S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) has been a great place historically to find great companies to invest your money into for long-term gains. However like any index the ASX 200 isn't perfect. It's heavy on ASX banks and miners and light on tech companies. At least where it counts: market-capitalisation weighting.

That's where the US markets can come in handy. Not only is America home to some of the best companies in the world such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). it also offers ASX investors some exposure to trends and sectors that the ASX 200 just can't.

So here are 3 ASX exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have the potential to easily expose any ASX investor's portfolio to the US markets.

3 ASX ETFs that can offer ASX investors easy US markets exposure

iShares S&P 500 ETF (ASX: IVV)

Here we have a simple cheap US-based index fund. The S&P 500 Index (INDEXSP: .INX) is one of the largest and most-tracked index in the world. It holds 500 of the largest companies in the US. That's everything from Apple and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) to Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE). This is the index that IVV tracks. This ETF has been an objectively solid performer over the past 10 years returning an average of 17.93% per annum. it also has one of the lowest management fees of any ETF on the ASX at 0.04% per annum.

BetaShares Nasdaq 100 ETF (ASX: NDQ)

Another US-based index fund here. But instead of the S&P 500 NDQ tracks the Nasdaq-100 (INDEXNASDAQ: NDX). This index is a little different holding only the companies that list on the Nasdaq exchange. The Nasdaq is one of the major stock exchanges in the US but it's a lot newer than its main rival the New York Stock Exchange. As such it tends to house mostly tech companies. It's largest holdings are Apple Microsoft and other tech giants like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX).

NDQ charges a management fee of 0.48% per annum and has retuned an average of 20.94% per annum since its inception in 2015.

VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (ASX: MOAT)

This ETF is a little different from the above examples as it is not an index fund. Rather it can be described as an 'active ETF'. That's because it invests in companies that meet certain criteria – that of a wide economic moat. VanEck works with Morningstar to identify a concentrated portfolio of at least 40 US shares that show signs of a 'wide moat'.

'Moat' is a Warren Buffett term that describes a company's intrinsic competitive advantage. This can be in a powerful brand cost advantage or other factors that enable a company to stay on top of its competition. Some of MOAT's top holdings include Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) and Buffett's own Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). MOAT charges a management fee of 0.49% per annum. It has returned an average of 20.38% per annum since its inception in 2015.",,,

Both Amazon and Best Buy have the 40mm GPS version for $279 right now or $120 off its normal price. While not the all-time low of $249 that we saw for a brief moment back in April this remains a great deal on Apple's most powerful smartwatch. Most other colors (that are in stock) are down to $329 which is $70 less than usual.

Buy Apple Watch Series 6 (Red) at Amazon - $279 Buy Apple Watch Series 6 (Red) at Best Buy - $279

If you want the best wearable experience Apple has to offer the Series 6 is the gadget to get. Its exterior looks almost identical to that of the Series 5 but Apple made some changes inside. It runs on an S6 chipset that's 20 percent faster than the processor in its predecessor. Indeed the Series 6 feels zippier when you're wiping through watch faces and navigating between apps. The new processor efficiencies also help improve the Series 6's battery life a bit and the Watch charges faster than before too. In just a half hour the Series 6 gained 51 percent power in our testing.

In addition to the array of sensors the Series 5 Watch had the Series 6 adds a blood oxygen sensor for measuring oxygen saturation. Admittedly this will be most useful for only a certain number of people but it provides interesting health insights to everyone. We also appreciate the new native sleep tracking in watchOS 7 and the hand-washing timer feature that counts you down as you watch your hands. Apple will be expanding on the former in watchOS 8 too to make it even more comprehensive.

We recommend the Apple Watch Series 6 to those that want all of the health tracking features Apple has to offer or simply the most powerful wearable in the company's lineup. It's an easier buy when it's on sale like this if you're comfortable with the red version. Those who don't need the extra health sensors and the always-on display could opt for the Apple Watch SE which is also on sale right now at Amazon. An automatically applied coupon knocks $30 off some colors of the Watch SE bringing them down to $240. This model gives you all of the core Apple Watch features like all-day fitness tracking irregular heart rhythm alerts fall detection noise monitoring and more at a more affordable price.

We're comparing the iPhone 11 which starts at $599 with 2018's iPhone XR currently available for $499 to see which phone is the better buy today.

Sarah Tew/CNET Apple iPhone 11 The future-proof iPhone With dual rear cameras Night Mode shooting and a 12-megapixel front-facing shooter the iPhone 11 does have more tricks up its sleeves for photos and videos. But compared to the iPhone XR which already takes fantastic pictures and video the advantages are slight for the extra money you'll pay. In addition the iPhone 11 has a new U1 chip and Wi-Fi 6 and Gigabit LTE capabilities. You will see these next-gen features in future iPhones and Android devices so if you want to have a modern phone for the next few years the iPhone 11 is the best bet. But because Wi-Fi 6 and Gigabit LTE are not fully built-out networks yet you won't see any immediate advantages -- another reason why we still prefer the iPhone XR.

Josh Miller/CNET Apple iPhone XR The better value It might have an older processor and specs but for the money you'll be saving with the iPhone XR we think it's worth it. It runs iOS 14 just as smoothly as the iPhone 11 on its A12 chipset and though it doesn't have an ultrawide camera and the updated camera tech the iPhone XR works just fine for posting photos on Instagram and social media too. In general if you're on a tight budget the iPhone XR is still a great value. We'd suggest either pocketing that extra cash for something else or using it to upgrade to the 128GB model.

How we tested

Design: Nearly identical and still as durable

The iPhone 11 and XR look nearly identical -- the quickest way to identify them is by the iPhone 11's extra camera and square bump. But besides that and the different color choices (the iPhone 11 comes in lavender mint green and a pastel yellow while the Phone XR comes in a canary yellow coral and blue) there are no obvious differences. They are the same size and weigh the same and the phones have the same 6.1-inch LCD display with the same resolution and pixel density.

Besides the number of rear cameras they have the iPhone 11 and XR look similar. Angela Lang/CNET

We performed a series of drop tests on the iPhone 11 and XR and both phones are quite sturdy. We dropped the iPhone 11 on its front and back on smooth concrete from 3 feet 6 feet and 8 feet 7 inches. On all drops the phone's back glass and screen didn't crack. There was a small cosmetic scratch above the camera lens from 8 feet but the camera lens was completely fine.

When we dropped the iPhone XR back in 2018 we dropped it on a concrete sidewalk. At waist height (about 3 feet) the phone's camera glass cracked but the back glass survived. The screen also was unscathed. At eye-level (or around 5 feet) the iPhone XR survived a fall on its back with no new damage but when we dropped it on its screen the display ultimately cracked. Though that was unfortunate the fact that the iPhone XR survived waist-high drops was still good.

Both phones are water-resistant but the iPhone 11 has a higher IP rating of IP68 and can survive underwater at 2 meters (about 6.5 feet) for 30 minutes. The iPhone XR meanwhile is rated IP67 and can survive underwater to a depth of 1 meter for 30 minutes on paper. When we took it out on dives however the iPhone XR kept on ticking even after 19 minutes underwater at a depth of 5 meters. In our water tests we were unable to drown the iPhone 11 or iPhone 11 Pro both phones surviving 30 minutes at a whopping 12 meters underwater. When it comes to water resistance the iPhone 11 far exceeds both its own promises and the iPhone XR's hardiness.

Camera: Latest updates give iPhone 11 the edge

Both phones have a 12-megapixel camera but the iPhone 11 has a second 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new Night Mode for low-light photography. All in all outdoor and well-lit photos on both devices look similarly vibrant with consistent and bright coloring on both cameras.

However the iPhone 11 did take notably sharper photos with finer details especially when pictures were viewed at full resolution. It also did a better job brightening up night time and dim photos with its new mode. The second ultrawide camera is useful when you want to fit more content into each frame or you want to capture more expansive scenes too. Its flash is a tad brighter as well though we rarely use the feature. Lastly we like that we can now take portrait photos of pets on the iPhone 11 (the iPhone XR does not recognize nonhuman faces for portraits which is a drag). The iPhone 11 also makes use of a feature called Deep Fusion which further improves detail and reduces image noise in photos.

As for video footage on the Phone 11 has a tad better dynamic range so lighting and exposure looks more even and natural. Video stabilization is a bit steadier as well on the standard 12-megapixel camera. But the wide-angle camera does not have optical image stabilization and during 4K video recording you can only switch between cameras when you're filming in 30fps (though both cameras can record 60fps).

On the front the iPhone 11 has a 12-megapixel camera while the iPhone XR has a 7-megapixel camera. While we do welcome the extra resolution of the iPhone 11 we never really had many gripes with the iPhone XR's front-facing camera and if you're a casual selfie-taker the iPhone XR is definitely satisfactory. The iPhone 11's front camera can also pull out for a wider point of view record 4K video at 60fps and take slow-mo videos. But since we mostly use the front-facing camera for selfies we didn't really find ourselves using those last two features often.

iPhone 11 is faster

The iPhone 11 features Apple's newest A13 Bionic processor while the iPhone XR has 2018's A12 chipset. For the most part the iPhone 11 and XR both run iOS 13 as smooth and fast as the other. When it comes to day-to-day tasks like browsing the web firing up the camera or opening apps we couldn't discern any speed differences. But on paper the iPhone 11 is unquestionably the faster phone. As you can see by the benchmark results below the newer iPhone far surpassed the iPhone XR and scored much higher on all the tests we ran.

While we're currently in the middle of changing our battery test methodology for phones we did test both the iPhone 11 and the iPhone XR with a new streaming video test. Here's what we wrote in our iPhone 11 review: After conducting our formal battery tests and living with the iPhone 11 for over a month we found the battery life is about the same as the iPhone XR. In our streaming video tests the iPhone 11 lasted 13 hours and 52 minutes compared with the iPhone XR's time of 12 hours and 7 minutes in the same test. In daily use the iPhone 11 has been lasting about a day and a half.

iPhone 11 is more future-proof but benefits come later

The iPhone 11 has a U1 chip for ""spatial awareness"" according to Apple and it helps iPhones find other iPhones more precisely when they're in close proximity. The chip also lets you ""point your iPhone toward someone else's and AirDrop will prioritize that device so you can share files faster."" Many believe that the U1 chip is actually laying the groundwork for a long-rumored Apple tile tracker.

The iPhone 11 has Wi-Fi 6 which is the next generation of wireless networking. As CNET Senior Editor Ry Crist puts it ""Wi-Fi 6 supports faster top transfer speeds; lets devices send more information with each individual transmission; lets routers and other access points service more devices at once; helps sensors and other wireless gadgets conserve battery power by scheduling transmissions; and facilitates better faster performance in dense crowded environments like airports and stadiums."" But you likely won't see many perks in your iPhone 11 now as Wi-Fi 6 routers are expensive.

The iPhone 11 has Gigabit LTE an advanced version of 4G LTE. Gigabit LTE is really fast and can reach peak speeds of 1 gigabit per second which is about the same speed as a landline internet connection. Apple introduced Gigabit LTE to its iPhone XS and XS Max in 2017 but the iPhone XR was oddly left out of the update. But the iPhone 11 has it and while you likely won't reach those speeds all the time your overall speed is going to be faster than an older phone and you have a lot more clearance when it comes to potential speed.

The iPhone 11 comes in a 256GB model. At $749 (£749 AU$1249) it's more expensive but if you take a lot of photos and shoot a lot of videos the extra onboard storage will come in handy -- especially if you don't really use cloud storage. Currently Apple only sells 64GB and 128GB models of the iPhone XR.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLXBvZGNhc3RzLTM2OTM1MjA40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Real Estate Podcasts That'll Teach You the Ins and Outs of Buying a House,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/real-estate-podcasts-36935208 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLXBvZGNhc3RzLTM2OTM1MjA40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlYXJwYXRyb2wuY29tL2hvbWUvYTM1OTQyMDczL2JsdWVhaXItYWlyLXB1cmlmaWVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Complete Buying Guide to Blueair Air Purifiers: Every Model Explained,"Blueair has over 20 years in the air purifier business — and too many units to keep track of so we did it for you.

Welcome to Brand Breakdown a series of comprehensive yet easy-to-digest guides to your favorite companies with insights and information you won’t find on the average About page.

While vacuum cleaners have Dyson air purifiers don’t have the same kind of go-to brand. Instead there a boatload of air purifier brands each with its own flagship models that deserve to be in your home fighting off the invisible particles hovering around your head. Blueair is one of those brands. The Swedish-founded brand of air purifiers has been around for over 20 years and it’s got the inventory and technology to back its long history in the product category. The only problem with Blueair is that it makes so many products that it’s hard to pick the right one for you. For example what’s really the difference between the Classic line and Blue line? We break it all down for you here.

Need to Knows

Activated carbon: A type of porous material that is good for absorbing unpleasant odors for the air. It is not apt at removing VOCs from the air.

Air quality: The extent to which the air is free of pollutants which is usually expressed as an average concentration during a given time period.

Air quality index (AQI): A scale from 0 to 500 that reports air quality and the amount of pollutants in the air. The lower the number the cleaner the air. For ranges on AQI see AirNow’s chart for more.

Allergen: In short any substance that can cause an allergic reaction. Potential allergens include pollen pet dander and mold spores. Allergens can have a reactionary effect through touch or inhalation.

AHAM-Verified mark: Products tested and approved for the Energy Star program by The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. Air purifiers with this certification ensure that the device’s “energy consumption rating is consistent with the measured energy consumption” per the Aham Verifide website.

Clean-air delivery (CADR) rating: Established by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers clean-air delivery ratings measures an air purifier’s effectiveness by noting the volume of clean air produced per minute based on the space of a room. Devices will be given a rating for smoke pollen and dust with the higher the number the better the efficacy.

Pollutant: Any substance that when in large concentrations can degrade health conditions.

True HEPA filters: High-efficiency particulate air filters that must remove 99.97 percent of particulates measuring .3 micron in diameter. These have become the baseline for all air purifiers. If you find a filter rated as HEPA-type don’t buy it as it’s trying to sell you an inferior product — by using the HEPA buzzword — with weaker filtering capabilities.

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): Compounds with high vapor pressure and low water solubility that are emitted as gases from solids or liquids. These can come from things such as paints and pesticides. VOCs a common type of indoor pollution can accumulate easily especially if you rarely open a window. Inhaling VOCs can lead to adverse health reactions and may cause cancer.

Naturally Samsung went ahead and jacked up the price of its successor the Galaxy A52 5G. This year's update costs $500.

Before you get your pitchforks out this new Android phone does have a few new features that somewhat justify the bump in price like added 5G connectivity a faster screen refresh rate of 120 Hz and a commitment from Samsung to a longer window for software updates—three years of Android OS upgrades with four years of security updates. The latter is even longer than what Google offers for its Pixel phones.

The A52 5G is a good phone but it's plagued by the same flaws as its predecessor: Its performance isn't as smooth as it should be and the cameras remain a step behind our current favorite midpriced phone the Pixel 4A 5G.

Mostly Smooth Sailing

I'm hard on the A52 because its performance really could be better. Don't get me wrong—it's no slouch. Inside is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G chip with 6 gigabytes of RAM a pairing powerful enough to speedily launch my apps and run graphically demanding games like Sky: Children of the Light and Genshin Impact. Sure gaming isn't as silky smooth as it is on pricier phones like the Galaxy S21 but it's far from a frustrating experience.

Benchmark tests I ran even put the A52 a notch higher than similarly priced phones like the Pixel 4A 5G ($500) and the new Moto G Stylus 5G ($400). However unlike these two phones I'm still treated to regular noticeable stutters in day-to-day use. Whether it's switching apps zooming into Google Maps or scrolling through Twitter the A52 5G randomly sputters. I suspect the software just isn't as well optimized. (A ton of preinstalled bloatware furthers this suspicion.) I can still easily get stuff done so really it comes down to how much the stutters annoy you.

Those hiccups somewhat spoil one of the new headline features though: the 120-Hz screen refresh rate. Such a high-performance screen spec is rare in a phone at this price. Traditional phones have a 60-Hz refresh rate which means the display refreshes 60 times per second. By doubling this rate to 120 everything on the screen looks more buttery smooth. It does! But when the aforementioned stutters pop in now and then they take away from that fluidity.

The 6.5-inch AMOLED screen picks up the slack a bit. It's sharp with a 2400- x 1080-pixel resolution while also being wonderfully bright and colorful. With dual speakers that also sound pretty good I didn't mind catching up on Star Wars: The Bad Batch on this device before bed. Better yet the large 4500-mAh battery cell won't give you any cause for concern. I usually ended the day with around 40 percent left in the tank.

It's also a surprisingly sleek device. It's big but slim which makes it feel not too unwieldy. And sure it only comes in black but the matte plastic design means you won't have to worry about the rear cracking when you drop it. The phone looks simple but modern and that aesthetic is aided by the slim bezels around the screen as well as the floating hole-punch camera on the front.

The other major addition here is 5G connectivity which is nice for future-proofing but don't buy this phone for 5G. The next-gen network is still sparse around the US and even if it's available in your area the A52 only supports sub-6 5G the version that's not dramatically faster than current 4G LTE speeds. Safe to say you probably won't notice much of a difference when you switch between 5G and 4G."

Might the fact that corporate investors snapped up 15 percent of U.S. homes for sale in the first quarter of this year have something to do with it? The Wall Street Journal reported in April that an investment firm won a bidding war to purchase an entire neighborhood worth of single-family homes in Conroe Texas—part of a cycle of stories drumming up panic over Wall Street’s increasing stake in residential real estate. Then came the backlash as cool-headed analysts reassured us that big investors like BlackRock remain insignificant players in the housing market compared with regular old American families.

The truth is between the two: We can panic and acknowledge Wall Street’s small role at the same time. Although the number of houses being purchased by mega-investors is currently not enough to move the market in most parts of the country these firms’ underlying structural advantage is profound and growing.

Let’s focus on Invitation Homes a $21 billion publicly traded company that was spun off from Blackstone the world’s largest private equity company in 2017. Invitation Homes operates in 16 cities with the biggest concentration in Atlanta where it owns 12556 houses. (Though that’s not much compared with the 80000 homes sold in Atlanta each year Invitation Homes bought 90 percent of the homes for sale in some ZIP codes in Atlanta in the early 2010s.) While normal people typically pay a mortgage interest rate between 2 percent and 4 percent these days Invitation Homes can borrow money for far less: It’s getting billion-dollar loans at interest rates around 1.4 percent. In practice this means that Invitation Homes can afford to tack on an extra $5000 to $20000 to the purchase price of every home while getting the house at the same actual cost as a typical homeowner. While Invitation Homes uses a mixture of debt and cash from renters to buy houses its offers are almost always all cash which is a big leg up in a competitive market.

One way to think about Invitation Homes’ business strategy is to consider the value of the properties the firm is buying relative to the rents they charge. According to a recent SEC disclosure Invitation Homes’ portfolio of homes is worth of total of $16 billion (after renovations) and the company collects about $1.9 billion in rent per year. That means it takes only about eight years of rental payments to pay back a typical house that Invitation Homes has bought. The usual rule of thumb for evaluating a fair sale price says Kundan Kishor professor of economics at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee “is that price to rent ratios are around 20 to 1.” When price-to-rent ratios are very high it makes more sense for consumers to rent than to buy and when they are low it makes more sense to buy than to rent. That Invitation Homes is getting deals twice as good as a typical homebuyer shows that it’s not just buying any homes: It’s buying the specific houses with the greatest potential to be wealth-building for the middle class.

It’s not exactly accurate that investors are “buying every single-family house they can find” as some have suggested. If that were true their market share in the United States wouldn’t be a piddling 15 percent. They’re really buying up the stock of relatively inexpensive single-family homes built since the 1970s in growing metro areas. They mostly ignore bigger and more expensive houses especially ones that are move-in ready: Wealthy boomers and the nation’s finance and tech bros nab those properties. And they’re also ignoring cities with stable or shrinking populations like Providence and Pittsburgh.

But investors are depleting the inventory of the precise houses that might otherwise be obtainable for younger working- and middle-class households in the cities where those workers can easily find good-paying jobs like Atlanta (22 percent of home purchases according to Redfin data) Charlotte (22 percent) and Phoenix (20 percent). More importantly they’re able to scour those markets scientifically and systematically to make cash offers on the most attractively priced properties. While normal people buy houses when they actually need to move somewhere (savvy) investors buy houses several years before a bunch of people need to move to an area. Whether they’re tracking where major employers are building new offices or looking at public school enrollment data being ahead of the market gives big firms a big leg up.

And in case you were assuming that converting houses to rentals would flood the market and bring down rents don’t get your hopes up: As Invitation Homes tells its investors “We operate in markets with strong demand drivers high barriers to entry and high rent growth potential.”

While renting might make sense for some people especially people who move a lot it often sucks particularly in the United States where we don’t have especially strong protections for tenants. The business strategy of the country’s biggest landlords Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent does not seem to be “Make renting with us so delightful that if my tenants have to move cities they’ll specifically seek out another property owned by our company.” Based on reports from Reuters the New York Times and the Atlantic it appears to be closer to “Squeeze our tenants for every penny avoid making repairs let black mold and raw sewage accumulate and count on the fact that moving is a huge expensive hassle.”

Our current system of encouraging homeownership is by no means perfect and it places a lot of unnecessary risk onto the “balance sheets” of the middle class but it’s worked out financially for most of the people who have been lucky enough to own a home. The implicit and explicit subsidies the government has given to Americans buying their first homes have been the biggest handout the American middle class has ever received (a handout notably denied to Black Americans for much of the 20th century one explanation for the current size of the racial wealth gap).

Laurie Goodman vice president of housing finance policy at the Urban Institute points out that policymakers could take steps to level the playing field between investors and the rest of us. She told me that buyers who need to borrow money using Federal Housing Administration loans or those who need a rehab loan for a fixer-upper have a particularly tough time competing against Wall Street firms. FHA paperwork often gets delayed slowing down the purchase process so home sellers often don’t want to sell to FHA buyers even if their bids are competitive. That’s a solvable problem. And loans for properties that need renovations Goodman says are both cumbersome and expensive. Rethinking the processes for FHA and rehab loans could “put individuals on a more equal footing” she explained.

If you don’t want all of America’s land and housing to end up in the portfolios of the 1 percent there’s ultimately one very simple solution: Tax the rich. After all the companies buying the houses are ultimately owned by people (or in some cases universities and churches which are their own cans of tax-advantaged rich-people worms). At the same time that the working-class is going hungry rich people are doing so outstandingly well that they are running out of easy places to park their cash which is why they’re buying 2000 square-foot houses in the Phoenix suburbs via their ownership stakes in these funds.

This is all part of a long-standing trend: As inequality in the United States increases the financial elite invests less in the types of things that could create jobs like R&D or new factories and more into directly extracting wealth from the working class. One way to do that? Becoming their landlords.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYmxhY2stbXVzaWNpYW5zLXJvY2stYW5kLXJvbGwtaGlzdG9yedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black Musicians in Rock-and-Roll Historya,"Ruth Brown's talents helped build Atlantic Records one of America's most important record labels to ever exist.

But worryingly as well as the huge hole in McGrath Park in Blackrock father of three Gary O’Donovan has also spotted cracks in their home.

Inspectors from Irish Water and the emergency services were on site early Sunday morning.

Mr O’Donovan said: “It’s horrific. We are out of the house there are structural cracks in it. It looks like the water was flowing under the house all night.”

Mr O’Donovan first spotted leaking water on Saturday evening.

“I saw a spring of water started coming down the drive and I found a crack between the footpath and where my drive starts it (water) was bubbling up” he said.

He immediately called Irish Water.

“They came out and had a look” he said.

“They didn’t seem too concerned they were going to get someone to come and take a look at it Monday or Tuesday to pinpoint where they might be a leak.”

It was the next morning when the full extent of the damage started to become clear.

“Half-past six when I woke up I looked out and saw the car in a hole. It collapsed under the car the car is sitting on the sill of it now” he said.

When he looked at their Mahon home he noticed changes to the exterior and then to the interior walls.

I noticed new cracks on the inside of the house and some pre-existing cracks have widened up significantly on the inside and the outside of the house.

Mr O’Donovan a mechanical engineer with Boston Scientific woke his wife and three children.

They left the house but were unable to close the front door after them as the frames and door were warped by the water.

The children — aged 10 seven and five — are now staying at their grandmother’s house nearby.

He rang Irish Water again and contacted Cork Fire Brigade.

When Mr O’Donovan spoke to the Irish Examiner on Sunday morning he and his wife were standing outside their house watching Irish Water inspectors tackling the problem.

A tape cordon was placed around the house blocking entry.

They have told us not to go back in until they get a structural engineer.

""I don’t know who will organise that but we are out at the moment” he said.

Mr O’Donovan said this is not the first time he or his neighbours have faced sinkholes but this is by far the worst incident.

“The road collapsed two and a half or three years ago right outside my house as well it was about three or four feet away from where it is now. They (Irish Water) came out and repaired that” he said.

A neighbour also described this older damage to the Irish Examiner.

Mr O' Donovan said: ""Our neighbours have been great really supportive and helpful to us all day.""

Cork City Fire Brigade said: “Crews are currently in attendance at a burst water main in McGrath Park Mahon. ESB Networks Bord Gais Energy Irish Water and a building inspector are all at the scene.”

They warned people to expect water outages in the area during Sunday.

He said: ""Irish Water working in partnership with Cork City Council is aware of a burst water main in McGrath Park in Mahon Cork.

""Investigations are currently ongoing in relation to potential damage to property and roads in the area.""

A family in the Blackrock area of Cork had a rude awakening this morning to find their car half swallowed by a massive hole in the road outside their home.

The giant sinkhole was opened by a burst water-main on McGrath Park in Blackrock. Emergency services rushed to the scene as the hole opened wider but there are so far no reports of injuries or serious damage to property.

If the deal goes through it would be Blackstone’s biggest bet on China’s real estate market according to Bloomberg.

Blackstone offered HK$5 for each Soho China share — a 31.6 percent premium to the latter firm’s last closing price before trading was suspended on Tuesday. The company is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Shares jumped as much as 26 percent when trading resumed on Thursday. Blackstone’s price works out to about $0.64 per share.

Soho China said in March last year that it was in talks to sell to overseas investors. Blackstone was among those interested but the pandemic put those discussions on hold.

[Bloomberg] — Dennis lynch",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMDYvYmxhY2tyb2NrLWludml0YXRpb24taG91c2VzLWludmVzdG1lbnQtZmlybXMtcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investment firms like Blackrock are buying affordable homes in growing areas.,"The median price of an American house has increased by 28 percent over the last two years as pandemic-driven demand and long-term demographic changes send buyers into crazed bidding wars.

Might the fact that corporate investors snapped up 15 percent of U.S. homes for sale in the first quarter of this year have something to do with it? The Wall Street Journal reported in April that an investment firm won a bidding war to purchase an entire neighborhood worth of single-family homes in Conroe Texas—part of a cycle of stories drumming up panic over Wall Street’s increasing stake in residential real estate. Then came the backlash as cool-headed analysts reassured us that big investors like BlackRock remain insignificant players in the housing market compared with regular old American families.

The truth is between the two: We can panic and acknowledge Wall Street’s small role at the same time. Although the number of houses being purchased by mega-investors is currently not enough to move the market in most parts of the country these firms’ underlying structural advantage is profound and growing.

Let’s focus on Invitation Homes a $21 billion publicly traded company that was spun off from Blackstone the world’s largest private equity company in 2017. Invitation Homes operates in 16 cities with the biggest concentration in Atlanta where it owns 12556 houses. (Though that’s not much compared with the 80000 homes sold in Atlanta each year Invitation Homes bought 90 percent of the homes for sale in some ZIP codes in Atlanta in the early 2010s.) While normal people typically pay a mortgage interest rate between 2 percent and 4 percent these days Invitation Homes can borrow money for far less: It’s getting billion-dollar loans at interest rates around 1.4 percent. In practice this means that Invitation Homes can afford to tack on an extra $5000 to $20000 to the purchase price of every home while getting the house at the same actual cost as a typical homeowner. While Invitation Homes uses a mixture of debt and cash from renters to buy houses its offers are almost always all cash which is a big leg up in a competitive market.

One way to think about Invitation Homes’ business strategy is to consider the value of the properties the firm is buying relative to the rents they charge. According to a recent SEC disclosure Invitation Homes’ portfolio of homes is worth of total of $16 billion (after renovations) and the company collects about $1.9 billion in rent per year. That means it takes only about eight years of rental payments to pay back a typical house that Invitation Homes has bought. The usual rule of thumb for evaluating a fair sale price says Kundan Kishor professor of economics at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee “is that price to rent ratios are around 20 to 1.” When price-to-rent ratios are very high it makes more sense for consumers to rent than to buy and when they are low it makes more sense to buy than to rent. That Invitation Homes is getting deals twice as good as a typical homebuyer shows that it’s not just buying any homes: It’s buying the specific houses with the greatest potential to be wealth-building for the middle class.

It’s not exactly accurate that investors are “buying every single-family house they can find” as some have suggested. If that were true their market share in the United States wouldn’t be a piddling 15 percent. They’re really buying up the stock of relatively inexpensive single-family homes built since the 1970s in growing metro areas. They mostly ignore bigger and more expensive houses especially ones that are move-in ready: Wealthy boomers and the nation’s finance and tech bros nab those properties. And they’re also ignoring cities with stable or shrinking populations like Providence and Pittsburgh.

But investors are depleting the inventory of the precise houses that might otherwise be obtainable for younger working- and middle-class households in the cities where those workers can easily find good-paying jobs like Atlanta (22 percent of home purchases according to Redfin data) Charlotte (22 percent) and Phoenix (20 percent). More importantly they’re able to scour those markets scientifically and systematically to make cash offers on the most attractively priced properties. While normal people buy houses when they actually need to move somewhere (savvy) investors buy houses several years before a bunch of people need to move to an area. Whether they’re tracking where major employers are building new offices or looking at public school enrollment data being ahead of the market gives big firms a big leg up.

And in case you were assuming that converting houses to rentals would flood the market and bring down rents don’t get your hopes up: As Invitation Homes tells its investors “We operate in markets with strong demand drivers high barriers to entry and high rent growth potential.”

While renting might make sense for some people especially people who move a lot it often sucks particularly in the United States where we don’t have especially strong protections for tenants. The business strategy of the country’s biggest landlords Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent does not seem to be “Make renting with us so delightful that if my tenants have to move cities they’ll specifically seek out another property owned by our company.” Based on reports from Reuters the New York Times and the Atlantic it appears to be closer to “Squeeze our tenants for every penny avoid making repairs let black mold and raw sewage accumulate and count on the fact that moving is a huge expensive hassle.”

Our current system of encouraging homeownership is by no means perfect and it places a lot of unnecessary risk onto the “balance sheets” of the middle class but it’s worked out financially for most of the people who have been lucky enough to own a home. The implicit and explicit subsidies the government has given to Americans buying their first homes have been the biggest handout the American middle class has ever received (a handout notably denied to Black Americans for much of the 20th century one explanation for the current size of the racial wealth gap).

Laurie Goodman vice president of housing finance policy at the Urban Institute points out that policymakers could take steps to level the playing field between investors and the rest of us. She told me that buyers who need to borrow money using Federal Housing Administration loans or those who need a rehab loan for a fixer-upper have a particularly tough time competing against Wall Street firms. FHA paperwork often gets delayed slowing down the purchase process so home sellers often don’t want to sell to FHA buyers even if their bids are competitive. That’s a solvable problem. And loans for properties that need renovations Goodman says are both cumbersome and expensive. Rethinking the processes for FHA and rehab loans could “put individuals on a more equal footing” she explained.

If you don’t want all of America’s land and housing to end up in the portfolios of the 1 percent there’s ultimately one very simple solution: Tax the rich. After all the companies buying the houses are ultimately owned by people (or in some cases universities and churches which are their own cans of tax-advantaged rich-people worms). At the same time that the working-class is going hungry rich people are doing so outstandingly well that they are running out of easy places to park their cash which is why they’re buying 2000 square-foot houses in the Phoenix suburbs via their ownership stakes in these funds.

This is all part of a long-standing trend: As inequality in the United States increases the financial elite invests less in the types of things that could create jobs like R&D or new factories and more into directly extracting wealth from the working class. One way to do that? Becoming their landlords.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbG9jYWxwcm92LmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL25vcm1hbi1wLi1sYXJvdWNoZS1kaWVzLWF0LTc20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Norman P.

In 1939 the court in United States v. Miller admitted that private citizens supply their own weapons for militia duty. While the court ruled a sawed-off shotgun has no use under the Second Amendment the court cited William Blackstone’s “Commentaries on the Laws of England” Adam Smith’s “The Wealth of Nations” and Herbert Osgood’s “The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century” as proof that militias are historically the able-bodied male population.

People who want to ban firearms need to stop rewriting the past and just be honest about their real view: an existential case against any gun being in the hands of a private citizen. Sure an AR-15 didn’t exist in 1791 but neither did a bolt action carbine a pump shotgun or a lever action rifle.

Ergo the case he makes against an AR-15 is functionally no different than a case against the aforementioned guns. He ends his column with the classic no-right-is-absolute cliche — could that argument be used against his views someday?

As part of their decisions aviation safety agencies in the US Brazil Canada Australia the UK the European Union and elsewhere have ordered Boeing and airlines to make repairs to a flight control system blamed for the two crashes that led to the ban; update operating manuals; and increase pilot training. China the world's second-largest market for commercial air traffic is still prohibiting the plane from flying however and it hasn't indicated when it'll reverse course.

The beleaguered aircraft was grounded worldwide on March 13 2019 after two crashes one in Indonesia in 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in 2019 that killed a combined total of 346 people. Apart from the human tragedy it was a huge blow to Boeing's business since the company has thousands of 737 Max orders on its books. In addition to the flight control system at the center of both investigations other reports identified concerns with the airliner's flight control computer wiring and engines.

Airlines are now slowly adding the 737 Max back into their schedules. Southwest was the latest carrier to do so when it resumed flights March 11. The plane is now back in service with all US carriers but Boeing will have to work vigorously to retain the trust of airlines and the flying public in regard to the Max family. Here's everything else we know about what's happened with the airliner.

What happened in the two crashes?

In the first crash on Oct. 29 2018 Lion Air flight 610 dove into the Java Sea 13 minutes after takeoff from Jakarta Indonesia killing 189 people. The flight crew made a distress call shortly before losing control. That aircraft was almost brand-new having arrived at Lion Air three months earlier.

The second crash occurred on March 10 2019 when Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 departed Addis Ababa Bole International Airport bound for Nairobi Kenya. Just after takeoff the pilot radioed a distress call and was given immediate clearance to return and land. But before the crew could make it back the aircraft crashed 40 miles from the airport six minutes after it left the runway. Aboard were 149 passengers and eight crew members. The aircraft involved was only four months old.

What caused the crashes?



On Oct. 25 2019 the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee published its final report on the Lion Air crash. The report identifies nine factors that contributed to the crash but largely blames MCAS. Before crashing the Lion Air pilots were unable to determine their true airspeed and altitude and they struggled to take control of the plane as it oscillated for about 10 minutes. Each time they pulled up from a dive MCAS pushed the nose down again.

""The MCAS function was not a fail-safe design and did not include redundancy"" the report said. Investigators also found that MCAS relied on only one sensor which had a fault and flight crews hadn't been adequately trained to use the system. Improper maintenance procedures and the lack of a cockpit warning light (see below question) contributed to the crash as well.

On March 9 2020 almost one year to the day since the crash in Addis Ababa Ethiopia's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau published an interim analysis. Like the Indonesian findings it cites design flaws with MCAS such its reliance on a single angle-of-attack sensor. It also blamed Boeing for providing inadequate training to crew on using the Max's unique systems. (The Seattle Times has a great deep dive on the report.)

Unlike their Indonesian counterparts the Ethiopian investigators do not mention maintenance problems. ""The aircraft has a valid certificate of airworthiness and maintained in accordance with applicable regulations and procedures"" the report said. ""There were no known technical problems before departure.""

Remember that crash investigations are tremendously complex -- it takes months to evaluate the evidence and determine a probable cause. Investigators must examine the debris study the flight recorders and if possible check the victims' bodies to determine the cause of death. They also involve multiple parties including the airline the airplane and engine manufacturers and aviation regulatory agencies.

What is the Boeing 737 Max?



Built to compete with the Airbus A320neo the 737 Max is a family of commercial aircraft that consists of four models. The Max 8 which is the most popular version made its first flight on Jan. 29 2016 and entered passenger service with Malaysia's Malindo Air on May 22 2017. (Malindo no longer flew the plane by the time of the first crash.) Seating between 162 and 210 passengers depending on the configuration it's designed for short- and medium-haul routes but also has the range (3550 nautical miles or about 4085 miles) to fly transatlantic and between the mainland US and Hawaii. The Max 9 first flew in 2017 the Max 7 in March 2018 and the Max 10 on June 18 2021.

The design of the 737 Max series is based on the Boeing 737 an aircraft series that has been in service since 1968. As a whole the 737 family is the best-selling airliner in history. At any given time thousands of some version of it are airborne around the world and some airlines like Southwest and Ryanair have all-737 fleets. If you've flown even occasionally you've most likely flown on a 737.

What's different about the 737 Max series compared with earlier 737s?

The 737 Max can fly farther and carry more people than the previous generation of 737s like the 737-800 and 737-900. It also has improved aerodynamics and a redesigned cabin interior and flies on bigger more powerful and more efficient CFM LEAP engines. CFM is a joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran.

Those engines though required Boeing to make critical design changes. Because they're bigger and because the 737 sits so low to the ground (a deliberate design choice to let it serve small airports with limited ground equipment) Boeing moved the engines slightly forward and raised them higher under the wing. (If you place an engine too close to the ground it can suck in debris while the plane is taxiing.) That change allowed Boeing to accommodate the engines without completely redesigning the 737 fuselage -- a fuselage that hasn't changed much in 50 years.

But the new position of the engines changed how the aircraft handled in the air creating the potential for the nose to pitch up during flight. A pitched nose is a problem in flight -- raise it too high and an aircraft can stall. To keep the nose in trim Boeing designed software called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS. When a sensor on the fuselage detects that the nose is too high MCAS automatically pushes the nose down. (For background on MCAS read these excellent in-depth stories from The Air Current and The Seattle Times.)

When was the Max grounded?



About 30 airlines operated the Max by the time of the second crash (the three largest customers being Southwest Airlines American Airlines and Air Canada). Most of them quickly grounded their planes a few days later. Besides the airlines already mentioned that list includes United Airlines WestJet Aeromexico Aerolíneas Argentinas GOL Linhas Aéreas Turkish Airlines FlyDubai Air China Copa Airlines Norwegian Hainan Airlines Fiji Airways and Royal Air Maroc.

More than 40 countries also banned the 737 Max from flying in their airspace. China (a huge Boeing customer and a fast-growing commercial aviation market) led the way and was joined by Indonesia Thailand Malaysia Australia India Oman the European Union and Singapore. Canada initially hesitated but soon reversed course.

Up until March 13 2019 the FAA also declined to issue a grounding order saying in a statement tweeted the previous day that there was ""no basis to order grounding the aircraft."" That was despite a public outcry from a group of senators and two flight attendant unions. But following President Trump's decision to ground the Max that day the agency cited new evidence it had collected and analyzed.

Older 737 models like the 737-700 737-800 and 737-900 don't use MCAS and weren't affected.

Of the four 737 Max versions only the Max 10 has yet to fly. Boeing

What was the problem with the warning light?

Both the Lion Air and Ethiopian planes lacked a warning light designed to alert pilots to the faulty sensor and that Boeing sold the light as part of an optional package of equipment. When asked about the warning light a Boeing spokesman gave CNET the following statement:

""All Boeing airplanes are certified and delivered to the highest levels of safety consistent with industry standards. Airplanes are delivered with a baseline configuration which includes a standard set of flight deck displays and alerts crew procedures and training materials that meet industry safety norms and most customer requirements. Customers may choose additional options such as alerts and indications to customize their airplanes to support their individual operations or requirements.""

But on April 29 2019 The Wall Street Journal said that even for airlines that had ordered it the warning light wasn't operating on some Max planes that had been delivered (a fact the Indonesian accident report confirmed). Then on June 7 2019 Reps. Peter DeFazio a Democrat from Oregon and Rick Larsen a Democrat from Washington said they'd obtained information suggesting that even though the plane maker knew the safety alert wasn't working it decided to wait until 2020 to implement a fix.

Boeing responded to DeFazio and Larsen in a statement sent to CNET the same day.

""The absence of the AOA Disagree alert did not adversely impact airplane safety or operation"" the statement read. ""Based on the safety review the update was scheduled for the MAX 10 rollout in 2020. We fell short in the implementation of the AoA Disagree alert and are taking steps to address these issues so they do not occur again.""

The original version of the 737 first flew in 1967. Boeing

What kind of MCAS training did 737 Max pilots receive?

Not much which was a factor cited in both crash reports. As the Indonesian report said ""The absence of guidance on MCAS or more detailed use of trim in the flight manuals and in flight crew training made it more difficult for flight crews to properly respond."" Airline pilots are thoroughly trained to fly an aircraft under extraordinary circumstances but they need accurate information about factors like airspeed and altitude to be able to make quick decisions in an emergency.

Though MCAS was a new feature existing 737 pilots didn't have to train on a simulator before they could start flying the Max. Instead they learned about the differences it brought through an hour's worth of iPad-based training. MCAS received scant mention. The reason? It was because Boeing backed by the FAA wanted to minimize the cost and time of certifying pilots who'd already been trained on other 737 versions. To do so Boeing and the FAA treated the Max as just another 737 version rather than a completely new airplane (which it pretty much is).

Pilot complaints about the lack of training emerged quickly after the Lion Air crash. On Nov. 12 2018 The Seattle Times reported that Max pilots from Southwest Airlines were ""kept in the dark"" about MCAS. The Dallas Morning News found similar complaints from American Airlines pilots four months later.

What other issues with the aircraft besides MCAS were identified?

There are a few.

Were any other reports issued?



On Oct. 11 2019 an international flight safety panel issued a Joint Authorities Technical Review that faulted both the FAA and Boeing on several fronts. For the FAA it said the agency needs to modernize its aircraft certification process to account for increasingly complex automated systems.

For Boeing's part the report cited the company's ""inadequate communications"" to the FAA about MCAS pilot training and shortage of technical staff. The review was conducted by representatives from NASA the FAA and civil aviation authorities from Australia Canada China Europe Singapore Japan Brazil Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates.

How did Boeing respond?

Boeing was fully involved with both investigations early on. On Nov. 6 2018 just eight days after the first crash the company issued a safety warning advising 737 Max operators to deactivate MCAS if a flight crew encountered conditions like the Lion Air pilots experienced. It also expressed sympathy for victims' families and pledged $100 million in support and it quickly backed the US grounding order.

""There is no greater priority for our company and our industry"" Boeing said in a March 13 2019 statement. ""We are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again.""

As is common after a crash Boeing didn't comment on preliminary findings of either investigation but the day after the Ethiopian crash the company said it would issue a software update that would include changes to MCAS pilot displays operation manuals and crew training.

Following the Lion Air accident report then CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company was ""addressing"" its safety recommendations. ""We commend Indonesia's KNKT for its extensive efforts to determine the facts of this accident the contributing factors to its cause and recommendations aimed toward our common goal that this never happens again"" he said.

The grounding order also caused Boeing to halt production of the Max for four months in January 2020.

Did Boeing know about Max problems before the crashes?

There is evidence that it did. On Oct. 17 2019 Boeing revealed text messages between two of the company's top pilots sent in 2016 which indicated the company knew about problems with the MCAS system early on. In one of the messages a former chief technical pilot for the Boeing 737 described the MCAS' habit of engaging itself as ""egregious.""

Later that month as he appeared before two congressional committees Muilenburg admitted Boeing knew of the test pilot concerns in early 2019. ""I was involved in the document collection process but I relied on my team to get the documents to the appropriate authorities"" he said. ""I didn't get the details of the conversation until recently.""

Then on Jan. 10 2020 Boeing released a series of explosive emails and instant messages to Congress in which Boeing employees discussed the 737 Max. Though some expressed regret for the company's actions in getting the aircraft certified -- ""I still haven't been forgiven by God for the covering up I did last year"" one employee wrote in 2018 -- others openly discussed the 737 Max's flaws and joked about the FAA's approval process. ""This airplane is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys"" another employee wrote. (The New York Times has compiled the documents online.)

Did Boeing change its leadership?

Yes but it didn't happen quickly. Though Muilenburg apologized to the victims' families in an interview with CBS News in May 2019 he came under sharp criticism for his response to the crashes. On Oct. 11 2019 Boeing announced it had taken away his role as chair so that as CEO Muilenburg could ""focus full time on running the company as it works to return the 737 Max safely to service.""

Muilenburg spent the next two months resisting calls for his resignation from his other position but on Dec. 23 2019 the company announced that he had stepped down. ""The Board of Directors decided a change in leadership was necessary to restore confidence in the company moving forward as it works to repair relationships with regulators customers and all other stakeholders"" Boeing said in a statement. Chairman David Calhoun officially replaced Muilenburg on Jan. 13 2020.

Calhoun had defended Muilenburg before taking the top role but in a March 5 2020 interview with the New York Times he said his predecessor had needlessly rushed production of the Max before the company was ready. ""I'll never be able to judge what motivated Dennis whether it was a stock price that was going to continue to go up and up or whether it was just beating the other guy to the next rate increase.""

Separately on Oct. 22 2019 the company said it replaced Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Kevin McAllister the official overseeing the 737 Max investigation with Stan Deal former president and CEO of Boeing Global Services.

What has the FAA's role been?

Complicated. The agency quickly came under fire on multiple fronts over the crashes. Congress the FBI the Justice Department's criminal division and the Department of Transportation all called for investigations of the FAA's certification process. Under an FAA program Boeing was allowed to participate in the process meaning that it inspected its own plane.

But on Jan. 16 2020 an independent panel set up by the Department of Transportation (the FAA is a division of the DOT) dismissed that criticism. In its report the committee found no significant problems with how the Max was cleared to fly. Though the committee said the FAA could improve the certification process it saw no need for substantial changes.

Those findings were largely echoed by a report from the Department of Transportation inspector general's office on Feb. 24 that made 14 recommendations for revising the FAA's certification program. Though the 55-page report said the FAA didn't deviate from an established protocol when it first cleared the plane to fly in 2016 it significantly misunderstood the MCAS flight control system.

Outside of the certification process the FAA slapped Boeing with two fines for installing substandard or unapproved equipment in some Max planes. With the first fine which the FAA proposed in January 2020 for $5.4 million the agency said Boeing used improper equipment to guide the slats on 178 Max planes. Positioned at the leading edge of each wing slats are deployed at takeoff and landing to provide more lift. The FAA also accused Boeing of installing a guidance system on 173 Max planes that used sensors that hadn't been properly tested. The proposed penalty is $19.68 million.

Has Boeing been subject to other fines?

Yes. After the Department of Justice charged Boeing with conspiring to defraud the FAA the company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement to pay more than $2.5 billion in criminal penalties compensation payments and the establishment of a $500 million beneficiaries fund for the 346 crash victims.

Did Congress get involved?

Yes. In March 2020 the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure released a report on the design development and certification of the 737 Max and the FAA's oversight of Boeing. It said ""acts omissions and errors occurred across multiple stages and areas of the development and certification of the 737 MAX."" The report went on to identify five specific issues.

Production pressures: There was tremendous financial pressure on Boeing and the 737 Max program to compete with the A320neo leading the company to rush the plane into service.

Faulty assumptions: Boeing made fundamentally faulty assumptions about critical technologies on the 737 Max most notably with MCAS.

Culture of concealment: In several critical instances Boeing withheld crucial information from the FAA its customers and 737 Max pilots.

Conflicted representation: The FAA's current oversight structure over Boeing creates inherent conflicts of interest that have jeopardized the safety of the flying public.

Boeing's influence over the FAA's oversight: Multiple career FAA officials documented examples of FAA management overruling the determination of the agency's own technical experts at the behest of Boeing.

On Sept. 16 the House Transportation Committee issued a report that blamed the crashes on a ""horrific culmination"" of failures at Boeing and the FAA. ""In several critical instances Boeing withheld crucial information from the FAA its customers and 737 MAX pilots"" the report said. And as for the FAA ""the fact that a compliant airplane suffered from two deadly crashes in less than five months is clear evidence that the current regulatory system is fundamentally flawed and needs to be repaired.""

Then on Dec. 21 after a Senate report faulted Boeing's and the FAA's initial review of the Max Congress passed legislation that reforms the FAA's protocols for certifying new aircraft. Among other things the bill eliminates some parts of the process that allows manufacturers to certify their own planes and creates new safety review procedures and whistleblower protections.

What happened during the grounding period?

First off Max airlines had to look for parking spaces for the roughly 300 Max aircraft Boeing had delivered by the time the worldwide order went into effect. That's a tremendously complicated effort by itself.

But while airlines can't fly the plane (except to ferry empty aircraft from one airport to another) Boeing was able to conduct test flights for evaluating its proposed fixes.

On May 16 2019 the company said its updates were largely complete after more than 135 test flights. Five months later on Oct. 22 the company said it had made ""significant progress"" toward that goal by adding flight control computer redundancy to MCAS and three additional layers of protection. It also had conducted simulator tests for 445 participants from more than 140 customers and regulators. Boeing provided a further progress report Nov. 11 2019.

Boeing and the FAA finally began the recertification flights on June 29. The flights attempted to trigger the steps that led to the two crashes and confirm that MCAS isn't activating erroneously. The FAA also reviewed pilot training materials and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson piloted the plane on a Sept. 30 test flight to evaluate Boeing's changes. Speaking to reporters after the flight he said he ""liked what I saw.""

When did the FAA lift the grounding order and what are its proposed fixes?

The agency lifted the order on Nov. 19. The mandatory fixes include:

MCAS must compare data from more than one sensor and avoid relying on a single angle-of-attack sensor that's giving faulty readings.

All aircraft must have a warning light that shows when two sensors are disagreeing.

When MCAS activates it must do so only once rather than activating repeatedly (another factor that contributed to both crashes).

If MCAS is erroneously activated flight crews must always be able to counter the movement by pulling back on the control column.

Pilots must get more-rigorous training on MCAS including time in a Max simulator (see next question).

Outside of MCAS the FAA identified other modifications Boeing must make including separating two bundles of wiring that power control surfaces on the aircraft's horizontal stabilizer to ensure redundancy if one of the bundles fails.

Not everyone is trusting in the FAA's decision though. On March 10 relatives of some of the Ethiopian crash victims asked the agency to reverse its decision. In a meeting with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg they also called for several top FAA officials to be removed.

How will pilot training change?

Simulator time focusing on MCAS will now be required a change from a position the FAA previously took. It took lobbying from pilots and regulatory officials from other countries like Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau to change that decision.

They won an influential supporter on June 19 2019 when ""Miracle on the Hudson"" Capt. Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger argued before a congressional committee that simulator training should be required before pilots take the Max back into the air. He also said the original design of MCAS was ""fatally flawed and should never have been approved.""

On Jan. 7 2020 Boeing agreed when it issued a recommendation that pilots receive simulator training on MCAS before the Max returns to service. Simulator sessions will require extra time and expense for airlines struggling to get their Max fleets back in the air.

What happens next?

Before airlines can fly the Max again Boeing must work with them to make the required fixes and retrain pilots. Only then will the FAA sign off on certification for each aircraft. That will take time.

American Airlines resumed flights Dec. 29 with a Max flight between Miami and New York LaGuardia. The airline says it will continue to add Max flights ""with up to 36 departures from our Miami hub depending on the day of the week."" United Airlines resumed flights on Feb. 11 while Southwest Airlines started flying the Max again on March 11. Alaska Airlines a new 737 Max customer began flights March 1.

But that's just in the US. Aviation regulatory agencies around the world also need to approve the fix before they'll let the Max fly to the countries they oversee. Traditionally they've followed the FAA's lead on such matters but Transport Canada China the European Aviation Safety Agency and the UK's Civil Aviation Authority conducted independent tests of the plane on different timelines while working with the FAA.

Brazil's National Civil Aviation Agency lifted its grounding order Nov. 25. Canada followed on Jan. 18 the EU and the UK on Jan. 27 the United Arab Emirates on Feb. 17 Australia on Feb. 26 Fiji on March 31 and Vietnam on April 6.

China is still conducting its review and has not set a timetable for any updates.

How will I know I'm booked on a Max flight and will I be able to change my reservation?

Your aircraft type will be listed in the flight details as you book. Some airlines will spell out the full aircraft name as ""737 Max"" while other carriers may shorten it to ""7M8."" If you're not sure contact a reservations agent to confirm. Just remember though that airlines can change the aircraft type for your flight at the last minute.

For now at least all US airlines operating the Max will allow you to change your flight with penalty or cancel your trip for either a full refund or a travel credit. The exact details will vary and I wouldn't expect the policies to last forever so click the link above and confirm with your airlines as you book.

How important is the Max series to Boeing?

Hugely important. Boeing and Airbus are in a fierce battle for the 150- to 200-seat aircraft market. Following the second crash new orders for the 737 Max slowed dramatically and some carriers canceled or delayed their orders a trend only hastened by the travel slowdown from the coronavirus pandemic.

But Boeing still has almost 4000 737 Max orders on the books and new orders have started to creep up since the lifting of the grounding order. The list of buyers includes Alaska Ryanair United Virgin Australia Air Canada AeroMexico Southwest and Air Astana.

Has a commercial aircraft been grounded before?

Yes. In the most recent example the FAA grounded the Boeing 787 for three months in 2013 after a series of nonfatal battery fires. Before that the FAA grounded the Douglas DC-10 for a month in 1979 after a crash near Chicago O'Hare Airport killed 271 people on board plus two on the ground. (Outside of the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks that remains the deadliest airplane crash on US soil.) The Chicago crash was ultimately attributed to improper maintenance. The crash of a DC-10 in 1974 in France killing 346 people was caused by a design flaw on a cargo hold door latch.

Outside the US both Qantas and Singapore Airlines voluntarily grounded their Airbus A380s for a couple of days after a Qantas flight from Singapore to Sydney in 2010 had an uncontained engine failure.

But the company's reputation has been damaged by crashes involving earlier versions of the MAX plane.

The newest version of Boeing's 737 MAX model airplane took to the skies of the US state of Washington on Friday in an attempt to improve the model's reputation.

The 737 MAX 10's initial flight was about 2.5 hours long taking off from Renton Municipal Airport just south of Seattle and landing at Boeing Field about 7 miles (11 kilometers) away. The flight came after months of testing and safety certification.

""The airplane performed beautifully. The profile we flew allowed us to test the airplane's systems flight controls and handling qualities all of which checked out exactly as we expected” said Chief Pilot Jennifer Henderson in a statement.

American carrier United Airlines has put 100 Boeing 737 MAX 10 planes on order. The new model is expected to enter service in 2023 after more safety tests and inspections.

Boeing's new airplane can carry up to 230 passengers and is longer than previous models of the 737 MAX. However it has a lower flying range than earlier versions only being able to travel about 3300 nautical miles (3800 miles 6100 kilometers).

Sparse crowd still hurt by crashes

The first flight was witnessed by dozens of Boeing employees but almost no outside visitors as Boeing downplayed the event.

The 737 MAX model came under intense criticism after two crashes involving the MAX 8 killed 346 people. The crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 in October 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March 2019 both involved 737 MAX 8 planes that were in service for just a few months.

They both crashed minutes after takeoff and both deadly incidents were induced by several design flaws including the faulty Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) safety system on the 737 MAX 8. The MCAS forced the airplane's nose down during takeoff on both flights due to a faulty reading.

Boeing 737 MAX planes were grounded worldwide just days after the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Boeing's reputation and pocketbook were hit after several orders for MAX planes were canceled. Boeing paid millions of dollars in compensation to the families of the victims on the ill-fated flights. The company posted an $8.4 billion (€7.1 billion) loss last year due to the reduced demand for planes and the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company was also forced to pay billions of dollars in fines to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) earlier this year for defrauding regulators.

Boeing's 737 MAX 8 model was grounded until November 2020 when US regulators allowed the jet to resume service. Most other aviation bodies followed suit. American carriers Southwest Airlines and American Airlines as well as Iceland flag carrier Icelandair and European discount airline Ryanair all use Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes.

Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal said Boeing was working on safety enhancements for the 737 MAX 10.

""We're going to take our time on this certification” said Deal.

kbd/sms (AFP AP Reuters)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvZGVsdGEtNzM3LTc1Ny1uZXcteW9yay1zZWF0dGxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comparing Delta's 737-900ER and 757 on New York-Seattle,"If I were to tally up all of my flights over the years New York-Seattle probably tops the list of routes I’ve flown the most. It’s a rather long domestic flight with varying levels of competition and an on-again off-again flirtation with premium transcontinental services.

I often book Delta on this route as it tends to operate intentionally equipped aircraft with an elevated level of service but on my most recent trip I booked a screaming JetBlue fare in its Mint-configured A321 only to see it downgraded to an unrefurbished A320. I canceled and rebooked on Delta with a 737-900ER and A330-900neo scheduled for the roundtrip though the A330 was quickly swapped out for a 757-200ER on the return.

I have written in the past about how I prefer to fly Delta due to its incredible levels of product consistency and operational reliability but in a COVID-ravaged world things are a bit different and a whole lot less predictable.

My morning 737-900ER flight from JFK to Seattle was delayed by 30 minutes the night before departure an indication that adverse weather in New York was stretching Delta’s crew availability thin. This likely would not have been as noticeable pre-COVID as Delta would have been much more likely to assign a new crew member to the flight and get out on time. The same flight was delayed more than four hours the prior day so at least I dodged that bullet. (My return flight was also delayed more than half an hour due to a late loading of bags and freight.)

The interiors of the 737-900ER and 757-200ER are strikingly similar to each other despite the 14-year age difference with the 737 sporting some visible updates such as more modern passenger service units and overhead bins.

Hand sanitizer offered outside the lav on both aircraft was a nice touch.

By and large both the 737 and 757 aircraft provide extremely comparable experiences. My seat in the Comfort+ economy class section provided me with ample legroom on both flights. And both offered the same Panasonic Eco Series 9-inch IFE monitors with abundant video content and about a dozen live TV channels.

Both aircraft featured two AC power outlets per set of three seats in addition to the low-power USB port in each IFE monitor.

One noticeable difference between the two aircraft is the inflight Wi-Fi system.

While both offer satellite-supported connectivity from Intelsat branded as Gogo the 737-900ER is outfitted with the newer 2Ku system while the 757 features the older traditional Ku-band system. The former facilitates streaming video onboard while the latter does not (the antenna hump atop the aircraft is higher with traditional Ku).

Using my one hour of free Wi-Fi provided by T-Mobile netted quite a better experience on the 737 with regular Ku on the 757 struggling to keep up with basic tasks such as browsing and social media.

On the 737 one could avail of Wi-Fi by the hour or for the full flight. A one-hour browse pass cost $6 while a full-flight browse pass came in at $20. The one-hour stream pass started at $10.

By comparison the traditional Ku-band system on the 757 offered a half-hour browse pass for $11 while the full-flight pass was an unreasonable $40.

Both the 737-900ER and the 757 aircraft are slated to be upgraded to Viasat-powered Ka-band Wi-Fi by the end of 2021. This will be the fourth Wi-Fi upgrade for each type as they previously offered Gogo’s air-to-ground ATG-4 system and prior to that the legacy ATG solution.

The soft product on select Delta transcon flights is typically an outstanding value-add but things are different in a COVID world. Prior to the pandemic Delta offered a complimentary meal to all passengers on select transcon flights including JFK to Seattle.

The meal offered was typically in my opinion better than most buy-on-board options offered by most airlines. Unfortunately these meals and most inflight services became a victim of COVID.

The near six-hour flight to Seattle only offered a choice of a small energy bar and a bag of mini pretzels.

A limited beverage selection was also available including free alcoholic beverages for Comfort+ passengers who knew it was a benefit of that seat (menus were not on offer).

I bought a sandwich from a local deli on the way to JFK and ate it onboard a move I typically frown upon. With these limited services on long flights however I felt I had to do it.

The return flight to JFK occurred on the first day of the resumption of full meal service in First Class/Delta One on select transcon routes including JFK and Seattle.

Back in Comfort+ and Main Cabin though not much had changed.

The limited selection is now served from a basket rather than an aisle cart and Flight Fuel snack boxes have made a return for purchase.

There is however still no option to purchase fresh food nor has Delta brought back the complimentary meal for economy passengers. It would be nice if Delta loaded its menu onto the IFE system so passengers could know their full options before the flight attendants get to their row.

It’s surprising to me that Delta has lagged rather than led the pack in the resumption of certain soft product offerings. If travel is truly back as the airlines tell us at least domestically in the US the services offered before COVID should be back as well.

The largest member of the 737 MAX family the MAX 10 is designed to compete with the Airbus A321neo in the anticipated highly competitive post-COVID-19 aerospace market and in the wake of the 737 MAX groundings after two fatal air crashes in 2018 and 2019.

The aircraft took to the air from Renton Field in Renton Washington on June 18 at 10:07 am EDT with 737 Chief Pilot Captain Jennifer Henderson at the controls before making its way to Boeing Field in Seattle where it landed at 12:38 pm. The successful first flight of the MAX 10 marks the beginning of a comprehensive test program leading up to the certification of the aircraft by regulators before entering service in 2023.

Boeing's 737 MAX 10 comes into land after its maiden flight Boeing

Based on the 737 MAX 9 the MAX 10 is a stretched version of its predecessor retaining many of its features which includes the wing though there is a new undercarriage. The MAX 10 generates 14 percent lower carbon emissions and 50 percent less noise than the current Next-Generation 737.

The MAX 10 is claimed to have the lowest seat-mile cost of any production single-aisle airplane. It comes in two-class variants seating 188 to 204 passengers but its length of 43.8 m (143.6 ft) allows it to carry up to 230. In addition it has a range of 3300 nm (6110 km) thanks to its twin LEAP-1B from CFM International engines.

""The airplane performed beautifully"" said Henderson after the flight. ""The profile we flew allowed us to test the airplane's systems flight controls and handling qualities – all of which checked out exactly as we expected.""

So is it just a cheap Volvo XC90?,"On the night of 19th June Lynk & Co officially released its flagship model 09 in Shanghai. The new car is positioned as a mid-size SUV. Following models 01 – 07 Lynk & Co 09 is the automaker’s biggest car. It is based on Volvo’s SPA platform – the same that underpins the Volvo XC90 II (also a mid-size SUV) several other Volvo cars and Polestar 1. Chinese automaker Geely owns all these brands.

Lynk & Co will manufacture the new flagship model in the Meishu plan in Ningbo. The design has some typical signs of the Lynk & Co signature. The front has the same frog-eye lights as other Lynk & Co’s but below that sits a very impressive grille with large vertical bars. This part of the design is unlike any other Lynk & Co. The rear features a horizontal setup of taillights and four exhausts for a sporty look.

- Advertisement -

The size is 5042/1977/1780mm and the wheelbase is 2984mm. From the release event pictures we can confirm it will be a 7 seater. About the interior it looks similar to Lynk & Co 5. It has 6 LCD screens including a 12″ + 6″ control panel screen and a 12.8″ infotainment screen and a 12.3″ panel screen.

I know you are all interested in powertrain specs. When the car was announced at Shanghai Auto Show two months ago it was reported it would come only as a PHEV. However during the official release today we learned there would be three versions:

- Advertisement -

Mild hybrid (2.0T+8AT 48V) It’s actually not a hybrid. It’s more a fancy name for a classic petrol car which can switch the engine on/off anytime. Yes it has some recuperation and the 48V battery can sometimes help the ICE with some power. Maybe. It is the most common solution with new cars.

Hybrid An electric motor can help petrol engine. A battery can be charged only by regeneration when breaking and by ICE (Internal Combustion Engine).

PHEV (plug-in hybrid) The electric engine helps ICE. The owner can charge the battery by plugging it into electricity.



Same with all other cars based on the SPA platform the engine is 2.0T. It should have 252 – 431 hp based on configuration and all variants are four-wheel driven. Lynk & Co American partner BorgWarner supplies this AWD. All versions will also have eight-speed Aisin 8AT automatic transmission.

Most of the Lynk & Co older models are based on Volvo’s CMA platform. Also Volvo plans to leave its SPA platform for the new SPA2 which should feature the Nvidia AI chip and be released in 2022. Guess what car will be the first to have it? Yes next-generation Volvo XC90! What is essential for us – the SPA platform would probably be left for Lynk & Co and we will see more cars with it.

So how about the price?

Lynk & Co 01 cost in China 180 000 – 202 000 yuan (28 000 -31 000 USD). The Volvo XC40 with the same platform is 287 000 – 386 000 yuan (44 000 – 60 000 USD). In general Lynk & Co cars are about 60% price of their Swedish counterpart.

Volvo XC90 which is the same medium SUV and Lynk & Co 09 the fuel version costs 639 000 – 782 000 yuan (99 000 – 121 000 USD) PHEV version is up to 895 000 yuan (140 000 USD). However XC90 is not domestically produced so it’s impossible to apply the directly previous rule. Let’s pretend XC90 is made in China for a moment. Then the price would be 100 000 yuan (15 000 USD) reduced. That would make Lynk & Co 09 estimated cost starting 300 000 yuan (46 000 USD).

I like the car; it looks promising. Hopefully it will be more difficult to call it cheap XC90 despite it shares lots of technology (unlike Geely Xingurui – Preface which was nicknamed small Volvo S60).

Lynk & Co plans an official launch in Q4 2021. We will closely watch the news about details. Lynk & Co is famous for its Chinese pricing and Volvo’s safety making this car an attractive bargain. Also looking forward to when Lynk & Co will update us with some news on its European expansion plans which they announced last year.

The existing brick structure will be replaced by a six-story mixed-use project giving a small office space in the city. Handel Architects is responsible for the eye-catching design.

The San Francisco-based Urban Land Development LLC is responsible for the development. The developer website lists that construction is expected to begin this Fall. Once demolition begins the job is projected to last 16 months until the building can open.

The 65-foot proposal will yield 49290 square feet of which 46390 square feet is for office use and 2900 square feet for retail and services. 2780 square feet of usable open space will be opened on-site as well primarily from the roof deck with views of the skyline. There will be a large retail spot along Bryant Street as well as micro-retail spaces facing Zoe Street to provide smaller business spaces.

The design by Handel Architects contrasts darkened patina metal panels running along the podium with reflective brushed metal panels and mullions framing floor-to-ceiling windows. A screen of projecting vertical fins will serve as a design motif giving a visual prominence to the entrance lobby and retail space.

The lot sold in 2016 for $7 million with the city assessor currently valuing the land at $6.3 million and the soon-to-be-demolished structure at $1.1 million. Demolition is expected to cost $120000 with construction costing an estimated $14 million.

The property is located between 3rd and 4th Street nearby the I-80 freeway slicing the industrial neighborhood apart from the Central Business District. 531 Bryant Street will find itself a block away from 725-777 Harrison Street a proposed 15-story red and grey office and housing proposal designed by HOK and developed by Boston Properties.

These four charts show the damage inflicted,"It is also a growing contributor to the already perilous climate problem. And in New England’s heat wave early this month — five days of 90 degree-plus heat the longest June heat wave in nearly a century — peak electricity demand from air conditioning put 36 million extra pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

When smothering heat and humidity overtake the cool of spring a familiar quest for relief begins usually a trek to the basement or attic to dig out the window unit that’s been dormant all winter or flipping on the central air. It brings welcome sometimes lifesaving cool.

That’s 3551 cars driving for a year.

Or 18 million pounds of coal burned.

The eye-popping numbers are not necessarily unexpected but they highlight an alarming phenomenon at work as climate change makes periods of extreme heat more common and prolonged: The warming climate is leading us into a dangerous vicious cycle.

“Climate change is driving more and hotter heat waves which is forcing us to use our A/C units more which is driving up emissions and causing more climate change and so on and so forth perpetuating itself” said Joseph Daniel senior energy analyst with the Climate & Energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

As long as the electrical grid powering those air conditioners draws from predominantly fossil fuels it’s a trend that will continue. The state is working to power the grid with more renewable energy but even under a best-case scenario it is expected to take decades to completely transform it.

Meanwhile the increased need for air conditioning during periods of intense heat will continue setting off a chain of other effects compounding the impact of heat itself on public health air quality and a host of other effects. And those problems are likely to grow around the world and in New England. By the end of the century experts say Massachusetts could see between 13 and 56 days of extreme heat each year up from an average of four between 1971 and 2000.

For a snapshot of the issues that extreme heat present locally the Globe compiled data that offer a vivid look at how the heat wave of June 5-June 9 affected our city state and region.

Air conditioning famously chews through massive amounts of electricity; According to data from grid overseer ISO-New England by June 8 the fourth day of the heat wave when temps reached 95 degrees peak electricity demand soared some 66 percent over average daily use in the previous two months most all of it likely attributable to air conditioning.

That’s not to say we can simply give up air conditioning.

“Saving lives today in an increasingly heat-stressed world is of paramount importance” said Martin Hoerling a research meteorologist in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association’s Physical Sciences Laboratory in Boulder Colo. “I would feel that folks shouldn’t be making a ‘Sophie’s Choice’ between surviving heat waves while also wanting to secure a more habitable future world.”

From 2009 to 2015 the number of households in New England reporting they used air conditioning jumped nearly 7 percent from 3.9 million to 4.2 million households according to the most recent data from the Energy Information Administration.

Those sales spike especially during heat waves.

“This year we have invested in a sizable inventory of air conditioners and have seen demand peak much earlier than in past years” as heat waves arrive earlier than usual said Paul Conforti the chief marketing officer for Ocean State Job Lot.

All of that excess energy demand means more carbon emissions and more climate warming. On the hottest days energy suppliers fire up what are called “peaker plants” said Daniel of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “These are by definition the most expensive power plants on the grid and they’re really only ever needed when energy demand peaks” he said. “They tend to be older and dirtier.”

A 2020 report by the policy institute PSE Energy Health found that Massachusetts’ high-demand days are covered by 23 oil- and gas-fired peaker plants and peaking units at larger plants including the oil-fired Canal plant in Sandwich and two oil-fired plants in Everett.

The report found that one-third of the state’s peaker plants have more than 100000 people living within a three mile radius and six of the facilities are in designated environmental justice areas meaning communities where at least 25 percent of the population reports as non-white non-English speaking and/or with a median income less than 65 percent of the statewide median.

These are also the areas most likely to feel the worst health impacts of a heat wave.

As air conditioners blast cool air inside a home they can also contribute to an increase in emissions of particulate matter from the extra power plants needed to drive them which reacts in the atmosphere and forms smog and an increase in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides which can cause respiratory problems.

Across Massachusetts as the temperature rose air quality declined. Air monitors all over the state marked a change from good to moderate air quality as the heat wave settled in according to EPA data.

And across the city calls to Boston Emergency Medical Services rose. On Monday June 7 EMS saw a 44 percent increase in call volume over what it typically sees.

Experts say there are a host of negative health impacts that can be triggered by heat waves including respiratory problems heat exhaustion heart attacks strokes kidney problems and more.

As with all heat waves this one ended. As the temperature dropped so did energy demand. The air across Massachusetts cleared. But the city and the state are preparing for more days like this partially via plans to develop more clean energy and tackle climate change.

Late last year the state released its 2030 Clean Energy and Climate Plan which includes the goal of moving from the current 400000 homes heating and cooling with electricity to at least 1 million homes by 2030. Successfully hitting that mark — while increasingly replacing fossil fuel power sources in the grid with renewables — will be a big step in achieving the state’s larger goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Heat pumps run off electricity using the refrigeration cycle to heat and cool by transferring thermal energy from a cooler space to a warmer space. They are far more efficient than window air conditioner units and central A/C but the only way that heat pumps offer real climate savings is if they are powered by electricity created from clean sources of energy.

The state is also working on developing Clean Peak Energy Standard guidelines which will gradually see peaker plants taken off line.

As the state develops more clean energy resources gains in solar energy could also help meet the demands of increased heat waves. “The good news is that air conditioner demand — which is the primary driver for increased electricity demand — and solar output are strongly correlated” said Daniel of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It’s not perfect but we could certainly avoid the over-reliance of many of the dirtiest and least efficient power plants by building more solar and by pairing that solar with storage.”

As the Irish Examiner reports worryingly as well as the hole in McGrath Park in Blackrock father of three Gary O’Donovan has also spotted cracks in his home.

Inspectors from Irish Water and the emergency services were on site early Sunday morning.

Mr O’Donovan said: “It’s horrific. We are out of the house there are structural cracks in it. It looks like the water was flowing under the house all night.”

He first spotted leaking water on Saturday evening. “I saw a spring of water started coming down the drive and I found a crack between the footpath and where my drive starts it (water) was bubbling up” he said.

He immediately called Irish Water. “They came out and had a look” he added.

Extent of the damage

“They didn’t seem too concerned they were going to get someone to come and take a look at it Monday or Tuesday to pinpoint where they might be a leak.”

It was the next morning when the full extent of the damage started to become clear.

“Half-past six when I woke up I looked out and saw the car in a hole. It collapsed under the car the car is sitting on the sill of it now” he said.

When he looked at their Mahon home he noticed changes to the exterior and then to the interior walls.

I noticed new cracks on the inside of the house and some pre-existing cracks have widened up significantly on the inside and the outside of the house.

Mr O’Donovan a mechanical engineer with Boston Scientific woke his wife and three children.

They left the house but were unable to close the front door after them as the frames and door were warped by the water.

He rang Irish Water again and contacted Cork Fire Brigade.",,,,,,

The move by Miami-based NextSource Biotechnology means the drug Gleostine no longer qualifies for Medicare Part D drug assistance meaning there is one fewer option of a handful of approved chemotherapies.

""There are lots of people right now who are not getting the drug"" and some will likely die as a result Henry S. Friedman a neuro-oncologist and professor of neurosurgery at Duke University School of Medicine told CBS MoneyWatch. ""There are patients who can't afford the drug and other drugs may not be as effective.""

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or CMS confirmed NextSource had withdrawn from the Medicaid drug rebate program meaning states cannot receive federal funding reimbursement for Gleostine. However states can still pay for the drug with their own funds with each state's Medicaid program making those coverage decisions.

Used to treat a tumor known as glioblastoma and other brain cancers Gleostine's patent has lapsed but there is no generic version.

""The decision by the company to withdraw from public health insurance programs weakens the safety net for vulnerable brain cancer patients who already have few treatment options. Lomustine (brand name: Gleostine ) is a medically-necessary part of the standard of care for patients with the most aggressive tumors and is also essential in many clinical trials"" stated David Arons CEO of the National Brain Tumor Society.

""We urge Nextsource to rejoin these programs and help reduce barriers for patients who require access to this therapy as well as for researchers and clinical trial participants participating in critical ongoing brain cancer studies"" Arons continued.

The company had previously jacked up the price of Gleostine an off-patent drug formerly known as lomustine that first came out more than four decades ago to treat brain tumors and Hodgkin lymphoma. It was marketed under the brand name CeeNu by Bristol-Myers Squibb or BMS which sold the product to NextSource in 2013.

""Lomustine is one of only three FDA-approved chemotherapies for patients with glioblastoma and the one that most patients receive when their tumor progresses on first line temozolomide chemotherapy. The median age for patients with glioblastoma is 65 meaning the decision to no longer participate in the Medicare program affects half of the glioblastoma population"" Dr. Patrick Wen director of the Center for Neuro-Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston said in emailed comments.

""The only other treatment is avastin. Lomustine is also the standard-of-care treatment used in the control arm of most recurrent glioblastoma clinical trials and not having easy access to this drug has an important impact on research to find better treatments for this devastating cancer"" the physician added.

""It cost $50 per capsule since BMS sold it"" David Vanness a professor of health policy and administration at Pennsylvania State University tweeted on Thursday. ""This is a drug from 1976.""

Headline distracts from the main story which is that NextSource withdrew from Medicare's discount program after having raised Gleostine's price. It cost $50 per capsule when BMS sold it in 2013. This is a drug from 1976. https://t.co/CSbiGbRnbg — Dave Vanness (@djvanness) June 17 2021

These days a capsule can run as much as a grand a pop after multiple price increases by NextSource.

NextSource did not respond to a request for comment from CBS MoneyWatch. It told the Wall Street Journal which first reported it had pulled out of the Medicare Part D program that it was reviewing its participation in various programs.

However NextSource posted a statement on its website about its price increases citing product development costs regulatory agency fees and the benefit the treatment offers to patients as among the underlying factors.

Friedman however dismissed the explanation. ""It's all greed. Why do you take a drug for which you do no research and development and raise the price 1400%? All they did was rebrand it a drug that was out there forever"" Friedman said.

Other companies including Turing Pharmaceuticals and Valeant Pharmaceuticals have significantly raised prices after buying drugs that had been on the market for years.",,,,,,,,,

BRO,Brown & Brown,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNibmF0aW9uLmNvbS9nb2xmLzIwMjQvNS85LzI0MTUzMDcwL3BnYS10b3VyLW5ld3MtYmxhZGVzLWJyb3duLWRlYnV0LW15cnRsZS1iZWFjaC1jbGFzc2lj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blades Brown 16 makes PGA Tour debut in style at Myrtle Beach Classic,"The future is already here.

For the second straight week a teenager has made their PGA Tour debut.

Like 16-year-old Kris Kim at last week’s CJ Cup Byron Nelson Blades Brown is teeing up at this week’s Myrtle Beach Classic.

Brown who became the youngest stroke-play medalist in U.S. Amateur history last year opened with a 1-over 72 on Thursday.

“Oh my goodness it was so much fun” Brown said after his round.

“This course has some teeth to it. I’m not 100 percent used to that yet but I feel like the experience I’m getting this week is—like you can’t pay for this.”

The Dunes Golf and Beach Club is hosting this Opposite Field event held the same week as the Wells Fargo Championship the Signature Event that now features an elite 68-player field thanks to Hideki Matsuyama’s withdrawal.

That should not take away from the talent within the Myrtle Beach field which includes Ryder Cup star Robert MacIntyre Joel Dahmen and Beau Hossler who leads at 7-under after round one.

“I was so pumped to hear that I was playing in a PGA Tour event” Brown added.

“The nerves didn’t really set in until I got here. I started seeing all the grandstands and everything. But then I started to get settled in hit a few balls muscle memory started to take over and I can’t thank the Myrtle Beach Classic for giving me this opportunity.”

Brown admitted to having some nerves over the first couple of holes and who could blame him? He has never competed on a stage like this before.

“First tee I was shaking a little bit but I decided to—instead of thinking about it as nervousness think about it as excitement” Brown said.

“But yeah it was a lot of fun... I’d say about hole three or so is when I got going.”

The 16-year-old opened with five straight pars before sticking it to nine feet on the par-3 6th where he made his first birdie. But his first PGA Tour round was defined by a mix of birdies and bogies teetering on the brink of par throughout the round.

In all he made five birdies to six bogies—two of which came on the 17th and 18th holes a disappointing finish to a dream-fulfilling day.

“This course is hard” Brown assessed.

“I [need to] tighten it up around the edges but overall I feel solid about my game. It’s really close but I’m excited for [Friday’s second round].”

He will need to go low to follow Kim’s lead and become the second teenager in as many weeks to make a cut on the PGA Tour. But Brown has an idea of what he needs to do on Friday.

“Just course management stuff like that” Brown added.

“My job is just to hit the ball straight and you can’t learn enough from hanging around these guys. Smack talk as well. That’s there too. But just where to hit it off the tee and where to hit it on the greens... I just need to tighten up on a few things but I feel like this is where I belong.”

Tina Kotek didn’t have the authority to send a woman who completed her sentence one year ago back to prison and ordered the woman’s immediate release.

Terri Lee Brown was charged in 2016 with two counts of mail theft. On April 20 2017 she was sentenced to two and half years in prison followed by two years of post-prison supervision. On Dec. 23 2020 she was released from prison early after then-Gov. Kate Brown granted her a commutation. By February 2023 the state sent her a certificate saying she had fulfilled all the obligations of her sentence.

Despite that Kotek revoked that commutation in December 2023.

The state Supreme Court said in its ruling that Kotek had gone too far.

The justices wrote that Terri Lee Brown’s “imprisonment is unlawful” after Kotek revoked her commutation late last year. Police in Josephine County arrested Brown on Feb. 17 and after five days in jail transferred her to the Coffee Creek Correctional Facility in Wilsonville.

“Terri Lee Brown was released from Coffee Creek Correctional Facility at 3:25 pm today” Amber Campbell a spokesperson for the Oregon Department of Corrections wrote in an email Wednesday.

Commutation refers to the governor’s power to change a convicted person’s sentence. During the COVID-19 pandemic Gov. Brown granted commutations to thousands of people in Oregon’s prisons in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.

The case leaves some questions unanswered including how Brown 48 was sent back to prison even though her sentence had been completed for an entire year before she was again arrested. The factors that led to a warrant for her arrest are also unclear according to attorneys with the Oregon Justice Resource Center which helped Brown win the habeas corpus petition.

The state’s highest court moved quickly issuing its opinion less than one week after hearing oral arguments in the case.

The governor’s office was represented by attorneys with the Oregon Department of Justice.

“The governor’s plenary clemency power includes the power of the governor to revoke a conditional commutation after the time the original sentence has expired and order that person’s arrest and return to prison at any time” Assistant Attorney General Kirsten Naito argued to the justices.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

Not even 30 seconds into her arguments Supreme Court Associate Justice Bronson James asked Naito to clarify what he called a “pretty absolutist” position.

“I think I just heard the answer but I really want to clarify it” James asked. “Is it the position of Gov. Kotek that she has the authority to revoke a commutation at any time in the future and subsequent governors would continue to have that authority to revoke a commutation at any time in the future for the entire life of Ms. Brown?”

Naito said yes. “That is correct” she added.

The court disagreed.

“The Governor respects the court’s decision and will take this ruling under advisement in the future” Elisabeth Shepard the governor’s press secretary wrote in an email late Wednesday. “The office is not aware of any other similar cases under review.”

During the past year Kotek has revoked numerous commutations — part of former Gov. Brown’s legacy — at the request of local district attorneys.

It’s not clear what prompted Kotek’s office to review and ultimately for the governor to revoke Terri Lee Brown’s commutation years later. One possibility is that in May 2021 Brown pleaded no contest to violating her post-prison supervision. She was sent to jail for 30 days. But since then she’s had no issue complying with her post-prison supervision her lawyers said.

Leading up to her arrest and imprisonment earlier this year Brown was doing well according to court documents filed by her attorneys.

“For over two years she had been providing in-home healthcare” Julia Yoshimoto Brown’s attorney wrote in court documents. “She cared for approximately 12 individuals during that time including for over a year the former deputy chief of police for the Medford Police Department. In the evenings [Brown] worked as an auditor for Holiday Inn. [She] was also in her third semester at Rogue Community College working towards her associate degree in business science.”

In its decision the Oregon Supreme Court said that for the most part “violation proceedings must be initiated while the offender is under supervision (i.e. before the offender’s sentence has expired) and not after the term of supervision has ended and the offender is no longer subject to any sentence.”

Justices went on to explain that even though the commutation agreement with Brown stated the governor could revoke it “there is no indication that the authority to revoke would survive the expiration of plaintiff’s sentence.”

In other words Brown had completed her sentence by the time Kotek decided to order her back into custody.

“For the reasons explained in this opinion we conclude that because plaintiff had finished serving all of her sentences when the Governor revoked the conditional commutation the Governor lacked authority under the terms of the commutation to issue the revocation” the justices wrote.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9yc3BvcnQuY29tL2YxL25ld3MvdmVyc3RhcHBlbi1icm93bi10cnlpbmctdG8tc3Rpci10aGluZ3MtdXAtd2l0aC1uZXdleS1yZWQtYnVsbC1mMS1jb21tZW50LzEwNjA4NjU2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Verstappen: Brown trying to ""stir things up"" with Newey/Red Bull F1 comment","Brown stated that he had seen an increase in applications from those currently employed by Red Bull in the wake of the allegations and power struggle surrounding both team principal Christian Horner and between the Austrian and Thai shareholders of the parent Red Bull company

Horner refuted those comments stating that it was ""inevitable"" that other teams wished to capitalise on the situation.

Verstappen agreed with his team principal noting that Red Bull's successes had made many of its staff targets for other teams seeking to improve their own fortunes in F1.

""He obviously wants to stir things up. For us as a team we can't do anything with comments like that"" Verstappen said.

""From his point of view I understand it of course because everyone is trying to attract our people and that is completely normal in the world of Formula 1 as well.

""But I'm not really interested in those things either. I see the headlines but I don't even click on them.""

Verstappen added that many of Red Bull's key staff were subject to long-term contracts with the Milton Keynes squad although admitted that there were ""human aspects"" that had to be taken into account.

The Dutch driver is contracted to Red Bull until the end of 2028 but has been targeted by Mercedes as a potential replacement for the Ferrari-bound Lewis Hamilton in the event that Verstappen becomes dissatisfied at Red Bull.

He felt that he was in a similar position to those at Red Bull bound by long-term deals and that those contracts were not a ""100 per cent"" guarantee that people would stay on if they were not happy.

""In life you can never guarantee everything. It's also possible that I won't wake up tomorrow morning so in the end you never know things 100 percent for sure in life anyway.

Or more accurately rose-colored glass flecked with jarringly out-of-place blue squares.

Walking along the Boardwalk in Atlantic City he looked up at the glass-encased tower of what once was the hottest and most successful casino in the seaside gambling resort. What he saw annoyed him greatly everywhere a broken window had once been.

""I said 'That's it"" recalled Juliano an executive with the casino's new owners a Rhode Island based company that used to be called Twin River but has since adopted the Bally's name for the entire company. ""By the middle of July every window in that grand iconic hotel tower that was fixed in a blue color will be rose. It's symbolic of what we intend to do. Under this leadership this place will sparkle.""

What Bally's intends to do is nothing short of bringing a comatose casino back to life in perhaps the most cutthroat gambling market in America. Bally's for years had been a lesser priority of former owners Caesars Entertainment which lavished attention and reinvestment cash on two higher-profile Atlantic City casinos Harrah's and Caesars.

As its resources declined so did its performance. Last year which saw casinos closed for 3½ months due to the coronavirus pandemic Bally's finished dead last among Atlantic City's nine casinos in terms of the amount of money won from gamblers. Things were almost as bleak in 2019 before the pandemic hit as Bally's barely avoided finishing last.

[CORONAVIRUS: Click here for our complete coverage » arkansasonline.com/coronavirus]

As far back as 2014 when Caesars Entertainment closed the Showboat and the Atlantic Club amid a severe slowdown that saw four casinos go belly-up then-Chairman Gary Loveman none-too-subtly indicated that Bally's was in danger of meeting a similar end telling The Associated Press ""We need to make money there.""

As it turned out Bally's outlasted Loveman but was trapped in a downward spiral.

Enter Providence R.I.-based Twin River Worldwide Holdings which was a smaller regional casino company in April 2020 when it bought Bally's for $25 million along with casinos in Shreveport and Lake Tahoe Nevada.

The company later bought the Bally's name and embarked on a buying spree of gambling technology and content companies in its quest to become a perfectly integrated mix of in-person and online gambling and entertainment. The company owns 14 casinos with acquisitions in Las Vegas and Pennsylvania awaiting approval by regulators.

Bally's Atlantic City is a big part of those plans. Last November it promised New Jersey gambling regulators it would invest at least $90 million into the casino-hotel over the next five years.

""Things were in bad shape"" said Juliano an Atlantic City native who is the company's executive vice president of casino operations and chief marketing officer. ""We have a mission to bring this place up to the standard we have set for ourselves wherever we operate. We are extremely confident we will bring this property back to a respectable place.""

Jane Bokunewicz coordinator of a gambling and tourism institute at Stockton University said Bally's has an opportunity to reintroduce itself to a market that has known it since 1979.

""Like any newly opened property Bally's will benefit from public curiosity about what is new and different"" she said. ""Customers will be eager to see what has changed under the new ownership.""

As for challenges Bokunewicz said Bally's ""will need to get up to speed quickly regarding online casino and sports betting offerings if they want to keep up with their neighbors.""

Early priorities include a renovation of the casino floor new slot machines and table games.

A walk through the casino last week saw electricians working on long strands of wiring handymen removing outdated signs from walls and old slot machine stools sitting in a soon-to-be discarded pile. Workers with spray bottles and wipes seemed to be everywhere.

The company is adding restaurants including a well-received Italian eatery that opened a few weeks ago. And its complete inventory of more than 1200 hotel rooms will be redone as well. A FanDuel-branded sports book opened last winter.

And Juliano promises entertainment will return in a bigger way to Bally's including a July 3 Motown review in its 1200-seat ballroom as well as live music on the sand at its popular beach bar.

We had our first gander at the MSG Sphere at The Venetian on Thursday morning a 360-degree tour in 110-degree heat. The hype is merited so far with this venue.

The Sphere is in fact dizzying.

Having taken construction tours of the Colosseum at Caesars Palace the Smith Center the upgraded Joint T-Mobile Arena and Park Theater (among others) over the years I can say the venue stands alone in its grand scope and unique design.

Someone out on social media has suggested calling it the Madison Sphere Garden a fitting if unofficial title. The layout actually feels as you were to inflate a traditional performing-arts center (Reynolds Hall Carnegie Hall the Lincoln Center) as if it were a balloon. The giant hall seems to expand Jiffy Pop-style as you imagine the curved video projection encompassing crowds of 17500 or 20000 standing.

The Sphere does offer more questions about programming at least at this point than the previously mentioned venues. We understood Celine Dion would anchor the Colosseum and Broadway touring shows would propel Reynolds Hall at the Smith Center. The Sphere presents so many questions because of its arena-scale capacity. You might need the greatest live-entertainment concept of a half-century to consistently sell out this place.

The Sphere will draw from an array of entertainment mediums. The hall will be filled with superstar recording artists naturally. But the list is short of such artists as U2 Taylor Swift Foo Fighters or Justin Timberlake who could satisfy a Vegas-style residency. The Sphere will incorporate familiar live- and projection-entertainment formats and expand them in a customized experience.

Madison Square Garden Senior Creative Director Gawain Liddiard and MSG Vice President of Creative Development Jill Morris provided a general preview in a company recruiting video this month. “Sphere really is a new artistic canvas” Liddiard says in the minute-long clip. “It is not taking film and transferring it onto a bigger screen. It’s not taking Broadway or a traditional live show and putting it on a stage. It’s the ability to take people to new places and build new worlds around them.”

Morris says The Sphere will stretch the imagination and capture emotion. “It will have the spectacle and razzle-dazzle of a Super Bowl halftime show. It will have the resonance of an Olympics opening ceremony.”

How an acoustic set from a superstar rock band fits into this vision remains to be seen.

But the feeling here is MSG Sphere is going to need the biggest available stars to rotate in residency.

The arena model George Strait’s exclusive residency at T-Mobile Arena a half-dozen weekends a year. It will also need the gold-standard live-entertainment experience of this decade. The Sphere is shooting high beyond the 366 feet when the exosphere covering the venue’s exterior.

What might be lacking in a high volume of superstar recording acts capable of filling the venue will be complemented by ingenuity in theatrical programming. We’re going to experience a form of entertainment we haven’t seen yet in Vegas or anywhere when The Sphere launches in 2023. As Morris says “It will speak to the world.”

Bono’s back

From The Sphere to the showroom “The Dennis Bono Show” relaunches at South Point Showroom at 2 p.m. (doors at 1 p.m.) Thursday. A very Vegas lineup of Righteous Brothers Bill Medley and Bucky Heard Frankie Scinta Zowie Bowie Michelle Johnson the Bronx Wanderers and Kathleen Dunbar bring the show back after a 15-month pause.

Contact the South Point box office at (702) 797-8055 for reservations. The $5 ticket gets you a drink and afternoon cocktails at BonoPalooza means Vegas is back.

Shriver Ruvo and ‘Today’

Maria Shriver checked in on “Today” on NBC to mark the first anniversary of the Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement Prevention Center at Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health. The Vegas clinic is the nation’s first prevention center designed specifically for women.

Shriver noted the Ruvo Center in the five-minute report noting the 100 women who have been treated ages 30-60 and an outline of the center’s diagnostic and treatment programs.

Shriver’s father the diplomat and political figure Sargent Shriver died in January 2011 after battling Alzheimer’s for eight years. As Maria Shriver said Alzheimer’s was “a disease that ravaged his memory and his mind leaving my family to grieve even while he was still alive.” Shriver also hosted a fundraising event for the clinic in May.

Auditions action

Longtime Wynn Las Vegas casting director Louanne Madorma has headed up auditions for dancers in Vegas and Los Angeles last week. Word is this is for a new concept coming to Le Reve Theater in 2022. The host show closed in August.

Not Piff

Strong indications around the scene that a stage adaptation of “Enter The Dragon” is the production show planned for Paris Theater.“It’s better than nothing!” says Johnny Kats of the theatrical version of the 1973 Bruce Lee martial-arts movie. Paris Theater has been dark since even before COVID.

Smiles!

Mr. Smiles & Molly is but a working title for the developing Criss Angel-Franco Dragone pre-club experience we anticipate is headed for Angel’s theater at Planet Hollywood. I can’t guarantee everyone who reviewed that as a title knew “Molly” might be a taken as a drug reference.

Cool Hang Alert

Piero’s Italian Restaurant is returning live entertainment with Vegas vet Jimmy Hopper from 7:30 p.m.-11 p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays. Pia Zadora and Sonny Charles are planning an October return of Pia’s Place on Fridays and Saturdays relaunch dates to be announced.

The Review-Journal is owned by the family of Dr. Miriam Adelson the majority shareholder of Las Vegas Sands Corp. which operates The Venetian.

Posted on: June 19 2021 11:45h.

Last updated on: June 20 2021 08:23h.

MGM Resorts International announced on Friday that it was introducing charter air service to the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City.

The service will be made available for qualified members of its M Life Rewards program with flights available from dozens of cities across the US. (Image: MGM Resorts International)

In a statement the gaming company said that travelers from up to 75 cities will be able to fly into the New Jersey seaside resort city. Sun Country Airlines operates the flights for MGM Resorts on 173-seat 737-800 aircraft.

Departures are available from such cities as Buffalo Chicago Detroit Houston Louisville Pittsburgh and Raleigh.

Sean Farrell MGM’s executive director of charter services said in a statement that offering chartered flights for patrons is a milestone achievement for the company. The flights are an expansion of service the company currently offers to people going to the Beau Rivage Resort on Mississippi’s Gulf Coast.

MGM’s charter service is available for select members of the company’s M Life Rewards loyalty program who meet the minimum requirements.

Tim Kroll director of the Atlantic City International Airport said in a statement the service benefits more than the city’s largest casino.

The expansion of Borgata’s flight service through ACY on Sun Country Airlines significantly increases the airport’s charter offerings and affords more passengers convenient access to Atlantic City” he said. “The program is valuable to introducing the market to a greater number of communities throughout the U.S.”

Farrell agreed noting that Borgata patrons would be able to visit the famed Atlantic City Boardwalk and take in other attractions in the area during their stay.

MGM’s AC Charter Move Follows Hard Rock

MGM’s announcement comes two weeks after Hard Rock International announced the launch of its charter service to its Atlantic City resort.

Those two brick-and-mortar casinos rank as Atlantic City’s biggest in terms of gaming revenue according to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.

In figures released this past week the Borgata reported $48.7 million in gross gaming revenue for May. Hard Rock reported $35 million. No other Atlantic City casino reported a total higher than $24.6 million.

Both casinos have also been significantly ahead of their peers in terms of year-to-date totals as well. The Borgata reported a total win of $208.9 million for the first five months of the year while Hard Rock reported $151.1 million for the same time span.

Only one other casino the Ocean Casino Resort exceeded $100 million for the first five months.

Service Seeks to Lure Top Caesars Customers too

But MGM Resorts isn’t just looking to compete with Hard Rock in the charter air game. Among the specials they offer on the FlyBorgata.com website MGM offers two complimentary seats on the plane for Seven Stars cardholders with Caesars Entertainment.

Seven Stars is the highest tier in the Caesars Rewards program.

For those not in Caesars Seven Stars program nor high enough in MGM’s M Life program to snag a free flight packages start at $553 per person. That includes the roundtrip flight a three-night stay at the Borgata and transportation between the resort and the Atlantic City airport.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhemV0dGVsaXZlLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdGVlc3NpZGUtbmV3cy9sZWZ0LXJvdC13aGF0cy1oYXBwZW5pbmctOC0yMDcyNDE0MdIBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhemV0dGVsaXZlLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdGVlc3NpZGUtbmV3cy9sZWZ0LXJvdC13aGF0cy1oYXBwZW5pbmctOC0yMDcyNDE0MS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Left to rot?

Something went wrong please try again later.

Though rich in history and character Hartlepool is tainted by several 'blots' on the landscape.

Many of its most iconic buildings sit empty derelict and in need of some major TLC.

These 'eye-sores' are a particular issue for residents who live nearby who want to feel pride for their local surroundings.

Hartlepool Live has been looking into what's happening with some of the key properties left to rot around town.

Hartlepool Engineers Club

Once a bustling community venue Hartlepool Engineers club is now a stain on Hartlepool town centre.

The Engineers Club itself as well as the land to the rear of the newly refurbished Advanced House in Wesley Square is owned by developers Advanced Retail Solutions.

After acquiring the one-acre site the firm proposed to build 184 student apartments and seven ground floor shop units.

However those plans have now been scrapped leading residents to wonder what will happen to the old social haunt on Raby Road which closed its doors for the final time in 2017 due to lack of custom.

Managing director of Advanced Retail Solutions Rob Collier said his team have gone ""back to the drawing board"" to think about what would work best for the centre of Hartlepool.

He's said that they want to ensure they build something ""sustainable"" that's in the ""best interest"" of the residents.

""We've been working for the last 2 and a half years to decide on a suitable scheme and we are currently drawing up the necessary plans for a very exciting project.""

They are currently in ""late stage discussions"" about a new proposal which he said he can't disclose the details of yet.

However we can expect the plans to be submitted ""imminently"" and he hopes that if all goes to schedule work will be underway no later than January 2022.

The Friarage/ North-East wing of St Hilda's hospital

This antiquated limestone landmark is assumed to be the oldest non-religious structure in the Hartlepool borough.

It's thought the property is the remains of manor from the 1600s which became a workhouse in 1859 and latterly a hospital which was closed in 1984.

When the Headland hospital was knocked down this property was left untouched owing to its status as a grade two listed building.

In 2015 Thirteen Group announced it was 'spearheading' a project to rescue the historic landmark however in the years following there have been no changes.

A spokesperson for Thirteen said: “Thirteen originally received planning permission to provide affordable housing at the Friarage but on carrying out further investigations the project became unfeasible due to the extra costs associated with work required on the site.

“We’re currently in discussions with Hartlepool Borough Council with the aim of protecting the site and making the building structurally sound.”

Wesley Chapel

Despite falling into years of disuse this Grade II listed property remains an impressive sight.

Constructed in 1973 it served as a Victorian Chapel and later as a popular nightclub and leisure centre.

The council prioritised supporting the owners of the Wesley building in a recent successful bid to central government.

A spokesperson from the council said: ""Following the announcement that we are to get the full £25 million that we asked for from the Towns Fund we will continue to progress those plans.""

To sign up for Hartlepool Live updates go here

The iconic building which currently sits dilapidated at the end of Victoria Road is privately owned by Stockton-based Jomast Developments who have plans to transform it into a boutique hotel.

The company requested extra support from the local authority with its remediation efforts because of a fire in 2017 which ripped through the property leaving the roof missing and the interior gutted.

Those most recent plans detail creating a 36-bedroom hotel and using the upper ground floor to house a restaurant and bar as well as converting the lower ground floor into five commercial units for use by retail professional services restaurants and cafes and drinking establishments.

Shades Nightclub

This dilapidated former nightclub and hotel has recently been given the go-ahead for essential repairs.

Hartlepool Council planners gave listed building consent to carry out re-roofing chimney drainage and structural repairs at the Church Street site to ensure future use of the building.

The Grade II listed building was originally constructed in 1868 and extensively altered internally and externally in 1900.

A council spokesperson said: ""I can confirm that the appointment of a specialist contractor to carry out works to the building is imminent.""

Former Care Home on Hartlepool Headland

The former Admiral Court Care Home on the headland is in a sorry state with broken windows and debris littering the floor inside the stripped interior.

Located on Cleveland Road the building has become an 'eyesore' for residents and is vulnerable to attack from groups of teens.

In June 2015 the Care Home was closed down after it was found to have unlawfully detained residents and showed a disregard for their humanity according to the Care Quality Commission.

Cleveland Police have said they have been informed of the ongoing issue with the site and a Hartlepool council spokesperson said: “We are aware of the problems occurring at this property and indeed we have taken action to secure it on a number of occasions.

""Going forward we are hoping to set up a meeting with the police and other partners to try to find a longer-term solution.”

The Odeon

Once an art-deco dream this building has certainly seen better days.

Located at the corner of York Road the Grade II listed building opened in 1936 as the Majestic Cinema and was taken over by Odeon in 1943.

It changed hands several times over the years becoming a bingo club a snooker club and from the mid 1990's Caesar's Palace Night club.

The famous night-out closed around the time of the millennium and the building has remained disused since.

Over the years the council have made some attempts to find a buyer for the privately owned property but the longer it sits decaying the harder that becomes.

This beautiful and luxurious home was demolished in 2014 as part of plans to build executive-style houses but the land remains untouched by the developers.

The property was built in 1897 for armed forces officer Christopher Furness complete with a swimming pool large ballroom and motifs of various ships built in Hartlepool.

In the 1920s it was passed over to his son for use as a sports' club and around 1950 it was acquired by West Hartlepool Council and was renovated for educational use.

In 2002 the council granted cheap leases to anyone who wished to care for the property but in 2006 the scheme was abandoned and it became a haven for vandals and arsonists.

Hartlepool Live has attempted to contact Ruttle the developers for a comment about the future of the land.

42nd Street on Lucan Street

Although many people will look back fondly on their times at this nightlife hotspot and the 'Spudweiser' van outside it retains none of its former glory.

It shut down in 2006 and according to council documents the local authority became aware in 2009 that the owner of the licence Capanac Lesiure had been wound up and the premises license was cancelled.

Since then no plans for the location have been submitted and it has instead sat as a target for vandals.

Commenting on the array of derelict buildings across the town a Hartlepool Council spokesman said: “As an authority we actively seek to bring about improvements to derelict buildings across the Borough.

""We do this by working proactively with owners but where necessary we will consider enforcement action.

""This process is led by the Council’s Derelict Building Group which meets on a regular basis to monitor progress and to determine the next steps in relation to specific buildings.”",,,

Thin potato slices fried crisp in oil date from the early 19th century when they are said to have been invented by chef George Speck in Saratoga Springs New York. Chips as they came to be called were first produced commercially either in Massachusetts in 1908 or Ohio in 1910. Flavorings were added for the first time — cheese & onion and salt & vinegar — by an Irish company Tayto in the 1950s and America got into the act with chips made with barbecue-sauce flavorings later in the same decade.

After that all bets were off. American companies started selling chips flavored with various combinations of chile powder and other spices citrus sour cream pickle juice assorted cheeses ranch dressing and more. British manufacturers went crazy producing variations whose flavorings were meant to simulate the tastes of prawn cocktail oysters roast chicken roast beef roast ham with cranberries roast lamb with mint sausage and mustard even haggis. Japan put its own twist on chips with examples that evoked the flavors of nori seaweed pickled plums fish roe and (why not?) Pepsi Cola.

The craze for flavoring extended beyond potato chips to tortilla chips (like Doritos) the unique little corn chips called Fritos and various other crispy snacks — including the faux-potato chips called Pringles made with extruded potato flour. These are 25 “junk foods” that are actually not so bad for you.

Food companies are constantly developing new products of course and that includes new flavored chips and suchlike. Often these are limited editions or sold only in certain markets. Sometimes though they’re launched nationwide and just don’t fly off the shelves so get discontinued — sometimes just as we’re starting to develop a taste for them. Chips after all are among the 40 popular discontinued snack foods we miss the most.

24/7 Tempo has assembled a list of 20 potato chips and snack chips of a few other kinds that were introduced but then faded from sight. They’re some of the ones we miss the most — chips with forthright and sometimes unusual flavors that deserve another chance. We consulted a number of online lists including those published by ChipReview Taquitos.Net Insider and METV as well as corporate sites for various chip manufacturers.

COF,Capital One,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vY2FwaXRhbC1vbmUtc3ByaW5nLXByaWNlbGluZS1zYXZlLWhvdGVscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No Joke: Capital One Spring & Priceline Really Can Save You 50%+ On Hotels (No Capital One Card Needed),"Bonkers simply bonkers.

Capital One Spring is a program offering savings to businesses with a range of partners. It’s completely free to join (you can register here) and you don’t even have to be a Capital One cardholder to get access to the deals.

Nick first covered the program here where he highlighted some of the savings available with Dell and on Happy gift cards. I subsequently looked into the savings they claimed to offer for Choice and there were some legit discounts available by booking with their code.

For some time Capital One Spring has listed savings of up to 50% off hotel rates when booking with Priceline.

I took that claim of up to 50% savings with a pinch of salt as a lot of sites claim savings of that nature but which seem to be exaggerated in reality. The pinch of salt I took was so large in fact that I ignored this part of the Capital One Spring program entirely until recently as I assumed it was simply a link to the regular Priceline site.

That was dumb of me.

You see the site you click through to isn’t the regular Priceline site. And when Capital One Spring/Priceline claim to offer up to 50% off hotels that’s not true. Some of the hotel savings are even bigger than 50%. Those aren’t artificially inflated prices they’re comparing the savings against either. These are very real savings when compared to booking on the regular Priceline site and even when booking directly with the hotel chain.

For example I did a search for a two night stay in New York City from August 3-5. The Capital One Spring/Priceline site (which actually shows up at rezserver.com) sorts the results by largest percentage savings but you can sort by price hotel name ratings etc.

Here are the top three results by percentage savings:

66% savings at the Conrad New York Midtown 59% savings for the Westgate New York Grand Central and 57% off at the Holiday Inn Express New York City Chelsea.

Lest you think these are made up savings they’re not. Capital One Spring/Priceline are basing the Conrad savings off a room rate of $532 per night. That’s not far off the $513 per night Hilton is charging directly for the same property on the same nights:

That’s savings of $664 before tax over the course of that two night stay. Like I said bonkers.

Seeing as you wouldn’t be booking directly you wouldn’t earn elite night credits or points or receive status benefits. However when you’re saving $664 does it really matter that you won’t be getting the $25 per person for breakfast that Hilton now offers elite members at Conrad properties in the US?!

The savings for that Holiday Inn Express are equally legit. You can pay $117 per night via this Priceline partnership or $242.77 per night when booking directly with IHG. Even better the fact that it’s a Holiday Inn Express means you’d get free breakfast even when not booking directly as it’s a brand that offers free breakfast to all guests regardless of their status level or how they booked.

Those three hotels listed above aren’t the only good deals either. Want to stay at a decent hotel in Times Square? How does $100 per night sound for the Holiday Inn New York City Times Square?

The funny thing is that the savings for this property are in theory even higher than the 49% discount they’re claiming. That’s because IHG is charging $215.70 per night which is a 54% discount.

It’s not like these savings are isolated to New York City. When doing a search for the same dates (August 3-5) in Chicago here’s the top result.

The Palmer House Hilton is available for only $106. Compare that to the $212 that Hilton wants to charge you for booking those same nights directly.

Great savings can be had at many other Hilton properties in Chicago too. Here’s what’s being charged via Capital One Spring/Priceline…

…and here’s how much Hilton is charging for those three properties when booking directly with them – some pretty significant savings are available here.

I’m not sure if this is the case for all cities but it seems like the largest discounts are available at Hilton and IHG properties. Although Marriott and Hyatt properties do appear in the search results on the Capital One Spring/Priceline site I didn’t notice any of those being discounted. Hotels in some other chains are available though such as the Radisson Blu Aqua.

The $240 rate they’re basing the savings on exactly matches the rate that Radisson is charging when booking directly on their website.

A Downside With These Rates

Other than the fact that you won’t receive elite status benefits or earn points and elite night credits for not booking directly there’s a very annoying quirk with these prices.

In order to access these discounted hotel prices you have to log in to Capital One Spring and then click through to the Priceline site. That causes greatly discounted prices like these to show up:

If you copy and paste the URL from that search results page (this is it) the standard higher pricing is what gets displayed – not the lower prices.

The reason that’s incredibly annoying is because it means you can’t use the lower rates for Best Rate Guarantee (BRG) claims. When making a BRG claim it has to be a publicly available rate; the fact that the hotel chain’s BRG team would have to log in to Capital One Spring click through to Priceline and then do the search themselves means it’d be an invalid rate.

If it was possible to have them access these rates you could get the best of both worlds. You could get the hotel chain to match the much cheaper rate (and get a further discount depending on the hotel chain’s BRG policy) while also being eligible for elite status benefits and earning points and elite night credits because you’d have booked the stay with the chain directly.

Cancellation Policies

I’d thought that another downside would be that the low rates would be non-refundable but that’s not necessarily the case. For example the Holiday Inn New York City Times Square has what they’re listing as a flexible cancellation policy for most of the room types.

When looking at the terms it said that the rate was fully refundable provided you cancel before July 31. That’s three days before the stay which while not as good as being able to cancel the day before does provide a good degree of flexibility.

Summary

Capital One Spring and Priceline allow you to book some hotels – particularly Hilton and IHG properties – at discounts of more than 50%. You won’t receive benefits or points as you’re not booking directly but with potential savings of hundreds or thousands of dollars depending on the length of your stay the money you save could well be worth it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2dlcm1hbnktcmVvcGVuaW5nLWZpcnN0LWFtZXJpY2FuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I was one of the first American tourists to enter Germany... Here's what it was like,"My journey to Germany was well... interesting. After the European Union lifted restrictions on American citizens to travel to its 27 member states on June 16 we decided it would be a good idea to get someone from TPG to be there as the borders opened to nonessential travel. Because Germany is a member of the EU we figured this decision by the EU included Germany. In fact we were under the impression that as of June 18 Germany's borders were open.

But that wasn't the case.

Attempt Number One

Thursday night we booked a flight for the next day (June 18) at 3:45 p.m. with Lufthansa from JFK to Frankfurt (FRA). I purposely arrived at 1:15 p.m. so that I had enough time should any issues come up. And boy were there issues. Because passengers needed to show proof of vaccination a negative test or proof of recovery we had to go through a longer check-in process than normal.

I am fully vaccinated and I got a rapid test earlier that morning (with specific travel documentation) just in case they asked for it. When I finally reached the counter the agent scanned my passport and told me my ticket was voided. This was the first of many hurdles.

I had a confirmation number so I figured it was just a system error. After a few minutes they told me they wouldn't be able to fix the issue and that I had to call the ticket issuer (our parent company's travel agency). I stepped aside and was told by the agency that I was issued two tickets by mistake but there was an active ticket. I went back to the counter with the active ticket number (they didn't make me wait) but they told me I had to go to the help desk to get the active ticket switched with the voided ticket.

By this time the Lufthansa check-in was becoming madness. At the help desk an incredibly agitated man was unable to fly to his destination because the plane was full even though he had a confirmation number for a ticket. He berated the help desk agents for about 25 minutes leading to two police officers arriving.

As he was dealt with a few other customers in front of me had issues checking their bags because it was a codeshare with United. After their issues were handled I explained my situation and the agent managed to get my active ticket to work.

He led me over to another agent who questioned me about my purpose for travel. After saying business she asked for confirmation of my business or papers. I had neither because I was under the impression that nonessential travel was allowed. I was then transferred to the deputy manager (who was helping the same angry man from earlier. Yikes). He told me that he was worried about sending me to the border without papers and thought I would be turned away. I looked up the current border restrictions and there it was:

[pullquote]The German Government is lifting all travel restrictions for persons residing in the United States effective Sunday June 20 2021. So starting Sunday travel to Germany for all purposes will be permitted again. However a proof of vaccination proof of recovery from COVID-19 or negative test result is still required for entry via air travel.[/pullquote]

This was news to me and the deputy manager. He told me he was unaware of the lifting of restrictions by the EU so he was glad I said something because he had been dealing with U.S. passports all day. All of this happened while a massive white dog in a crate barked for around 25 minutes. It was hectic to say the least.

Unfortunately and unknowingly I was one day early because the German Government decided that morning to lift restrictions for the following Sunday. He kindly reticketed me for June 19 (my flight would land in Germany on June 20 allowing me to enter ... hopefully). I ubered back home disappointed but determined.

Attempt Number Two

On June 19 I woke up and did the exact same thing I did before. I got a COVID-19 rapid test with accompanying travel documents and ubered to the airport this time arriving at 1 p.m. on the dot.

The Lufthansa counter seemed a lot calmer than the day before. I got in line and waited. And waited. And waited.

I wasn't far from the counter but it took me about 45 minutes to get to a gate agent. She scanned my passport asked for my vaccine card weighed my suitcase and handed me my boarding pass. I couldn't believe it. After everything I went through the day before it was shocking to receive my ticket so easily. I've never taken such good care of a boarding pass as I did with this one. It truly felt like a Golden Ticket.

I was thankful to get out of the check-in area because the line was snaking its way all the way to the entrance and was now multiple lanes deep.

After about 50 minutes of being at the Lufthansa check-in the line had already snaked to the entrance. (Photo by Mimi Wright/The Points Guy)

By 2:02 p.m. I was through security and on the way to my gate (I have Global Entry and TSA PreCheck which helped). With an hour until boarding I got a bagel checked up on work things and waited. Boarding the plane was efficient calm and speedy.

I found my seat (37K) and settled in for the journey. It felt very similar to pre-pandemic flights except for a few small changes. We were offered a towelette and earbuds masks had to be worn the whole time (except for when eating or drinking) and service was a bit different. We received hot meals (vegetarian pasta with a roll side salad crackers and cheese and a berry dessert) but alcoholic beverages were limited and not allowed between meals.

The flight was smooth and on time. When I arrived in Frankfurt I was worried about customs because I didn't know what the process would be like. In reality it took longer for me to walk to customs than to actually get through.

The border agent asked me if I was meeting anyone what my purpose was if I had a vaccine card and if I had a place to stay. He stamped my passport and I was through.

All in all it was a headache getting to Germany but mostly because we were a day early thanks to Germany updating its restrictions on short notice. For anyone planning a trip or heading there soon as long as you have the proper COVID-19 documentation you shouldn't have too much of an issue getting in. Remember that you need that COVID-19 test and TPG suggests printing out supporting documentation from the government ""just in case.""

My best advice is this: Get to the airport way before your flight because those lines were brutal. And maybe pack some patience. You might need it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vc3RhcnNhbmRzdGlja3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMjAvd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1jYXBpdGFscy1yZS1zaWduLXNoYW5lLWdlcnNpY2gtdG8tb25lLXllYXItZGVhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Washington Capitals re-sign Shane Gersich to one year deal,Trending.

KUWAIT CITY June 19 (Xinhua) -- One person was confirmed dead and another two injured after a fire broke out Saturday morning at a warehouse in Capital Governorate of Kuwait the Kuwait Fire Force (KFF) said.

KFF said in a statement that seven firefighting teams reached the scene and managed to control the fire.

According to the statement the warehouse has an area of 10000 square meters and contains iron and wood household utensils.

An investigation into the cause of the fire is underway it added.

While this service has been delayed for the sixth time to Aug. 1 2021 (per Cirium schedules and confirmed on Delta's website) this time the carrier has now decided to drop plans to fly to Cape Town altogether.

When Delta first announced its two-city South Africa service the carrier planned to start flights on Oct. 24 2020. It was then delayed to Jan. 8 2021 then March 27 2021 then June 5 2021 and then to July 2 2021. While Delta's flight to South Africa is still projected to fly on Aug. 1 the service will now only run directly from Atlanta (ATL) to Johannesburg.

Delta is also tweaking the operating frequency. From Aug. 1 through Sept. 8 the carrier plans to run three weekly flights on Sundays Wednesdays and Fridays in the eastbound direction and on Mondays Thursdays and Saturdays in the westbound direction.

From Sept. 8 on Delta will increase the flight to daily service.

The month-long delay comes as South Africa has just logged its first confirmed cases of the Delta coronavirus variant while still dealing with its own virus variant that appears to be more infectious. The U.S. government on Jan. 26 2021 banned travel from South Africa with the exceptions of U.S. citizens and legal U.S. residents due to the more contagious South Africa variant.

Before the pandemic Delta operated daily non-stop flights from Atlanta (ATL) to Johannesburg (JNB) on a Boeing 777-200LR. However the airline's 777 fleet was retired late last year.

Delta uses enhanced Airbus A350-900

Flying an A350 from JNB to ATL initially presented Delta with a problem. Due to the city's high elevation the A350 couldn't reach Atlanta at maximum payload. That's why the carrier originally added the tag flight to Cape Town (CPT) allowing the plane to refuel at sea level before beginning the 8130-mile trek back to the U.S.

The route will now be flown by the carrier's flagship Airbus A350 outfitted with 32 fully enclosed Delta One business class suites 48 Premium Select premium economy seats and 226 economy seats. The flight time will run about 16 hours -- Delta's longest flight and will no longer need a stop in CPT anymore and will just fly directly from ATL to JNB.

Paid fares on the inaugural flight start at a whopping $2500 round trip in coach and $3700 in Premium Select. Delta One Suites are sold out as of press time. One-way award redemptions start at 140000 250000 and 465000 SkyMiles respectively.

Big three launches other ultra-long-haul flights

Despite the pandemic the ""Big 3"" U.S. airlines are all slated to launch a slew of new ultra-long-haul flights this year.

United Airlines launched its flagship Johannesburg route on June 3 2021. Following the successful late 2019 launch of a Newark (EWR) to CPT nonstop the Chicago-based carrier is planning to launch a second South Africa flight to JNB using a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner.

United is also planning a new San Francisco (SFO) to Bangalore (BLR) flight which was just delayed again this time to Aug. 1.

Many workers and companies have now embraced remote work in previously office-based positions and this is continuing even as the economy reopens and new jobs are posted. Many new remote positions are being posted advertising that applicants can live anywhere in the US—except Colorado.

Here’s why.

“A new Colorado law… requires companies with even a few employees in the state to disclose the expected salary or pay range for each open role they advertise including remote positions” the Wall Street Journal reports. “The rule’s aim is to narrow gender wage gaps and provide greater pay transparency for employees.”

The result?

“To avoid having to disclose that information… some employers seeking remote workers nationwide are saying that those living in Colorado need not apply” the Journal notes.

Big companies want to hire remote workers—as long as they're not from Colorado https://t.co/CltN4yVGTp — The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) June 18 2021

For example a posting for a Johnson & Johnson job recently read: “Work location is flexible if approved by the Company except that position may not be performed remotely from Colorado.” Multiple job listings at Cardinal Health Inc. advertise that “This is a remote work from home position. This role is to be filled outside of the state of Colorado.”

You get the idea. A website ColoradoExcluded.com catalogs these postings and reports that at least 39 companies are actively discouraging Colorado residents from applying. Why?

Well companies say that the Colorado regulations are burdensome and costly to comply with. And publicly posting all salary information not only undercuts employees’ privacy but also could fuel discontent and conflict within the company. Given the fact that they have 49 other options (and more if you count Washington DC Puerto Rico etc.) it’s easier for some companies to just not hire people from the state.

This is certainly not what Colorado state lawmakers intended. They likely had good intentions of promoting transparency and equality albeit ones based on a statistically dubious premise of the largely fictional sexist “gender pay gap.” But as Nobel-Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman once said “One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results.” And the result of this regulatory overreach was to take jobs away from Coloradans not make them more equitable.

Of course few could have seen this coming when drafting salary transparency regulations. While easy enough to understand in hindsight it would have taken tremendous foresight to predict that this would specifically lead to remote work positions discriminating against the state. But that’s exactly the problem with the government interfering in the minutiae of economic life. Bureaucrats huddled in some office somewhere can never fully foresee the vast and disparate consequences of their actions—meaning unintended consequences inevitably follow.

“Every human action has both intended and unintended consequences” economist Antony Davies and political scientist James Harrigan explain. “Human beings react to every rule regulation and order governments impose and their reactions result in outcomes that can be quite different than the outcomes lawmakers intended.”

Colorado lawmakers may not have intended to get applicants in their state discriminated against in remote work opportunities. But we should judge them not on their intentions but on their results.

The renovation is part of CSMC’s continuous effort to improve its quality of service and ensure excellent hospital experience for everyone who enters its doors.

“The new lobby that we see is just the start of more renovations in our facilities and upgrade in our medical equipment” CSMC President and CEO Mr. Raul C. Pagdanganan said in his message. “This development reaffirms our commitment to the community and the patients we serve” he said.

The new lobby now houses a memorial plaque for Cardinal Rufino Santos whose legacy of compassionate service serves as the foundation of the hospital.

During the program CSMC also unveiled its enhanced Vision Mission and Values wall which carries the hospital’s core principles and a newly installed tribute marker that CSMC dedicates to its healthcare workers in recognition of their sacrifices during the pandemic.

“Through this simple remembrance and dedication with hearts ignited by passion and purpose we remember who we are where we came from and what our true destiny is as Caring Cardinal Leaders- a ray of hope a lifesaver an exemplar of excellence always in the service of others” CSMC VP and Head of Human Resources Ms. Maria Louzel L. Diaz-Tiozon said.

To round up the event CSMC welcomed members of the Singing Cardinals to celebrate the premiere of the new CSMC Hymn video which was published just in time for Saturday’s Independence Day celebration.

Joining Mr. Pagdanganan in leading the ribbon-cutting ceremony were CSMC SVP and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Zenaida M. Javier-Uy and Chief Financial Officer Ms. Marivic S. Mabuti. The event hosted by CSMC VP and Head of Business Planning and Development Division Dr. Marichu L. Catan was also graced by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila Oeconomus Rev. Fr. Cesar V. Buhat CSMC Chaplain Fr. Jun Abogado Metro Pacific Hospitals Group Chief Operating Officer Dr. Jeffrey Staples and other members of the CSMC Management Committee

Mi,Will someone just hand @smithrukami his “I moved the goalposts enough that I feel like I proved someone wrong on the Internet” trophy so he can stop hijacking this thread with arguments about the specific intentions of used car dealers?On topic:I’m really wresting with whether I should purchase a Model Y right now. When I ordered on 5/15 then absolutely it made sense; it seems like it will fit my driving situation the acceleration and quietness is fantastic and even though I don’t plan to get FSD autopilot worked great for me. Then the cars were hampered with a 75mph cruise control limit (which will not match the flow of traffic around here). Then the NHTSA pulled the safety-feature test results (which raises my insurance rates about 20%). Then they pulled lumbar from the passenger seat (which I don’t particularly care about but my wife commented on it several times during the test drives so it’s just another kick while we’re already feeling down). I still have my order in (EDD July/August) but I don’ta car right now due to work-from-home being extended at least a few more months so it’s not quite so clear what I should do.Honestly if the autopilot can reach feature parity with what it was when I test drove and the safety feature “checkboxes” come back then there’s no doubt in my mind that this is a good time to order. Otherwise maybe I should wait for those to happen and see what other changes Tesla makes in the meantime.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vZWFybmluZ3MtY2FsZW5kYXItZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrLW9mLWp1bmUtMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings calendar for the week of June 21,"With only a few major companies remaining to report this season there will be fewer earnings events in the coming week.

At least five people were injured Friday night in two separate shootings less than a mile apart in Colorado Springs Colorado police said.

The first shooting involved “a disturbance between two known groups” at a mall carnival where three juveniles were transported to a hospital the Colorado Springs Police Department said in a series of tweets.

Officers responded to a report of shots fired at the Citadel Mall event about 9 p.m. according to police.

Police came upon two injured juveniles who were taken to a hospital.

Officers later learned that a third injured juvenile was transported to a hospital by family members the posts said.

Police in the posts described their injuries as “serious but non life-threatening.”

While investigating the first shooting officers received another report of gunfire at a Boston Market across the street according to police.

The second shooting happened about 40 minutes after the first report of gunfire CNN affiliate KKTV reported.

A preliminary investigation found the second shooting occurred when “a suspect confronted three individuals in a parked car” police said.

Two people in the car were driven to a hospital after suffering gunshot wounds according to the posts.

Investigators believe the shootings are isolated and appealed to the public for information police said.

No additional information was provided on suspects or possible motives in the shootings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybGluZ3RvbmNhcmRpbmFsLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2L3Nob3RzLWZpcmVkLWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24tbmVhci1jYXJuaXZhbC1hdC13b29kZmllbGQtbWFsbC1zY2hhdW1idXJnL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shots Fired Investigation Near Carnival at Woodfield Mall Schaumburg,"Shots fired investigation near Woodfield carnival in Parking Lot G Schaumburg. YouTube Tips ⓘ

Police from Schaumburg responded about 9:45 p.m. Friday June 18 2021 to a report of shots fired near the carnival in the southeast corner of the Woodfield Mall property 5 Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg. No gunshot wound injuries were reported Friday night.









Schaumburg police stated that police officers responded to a parking lot area at 5 Woodfield Mall for a report of shots fired. Police officers found a parked unoccupied vehicle with bullet hole damage. No injuries were reported; however a Schaumburg Fire Department ambulance was dispatched about 9:49 p.m. for a possible EMS call related to the incident which also involved one or more groups fighting. A second ambulance was dispatched about 10:18 p.m. to stand by at the scene near a police command post set up for the investigation.

The carnival was scheduled to close at 10:00 p.m. Friday night and was immediately cleared of people that were in attendance at the carnival.









A criminal investigation perimeter was established that appeared to be located primarily in the large parking lot between Perimeter Drive near Ashley Furniture and DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse to the east and Sears and Pac-Man Entertainment located in the main mall building to the west (including north of the Sears Auto Center). Traffic was blocked along Perimeter Drive near the scene.

A large red GMC pickup truck was inside the investigation perimeter surrounded with red tape but initially there was no official confirmation that the pickup truck was the vehicle with the bullet hole damage.









Much of the investigative work at the scene appeared to begin breaking down about 12:10 a.m. Saturday.

Witnesses reported that groups of people of 30 or more were fighting at the scene. Witness said some fighting occurred inside the carnival area near the games. Witnesses in the area of Whole Foods also noticed a large volume of police activity passing by toward Woodfield between 9:50 p.m. and 10:20 a.m.

Schaumburg firefighters and paramedics were dispatched to the scene for a report of person injured or some type of EMS call.









Illinois State Police and Hoffman Estates police officers were also assigned to the scene at Woodfield.

The carnival is scheduled from June 16 to June 20 2021 and is provided by North American Midway Entertainment. Tickets are purchased at the gate.

USS Gerald R. Ford completed the first explosive event of full-ship shock trials Friday.

The Navy detonated explosives near the carrier to see how it holds up against shock and vibrations.

The standard testing is designed to simulate real battle conditions.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

The US Navy's new supercarrier is going through shock trials and that means setting off live explosives near the warship to simulate actual combat conditions.

USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) the first of a new class of aircraft carriers completed the first explosive event of the ongoing full-ship shock trials on Friday off the US East Coast where the Navy detonated explosives near the carrier.

The Navy said the carrier was ""designed using advanced computer modeling methods testing and analysis to ensure the ship is hardened to withstand battle conditions and these shock trials provide data used in validating the shock hardness of the ship.""

The official Twitter account for USS Gerald R. Ford tweeted Saturday that ""the leadership and the crew demonstrated Navy readiness fighting through the shock proving our warship can 'take a hit' and continue our mission on the cutting edge of naval aviation.""

Though the Navy has conducted shock trials with other vessels the latest trials with the Ford the service's newest and most advanced carrier mark the first time since 1987 the Navy has conducted shock trials with an aircraft carrier.

The last aircraft carrier shock trials involved the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt according to the Navy.

Shock trials are designed to test how Navy warships hold up against severe vibrations and identify potential shock-related vulnerabilities in a combat vessel.

A 2007 study sponsored by the Office of Naval Research and conducted by the MITRE Corporation's JASON program said US Navy shock trials have their origins in observations from the Second World War.

During the major global conflict ""it was discovered that although such 'near miss' explosions do not cause serious hull or superstructure damage the shock and vibrations associated with the blast nonetheless incapacitate the ship by knocking out critical components and systems"" the study said.

Nearby explosions even though vessels were not taking direct hits would send destructive high-pressure waves toward ships the report said noting that ""this discovery led the Navy to implement a rigorous shock hardening test procedure.""

After completing full-ship shock trials the aircraft carrier will return to the pier at Newport News Shipbuilding for its first planned incremental availability a six-month period during which the ship will undergo ""modernization maintenance and repairs prior to its operational employment"" the Navy said.







As a first-in-class ship USS Gerald R. Ford has been experienced cost overruns developmental delays and technological setbacks but the Navy is moving forward with the project.

The Navy planned to have the carrier ready for deployment by 2024 but in May Rear Adm. James Downey program executive officer for aircraft carriers suggested the service might be able to get there sooner.

There are three other Ford-class carriers in various stages of procurement and development namely USS John F.

In this second article exploring the history of RTK we focus mostly on the 1980s to look at what confirmed or inspired further exploration of GPS for land and marine surveying and foreshadowed an intense period of development (to come in Part 3) in the first half of the 1990s as geodesists scientists and engineers tried to build the perfect system.

Cornerstone: Using extraterrestrial systems for centimeter-level accuracy

The development of satellite geodesy would rest on the foundation of using phase differencing for high-accuracy baseline determination such as was used with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). GPS which launched its first satellite in 1978 was designed to use code-based signals for real time accuracies of 3-to-5 meters horizontal and 10-to-15 meters vertical but there was so much more potential.

Clever scientists determined they could use GPS satellites in a similar way using two receivers to interpret its non-code signals called carrier-phase signals for precise measurement to the accuracy of centimeters. This was known as carrier-phase differential GPS positioning and a host of individuals started developing software algorithms for extracting and processing that data as well as developing techniques to improve GPS surveying capabilities.

One of those individuals was Dr. Benjamin W. Remondi a GPS technologist for the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) who in the early 1980s began a long productive career in static and kinematic positioning based primarily on GPS observations. His body of work over several decades included more than 50 technical papers on methods still in use today such as the triple differencing method the antenna exchange method and the kinematic survey method. Researchers in the field would come to refer to him as “the father of Real Time Kinematic survey.”

Meter-level positioning at sea

Prior to Remondi’s research there were also technologies that routinely used broadcast radio waves for meter-level positioning of marine vessels performing engineering and construction work in the world’s ports and harbors.

One was Raydist a marine navigation system that relied on carrier signals broadcast from land-based shore stations. In the 1940s engineer Charles Hastings developed a method to measure the phase shift of a signal superimposed on radio waves transmitted between aircraft and a ground station. This led to the Raydist radio wave system for accurately measuring distance through continuous wave phase comparison.

Raydist was in use for hydrographic positioning and dredging when Steve DeLoach a civil engineer and land surveyor began working for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). “We had to run geodetic control along all the nation’s bays rivers and harbors to establish stations to locate the Raydist towers and had to set ‘spar buoys’ along the shipping channels as known points and locate these geodetically with multiple angle resections from shore” said DeLoach now retired. “These spar buoys were often many miles offshore bobbing about. The boat would pull alongside and the captain would yell ‘mark’ so the Raydist operator could enter the correct number of cycles from the two base stations.”

As a young engineer DeLoach was dumbfounded at the Raydist system’s mass of paper tape whirling analog dials massive ships’ power systems (fire hazards) and no vertical positioning. “All vertical information was from a tide station that was miles away therefore in significant error.”

But those issues aside Raydist represented the same type of solution as GPS ambiguity resolution making GPS carrier-phase positioning worth pursuing for hydrographic surveying. “The method of using a known static point to ‘resolve integers’ is exactly what the old 1960s Raydist system did in the marine environment” DeLoach said.

Comparing Raydist and other marine navigation systems was a way to prove that GPS could actually work and provide compatible results and those results also helped DeLoach make his case with USACE for funding in the late 1980s for a major project to develop a GPS carrier-phase positioning system for hydrographic surveying and dredging that would lead to RTK development.

“Raydist counts lanes of phase difference and that is exactly what geodetic GPS does” DeLoach said. “It’s the same basic math problems—just complicated by satellites orbiting versus base stations on the ground.”

Remondi would join the dredging project team in 1989 as one of its key problem-solvers but before that phase of development could begin other steppingstones on the way to RTK needed to be found.

Centimeter GPS positioning on land

The Macrometer was another predecessor technology demonstrating centimeter-level accuracy in GPS positioning. In the 1980s Charles Counselman a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) led the development of the Macrometer V-1000. According to a 2010 article on Counselman by MIT Technology Review a NASA scientist labeled Counselman’s invention as “snake oil” but would soon be proven wrong as it represented a new way to harness GPS by combining expertise in radio and astronomy.

Counselman proved his technology in a series of demonstrations in the early 1980s and was subsequently granted 36 patents. But while the Macrometer demonstrated extraordinary accuracy it had downsides for everyday civilian surveying uses. It was expensive heavy took two people to carry and had to be transported in a utility vehicle. Even so it would play an important role in research on the way to more streamlined and nimble commercial GPS systems.

“Today GPS receivers embodying Chuck’s technologies are portable inexpensive and ubiquitous” noted a 2008 article when Counselman received the Charles A. Whitten Medal from the American Geophysical Union. “Look under the hood and you’ll find many of his basic patents inside.”

GPS data simulation for precise carrier phase data

After earlier work in orbital mechanics and software development (see Part 1) Remondi was hired in 1981 by Admiral John Bossler and Dr. Clyde Goad to work at the NGS to solve “a most important problem”—using GPS for surveying at centimeter-level accuracy.

At the time there was no carrier data so Remondi’s first activity was to write a GPS data simulator for precise carrier phase data. During that time Remondi recalls being given tremendous freedom as a researcher including use of the lab’s minicomputer. The combination made developing software at NGS “amazing” he said. “I had been programming by that time probably 20 years of my life and it was always a burden. Sometimes I had to wait two or three days in the early days for a response to a program and another two to three days to get feedback. Now it was instantaneous. I could do two lines of code and ask it to compile and run two more lines of code. This was just unbelievable. This just super-charged me like you can’t believe.”

With this new computing power Remondi wrote two software programs that could process his simulated data. One used an interferometric search method he learned from Counselman and Sergei A. Gourevitch (Miniature Interferometer Terminals for Earth Surveying: Ambiguity And Multipath with Global Positioning System October 1981) while the other was a triple-difference program of his own invention. The programs were written to anticipate cycle slips and repair them if desired.

There was an obsession with cycle slips and the interferometric methods Remondi got from Gourevitch and Counselman enabled him to develop advanced computer methods to speed up the time for processing by a factor of 100000. The triple-difference method while considered naïve on the theory that there would be too little signal was faster in processing detected cycle slips and worked fine.

Collaboration and data familiarity advance RTK methods

Also to support Remondi’s initial work Bossler approved the purchase of two Macrometers at $250000 apiece. “They are usually $300000 but we got them for a Sunday Special” Remondi recalled. The receivers tracked six GPS satellites were codeless and had weak signals but with a small dataset provided by MIT “miraculously my programs worked.”

Meanwhile NGS was working with four sister government agencies to partner with Texas Instruments to develop the TI 4100 one of the first commercial GPS receivers and antennas. The TI 4100 team included excellent engineers writing simulation software Remondi said and he contributed timing software to their efforts. “They liked my contribution and good relations were established.”

After receiving the Macrometers the NGS team put them to work surveying the nation. It was no small logistical and physical effort because the receivers were heavy required large batteries and had to be time-synced. The team had to generate orbital data in the home office and send it to the field.

“I became extremely cozy with the data” Remondi said. “I noticed that a tracking channel could get confused and switch satellites when the doppler signal was the same. The receiver would then report the wrong satellite. This was easy to fix but it pointed to how close I was watching the data. MIT was unaware of this sympathetic tracking behavior.”

Goad and Remondi shared the results of this work in 1984 in “Initial Relative Positioning Results Using the Global Positioning System.”

Initialization without sitting still for hours

Also in the 1983-84 timeframe and as part of the Macrometer testing Larry D. Hothem a geodesist with the United States Geological Survey set up a test network in California with survey marks near each other. At the time it was taking three hours at each monument to establish a position and Remondi thought there had to be a more efficient way. He realized the long stays at each monument were to give time for the satellites to move and wondered if they should stay a couple of minutes at each site and return several times. “I did not experiment with this method right then” he said “but I did later.”

The jumping from site to site made him wonder: Could the antenna be moved from a known site to an unknown site while maintaining carrier tracking? “While I believed the Macrometers could not do this I thought if I rotated the antenna very slowly I could prove the point. I asked Professor Counselman if such tracking could be done. He said no but if there was an application they would consider it.”

By the spring of 1984 Remondi—inspired by a paper by Dr. Alan G. Evans at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) that proved carrier tracking could be done while moving—set up a kinematic (or motion geometry) test but it didn’t work.

He learned from Texas Instruments engineers that with an increase in bandwidth the TI 4100 could track the carrier when the antenna was in motion. Next he asked his colleagues at NSWC to modify the receiver’s software to widen the bandwidth to 8 Hz. With this change Remondi repeated his experiment with field personnel carrying an antenna around a roughly square path and sending the data to him.

Antenna swapping—an awkward dance

The experiment was successful. With that proof Remondi designed more interesting experiments to travel between known survey marks using RTK. “Those tests were not in real time yet so we called the method ‘kinematic’ and not ‘RTK’” he said. “One of those experiments added the technique of swapping antennas.”

It looked like an awkward dance. Picture two tripods each with a GPS antenna and two guys lifting the antennas carefully up over their heads so they don’t interfere with the signal and then walking around each other to set the antennas down on the other tripod and not tangling the cords in the process. “They looked silly while doing it” said DeLoach and at some point the antenna swap started being referred to as “the Remondi Foxtrot.”

The article “Performing Centimeter-Level Surveys in Seconds with GPS Carrier Phase: Initial Results” (NAVIGATION Journal of The Institute of Navigation Winter 1985-1986) describes the initial tests: “The results of this experiment show that centimeter-level relative surveys can be performed in seconds. A priori geodetic coordinates of the initial location of the ‘roving’ antenna are not required since they too can be determined within seconds.”

Surveying with kinematic GPS—stopping only for a few seconds—seemed preposterous to many of Remondi’s colleagues. Until it didn’t. One scientist eventually apologized for his skepticism and receiver manufacturers started asking for the capability. “The antenna swap was greeted with a big ‘wow’ and without skepticism” Remondi said “meaning my work was beginning to be taken seriously.”

GPS commercial development: What can we do to keep the company going?

Alongside the scientific work of GPS technologists like Remondi were efforts by commercial GPS pioneers including Charles R. Trimble who founded the company in 1978 to initially focus on Loran-C a hyperbolic radio navigation system but in 1982 began developing receivers using GPS signals.

Unlike scientists at NGS or the Department of Defense who had access to the computer systems that tracked the GPS satellites and could develop the ephemeris data for their calculations surveyors needed receivers that could download and understand the ephemeris or orbital data.

In 1984 Trimble introduced one of the first GPS positioning products called the 4000A GPS Locator a C/A code receiver intended to replace Loran. The main users for the 4000A were hydrographic survey boats locating previously drilled holes over which to build oil platforms.

Then on Jan. 28 1986 the Space Shuttle Challenger was engulfed in flames 73 seconds into flight killing all seven crew members aboard. Also lost in the explosion was a satellite to enhance coverage worldwide. It would be two more years before additional GPS satellites could be launched.

Unlike other GPS manufacturers that were able to shift to other areas of production Trimble was invested almost exclusively in GPS. “Here was Charlie with a commercial company and all of a sudden the whole GPS program came to a halt because they could no longer launch satellites” said Mark Nichols general manager at Trimble and one of the company’s early RTK development leaders. “So he turned to Ron Hyatt who also came out of HP and said ‘What can we do with GPS to keep the company going when there aren’t enough satellites in the sky?’”

They shifted the company’s focus to time transfer because it was possible to get atomic clock accuracy timing out of a GPS receiver with only one or two satellites and also to the development of GPS static carrier-phase differential positioning for geodetic surveying.

“GPS entered into the surveying industry by virtue of Trimble looking for a commercial application after the Space Shuttle disaster” Nichols added. “And it was used initially for doing control surveys over long distances.”

As part of their decisions aviation safety agencies in the US Brazil Canada Australia the UK the European Union and elsewhere have ordered Boeing and airlines to make repairs to a flight control system blamed for the two crashes that led to the ban; update operating manuals; and increase pilot training. China the world's second-largest market for commercial air traffic is still prohibiting the plane from flying however and it hasn't indicated when it'll reverse course.

The beleaguered aircraft was grounded worldwide on March 13 2019 after two crashes one in Indonesia in 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in 2019 that killed a combined total of 346 people. Apart from the human tragedy it was a huge blow to Boeing's business since the company has thousands of 737 Max orders on its books. In addition to the flight control system at the center of both investigations other reports identified concerns with the airliner's flight control computer wiring and engines.

Airlines are now slowly adding the 737 Max back into their schedules. Southwest was the latest carrier to do so when it resumed flights March 11. The plane is now back in service with all US carriers but Boeing will have to work vigorously to retain the trust of airlines and the flying public in regard to the Max family. Here's everything else we know about what's happened with the airliner.

What happened in the two crashes?

In the first crash on Oct. 29 2018 Lion Air flight 610 dove into the Java Sea 13 minutes after takeoff from Jakarta Indonesia killing 189 people. The flight crew made a distress call shortly before losing control. That aircraft was almost brand-new having arrived at Lion Air three months earlier.

The second crash occurred on March 10 2019 when Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 departed Addis Ababa Bole International Airport bound for Nairobi Kenya. Just after takeoff the pilot radioed a distress call and was given immediate clearance to return and land. But before the crew could make it back the aircraft crashed 40 miles from the airport six minutes after it left the runway. Aboard were 149 passengers and eight crew members. The aircraft involved was only four months old.

What caused the crashes?



On Oct. 25 2019 the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee published its final report on the Lion Air crash. The report identifies nine factors that contributed to the crash but largely blames MCAS. Before crashing the Lion Air pilots were unable to determine their true airspeed and altitude and they struggled to take control of the plane as it oscillated for about 10 minutes. Each time they pulled up from a dive MCAS pushed the nose down again.

""The MCAS function was not a fail-safe design and did not include redundancy"" the report said. Investigators also found that MCAS relied on only one sensor which had a fault and flight crews hadn't been adequately trained to use the system. Improper maintenance procedures and the lack of a cockpit warning light (see below question) contributed to the crash as well.

On March 9 2020 almost one year to the day since the crash in Addis Ababa Ethiopia's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau published an interim analysis. Like the Indonesian findings it cites design flaws with MCAS such its reliance on a single angle-of-attack sensor. It also blamed Boeing for providing inadequate training to crew on using the Max's unique systems. (The Seattle Times has a great deep dive on the report.)

Unlike their Indonesian counterparts the Ethiopian investigators do not mention maintenance problems. ""The aircraft has a valid certificate of airworthiness and maintained in accordance with applicable regulations and procedures"" the report said. ""There were no known technical problems before departure.""

Remember that crash investigations are tremendously complex -- it takes months to evaluate the evidence and determine a probable cause. Investigators must examine the debris study the flight recorders and if possible check the victims' bodies to determine the cause of death. They also involve multiple parties including the airline the airplane and engine manufacturers and aviation regulatory agencies.

What is the Boeing 737 Max?



Built to compete with the Airbus A320neo the 737 Max is a family of commercial aircraft that consists of four models. The Max 8 which is the most popular version made its first flight on Jan. 29 2016 and entered passenger service with Malaysia's Malindo Air on May 22 2017. (Malindo no longer flew the plane by the time of the first crash.) Seating between 162 and 210 passengers depending on the configuration it's designed for short- and medium-haul routes but also has the range (3550 nautical miles or about 4085 miles) to fly transatlantic and between the mainland US and Hawaii. The Max 9 first flew in 2017 the Max 7 in March 2018 and the Max 10 on June 18 2021.

The design of the 737 Max series is based on the Boeing 737 an aircraft series that has been in service since 1968. As a whole the 737 family is the best-selling airliner in history. At any given time thousands of some version of it are airborne around the world and some airlines like Southwest and Ryanair have all-737 fleets. If you've flown even occasionally you've most likely flown on a 737.

What's different about the 737 Max series compared with earlier 737s?

The 737 Max can fly farther and carry more people than the previous generation of 737s like the 737-800 and 737-900. It also has improved aerodynamics and a redesigned cabin interior and flies on bigger more powerful and more efficient CFM LEAP engines. CFM is a joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran.

Those engines though required Boeing to make critical design changes. Because they're bigger and because the 737 sits so low to the ground (a deliberate design choice to let it serve small airports with limited ground equipment) Boeing moved the engines slightly forward and raised them higher under the wing. (If you place an engine too close to the ground it can suck in debris while the plane is taxiing.) That change allowed Boeing to accommodate the engines without completely redesigning the 737 fuselage -- a fuselage that hasn't changed much in 50 years.

But the new position of the engines changed how the aircraft handled in the air creating the potential for the nose to pitch up during flight. A pitched nose is a problem in flight -- raise it too high and an aircraft can stall. To keep the nose in trim Boeing designed software called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS. When a sensor on the fuselage detects that the nose is too high MCAS automatically pushes the nose down. (For background on MCAS read these excellent in-depth stories from The Air Current and The Seattle Times.)

When was the Max grounded?



About 30 airlines operated the Max by the time of the second crash (the three largest customers being Southwest Airlines American Airlines and Air Canada). Most of them quickly grounded their planes a few days later. Besides the airlines already mentioned that list includes United Airlines WestJet Aeromexico Aerolíneas Argentinas GOL Linhas Aéreas Turkish Airlines FlyDubai Air China Copa Airlines Norwegian Hainan Airlines Fiji Airways and Royal Air Maroc.

More than 40 countries also banned the 737 Max from flying in their airspace. China (a huge Boeing customer and a fast-growing commercial aviation market) led the way and was joined by Indonesia Thailand Malaysia Australia India Oman the European Union and Singapore. Canada initially hesitated but soon reversed course.

Up until March 13 2019 the FAA also declined to issue a grounding order saying in a statement tweeted the previous day that there was ""no basis to order grounding the aircraft."" That was despite a public outcry from a group of senators and two flight attendant unions. But following President Trump's decision to ground the Max that day the agency cited new evidence it had collected and analyzed.

Older 737 models like the 737-700 737-800 and 737-900 don't use MCAS and weren't affected.

Of the four 737 Max versions only the Max 10 has yet to fly. Boeing

What was the problem with the warning light?

Both the Lion Air and Ethiopian planes lacked a warning light designed to alert pilots to the faulty sensor and that Boeing sold the light as part of an optional package of equipment. When asked about the warning light a Boeing spokesman gave CNET the following statement:

""All Boeing airplanes are certified and delivered to the highest levels of safety consistent with industry standards. Airplanes are delivered with a baseline configuration which includes a standard set of flight deck displays and alerts crew procedures and training materials that meet industry safety norms and most customer requirements. Customers may choose additional options such as alerts and indications to customize their airplanes to support their individual operations or requirements.""

But on April 29 2019 The Wall Street Journal said that even for airlines that had ordered it the warning light wasn't operating on some Max planes that had been delivered (a fact the Indonesian accident report confirmed). Then on June 7 2019 Reps. Peter DeFazio a Democrat from Oregon and Rick Larsen a Democrat from Washington said they'd obtained information suggesting that even though the plane maker knew the safety alert wasn't working it decided to wait until 2020 to implement a fix.

Boeing responded to DeFazio and Larsen in a statement sent to CNET the same day.

""The absence of the AOA Disagree alert did not adversely impact airplane safety or operation"" the statement read. ""Based on the safety review the update was scheduled for the MAX 10 rollout in 2020. We fell short in the implementation of the AoA Disagree alert and are taking steps to address these issues so they do not occur again.""

The original version of the 737 first flew in 1967. Boeing

What kind of MCAS training did 737 Max pilots receive?

Not much which was a factor cited in both crash reports. As the Indonesian report said ""The absence of guidance on MCAS or more detailed use of trim in the flight manuals and in flight crew training made it more difficult for flight crews to properly respond."" Airline pilots are thoroughly trained to fly an aircraft under extraordinary circumstances but they need accurate information about factors like airspeed and altitude to be able to make quick decisions in an emergency.

Though MCAS was a new feature existing 737 pilots didn't have to train on a simulator before they could start flying the Max. Instead they learned about the differences it brought through an hour's worth of iPad-based training. MCAS received scant mention. The reason? It was because Boeing backed by the FAA wanted to minimize the cost and time of certifying pilots who'd already been trained on other 737 versions. To do so Boeing and the FAA treated the Max as just another 737 version rather than a completely new airplane (which it pretty much is).

Pilot complaints about the lack of training emerged quickly after the Lion Air crash. On Nov. 12 2018 The Seattle Times reported that Max pilots from Southwest Airlines were ""kept in the dark"" about MCAS. The Dallas Morning News found similar complaints from American Airlines pilots four months later.

What other issues with the aircraft besides MCAS were identified?

There are a few.

Were any other reports issued?



On Oct. 11 2019 an international flight safety panel issued a Joint Authorities Technical Review that faulted both the FAA and Boeing on several fronts. For the FAA it said the agency needs to modernize its aircraft certification process to account for increasingly complex automated systems.

For Boeing's part the report cited the company's ""inadequate communications"" to the FAA about MCAS pilot training and shortage of technical staff. The review was conducted by representatives from NASA the FAA and civil aviation authorities from Australia Canada China Europe Singapore Japan Brazil Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates.

How did Boeing respond?

Boeing was fully involved with both investigations early on. On Nov. 6 2018 just eight days after the first crash the company issued a safety warning advising 737 Max operators to deactivate MCAS if a flight crew encountered conditions like the Lion Air pilots experienced. It also expressed sympathy for victims' families and pledged $100 million in support and it quickly backed the US grounding order.

""There is no greater priority for our company and our industry"" Boeing said in a March 13 2019 statement. ""We are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again.""

As is common after a crash Boeing didn't comment on preliminary findings of either investigation but the day after the Ethiopian crash the company said it would issue a software update that would include changes to MCAS pilot displays operation manuals and crew training.

Following the Lion Air accident report then CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company was ""addressing"" its safety recommendations. ""We commend Indonesia's KNKT for its extensive efforts to determine the facts of this accident the contributing factors to its cause and recommendations aimed toward our common goal that this never happens again"" he said.

The grounding order also caused Boeing to halt production of the Max for four months in January 2020.

Did Boeing know about Max problems before the crashes?

There is evidence that it did. On Oct. 17 2019 Boeing revealed text messages between two of the company's top pilots sent in 2016 which indicated the company knew about problems with the MCAS system early on. In one of the messages a former chief technical pilot for the Boeing 737 described the MCAS' habit of engaging itself as ""egregious.""

Later that month as he appeared before two congressional committees Muilenburg admitted Boeing knew of the test pilot concerns in early 2019. ""I was involved in the document collection process but I relied on my team to get the documents to the appropriate authorities"" he said. ""I didn't get the details of the conversation until recently.""

Then on Jan. 10 2020 Boeing released a series of explosive emails and instant messages to Congress in which Boeing employees discussed the 737 Max. Though some expressed regret for the company's actions in getting the aircraft certified -- ""I still haven't been forgiven by God for the covering up I did last year"" one employee wrote in 2018 -- others openly discussed the 737 Max's flaws and joked about the FAA's approval process. ""This airplane is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys"" another employee wrote. (The New York Times has compiled the documents online.)

Did Boeing change its leadership?

Yes but it didn't happen quickly. Though Muilenburg apologized to the victims' families in an interview with CBS News in May 2019 he came under sharp criticism for his response to the crashes. On Oct. 11 2019 Boeing announced it had taken away his role as chair so that as CEO Muilenburg could ""focus full time on running the company as it works to return the 737 Max safely to service.""

Muilenburg spent the next two months resisting calls for his resignation from his other position but on Dec. 23 2019 the company announced that he had stepped down. ""The Board of Directors decided a change in leadership was necessary to restore confidence in the company moving forward as it works to repair relationships with regulators customers and all other stakeholders"" Boeing said in a statement. Chairman David Calhoun officially replaced Muilenburg on Jan. 13 2020.

Calhoun had defended Muilenburg before taking the top role but in a March 5 2020 interview with the New York Times he said his predecessor had needlessly rushed production of the Max before the company was ready. ""I'll never be able to judge what motivated Dennis whether it was a stock price that was going to continue to go up and up or whether it was just beating the other guy to the next rate increase.""

Separately on Oct. 22 2019 the company said it replaced Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Kevin McAllister the official overseeing the 737 Max investigation with Stan Deal former president and CEO of Boeing Global Services.

What has the FAA's role been?

Complicated. The agency quickly came under fire on multiple fronts over the crashes. Congress the FBI the Justice Department's criminal division and the Department of Transportation all called for investigations of the FAA's certification process. Under an FAA program Boeing was allowed to participate in the process meaning that it inspected its own plane.

But on Jan. 16 2020 an independent panel set up by the Department of Transportation (the FAA is a division of the DOT) dismissed that criticism. In its report the committee found no significant problems with how the Max was cleared to fly. Though the committee said the FAA could improve the certification process it saw no need for substantial changes.

Those findings were largely echoed by a report from the Department of Transportation inspector general's office on Feb. 24 that made 14 recommendations for revising the FAA's certification program. Though the 55-page report said the FAA didn't deviate from an established protocol when it first cleared the plane to fly in 2016 it significantly misunderstood the MCAS flight control system.

Outside of the certification process the FAA slapped Boeing with two fines for installing substandard or unapproved equipment in some Max planes. With the first fine which the FAA proposed in January 2020 for $5.4 million the agency said Boeing used improper equipment to guide the slats on 178 Max planes. Positioned at the leading edge of each wing slats are deployed at takeoff and landing to provide more lift. The FAA also accused Boeing of installing a guidance system on 173 Max planes that used sensors that hadn't been properly tested. The proposed penalty is $19.68 million.

Has Boeing been subject to other fines?

Yes. After the Department of Justice charged Boeing with conspiring to defraud the FAA the company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement to pay more than $2.5 billion in criminal penalties compensation payments and the establishment of a $500 million beneficiaries fund for the 346 crash victims.

Did Congress get involved?

Yes. In March 2020 the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure released a report on the design development and certification of the 737 Max and the FAA's oversight of Boeing. It said ""acts omissions and errors occurred across multiple stages and areas of the development and certification of the 737 MAX."" The report went on to identify five specific issues.

Production pressures: There was tremendous financial pressure on Boeing and the 737 Max program to compete with the A320neo leading the company to rush the plane into service.

Faulty assumptions: Boeing made fundamentally faulty assumptions about critical technologies on the 737 Max most notably with MCAS.

Culture of concealment: In several critical instances Boeing withheld crucial information from the FAA its customers and 737 Max pilots.

Conflicted representation: The FAA's current oversight structure over Boeing creates inherent conflicts of interest that have jeopardized the safety of the flying public.

Boeing's influence over the FAA's oversight: Multiple career FAA officials documented examples of FAA management overruling the determination of the agency's own technical experts at the behest of Boeing.

On Sept. 16 the House Transportation Committee issued a report that blamed the crashes on a ""horrific culmination"" of failures at Boeing and the FAA. ""In several critical instances Boeing withheld crucial information from the FAA its customers and 737 MAX pilots"" the report said. And as for the FAA ""the fact that a compliant airplane suffered from two deadly crashes in less than five months is clear evidence that the current regulatory system is fundamentally flawed and needs to be repaired.""

Then on Dec. 21 after a Senate report faulted Boeing's and the FAA's initial review of the Max Congress passed legislation that reforms the FAA's protocols for certifying new aircraft. Among other things the bill eliminates some parts of the process that allows manufacturers to certify their own planes and creates new safety review procedures and whistleblower protections.

What happened during the grounding period?

First off Max airlines had to look for parking spaces for the roughly 300 Max aircraft Boeing had delivered by the time the worldwide order went into effect. That's a tremendously complicated effort by itself.

But while airlines can't fly the plane (except to ferry empty aircraft from one airport to another) Boeing was able to conduct test flights for evaluating its proposed fixes.

On May 16 2019 the company said its updates were largely complete after more than 135 test flights. Five months later on Oct. 22 the company said it had made ""significant progress"" toward that goal by adding flight control computer redundancy to MCAS and three additional layers of protection. It also had conducted simulator tests for 445 participants from more than 140 customers and regulators. Boeing provided a further progress report Nov. 11 2019.

Boeing and the FAA finally began the recertification flights on June 29. The flights attempted to trigger the steps that led to the two crashes and confirm that MCAS isn't activating erroneously. The FAA also reviewed pilot training materials and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson piloted the plane on a Sept. 30 test flight to evaluate Boeing's changes. Speaking to reporters after the flight he said he ""liked what I saw.""

When did the FAA lift the grounding order and what are its proposed fixes?

The agency lifted the order on Nov. 19. The mandatory fixes include:

MCAS must compare data from more than one sensor and avoid relying on a single angle-of-attack sensor that's giving faulty readings.

All aircraft must have a warning light that shows when two sensors are disagreeing.

When MCAS activates it must do so only once rather than activating repeatedly (another factor that contributed to both crashes).

If MCAS is erroneously activated flight crews must always be able to counter the movement by pulling back on the control column.

Pilots must get more-rigorous training on MCAS including time in a Max simulator (see next question).

Outside of MCAS the FAA identified other modifications Boeing must make including separating two bundles of wiring that power control surfaces on the aircraft's horizontal stabilizer to ensure redundancy if one of the bundles fails.

Not everyone is trusting in the FAA's decision though. On March 10 relatives of some of the Ethiopian crash victims asked the agency to reverse its decision. In a meeting with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg they also called for several top FAA officials to be removed.

How will pilot training change?

Simulator time focusing on MCAS will now be required a change from a position the FAA previously took. It took lobbying from pilots and regulatory officials from other countries like Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau to change that decision.

They won an influential supporter on June 19 2019 when ""Miracle on the Hudson"" Capt. Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger argued before a congressional committee that simulator training should be required before pilots take the Max back into the air. He also said the original design of MCAS was ""fatally flawed and should never have been approved.""

On Jan. 7 2020 Boeing agreed when it issued a recommendation that pilots receive simulator training on MCAS before the Max returns to service. Simulator sessions will require extra time and expense for airlines struggling to get their Max fleets back in the air.

What happens next?

Before airlines can fly the Max again Boeing must work with them to make the required fixes and retrain pilots. Only then will the FAA sign off on certification for each aircraft. That will take time.

American Airlines resumed flights Dec. 29 with a Max flight between Miami and New York LaGuardia. The airline says it will continue to add Max flights ""with up to 36 departures from our Miami hub depending on the day of the week."" United Airlines resumed flights on Feb. 11 while Southwest Airlines started flying the Max again on March 11. Alaska Airlines a new 737 Max customer began flights March 1.

But that's just in the US. Aviation regulatory agencies around the world also need to approve the fix before they'll let the Max fly to the countries they oversee. Traditionally they've followed the FAA's lead on such matters but Transport Canada China the European Aviation Safety Agency and the UK's Civil Aviation Authority conducted independent tests of the plane on different timelines while working with the FAA.

Brazil's National Civil Aviation Agency lifted its grounding order Nov. 25. Canada followed on Jan. 18 the EU and the UK on Jan. 27 the United Arab Emirates on Feb. 17 Australia on Feb. 26 Fiji on March 31 and Vietnam on April 6.

China is still conducting its review and has not set a timetable for any updates.

How will I know I'm booked on a Max flight and will I be able to change my reservation?

Your aircraft type will be listed in the flight details as you book. Some airlines will spell out the full aircraft name as ""737 Max"" while other carriers may shorten it to ""7M8."" If you're not sure contact a reservations agent to confirm. Just remember though that airlines can change the aircraft type for your flight at the last minute.

For now at least all US airlines operating the Max will allow you to change your flight with penalty or cancel your trip for either a full refund or a travel credit. The exact details will vary and I wouldn't expect the policies to last forever so click the link above and confirm with your airlines as you book.

How important is the Max series to Boeing?

Hugely important. Boeing and Airbus are in a fierce battle for the 150- to 200-seat aircraft market. Following the second crash new orders for the 737 Max slowed dramatically and some carriers canceled or delayed their orders a trend only hastened by the travel slowdown from the coronavirus pandemic.

But Boeing still has almost 4000 737 Max orders on the books and new orders have started to creep up since the lifting of the grounding order. The list of buyers includes Alaska Ryanair United Virgin Australia Air Canada AeroMexico Southwest and Air Astana.

Has a commercial aircraft been grounded before?

Yes. In the most recent example the FAA grounded the Boeing 787 for three months in 2013 after a series of nonfatal battery fires. Before that the FAA grounded the Douglas DC-10 for a month in 1979 after a crash near Chicago O'Hare Airport killed 271 people on board plus two on the ground. (Outside of the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks that remains the deadliest airplane crash on US soil.) The Chicago crash was ultimately attributed to improper maintenance. The crash of a DC-10 in 1974 in France killing 346 people was caused by a design flaw on a cargo hold door latch.

Outside the US both Qantas and Singapore Airlines voluntarily grounded their Airbus A380s for a couple of days after a Qantas flight from Singapore to Sydney in 2010 had an uncontained engine failure.

Delta Air Lines started service to Reykjavik Iceland from Boston on May 20. It then restarted nonstops to the Icelandic capital from Minneapolis a week later. Service from New York started May 1. United Airlines ' first service to Dubrovnik starts July 1 from its Newark New Jersey hub. The airline plans to add July-October flights to Athens from Washington-Dulles next month on top of its service from Newark that started earlier this month.

Carriers are also beefing up schedules to Spain Portugal and Italy as those countries open up too. American Airlines  for example pushed up service from Philadelphia to Athens to the second half of August and to Rome from both Philadelphia and Chicago in September — routes it expected to resume next summer.

The European Union this week recommended adding the United States to a list of safe origin countries which could make it easier for U.S. visitors to enter the 27-country bloc this summer. The EU banned them since early in the pandemic and the change is fueling airlines' efforts to avoid another lost European summer.

The quick flight launches show airlines' scramble to drive up revenue and stem pandemic losses that total more than $32 billion for Delta United and American combined.

Airlines generally like to unveil new international destinations with fanfare several months and sometimes close to a year in advance. The long lead time gives airline marketing departments time to spark customer interest with campaigns featuring images of sun-soaked cobblestone streets or sweeping views of the Adriatic Sea. It also gives government affairs and airport teams time to secure permits and contractors to handle everything from check-in to wheelchair service to fuel on the ground long before the first flights take off.

That's out the window in the pandemic era. Airlines instead have been waiting for green lights from governments to lift travel restrictions to help rebuild international networks. Travelers have also waited longer before booking because of uncertainty caused by the pandemic.

American would normally take about a year to launch a new international route like its new Miami to Tel Aviv said Brian Znotins American Airlines' vice president of network and schedule planning. Planning new routes involves hundreds of employees he said.

""Those timelines have all been compressed. People weren't booking eight and 12 months in advance. They were booking two to three months in advance"" said Znotins. His team is ""moving at light speed.""

Patrick Quayle United's vice president of international network and alliances said demand for Dubrovnik Croatia a new market for United was so high after the airline announced it he called up the carrier's vice president of global airport operations David Kinzelman with a request: ""I would like to start it a week earlier. Can you do it?""

""We're loading it relatively late and we're putting it out there on the hope that people will book"" Quayle said. He said that demand for Croatia Greece and Iceland has ""dwarfed"" demand to the U.K. which is usually its biggest trans-Atlantic destination ""because those three countries were first out of the gate.""

Domestic leisure bookings this summer are near 2019 levels — with fares to match — but usually lucrative international travel continues to lag as many travel restrictions remain in place. That has forced U.S. carriers to focus more on U.S. destinations where in some cases they've deployed their largest jets that would normally fly across oceans.

United said its international capacity this July is 36% of its total down from a 45% share in 2019. And its domestic flights are only a quarter lower than two years ago while international capacity is off by twice as much.

But demand is rising for trips to Europe. Fare-tracking app Hopper said Friday that searches for Europe flights have nearly doubled from this time last month. Travel site Kayak said searches for European travel searches are down 11% compared with 2019 and that July airfares between the U.S. and Europe are averaging $929 about 6% below fares two years ago.

Even as airlines add more service to Europe demand and service are still off 2019 levels because the U.S. still bars most non-citizens who have been either in the European Union or the U.K. in the last two weeks despite pleas from the airline and travel industry to governments on both sides of the Atlantic. U.S. citizens can visit the U.K. but still have to quarantine.

But airlines are looking for any flights they can launch and their starting point is very low.

Passenger volumes between the U.S. and the top 25 destination countries in May were down more than 90% from 2019 with numbers between the United States and Italy the U.K. and Spain down 95% or more according to Airlines for America an industry trade group that represents most large U.S. carriers.

Covid travel restrictions have also posed challenges to airlines as they set up new flights with organizing on-the-ground facilities and staff remotely.

Kinzelman United's global airports vice president said that was the case ahead of the airline's launch of Dulles to Accra Ghana flights this year.

""We couldn't get people who normally would travel in ahead to do site audit and station visit"" he said. ""In many cases just videos like this where we would say: Take your camera and let's walk through the space. What's a customer experience going to look like? And it was super helpful.""

Kinzelman added the airline wouldn't want to do that indefinitely but said ""necessity is the mother of invention."""

The invasive bug is in the midst of a population boom and the creatures in larva stage are out in numbers not seen in over a decade according to media reports and advisories from the Department of Environmental Conservation.

Schuyler County resident Shannan Warick told Syracuse.com she moved her outdoor furniture away from caterpillar-infested trees — and the larva’s droppings.

“It sounds like it’s raining in the backyard” she said. “It’s really disgusting.”

The little buggers have torn through leafy trees like oaks and moved on to pines and needles to the point where some locals say entire forests have been drained of green. Dwight Relation owner of Rockwood Maples in West Chazy told the Press-Republican the caterpillars de-leafed his oaks pines and white birches.

“They just kept eating and eating and eating” Relation told the paper which compared the property to a scene out of Hitchcock or Kafka.

“There’s no green vegetation at all” he added. “Everything’s gone. It almost looks like it got hit with a nuke … like a chemical and it just killed everything in sight for hundreds of yards.”

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) recommends scraping egg masses off of trees or drowning caterpillars in soapy water — but warns against touching them because the hairs on their back can cause skin irritation.

Their eggs alone can be a nuisance.

“Gypsy moth will lay its egg masses on anything outdoors it doesn’t have to be trees” DEC Forester Rob Cole said during a Facebook Live on the outbreak.

“It’ll lay egg masses on the side of your house on your outdoor equipment on your patio furniture.”

Chris Koetzle supervisor of the town of Glenville told News 10 ABC he feels “stuck” without a lot of answers.

“They’re talking about individually drowning the caterpillar — which there are millions of them — so that’s not really practical” Koetzle said.

The caterpillars are likely to become moths in July according to the DEC. The outbreaks can last about two or three years the agency stated

Gypsy moths were brought from Europe in the 1800s by an entrepreneur looking to increase silk production Cole stated. They escaped their cages and are now present throughout the Northeast and Midwest and are moving south he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cGxvcmVqZWZmZXJzb25wYS5jb20vbG9jYWwvMjAyMS8wNi8xOS9ub3RpY2VhYmxlLWd5cHN5LW1vdGgtZGVmb2xpYXRpb24tYW50aWNpcGF0ZWQtdGhpcy15ZWFyLTExNzkxOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Noticeable Gypsy Moth Defoliation Anticipated This Year,"WARREN Pa. — Recreational users on the Allegheny National Forest (ANF) report seeing abundant populations of gypsy moth caterpillars — particularly across the northern half of the Bradford Ranger District.

“The DNCR Bureau of Forestry has received similar reports about gypsy moth caterpillars defoliating trees on private lands in the region.” said Cornplanter District Forester Cecile Stelter.

Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) a non-native invasive species from Europe has been in Pennsylvania since 1932 and is notorious for occurring in boom and bust cycles. “When populations are high like they are this year large quantities of foliage are consumed and complete defoliation of forested areas may occur. Most healthy trees will grow new leaves in response to the defoliation but some trees that are already weakened by other stressors may not withstand severe defoliation.” said ANF Silviculturist Josh Hanson.

Although oak trees are preferred gypsy moth caterpillars will feed on numerous other tree and shrub species. Other species on their menu include alder apple aspen basswood birches (gray white and river) boxelder hawthorn larch and witch-hazel.

To limit defoliation and the negative impacts associated with it the Forest Service and the DCNR Bureau of Forestry completed aerial suppression treatments across portions of seven ANF recreation areas totaling 2850 acres. Hooks Brook Boat Access Campground Tracy Ridge Recreation Area Handsome Lake Boat Access Campground Hopewell Boat Access Campground The Trails at Jakes Rocks Rimrock Hiking Trail and Overlook and the Morrison Hiking Trail were all treated with Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk)—a naturally occurring soil bacteria and insecticide that is commonly used in organic agriculture. These treatments were part of the Bureau of Forestry’s 2021 gypsy moth suppression program that treated a total of 203569 acres of state forests parks and game lands across Pennsylvania.

Spray treatments are conducted in spring when the caterpillars are small and before extensive defoliation damage occurs.

Two diseases can affect older gypsy moth caterpillar populations and have caused prior outbreaks to collapse. One disease is a nucleopolyhedrosis virus (NPV) which is naturally present in gypsy moth populations and generally causes high mortality only when the gypsy moth populations are at very high densities. The other disease is a fungus called Entomophaga maimaiga is native to Japan and was introduced to the northeastern United States in the early 1990s as a biological control for gypsy moth. Weather plays an important role in determining how effective E. maimaiga will be. Like most fungi the spores need moisture and high humidity to germinate. Frequent rain and warm temperatures in May and June can contribute to the fungus becoming active during gypsy moth outbreaks. Caterpillars folded in half like an upside-down “V” are killed by the virus those hanging head down are killed by the fungus and caterpillars with their heads up are still alive.

The species formerly known as the gypsy moth caterpillar is back with a vengeance.

Its Latin name is lymantria dispar dispar or LDD and these critters are decimating leaves in our region. The LDD favor the leaves of oaks maples and apple trees along with all kinds of different deciduous trees.

Listed as one of the hundred most destructive invasive species in the word its larvae consume the leaves of over 500 species of trees shrubs and plants and you may be noticing them in your trees right now.

Most years a fungus in the atmosphere kills the larvae and keeps them in check. However the weather this spring may have favored the caterpillars over the fungus.

There are some techniques to combat the crunching munching LDD caterpillars. And if you have healthy older and established trees they will probably weather the caterpillars just fine.

The trees you really want to protect from these invasives are the ones you may have just planted this spring.

The method to combat the critters is a simple one: use soap and water.

In the morning or evening go out to your trees armed with a pail of soapy water then simply pick them off the leaves and tree trunk and knock them into the pail.

You can try another trick to trap the critters: wrap burlap or sticky tape around the tree trunks. This method can help trap and gather the caterpillars and then you can shake them into that soapy water.

Q: My phlox all have black spots and yellowed dropping lower leaves. I removed the bad leaves and sprayed them with baking soda and water last week and still have spots. Then a gardener said to spray with a 1:2 ratio of hydrogen peroxide to water which I did yesterday but I am worried that the disease will spread everywhere. — Kate in Jamaica

It's not unusual to have the black spots on phlox especially during humid weather. The yellowing of the phox leaves could be caused by powdery mildew which phlox is known to get.

You might try another flower variety that is more disease-resistant like David phlox.

If you are going to spray something on your phlox leaves the baking soda spray is a good choice. There is also an organic spray called Serenade which is a bacteria that fights the fungus.

And both baking soda and the fungicide work best as preventive sprays. Use them early on before you see signs of the damage and they'll help keep the plants healthy.

Q: I'm interested in flowers that attract bees in the narrow space between my house and the neighbor's next door. It only gets direct sunlight for an hour or two each day. This spring I picked shade wildflower seeds to scatter. My only concern is getting stuff to grow for bees. — Robyn in Denver CO

If you have a shady spot you can still grow a bee garden!

Some options that do well in shade or part shade are flowers like bleeding hearts. Lamium is another great choice as its a ground cover that flowers early and thrives in shade.

You can also plant coral bells and hellebores which is an early-flowering plant and perennial. Some other great choices that do well in shade and that bees love are companula and ligularia which is a summer- and fall-blooming flower.

Get the right plants for your shade garden and you'll support the bees as well!

There are so many gypsy moth caterpillars in the canopy above the Heritage hiking trail in Pinery Provincial Park you can actually hear them.

""Yeah there's sort of that little patter in the background"" said Alistair MacKenzie a manager with Ontario Parks who's been working at the Pinery near Grand Bend for two decades.

In fact that ""patter"" sounds a lot like rain. Except it's not. It's something scientists call ""frass.""

""Scientists have lots of different names for scat"" MacKenzie said.

According to the federal government the gypsy moth is found mainly in Ontario Quebec and the Maritime provinces.

In southern Ontario communities panic over a gypsy moth invasion that's left hundreds of suburban trees wrapped in duct tape and burlap. Mississauga for one monitors and controls gypsy moth populations identifies areas where there are high numbers and treats city-owned trees including scraping egg masses off infected trees where they may also hang traps to catch male moths and prevent them from mating.

However MacKenzie who's in charge of protecting one of the rarest and most fragile ecosystems in Ontario is a lot more relaxed about the situation.

""To be honest at present we're really just observing"" he said. ""We're not anticipating any long-term effects from this.""

It seems counterintuitive especially when cities such as nearby London Ont. have called community meetings about the insects and used airplanes to get rid of them while media coverage about the caterpillars uses words and phrases like ""dreaded"" ""tree killer"" and ""voracious threat.""

""I think it's a sign that people are just getting a little bit removed from nature"" MacKenzie said.

""We know this species from decades of research by experts is one that goes through boom and bust cycles. It's likely we'll have this outbreak for three to five years and then they'll diminish and become another background species in the forest.

""There's no intention for Ontario Parks to do any spraying or any treatments in any of our properties this year"" he said.

""It's important that when we talk about invasive species we weigh the impact from the species itself and the control mechanisms that might be available.""

Ontario Parks to let nature take its course

Instead MacKenzie said in a forest it makes more sense to let nature take its course. While the damage borne by a gypsy moth caterpillar may be ugly it's unlikely the critters will actually kill their hosts.

Burlap or duct tape can be seen wrapped around trees in many suburban neighbourhoods across southern Ontario to defend trees against gypsy moth caterpillars. (Colin Butler/CBC News)

""It doesn't make a lot of sense for them.""

He notes it is possible but usually because something else such as drought fungus or some other insect is also affecting the tree's health. It's not in a gypsy moth caterpillar's interest to actually finish off its meal.

""If they eat themselves out of a house and home their next generation won't necessarily survive. So by nature they move across the landscape and go through these cycles of abundance and decline.""

The last time the Pinery went through a major gypsy moth caterpillar infestation was in 1994. This time around the park is in its third year of an infestation that can last anywhere from three to seven years.

Last year the insects consumed so many leaves that much of the canopy along nearby Highway 21 and the park's entrance looked ragged and bare giving visitors to the park an eye-opening first impression of what under normal circumstances is supposed to be one of Ontario's ecological jewels.

Caterpillars may be around till late June early July

""To many people it appears the trees have all died. So there are questions about 'Was it a fire?' 'Is there some other stressor going on?' Thankfully most trees especially the oak trees here have a lot resilience.""

It's one of the lessons human beings often fail to learn: if we just stay out of the way nature often works things out on its own. It's why the Pinery is trying to educate visitors about the pests and how to best tolerate them and what they leave behind.

""We anticipate the worst of the sort of inconvenience of the caterpillars and their frass falling from the canopy will be over by the end of June or early July"" said MacKenzie.

""We ask people to just sort of roll with it. It's one of those stressors that will ultimately make this park more diverse. Even if some trees do succumb it will open up sunny opening in the forest that will lead to more species and other species growing.""

MacKenzie said the park is asking visitors to consider wearing long-sleeved shirts and hats in case caterpillars drop down from the trees on silken threads emphasizing there's no immediate health risks from the insects."

According to the plans areas of both floors are set to be revamped with a focus on bringing office spaces up to a higher standard.

The refurbishment would include the introduction of air conditioning to improve ventilation in the spaces as well as improving their appearance.

A report submitted with the application said the work will aim to make the spaces more appealing to potential tenants.

The report from commercial real estate company CBRE said: “Currently the spaces are dated and with minimal building services installations.

“The purpose of this project is to improve the services provision and presentation of the spaces to assist lettings.”

The Port of Liverpool Building housed the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board which administers the city’s port from 1907 to 1994.

Later sold to a property company the building underwent a far more extensive refurbishment between 2006 and 2009 to restore its older features.

Each time losing bidders have protested alleging improprieties in the way the state picked winners. Twice in 2016 and 2018 Commonwealth Court judges agreed. The current protests against the winners announced last summer are pending in the same court.

“The plans see this as really big business” said Katherine Hempstead a senior policy adviser at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation the nation’s largest health philanthropy in Princeton. That’s why they protest every loss nationwide though the length of the protests in Pennsylvania may be extreme she said. “By stalling it they get a stay of execution.”

The losers’ protests underscore the importance of government backed insurance programs — Medicaid Medicare and individual Affordable Care Act plans often bought with the help of tax subsidies — as a source of growth for insurers Hempstead and other experts said.

Medicaid rolls in particular have surged during the pandemic driven by millions of people losing their jobs and their health insurance.

But dragging out the appeals for years has a potential downside for consumers because they need both stability and competition to benefit said Patrick Keenan director of consumer protections and policy at the Pennsylvania Health Access Network a nonprofit advocacy group.

“Stability helps plans develop relationships with patients and implement long-term strategies to improve outcomes while at the same time competition is necessary to ensure plans remain responsive to patients’ needs and their strategies don’t stagnate” he said.

The Pennsylvania Department of Human Services which oversees the state’s Medicaid program called HealthChoices runs the bidding process and said its hands are tied until the court rules.

Historically states have chosen private insurers to manage Medicaid benefits to save money. “They were just getting killed in terms of their state budgets. Twenty-five or 30% of their state budgets were going for Medicaid” recalled Michael McCue a professor emeritus at Virginia Commonwealth University who has studied Medicaid managed care.

Despite a history of Medicaid managed care dating to the 1990s Pennsylvania’s spending on Medicaid accounted for 28% of general funds in 2019 according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That’s among the highest ratios in the nation.

Medicaid profits as a percentage of revenue are not huge experts said but can still be substantial given the amount of money in the program. The average operating profit before taxes and investment income for Pennsylvania’s Medicaid managed care companies was 2.4% in 2017 said Allan Baumgarten an independent analyst in Minneapolis.

“When you compare it to pharmaceutical companies it doesn’t sound like much of anything but for insurance companies an operating gain of 2.4% is very good” said Baumgarten who last year authored a study of Medicaid managed care for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Over the last five years AmeriHealth Caritas a sister company to Independence Blue Cross has averaged a smaller net profit of 0.55% but that added up to a five-year total of $300 million. Medicaid has accounted for a significant portion of Independence’s growth over the last three years.

That trend will continue with AmeriHealth Caritas about to start providing services in North Carolina and being selected a winner in Ohio last month.

With so much money at stake Aetna Better Health of Pennsylvania UnitedHealthcare of Pennsylvania and others have refused to walk away without a fight.

Aetna which now operates statewide has been shut out twice in a row winning none of the state’s five geographic zones. Thanks to protests which prevent the state from completing the process Aetna has collected a total of $3.9 billion in Pennsylvania Medicaid revenue since 2017 when new contracts were originally supposed to go into effect.

Asked for comment on its current protest an Aetna spokesperson sent a link to the Commonwealth Court website. Aetna is fighting in that appeals court to obtain records of last year’s selection process using the state’s Right-to-Know Law.

UnitedHealthcare initially did better getting picked in 2016 for Medicaid contracts in all five zones. But since then its fortunes have dwindled getting the nod for just one zone the Southeast last summer. In the last four years UnitedHealth has collected $4.7 billion in Medicaid revenue in Pennsylvania by providing services in three zones.

“While we are pleased to continue 30 years of service to our HealthChoices members in Southeastern Pennsylvania we are disappointed about the overall decisions” a UnitedHealthcare spokesperson said. “We are actively pursuing all available remedies.”

Two other bidders also protested the latest picks.

Gateway Health Plan Inc. a joint venture of Pittsburgh-based Blue Cross Blue Shield insurer Highmark Inc. and Trinity Health a national Catholic hospital system was dropped to one zone last summer — after being picked for five zones in 2017. The company did not respond to a request for information about its protest.

Centene Corp. which operates here as Pennsylvania Health & Wellness is the fourth protester. The St. Louis company by far the largest Medicaid insurer in the country is a relative newcomer to Pennsylvania having won a contract in 2016 to manage long-term services such as home care and nursing homes. It has the smallest market share in the business behind Independence unit AmeriHealth Caritas and UPMC.

Some in the industry expected Centene to win a large chunk of the Pennsylvania business. It did at first winning three zones with the largest number of Medicaid beneficiaries the Southeast the Southwest and one that stretched from the Lehigh Valley to Fulton County.

But in the most recent bidding round it was shut out. The company declined comment.

The big winners last year selected to offer services statewide but held up by their competitors’ protests were AmeriHealth Caritas Health Partners Plans Geisinger and UPMC for You.

What went wrong with the state’s process? The Human Services Department was tripped up during the protests in 2016 and 2017 by its use of a secret criteria in the selection process favoring legacy operators to avoid disruption in the marketplace and making improper communications with Centene executives.

The current protests include allegations that state officials took an idea from UnitedHealth’s application and shared it with other bidders. Aetna alleged that UPMC should not have been eligible because it had a work stoppage within the last five years at one of its hospitals.

The biggest winner last summer was Health Partners Plans Inc. a nonprofit in Philadelphia that was selected for all five zones up from one zone now the Southeast which covers Bucks Chester Delaware Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties.

Health Partners which is expected to be acquired by Thomas Jefferson University in December had little to say about the protests that could upend its chance to expand statewide. The company had a profit of $23.5 million on revenue of $1.78 billion in 2019 according to its audited financial statement.

It’s unclear how long Commonwealth Court will take to work though the appeals.

The new contracts have a long term — five years — with the possibility of three one-year extensions.

“That raises the stakes too” said Hempstead the Robert Wood Johnson expert. “If you lose you might not get another bite at the apple for a while.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGx0b2RheS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9tZXRyby9rc2RrLW5ld3MtYW5jaG9yLWFubmUtYWxscmVkLWhhcy1iZWVuLXRocm91Z2gtYS1yb3VnaC1maXZlLXllYXJzL2FydGljbGVfNmQyOTk2N2QtM2Q1My01MTBjLTk3ZmYtMWIzYzNiNzVkZTU2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KSDK news anchor Anne Allred has been through a rough five years,"Anne Allred is familiar with the Bible passage about God not giving anyone more problems than they can handle.

And in light of the trials recently thrown in Allred’s path the KSDK news anchor’s reaction should come as no surprise.

“Well God certainly wasn’t pulling any punches the last five years” she said.

A few years before COVID-19 shutdowns Allred endured a difficult pregnancy that caused her daughter to be born three months premature.

Just weeks after that Allred’s kidneys failed and she had to endure seven months of daily dialysis until she underwent a transplant operation.

And now because transplant patients have to be especially careful about viruses and infectious diseases her post-coronavirus world has yet to return to anything close to its old normal.

“Sometimes I feel like I’m the only person not moving on with life after COVID-19” Allred said in her usual style — to the point fact-filled and anger-free.

“But that’s OK because I’m done with the whole ‘woe is me’ part.”

Road to success

Allred is a St. Louis girl to the bone even though she spent almost 10 years out of town as she worked at several television stations.

Born in Kirkwood the 39-year-old Allred is the daughter of Allen Allred a retired lawyer and Dawn Allred-Kraemer. She has two younger brothers.

Allred went to high school at Villa Duchesne where she was the editor of the high school newspaper and seemed to be headed toward a career in print reporting.

In fact she kept that goal her first two years at Ohio State University. But after her sophomore year she came home for the summer and worked an internship at KSDK. When she returned to college her focus switched to television news.

Anne Allred Occupation • News anchor KSDK (Channel 5) Age • 39 Family • She and her husband Drew Lammert were married in 2014 and have one daughter Nora who turned 5 in May. Home • Creve Coeur Causes • March of Dimes Mid-America Transplant National Kidney Foundation. Favorite book • “The Tender Bar” by J.R. Moehringer What you don’t know about her • An admitted candy addict she has never had a single cavity.

After graduating from Ohio State with a journalism degree she headed off to her first TV job in North Carolina. Then she returned to Columbus Ohio for her second gig.

In 2006 she was hired by WHDH (Channel 7) in Boston that market’s NBC affiliate at the time. She worked there for almost seven years the last five as co-host of the morning news show.

To say she was held in high regard by her former colleagues would be an understatement.

Less than a year after joining KSDK Allred returned to Boston in October 2013 to cover the Cardinals in the World Series against the Red Sox.

Her reunion with old work pals broadcasting outside of Fenway Park was a prime example of the irreverent one-of-the-guys reunions reserved for respected former colleagues complete with hugs high-fives and cries of “deserter” and “traitor.”

When Allred told the Boston crew that “of course I’m rooting for the Cardinals” her former co-host Byron Barnett accused Allred of reading that line from a cue card.

Coming back home

After being hired by KSDK and returning home in January 2013 all signs indicated that good things were coming Allred’s way.

First assigned as mainly a nightside reporter Allred anchored only the 5 p.m. weeknight newscasts with Mike Bush.

But within a year she was added to the 10 p.m. edition and became the main co-anchor along with Bush.

The pair now anchors the two main newscasts at 6 and 10 p.m. and Allred has picked up several local Emmy Awards along the way.

Even better the personal side of her life was coming up roses. In 2014 she married Drew Lammert a lawyer at McCarthy Leonard and Kaemmerer.

Lammert went to De Smet Jesuit High School and was part of Allred’s group of pals from her high school days a group that has maintained its ties over 20 years.

And the good news just kept breaking. In early 2016 Allred announced she was having a baby.

Turn for the worse

But soon after that Allred’s story took its challenging turn.

The baby Nora was due to arrive in late August but instead made her appearance on May 25 2016 — three months early.

Nora spent the first 96 days of her life in St. Louis Children’s Hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit.

“I didn’t even get to see her the first three days. And when I did she was in this plastic box her skin was almost transparent.

“I mean I didn’t even get to hold her” Allred said her voice cracking slightly for the only time during an interview with the Post-Dispatch.

Nora’s condition slowly but steadily improved but the same could not be said for Allred’s.

In early July about six weeks after Nora was born Allred’s kidneys failed.

Doctors told her the kidney problems started with preeclampsia during her pregnancy which then triggered a rare disorder that causes blood clots in major organs.

“They were telling me I had clots all over my body” she said. “The doctors were freaking out.”

Allred underwent surgery and was hospitalized numerous times. She had daily dialysis treatment because her kidneys were operating at about 3% efficiency.

“That summer I’d spend nine hours a day on dialysis and then I’d go see my daughter in the NICU” Allred said.

“That whole summer is still cloudy in my memory” she said dismissing the old adage about taking things one day at a time. “I was taking it one breath at a time.”

Another challenge Allred faced during her recovery was internal a product of her personality.

“Drew was a champion along with my family and friends” Allred said but then confessed. “But for a control freak like me it’s really hard to just say ‘you take care of it.’”

But of all the support Allred received that summer she made special note of her mother who often was the person pushing Allred’s wheelchair when she couldn't get around on her own.

“My mom was my rock” she said. “And I realized that anything that hurt her daughter hurt her too.”

Back at work

Allred managed to return to work in October 2016. Even though she was undergoing daily dialysis she still managed to anchor the 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. newscasts.

But early 2017 brought a shot of the best news. Allred told viewers in January that an old friend called her to say he was a donor match.

At that time the donor did not want to be identified but he has since acquiesced.

“His name is Mike Zangara a De Smet guy one of that old group of friends from high school” Allred said who then leaned forward to supervise the note-taking.

“That’s Mike Zangara Z-a-n-g-a-r-a.”

So by mid-2017 and for the next two-plus years Allred’s life returned to some version of normal — albeit one that included ongoing concerns about Nora’s health the need for periodic infusions and the back-of-mind reality that somewhere down the road Allred likely will need another transplant.

And then came coronavirus.

Going viral

In the early spring of 2020 while the nation wondered how dangerous the virus would prove to be transplant recipients had no doubts.

Because of her transplant Allred takes medication to suppress her immune system and therefore was in the highest-risk category.

So early on in the outbreak Allred sequestered herself at her west St. Louis County home and a studio was installed for her to handle her anchoring duties.

Allred did not return to the KSDK studios until last month where she wears a mask whenever possible and tries as best she can to maintain a 6-foot social distance.

Carol Fowler KSDK’s content director came to the station two years ago well after Allred’s transplant.

“So I sort of inherited her but it didn’t take long: I like Anne a lot” Fowler said then noted Allred’s skills.

“She’s whip-smart a good writer and she’s always willing to roll up her sleeves and get things done” Fowler said.

Over time the normally private Allred shared some of her ordeal with Fowler.

“And when I started to get a peek behind the curtain well I’m frankly in awe of what she’s accomplished” Fowler said.

As to the continuing coronavirus situation Allred said: “Forget COVID. When you’re a transplant patient a cold is a big thing.”

And like many others stuck at home during the shutdowns Allred engaged in some heavy-duty closet cleaning which proved to be an emotional experience.

“I found all of these things that people sent me during the time with Nora and my transplant” she said.

“There were trinkets prayer cards medals handwritten messages even handmade blankets. And all from people I’ve never even met” she said still sounding surprised several years later by all the goodwill.

When asked what lessons she may have learned over her last five years Allred did not miss a beat.

“You know I’ve thought about that a lot and there is only one thing I know for sure” Allred said.

“I know I would do it all over again — all of it — to have that child.”

Texas power companies remotely adjusted the temperature of customers' smart thermometers KHOU 11 reported.

Customers had unknowingly enrolled in a promotion letting companies raise the temperature to save energy.

Texas regulators asked residents last week to conserve energy amid an early summer heat wave.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Texas power companies heated up some customers' homes last week by remotely controlling their smart thermostats KHOU 11 reported on Thursday.

Some residents in the state which is facing a heat wave that's straining its power grid told KHOU 11 that they had awoken sweating and shocked that their homes had gotten as hot as 78 degrees without them changing the temperature.

It turns out that they had unknowingly enrolled their thermostats in an energy conservation promotion called ""Smart Savers Texas"" run by a company called EnergyHub in partnership with power companies. The program gives EnergyHub permission to adjust participants' smart thermostats remotely during times of peak energy demand in exchange for entry into a sweepstakes.

""During a demand response event Smart Savers Texas increases the temperature on participating thermostats by up to four degrees to reduce energy consumption and relieve stress on the grid"" Erika Diamond EnergyHub's vice president of customer solutions told Insider adding that ""the ability to reduce energy consumption is critical to managing the grid in Texas and nationwide.""

Thermostat owners typically get an offer to participate in the program from their device manufacturer or energy provider via mobile app or email Diamond said and ""every participant actively agrees to the terms of the program and can opt-out of a demand response event at any time.""

Diamond told USA Today that demand response events occur rarely around two to eight times per summer.

EnergyHub did not immediately have a response to Insider's questions about whether it notifies participants before adjusting their thermostats.

CenterPoint Energy a major energy provider in Texas told KPRC 2 that it had ""conducted a test curtailment event from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m."" on June 16 and that at its direction EnergyHub ""adjusted the thermostat set point for those enrolled customers.""

Months after winter storms overloaded Texas' power grid leaving millions without power or clean water the state is dealing with a heat wave that led the state's top energy regulator the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to ask residents to conserve power last week.

Smart thermostats allow power companies one way to reduce strain on a power grid at scale but they also sparked privacy and safety concerns for some residents that weren't aware what they had enrolled in.

""Was my daughter at the point of overheating?"" Brandon English a Deer Park Texas resident told KHOU 11 adding: ""She's 3 months old. They dehydrate very quickly.""

""I wouldn't want anybody else controlling my things for me"" English told KHOU 11 saying that he unenrolled his thermostat after the event.

Charles Schwab is hiring for more than 1000 new roles in North Texas expanding its local workforce by about 20% after moving its headquarters to Westlake earlier this year.

The new positions will cover Schwab and TD Ameritrade and will span roles in financial consulting client service and technology a Thursday release said. The announcement comes as brokerage accounts have shot up within the company increasing by 3.2 million in the first quarter of the year exceeding the company’s 2020 total.

“Dallas-Fort Worth is a big part of our history and our future” said Rob Mundell senior vice president of talent solutions in a prepared statement. “With the region’s highly skilled talent pool we have been growing rapidly in the Metroplex.”

The company has more than 5100 employees in North Texas — about 2500 of which work from its Westlake headquarters. The home base move in January came on the heels of Schwab’s acquisition of TD Ameritrade in a stock transaction valued at $26 billion last year.

Weeks after the deal closed Schwab announced it would reduce its workforce by about 1000 to decrease redundant roles across the firms per a statement though the company didn’t disclose how many North Texas jobs would be affected.

Part of the company's brokerage success came in January when day-trading app Robinhood suspended purchases of Gamestop shares and other stocks according to reporting from the San Francisco Business Times.

“We now realize that as we progress in the integration with TD Ameritrade we need to think about capacity in an entirely different light” CEO Walt Bettinger said on a call with analysts in April the San Francisco publication reported.

Bettinger and COO Joe Martinetto said on the call the company needed to update its TD Ameritrade integration plan to keep up with demand which surpassed Schwab’s models. More than 1.5 million of the new brokerage accounts were new-to-firm households — 70 percent of which were below the age of 40 Martinetto said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMDYvMjAvc2hvdy1lbS10aGUtbW9uZXktYWdhaW4tdGV4YXMtYXBwcm92ZXMtYW5vdGhlci0xMDAtbWlsbGlvbi10by1lbnRpY2UtYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wNi8yMC9zaG93LWVtLXRoZS1tb25leS1hZ2Fpbi10ZXhhcy1hcHByb3Zlcy1hbm90aGVyLTEwMC1taWxsaW9uLXRvLWVudGljZS1idXNpbmVzc2VzLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Show ’em the money (again): Texas approves another $100 million to entice businesses,"The state’s best-known corporate incentive program the Texas Enterprise Fund got its usual vote of confidence last month. Lawmakers in Austin approved another $100 million for the next two years allocating roughly the same amount to the so-called deal-closing fund as in recent legislative sessions.

That’s welcome news in Dallas-Fort Worth where projects over the years have won $289 million in enterprise awards more than any region in the state.

In the most recent two-year period D-FW companies won over three-quarters of the funds awarded. That includes millions in grants for Uber Technologies in Dallas Microsoft in Irving Texas Instruments in Richardson Wesco Aircraft Hardware in Fort Worth and the Professional Golfers’ Association of America in Frisco.

The question is: How much of the money will be well-spent?

From 2019 through 2020 four companies completed their enterprise deals as advertised according to the latest report to the Legislature from the governor’s office. But 15 companies terminated their contracts presumably because some wouldn’t meet their commitments.

The terminations freed up over $23 million to be returned to the fund. The state also clawed back $4 million more in awards because participants didn’t hit hiring numbers.

Some see those refunds as evidence of a flawed program while others believe the opposite — that they show the state’s increased oversight is working.

“We certainly see improvement in our monitoring and compliance” said Adriana Cruz executive director of Economic Development and Tourism for the Office of the Governor. “A lot of those payments and liquidated damages are from prior years and as those old contracts expire they’ll be even lower. There also may be no clawbacks because they’re all performance-based now.”

The fund was created in 2003 and in the early years it provided money to companies soon after they announced expansion plans. But a 2014 state audit found that the office of then-Gov. Rick Perry did not have good controls to monitor the process and company commitments. Almost half the money especially in the early years was awarded without contracts or specific job-creation pledges.

That led to major reforms and now taxpayer money is distributed only after hiring and investments have been made — and new jobs and wages confirmed. Companies receive about $1000 to $10000 per job depending on median wages capital investments and other details.

“Every year they’ve operated the enterprise fund the due diligence has gotten better” said Bill Sproull CEO of the Richardson Chamber of Commerce. “The return the state’s seeking the clawbacks in case the investment doesn’t happen the terms of the deal negotiated on the state’s behalf — they’re all better.

“From a taxpayer perspective you have to appreciate what the governor’s office has done to really tighten up that program” Sproull said.

After the 2014 audit the amount of reclaimed money soared. For the 2015-16 biennium the governor’s office collected over $19 million in clawbacks and termination payments from companies that hadn’t produced the specified results. Over $12 million more was returned as unencumbered funds which means the companies dropped out.

Combined over $31 million was returned to the enterprise fund. In 2017-18 nearly $36 million was returned although the total from clawbacks fell sharply.

In 2019-20 over $27 million was returned representing a decline in troubled deals. As Cruz said she expects the returned awards to continue to decline as older flawed contracts are replaced with ones that pay only after jobs are delivered.

In past legislative sessions there were efforts to cut corporate incentives including the enterprise fund. Last month lawmakers failed to authorize an extension of the Chapter 313 program which allows big projects to reduce their school taxes.

The 313 program started a few years before the enterprise fund and school districts have approved $10.8 billion in tax breaks over the past two decades. But the program has been riddled with abuses primarily around projects that were coming to Texas anyway — and still got the tax breaks.

While lawmakers opted to let funding for 313 run out at the end of 2022 they approved another $100 million for the enterprise fund.

“I hope this is a sign that our state legislators and leadership are comfortable with the program and how it’s being managed and operated” said Cruz who was appointed executive director of economic development in October 2019.

The enterprise fund was created not long after Boeing Co. selected Chicago over Dallas for its corporate headquarters. Elected leaders and economic development officials argued that Texas needed an extra incentive — more than the usual tax abatements — to win relocation contests against other states.

They settled on cash positioning the grants as the last “deal-closing” piece in the recruitment process. From late 2003 through March 2021 the fund made award offers to over 180 projects.

Recipients pledged to create at least 104507 direct jobs and invest $34.1 billion according to the latest quarterly update posted online. The enterprise fund made offers totaling nearly $679 million and through March it had distributed $539 million.

“In my opinion it’s the most valuable economic development tool we’ve got — because it’s cash” Sproull said. “It gives the state the ability to come in on any project that creates a lot of jobs and make an investment that’s meaningful to the company.”

During the pandemic there’s been an increase in corporate interest in the enterprise fund Cruz said. Her agency is getting about 70 inquiries a quarter from potential prospects roughly double the number it received before the pandemic.

Kelley Rendziperis of the Site Selection Group said the Dallas-based location consulting firm is busier than ever. It has a backlog of projects delayed by the pandemic many clients that want to reduce their existing footprint and companies whose businesses soared during the past year.

“Incentives are definitely at the forefront for most of the executive teams” she said “Because of the pandemic everybody is trying to be profitable and make [sound] economic decisions — and the incentive piece folds in there.”

Nathan Jensen a government professor at the University of Texas at Austin has criticized the state’s incentive programs including the enterprise fund. But he prefers cash awards to abatements especially on school taxes.

“I know it sounds weird but if you’re going to give incentives cash is a much more efficient way” Jensen said. “It can help startups that need capital. Cash grants also are more transparent. We know exactly how much is being given and people can decide whether they think it’s worth it.”",,,,,,,,,

Photo-Illustration: Joe Darrow

This article was featured in One Great Story New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.

Pat Kiernan wanted the bagels. It was January 15 2020 — National Bagel Day — and the crew of NY1’s morning show Mornings on 1 had already pillaged the breakfast platter in the control room when word came down that it was being requested on set. The bagels had been sent to weekend anchor Kristen Shaughnessy but Kiernan didn’t ask where they’d come from until he and his co-anchors were under the lights ready to go live. “The second he heard that it was Kristen it was like Do not touch — it’s poison” says a colleague. “They literally dropped the bagels” says a former producer.

Shaughnessy and Kiernan had worked together at NY1 for more than two decades. On 9/11 Shaughnessy reported live with Kiernan as the south tower collapsed Kiernan from the anchor desk Shaughnessy from outside the World Trade Center. They were both part of the ragtag team hired at the 24-hour local-news station in the ’90s when NY1 seemed like a launchpad for a sparkling career in broadcast journalism. The news team was young back then: Shaughnessy and Kiernan were in their 20s; their managers were barely over 30. They were cub reporters convinced they weren’t simply doing a job but performing a public service. It felt like a family.

Viewers were still buying into the camaraderie years after the chummy vibe had begun to dissipate behind the scenes the launchpad morphing into something of a professional flytrap. To watch NY1 — at home or in a laundromat a nail salon or the waiting room of a doctor’s office — and recognize its faces was to be a true New Yorker. Sure the major networks had fancy studios and flattering lighting but NY1 was where New Yorkers learned about a delay on the Q train and had the day’s headlines read to them as they swigged their coffee. NY1 wasn’t polished but it made good on its promise: hyperlocal news delivered by someone who could very well live in your neighborhood.

Then in 2019 the public illusion of the NY1 family blew up. Shaughnessy and co-anchors Roma Torre Amanda Farinacci Vivian Lee and Jeanine Ramirez sued NY1’s parent company Charter Communications for age and gender discrimination. All five women who ranged in age from 40 to 61 at the time claimed they had been pushed aside in favor of younger less experienced (and presumably cheaper) talent — mostly women in their 20s and 30s the same ages they had been when they were hired. Kiernan now 52 was used as a benchmark; it was alleged that he made significantly more money than Torre despite having similar responsibilities and was given more resources. The drama played out in the newsroom — hence the bagel incident — and in the city tabloids.

The allegations in the lawsuit were damning but not shocking. TV has always been a brutal business for women particularly women over 40. It’s no coincidence that 75 percent of broadcast news is reported by men and that roughly two-thirds of prime-time-TV news shows feature male anchors and correspondents per an analysis by the Women’s Media Center. But the real damage was in the details. The drama around the lawsuit revealed not simply sexism at the station but a sharp-elbowed culture in which the rewards were meager and the egos outsize. The sense that only a chosen few would get to shine turned a once-collegial news channel into a den of vipers.

NY1 launched in 1992 the brainchild of then–Time Warner Cable executive Dick Aurelio a former deputy mayor of New York who had worked as a reporter and editor for Newsday in the 1950s. Aurelio imagined a station with editorial judgments “based on the relevance of the news to our New York City viewers” and “not driven by ratings or sensationalism” as he wrote in an early memo. NY1 would cover the city the way the big networks couldn’t — diving deep into education theater crime and politics. It would come to serve a more practical purpose as a retention tool for Time Warner Cable customers. “Everyone hated the cable company but they loved NY1” says Steve Paulus a lifelong New Yorker who along with Paul Sagan was tapped by Aurelio to get the station off the ground. When competing cable companies came knocking “Time Warner Cable’s primary message to subscribers was ‘They don’t have NY1.’ ”

Since it was (and still is) funded by cable subscriptions its journalists were freer to report on topics that weren’t a ratings hit. “We did live gavel-to-gavel coverage of the City Council hearings on the creation of the Civilian Complaint Review Board” says Dan Jacobson who joined NY1 that first year and eventually became news director. Aurelio later described NY1 as “a gift to the people of New York.”

Compared with the big networks the pay was bad. Initially on-air reporters made as little as $32000 a year. But NY1 had the draw of being a small station in the media capital of the world. Instead of slogging away in Cincinnati or Rochester young journalists got to cut their teeth in New York. Before NY1 “you had to be in the business for years to get to being a producer — or an anchor for goodness’ sake. And here for the first time in New York City you had people with little to no experience on air” says Cheryl Wills who started at the station in 1992 as did Torre NY1’s first on-air hire. Three years later Shaughnessy was hired as a weekend anchor and reporter. Ramirez became the Brooklyn reporter soon after. In 1997 Kiernan who is Canadian was brought over from Time Inc. where he had been hosting a business show for Fortune.

“NY1 had the reputation as the scrappy news start-up” says Kiernan. “You knew what you were getting into.” Reporters worked long nights and holidays delivering no-fuss news with local-access-style graphics. They hauled their own gear and were taught to shoot footage on what were then considered compact cameras but today would be about as modern as Zack Morris’s cell phone. Sagan hired producer Michael Rosenblum to train staffers in his video-storytelling method: Reporters would shoot a series of takes on the premise that “you can build any story by adding narration and a sound bite” according to a 1992 piece in now-defunct Millimeter magazine that ran with the subtitle “NY1 Radicalizes the Way News Is Made.” (To put that in perspective: The article noted that having journalists shoot on the fly was the news media’s answer to the success of the hot new show America’s Funniest Home Videos.)

On-air talent didn’t just shoot their own footage; they also did their own hair and makeup. “We didn’t care much about aesthetics” says a former producer. “Our anchors and reporters looked and sounded like the people who watched them. Amanda Farinacci? Italian girl from Staten Island. Jeanine Ramirez? She’s Brooklyn Puerto Rican … Back in the day it was Vivian Lee who would put her hair up in a clip and maybe put on a little eye shadow. But that’s about as good as you’d get at 5:30 in the fucking morning.”

“I valued a reporter who could ad-lib for an hour on a breaking news story over what they looked like” Paulus says.

Eventually Kiernan and Torre became two of the channel’s most prominent figures with Kiernan anchoring the morning broadcast and Torre taking over the political program Inside City Hall before becoming midday anchor and theater critic. Kiernan gained notoriety as the guy who read the newspapers on air. (Paulus got the idea from watching Regis Philbin.) “There was a sense of We’re all doing something new here together and we are going to get this done by working harder than everybody else” says Kiernan. “That mentality served us well for many years. But ultimately we grew up.”

Hollywood writers and producers began casting NY1 anchors — often Kiernan but Torre and other talent too — in order to convey an authentic New Yorker–ness. The movie stuff was mostly accidental (“A funny sideline” says Kiernan) but it raised profiles mainly his. In 2011 he pissed off management when he told New York that he had thought of NY1 as “a stepping-stone.” He went on to play himself in The Avengers and Iron Man 3. He also auditioned — and publicly campaigned unsuccessfully — to take over for Philbin when the longtime host announced his retirement.

Several current and former colleagues of Kiernan’s — of the 51 who were interviewed for this story most requesting anonymity because the media world is small and retributive — say Kiernan became increasingly difficult to work with around this time. Margaret Menefee a former writer and producer at NY1 says there were “incidents where he berated people kind of harshly.” As multiple colleagues tell it one particularly memorable blowup was aimed at executive producer Leslie Martelli-Hines allegedly after she and Kiernan disagreed on where to send a reporter. When Martelli-Hines walked away they say Kiernan came up close behind her shouting. “So Leslie goes into the women’s restroom thinking Of course he’s not going to follow me and he followed her to the women’s restroom and stood out there in the hallway stalking her waiting for her to come out” says a former producer. “It was extremely intimidating” says another witness. (Martelli-Hines who left NY1 in 2017 after 21 years declined to be interviewed. Kiernan claims he never followed her.) On another occasion a producer “made the cardinal sin” of telling Kiernan to wrap. “We were trained ‘Don’t you dare wrap Pat Kiernan’ ” says a former staffer. When they cut to a commercial “Pat struts out of his anchor chair … He hovered over her and just verbally castrated her.”

Kiernan as far as anybody knows never apologized to Martelli-Hines probably because he didn’t have to. Nobody knocks Kiernan’s work ethic; even those who don’t like him personally acknowledge that “he’s really really good” at his job. But colleagues say he became the unofficial ruler of the newsroom. They were afraid to stand up to him because “you know that no matter what your response is to Pat — no matter how mild it is — it’s your ass” says a former producer. “Pat Kiernan is not going to be reprimanded. Pat Kiernan does not suffer consequences.”

“He was a diva” says Menefee. “I don’t know how else to put that. He liked things a certain way and if they’re not what he wanted he was very vocal about that.”

Paulus insists he never gave in to what he calls the “star system” he’d seen in his network days. “I told Pat ‘You know if you get hit by a bus tomorrow they’re going to turn on NY1 to see what the time and temperature is even if you’re not there’ ” he says. But Paulus acknowledges that eventually Kiernan did outearn his fellow anchors — even those who had been there longer. “The bottom line is the mornings were the most-viewed time period for us so they generated the most revenue and his compensation reflected that. Did he make more money? Yes he did. Did he deserve more money? I don’t know. It’s a tough one.”

As a hierarchy formed and the culture at NY1 was changing so too was the cable-television industry it relied on. Cable-TV subscriptions in the U.S. peaked around 2010 then began to rapidly slide. By 2014 with fewer subscribers Time Warner Cable was in talks with Comcast about a merger. When the deal fell through “all of a sudden in came the smaller cable companies going to buy the bigger cable company — God help us” says Paulus. Led by chairman and CEO Tom Rutledge Charter ultimately bought Time Warner Cable and with it NY1 in 2016 for $56 billion.

Initially NY1’s managers were relieved. Before Charter Rutledge was COO of Cablevision which had its own 24-hour local-news stations in the New York area; prior to that he had been president of Time Warner Cable. With an executive in place who “got it” Paulus says “we basically thought everything was going to be sort of status quo.”

Instead Charter brought in new management including Michael Bair who had most recently worked as CEO of the Bleachers Corporation a sports-streaming start-up. Bair laid out a plan that focused on multi-platform coverage such as a news app and podcasts and more live programming including a three-hour morning show. He also turned his attention toward the staff. “We had to start looking around at the management team and say ‘Okay who’s really resilient and adaptable? And who really believes in this too?’ ” Bair says.

“In my sour-grapes mode I’ll say he co-opted the business” Paulus says of Bair’s approach. “He thought that the way to get to where he wanted to go and become a profit center for the company was ‘We’ll do live TV. We’ll make it the Today show of New York City.’ ” Paulus and Jacobson the news director soon found themselves iced out of discussions about programming. They were the old guard the purists still clinging to the notion that they were public servants. Jacobson got a whiff of changes coming down the line he says when Bair suggested sending Kiernan to the 2016 U.S. Open to do “funny odd things” as if it were a late-night bit an idea he says Kiernan was into. “Pat? Oh yeah he loved the attention.” (A Charter spokesperson denies that Bair asked Kiernan to do anything “funny.”)

“I probably could have done a better job in general with it” Bair says of the management transition. For Jacobson the writing was on the wall — which he was suddenly much closer to after his desk was moved from the center of the newsroom to a corner by the supply closet. Paulus got the ax and soon too did dozens of other longtime employees many of them over the age of 40. “By all indications they were into a youth movement both in management and on air” Jacobson says. Paulus is more dramatic: “There was a bloodbath at the station. They fired everybody who had any experience.”

NY1 executives also cut various longtime shows including The Call — a viewer call-in show that had been popular with die-hard NY1 fans but was otherwise underperforming. Aurelio bristled at the cancellations accusing Charter of “abandoning their commitment to the city.” But not everyone was disappointed. The station had outgrown Paulus’s loose management style. He had run the newsroom “like a college club” says a current employee — an approach put on public display in 2010 when former anchor Adele Sammarco took NY1 to court after she claimed she had been wrongfully fired a decade earlier. During the trial (she had rejected a $200000 settlement to pursue her claim) it was revealed that a male colleague had hung an altered photo of her with enlarged breasts in the newsroom. (The mostly male jury sided with NY1 and its defense that the behavior wasn’t sexual harassment because Sammarco had laughed about it at the time.) Shaughnessy and Torre testified for NY1 speaking against their female colleague.

It was hard to blame Charter for trying something new. NY1 is a beacon in local news but it is still local news accessed via a cable network — a dying industry within a dying industry. By 2015 the year before the merger cord-cutting had picked up and since then it has only gotten worse for cable companies; in the past six years the number of Americans who say they watch TV via cable or satellite has dropped from 76 percent to 56 percent and roughly two-thirds of 18-to-29-year-olds have either ditched cable or satellite or never signed up in the first place. The median age for cable viewers is now around 60. Some of NY1’s longtime talent the ones who remained anyway recognized that it was time to evolve. “Change in a family dynamic is never fun” says Wills 54 one of the few veterans who benefited from the merger; she was promoted from weekend anchor to prime-time news anchor and made the host of her own public-affairs show. “I’m not going to pretend it’s been a walk in the park for everyone. Some people left angrily. But sometimes things change.”

NY1 plucked Anthony Proia from Time Warner Cable’s operation upstate to run the newsroom. Melissa Rabinovich who had overseen NY1’s Queens and Staten Island coverage dubbed Local Edition was promoted to assistant news director. Before the merger Rabinovich and her team were what one former reporter called “the unwanted stepchild” of the newsroom — the talent skewed young sometimes just out of school and their segments aired only in certain boroughs. Colleagues say Rabinovich who has been at NY1 for roughly two decades was eager to prove herself to new management.

Reporters who worked under Rabinovich describe her as “vengeful” and “the ultimate Regina George” which sounds hyperbolic until they line up to vent. Alanna Finn a former news assistant says Rabinovich prevented her from getting a promotion by writing her up for accumulating unpaid parking tickets with the company car — even though tickets were common because journalists were often rushing to fires or crime scenes and had to park quickly. (A Charter spokesperson says Finn did not submit her tickets as required resulting in fees.) A former reporter says Rabinovich once called her from an event to tear apart one of her scripts reiterating her criticisms to her husband — who did not work at NY1 — while on the call so that he too could critique her work. CeFaan Kim also a former NY1 reporter says he complained to HR after colleagues informed him that if he didn’t chip in to buy Rabinovich a holiday gift she would retaliate. Yet another reporter says he threatened legal action against Charter after Rabinovich put a GPS tracker in his company car and recorded his whereabouts. (A Charter spokesperson says using GPS trackers is a common practice for safety reasons.) “So many people complained to HR about Melissa and they just kind of brushed it under the rug” he says.

In their new roles Rabinovich and Proia started holding monthly meetings with staffers but the meetings grew contentious former producers say when they brought up money. They were told they were lucky to have jobs at all when other media outlets were cutting staff. Proia mentioned that he had made a similar salary early in his career two decades prior — but didn’t seem to see that as worrisome say producers. In another conversation “he was like ‘Well what do you guys think you’re going to do live in luxury apartments?’ ” says a former staffer. “We wanted to maybe be able to afford an apartment without a roommate. Nobody was looking to live in the Dakota.”

Meanwhile management poured money and attention into Mornings on 1. Traffic reporter Jamie Stelter and longtime business anchor Annika Pergament were tapped to be Kiernan’s co-anchors. The trio are represented by the same agent and are friends off-camera. Kiernan even helped set up Stelter with her husband CNN host Brian Stelter. It’s a story she tells so often it’s included in her bio on the NY1 website. The morning-show format changed to include more banter between co-anchors; they still ran business and political segments but also fluffier content such as conversations led by Stelter about women preferring flats over heels.

An expensive new set was built new promos were shot and for the first time at NY1 hair-and-makeup artists were hired — for the morning talent. Kiernan often referred to the grand morning-show studio as “my studio.” Colleagues say he became irate on multiple occasions when he discovered that someone had sat in his chair. A rift formed behind the scenes. “We were almost pitted against each other because the morning show was this brand-new thing [with] tons of money being thrown at it” says a colleague. “We felt like whoever was their favorite got to do it. It wasn’t like you auditioned for it or anything like that. Pat was the deciding factor. He is the person who says yes or no.”

It definitely had the feeling of We are putting you in a position where it is difficult for you so we have more ammo to say ‘It’s not working.’

Stelter was on her way to becoming a recognizable media personality as well. She gave interviews about her personal life her morning routine her apartment’s décor. In 2011 the New York Times ran a profile of her with the headline “Stuck in Traffic? A Star Is Born.” Colleagues say she and Pergament began to behave like “high-school bullies” openly gossiping about co-workers — sometimes with their mics still on. “It could be the way someone did their hair what they’re wearing their reporting” says a former colleague. “A lot of people don’t like working with Jamie” says another. “People would avoid her” says a third. Stelter they say was protective of her position. When photos of then–fellow traffic reporter Alyse Zwick — a former Miss New York and Jets dancer — gained attention on Twitter positioning her as one of NY1’s top performers on social media Stelter allegedly made “snide comments.” Afterward Rabinovich told Zwick she was not allowed to post pictures from her NFL or pageant days says an ex-staffer.

Particularly disturbing to colleagues was the way Stelter and Pergament treated former weather anchor Stacy Ann Gooden who was hired in 2017. Ten current and former employees say Gooden was ostracized by the three co-anchors. Insiders say Gooden was often excluded from meetings and Stelter and Pergament would talk disparagingly about her on set. During roundtable discussions on air Gooden was often left out of the conversation and when she was given the opportunity to speak “it was very short abrupt” says John Friia a former producer. In 2018 when Gooden who is Black interviewed New York City’s First Lady Chirlane McCray for a Black History Month segment “one of the questions Pat and Jamie wanted Stacy-Ann to ask was how Dante” — McCray’s son with Mayor Bill de Blasio — “got his Afro so big” says a former producer. (A second former producer confirms this account. Kiernan and Stelter deny it.) “It got to the point where Stacy-Ann couldn’t take it anymore because they were just outwardly rude” says a former colleague. A former crew member says Gooden reported the behavior to HR. When nothing changed Gooden quit. “She wouldn’t even let them counteroffer” says the crew member. (Gooden declined to comment; Charter declined to comment on Pergament’s behalf.*)

Outside the morning show older reporters found themselves pushed aside. It was awkward former colleagues say when on-air reporter Shannan Ferry — who was in elementary school when Shaughnessy ran from the falling towers on 9/11 — was at the anchor desk and Shaughnessy was in the field. “That juxtaposition wasn’t lost on people” says a former producer. Ferry who was raised in Queens and is the daughter of a plumber was in her mid-20s at the time and was already recognized as a promising talent. “I knew I didn’t always have as much experience as other people at my station or at other stations in the New York City market but I knew I was responsible to try to hustle and get out there as best as I could” Ferry says. She had grown up watching NY1; getting the opportunity to anchor already? She’d be crazy to turn that down.

At first Torre appeared to be one of the lucky ones: She was given her own live show at noon holding her midday anchor spot. But outside that one-hour program she saw her on-air hours slashed. (A Charter spokesperson says that it’s possible viewers saw less of Torre because the channel began airing fewer pretaped segments. However the company claims her live coverage did not decrease.) Likewise Shaughnessy Ramirez and Lee had been filling in at the anchor desk for years but were passed over when full-time anchoring positions became available. What opportunities they did have were dramatically reduced. Shaughnessy a weekend anchor filled in during the more popular weekday time slot 48 times in 2017 but only five times in 2018; Ramirez’s weekday anchor appearances dropped from 49 in 2016 to seven in 2018.

Torre also got to use a new studio though it was smaller shared and poorly lit colleagues say. NY1 invested in promotional videos for Mornings on 1 and some of the younger anchors but Torre had to fight for a promo and felt the vendor hired to produce it was second-rate. (A Charter spokesperson says “As is typical with any network we have emphasized the most popular programming our Mornings on 1 show” and adds that NY1 made promos featuring other women over 40.) Torre was also allegedly told that hair and makeup were “not for her.” Ahbi Nishman a freelance makeup artist says she was instructed not to stay late for Torre. “They would be like ‘If she can’t get here on time she’s out of luck’ ” says Nishman who notes that Torre was coming in from New Jersey. “It definitely had the feeling of We are putting you in a position where it is difficult for you so we have more ammo to say ‘It’s not working.’ ”

Eventually after complaints hair and makeup were provided but only at 9 a.m. — three hours before Torre went on the air. (A Charter spokesperson says Torre’s shift began at 9 a.m. and that if she arrived punctually she had “ample time for her makeup.”) Torre complained to Rabinovich and Proia and eventually took the matter to the then–senior vice-president of news Dan Ronayne telling him that Proia told her “I don’t want to hear any more. That’s just the way it is. Too bad. Boo-hoo.” (Now bound by NDAs Torre Shaughnessy Ramirez Farinacci and Lee can’t talk about their experiences at NY1 but their accounts are detailed in the complaint.)

Torre was also a theater critic for NY1’s On Stage program. Karin Garfin a former producer of On Stage who later filed a legal complaint of her own says that from her first days at NY1 there was “a campaign against Roma.” In an early meeting Garfin says executive producer Kevin Dugan and his boss Audrey Gruber made derogatory remarks about Torre’s looks after she had undergone chemo for colon cancer. “I know that she’s been here since we went on air but does she need to look like it?” Gruber asked per Garfin’s complaint. Garfin says that Dugan — who she says sexually harassed her — repeatedly instructed her to cut down Torre’s segments and told her that Torre’s look didn’t go with the new “younger aesthetic” of the show.

Meanwhile Shaughnessy who had a reputation for being one of the stronger anchors at the station found herself left off of Rabinovich’s schedule entirely. Shaughnessy went into panic mode according to co-workers. She told bosses she would do “whatever it took” to get more anchoring opportunities. When she went to Bair with her concerns that Rabinovich was sidelining her he urged her not to make a formal complaint according to the lawsuit. Lee also spoke to management about Rabinovich. Afterward both women were demoted to general-assignment reporter — a junior position that involves lugging one’s own camera equipment. “I’m pulling 40 pounds of gear out the door into near-freezing temperatures to drive myself to a story that won’t air as much as others’ and see younger women with professionally styled hair and makeup walking by me heading into a studio for a weekday dayside anchor slot I applied for and was denied” Lee who won an Emmy in 2020 told Vice that year. “You can imagine how humiliating it is.” Farinacci and Ramirez both escalated their complaints to HR around the same time to no avail. Frustrated and out of options the five women banded together and hired a lawyer.

Torre walked into the newsroom on June 19 2019 to quiet applause the producers who worked with her lightly tapping their hands together in approval but wary of anyone in management seeing them. Moments earlier their phones had been pinged with a news alert from the New York Times: A lawsuit had been filed against Charter. There was shock among employees that the women had actually done it although the contents of the lawsuit were less surprising.

Support poured in on Twitter: Katie Couric Lin-Manuel Miranda and Megyn Kelly tweeted about the lawsuit as did local lawmakers and fellow journalists. Torre was especially vocal — for Fast Company she wrote an essay titled “I Was the Face of NYC News for 27 Years. Now I’m Being Pushed Aside Because I’m a 61-Year-Old Woman.” When Torre was told she would not be hosting NY1’s coverage of the ticker-tape parade for the U.S. women’s soccer World Cup win as she had in 2015 she posted an open letter to Mayor de Blasio on Medium asking him to “condemn NY1’s actions in the strongest terms.” De Blasio obliged tweeting in part “@RomaTorreNYC is a tireless advocate who’s worked hard to earn the trust of New Yorkers — she belongs at this parade. Shame on @NY1.” (A Charter spokesperson notes that the parade took place prior to Torre’s time slot.)

The lawsuit further divided the newsroom. Kiernan wasn’t a defendant but he was roped into the press coverage especially as it pertained to his salary. The lawsuit alleged that Proia and Rabinovich were giving opportunities to younger women who had similar looks or ethnic backgrounds grooming them to replace the more senior anchors. To hammer the point home the lawsuit included images of Shaughnessy Ramirez Lee and Farinacci next to their youthful look-alikes.

“I was so proud of them for speaking up because we know what happens — women have an expiration date” says a former reporter. “At the same time I think the way their attorneys had written the complaint was a little unfair. It didn’t account for the fact that some of the younger female talent were working their asses off for nothing.” (She says that when she was at NY1 she made roughly $50000 a year working 16-hour days.) Still she recognized some of the behaviors mentioned in the lawsuit.

Angi Gonzalez then 38 was one of the women pictured. She later told the New York Post that she took issue with any implication that she lacked experience; before joining NY1 she was an anchor at an NBC affiliate and had twice been nominated for an Emmy. Gonzalez wasn’t much younger than Farinacci. And while it could be argued this was evidence that there wasn’t bias a case could also be made that it was a blaring alarm: In just a couple of years this could be you. Farinacci after all had been nominated for an Emmy five times.

The petty sniping that had existed before only worsened. On a day Shaughnessy wore a shirt with cutout shoulders Gonzalez openly commented that she was too old for the style. When a producer brought in a cake as a thank-you to Shaughnessy he says his schedule was changed. It was hard to imagine that the previous spring when Torre won an Emmy Kiernan had proudly taken a photo of her accepting her gold trophy and shared it on his Instagram account — one of the last happy moments for Mom and Dad before the nasty divorce.

In December Torre Shaughnessy Lee Farinacci and Ramirez settled with Charter for an undisclosed amount. Aurelio who had been disgusted by the way the women were treated and had repeatedly contacted Charter executives over the years and asked them not to screw up his beloved channel says he understood why they took the settlement. “Finally they got an offer they couldn’t refuse … Part of me was pleased by it because it forced the company to do exactly what they didn’t want to do” he says. By hiring younger talent “they had intended to save money. But I think at least in the short term this was costly for them.”

Still it was hardly a victory. As part of the deal the women agreed to leave NY1. “People go ‘Oh well you get paid to be silent.’ No you never work again ” says former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson who walked away with $20 million and an apology — but also an NDA — when she sued then–Fox News CEO Roger Ailes for sexual harassment and wrongful termination in 2016. (Ailes disputed her allegations.) “Those women at NY1 they want to work. They don’t want a settlement.” Carlson is now an advocate for legislation banning NDAs and arbitration clauses. Some of the former NY1 anchors are also speaking out. At a virtual event in May hosted by the New York Women’s Foundation Shaughnessy and Farinacci gave advice on navigating sexism at work. “I would say to a woman — and this is just speaking generally — if you suspect something is awry in your workplace you should start documenting” said Shaughnessy. “You should start time-stamping things; you should listen to conversations write those conversations down say who had those conversations. If you know the rules in your state you should record those conversations if it is allowed.”

Charter is still contending with legal issues. Two experienced part-time reporters Thalia Perez and Michelle Greenstein have filed a complaint against the company for pregnancy discrimination. Perez then 43 says she was fired during her third trimester of pregnancy. Greenstein says she was let go months after giving birth at age 40. She says Rabinovich passed her over when hiring for a full-time position telling her she didn’t think Greenstein could handle the hours with a newborn. “You should stay home and enjoy the time with your baby” Rabinovich allegedly said. Garfin also filed a complaint claiming that Dugan the producer of On Stage wrote a false review of her work performance that led to her being fired — after she had refused his advances. (Another former employee who worked at NY1 prior to Garfin says that Dugan who remains at NY1 talked about his sex life to her at work and “never knew where the line was.” Multiple women interviewed say HR mishandled their sexual-harassment complaints.) The cases are in arbitration — Perez and Greenstein’s because of an otherwise innocuous corporate email sent before the age-discrimination suit that in the fifth paragraph mentioned that they waived their right to court litigation unless they opted out. (Neither recalls reading the email.) In a recent deposition for Perez’s case Rabinovich denied wrongdoing.

People go ‘Oh well you get paid to be silent.’ No you never work again.

In April Bair sent an email to employees announcing that he was going on a “listening tour” of the company. Multiple insiders say morale is low (current and former employees note that so many people have left in the past year that managers stopped sending good-bye emails for a period) and the meetings devolved into venting sessions. A current employee says that people were particularly upset about a recent round of layoffs which included the bulk of the channel’s young tireless news assistants considered by many to be the lifeblood of the channel. There were tears.

There are also still believers. Wills who turned down the opportunity to go to WNBC in the late ’90s and never looked back is one of them calling herself “deeply attached to NY1.” She goes to bat for Bair without prompting. “You know what I’m most impressed with about Mike Bair? He’s not a journalist but he’s an excellent listener. He has a great sense of what things should look like feel like and then he has the skill set to execute it.” It was Bair who gave her the show In Focus With Cheryl Wills a platform that has allowed her to do the work she is most proud of including a one-hour special after Derek Chauvin was found guilty of the murder of George Floyd. Only her show includes the name of its host. “Pat Kiernan’s name is not on Mornings on 1” she says. “Did you catch that?”

Even without his name on his show Kiernan remains the cornerstone of the channel. “Look if you’re an anchor you want to be the next Dan Rather. I’m dating myself. The next — the next Lester Holt. And I don’t think it’s there for [Kiernan]” says Paulus. “He’s perfect for the channel and the channel is perfect for him.” Kiernan says he’s not interested in a new gig “that might be perceived by some to be a modest step up.” He has hosted game shows and says he made it “abundantly clear” that if the opportunity were ever presented to host Jeopardy! he would take it.

For now though it seems Kiernan will stay put. He still speaks in the tone of NY1’s original mission statement. “We’re telling the stories that need to be told” he says. NY1 has been closely covering the New York City mayoral race with regular news stories analysis interviews with candidates and polling. The channel’s long-running political show Inside City Hall currently hosted by Errol Louis is still a mainstay airing twice on weeknights.

Over the past year with more New Yorkers home during the pandemic viewership has increased according to a Charter spokesperson. From March 2020 to March 2021 full-day ratings were 40 percent higher than the full-day average from the prior year and midday ratings nearly doubled. “We’re not saying we’re saving local news but we’re doing our hardest to save local news” Bair says. He has a copy of Aurelio’s mission statement from 30 years ago at his desk which some old-timers find humorous although Bair reads from it earnestly. NY1 has 50 reporters covering the city he says and “our mission of the greater good community service has not changed.” The way he talks about the future of NY1 sounds similar to the way Paulus speaks of its origins; reporters are now expected to be one-person crews. Last year the company even hired Rosenblum — the same producer NY1 hired in the ’90s — to teach reporters to shoot their own footage this time on iPhones and iPads. Bair and Vice President of Content Helen Swenson are attempting to create a nimble newsroom that can keep pace with Twitter.

Ferry for one is excited about the new approach. For her NY1 is still a launchpad. She has real talent according to producers who have worked with her and she has another thing just as valuable: time. “My ultimate goal would be to anchor and anchor live” she says. “Not that I don’t love breaking news but I think there’s something really special about being part of a live show.”

Torre’s role as the noon anchor remains unfilled. Some current and former employees say they are crushed by the absence of the longtime anchor and her female colleagues but “the thing that makes this tricky is it’s been totally fine” one staffer admits. He calls what happened to the anchors “an injustice” but adds a pang of guilt in his voice that those who remain “are also really great.” “It’s too bad that the ship sailed the way that it did” he says. “But at the same time I’m not surprised right? I would’ve been more surprised if we could have said the corporate machine was defeated or saw the errors of its ways.”

There is a strong desire to move on. Mornings on 1 is now back to its studio in Chelsea Market after months of being taped remotely. For viewers there’s at least some comfort in the consistency. The five women anchors might be gone but Kiernan’s still there right where they’ve seen him for over 20 years. For the staff of the morning show there has also been consistency: In March Kiernan went off on co-workers about someone altering the height of his anchor chair. The next day his name had been added to the back.

It’s May and after a short spurt of precipitation in an otherwise record dry year for Nevada the valley has turned pastel-green with sagebrush dotting the land. Near the administration building and Redstar’s office a sign is planted in the ground. It reads: “Keep Your Aboriginal Rights!!”

Redstar as chairwoman of the Fort McDermitt Paiute Shoshone Tribe is at the center of a fight over a planned lithium mine in Thacker Pass Peehee mu’huh in Paiute. Part-administrator and part-spokesperson her phone rings often and documents are scattered across her desk.

Long before Redstar heard of Thacker Pass she was following the national news about clean energy. Now the news has come home. The rural communities that encircle Thacker Pass the site of a major lithium mine are at the frontlines of an energy transition from climate-warming fuels coal mining and combustible engines to solar energy lithium mining and electric vehicles.

The project approved by federal land managers in January spans 17933 acres. Some of that land will be used for exploration. The mine itself — an open pit and processing facilities — would be built on about 5545 acres of federal public land with an expected lifespan of 41 years.

For many residents one mine is enough of a concern. But several companies have mineral rights in the area clear into Oregon and this sparsely-populated section of the Great Basin could soon become a booming mining district. There is exploration for gold too Redstar notes.

“We see on this mountainside here they’re doing exploratory drilling” Redstar said. “Well they found gold. So now what? Where are we going to be sitting ten fifteen years from now?”

Indigenous peoples have relied on Thacker Pass for food and traditional medicine including toza root and old-growth sagebrush which is used to make tea. Last month a group of tribal members opposing the mine wrote a public statement about the land’s spiritual significance.

“In addition to environmental concerns Thacker Pass is sacred to our people” they wrote. “Thacker Pass is a spiritually powerful place blessed by the presence of our ancestors other spirits and golden eagles – who we consider to be directly connected to the Creator.”

After federal land managers approved the mine in January members of tribes from across the Great Basin began visiting the mine site where protesters have set-up a 24/7 encampment.

In the months since Redstar was seated as the tribal chairwoman in December 2019 she has followed through on a petition signed by tribal members to disengage with Lithium Americas the company behind the Thacker Pass mine which was fast-tracked through an environmental review process during COVID-19. But state and federal officials have backed the project — and it is a major deposit projected to yield 66000 tons of lithium per year when fully operational.

“We’re just somebody little that’s trying to preserve what we have” Redstar said last month. “Do we stand a chance? You know that’s the big question. We’re going to give it our best shot.”

Redstar’s rhetoric is measured and she tries to approach issues with an open mind having to balance the interests of all tribal members. She said “there’s a mix” of opinions about the mine with one group pushing to prioritize the economic opportunity that lithium extraction might offer.

“I’m not going to put a price on culture” she said. “I’m not going to put a price on tradition. But we’re a small tribe. We’re an indigent tribe. So it’s hard to balance. It’s hard to balance that.”

“I respect the voice of our older members of the tribe” Redstar added. “But I also have young people that are looking for guidance that are looking toward being here for a very long time.”

In the communities closest to the mine opinions about the project range from active opposition to quiet support. Many people are resigned feeling that the mine can’t be stopped that their concerns are small in the national push to secure a domestic lithium supply chain for batteries.

Everyone is watching for what happens next. There is little doubt the mine is going to change the area. The small town of Orovada sits at the base of the Santa Rosa Range and straddles both sides of U.S. 95. Almost every truck going to Thacker Pass has to travel through Orovada where there is a gas station (with an electric-vehicle charger) a community center and a school.

Driving through Thacker Pass cars often come to a halt to let cattle cross the highway. On the other side of the pass the one-lane road becomes unpaved and rough. The road opens up into Kings River Valley an agricultural community that sits at the base of the Montana Mountains.

The mine will bring in dozens of trucks to haul rock and chemicals. Workers will be bussed into the area from Winnemucca about 65 miles away. Parents are worried about traffic (exiting U.S. 95 is unsafe and local residents say transportation officials have done little to help). To deal with safety the mine has offered to pay to relocate Orovada’s K-8 school. Given the costs for land and new construction estimates for the new school range from about $10 to $12 million.

Ranchers are worried about water and wildlife. One rancher is taking his concerns to court and challenging the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s decision to approve the mine. A coalition of environmental groups filed a similar lawsuit a case that has led to a delay in excavation plans.

“People don’t live out here for any other reason than just the fact that it’s peace it’s quiet” said Stacey Edwards part of a concerned citizens group and a fifth-generation Nevada rancher who is raising her family in Orovada. “There’s not a van or a car that drives by that you don’t know.”

“It’s going to change a lot of our everyday lives” she added.

A small community and that’s fine

The signs of a changing climate are everywhere this year. Drought has made it harder to earn a living as a rancher in the Great Basin an environment where water was already scarce. On a morning in May Dusty Edwards Stacey’s husband moves an irrigation line with his son Rhett.

This is one of the worst drought years Dusty can recall and it’s critical to use water wisely.

Stacey Edwards born and raised in Orovada met Dusty Edwards in Boise. They moved back to Orovada to raise their family and Dusty took a job ranching with Stacey’s father Ron Cerri. She said that sometimes she feels her kids are missing out on the opportunities that other kids have in big cities. But growing up as part of a ranching family in Orovada she says can make a person.

“You have to be self-sustainable” she said. “You have to know how to take care of yourself.”

Her daughter Addyson gets up early to feed her horse and two steers hauling red buckets out to them before she goes to the Orovada School the same school Stacey went to. Addyson also feeds five dogs and two cats. Her horse is named Mandy. The steers are Bingo and Angus.

“We’re not going to stop it” Stacey said of the mine at Thacker Pass which is across the valley. “There’s not a person in this world that can convince me that we are. I think that the need for it is there. I understand that the need for it is there. But you have to be able to also live with it.”

Edwards is a member of Thacker Pass Concerned Citizens a community group formed by local residents of Orovada and Kings River Valley. The group has organized regular public meetings at the community center gym. State environmental regulators have presented at the meetings to go over the permitting process — so have the county superintendent and mine representatives.

The meetings can get testy and skepticism is often expressed in the form of questions. In late April when an executive from a trucking company Savage Services came to talk about their practices for hauling molten sulfur local residents peppered him with a long list of questions.

It turns out according to a fact sheet Savage Services left at a check-in table for the meeting the company’s trucks transport about three million tons of molten sulfur each year. Its truck drivers according to the fact-sheet receive extensive training in safely transporting sulfur.

Yet residents have qualms about commercial trucks driving sulfur down U.S. 95 — where cars speed and there is no safe turning lane into Orovada. Once the sulfur reaches Thacker Pass the mining company plans to make sulfuric acid needed to process the mined rock. For many the sulfur plant which requires a state air quality permit gives them more pause than the mine.

The day after the meeting about trucking sulfur Ron Cerri is sitting at home getting ready to put out mineral supplements for his herd and visit his daughter’s family. Cerri is serving his second term on the Humboldt County Commission and residents in the Orovada area often approach him with their concerns. The chemical plant he said “really has everyone’s attention.”

“It’s not so much the mine” he said. “That’s my opinion anyway.”

The community is grappling with how to move forward. The public meetings are a way to sort through their issues and Terry Crawforth has taken on much of the work of organizing them.

Crawforth lives in Kings River Valley and his home is one of the closest to the mine. Sitting on his porch he gestures to the Montana Mountains behind him the range where the mine would be located. It’s the mountains that prompted him to move here from Sparks after 42 years at the Nevada Department of Wildlife including a term as director. The mountains are rich with wildlife.

In January the state wildlife agency wrote in a comment letter that it believes the plan “will likely result in adverse impacts to wildlife ground and surface waters and riparian vegetation within and outside the project area. These impacts include effects to an array of species and will likely have permanent ramifications on the area’s wildlife and habitat resources.”

As local residents started to gather information Crawforth said “the more concerned people got” about everything from air quality and wildlife to the school and transportation. He helped form the citizens group to advocate for residents. If the mine is coming they want to be at the table.

For someone who wears a shirt that says “CAUTION GRUMPY OLD MAN” he shows few signs of grumpiness. He is affable on a warm Sunday morning and has a good sense of humor.

It’s not only this one mine. Local residents he said are concerned with what happens when more lithium claims are developed. There are claims throughout the Montana Mountains and some of them are held by Lithium Americas. The company for its part has pledged to avoid blasting at higher elevations where there is critical habitat for the iconic Greater sage-grouse (wildlife managers Crawforth notes call the Montana Mountains the “sage-grouse holy land”).

But people are skeptical of that promise. If demand for lithium continues rising Crawforth and others believe there is going to be immense pressure to mine claims throughout the area.

State government officials view lithium mining as an economic opportunity but residents said they are doing little to offset the effects on communities taking the brunt for the greater good.

“If you want to be the lithium capital of the world” he said “there’s a cost to that.”

“I think people here feel like they are treated like ‘Well it’s just a bunch of country bumpkins out in the wastelands in Nevada’” Crawforth said. “And these people are not dummies. They have made a living for 150 years in some pretty harsh environment actually.”

Down the street Wendelyn and Martin Muratore have breakfast ready — homemade bacon string hash browns pancakes and eggs. They originally moved to Kings River Valley after living in California but they still go back from time to time: They ship hay to organic dairies north of San Francisco. Hunters regularly stay with them when they get tags in the Montana Mountains.

Neither of them want to see the mine go in. Wendelyn has joined Great Basin Resource Watch the mine watchdog group suing over the fast-tracked environmental review. And Martin rejects the mentality many state and county politicians have especially in Winnemucca — that if you are not growing as a community you’re dying. In the valley he said people don’t think that way.

“I don’t want any growth” he says. “There’s no water for it no need for it.”

A climate crisis and a lithium boom

Thacker Pass sits at the southern edge of the McDermitt Caldera a vast geologic structure — the remnant of an extinct supervolcano that erupted roughly 16 million years ago. For decades companies eyed this caldera in and around the Montana Mountains for minerals. First Chevron came looking for uranium in the 1970s and then in the 1980s the company turned to a search for lithium.

By the mid-2000s exploration in the area kicked off again. Lithium Americas eventually picked up where Chevron had left off assessing the feasibility of mining lithium from the volcanic clay.

During the nearly fifteen years since the company restarted exploration in the area the global dynamics around lithium mining have changed. In 2015 the United States and other countries adopted the Paris Agreement as a global response to climate change. Since then carmakers have committed to putting more electric vehicles on the road driving up demand for lithium.

Today Jonathan Evans president and CEO of Lithium Americas says young engineers contact him on LinkedIn every week. They want to work in an industry focused on climate change.

“This isn’t a gold mine” he said in an interview. “This isn’t an oil refinery. It’s something [where] they can utilize their skill-sets utilize their smarts to address an issue that is dear to them.”

Quietly over the past several years the company has built-up its physical infrastructure within the state and has made in-roads with politicians. The company has an office in Winnemucca and two spaces in Reno — one is a process testing plant in a non-discrete one-story building.

Technicians at the testing facility put ore from Thacker Pass through mechanical and chemical processes to separate the lithium material from the clay. The process relies on methods that the company says are meant to reduce acid use and are less intensive than other types of mining.

Lithium Americas in its mine plan documents has emphasized that the company is working to be as efficient as possible with their ore acid use and energy. At the testing facility water and materials are squeezed out of the ore to the point that unused rock or tailings are bone-dry.

On the mine site the company plans to operate a steam turbine and generate electricity using excess heat from the sulfur plant. Some of that electricity would be exported back to the grid.

Lithium Americas has also built out a political team. Last month the New York Times reported that the company hired a D.C. lobbying firm that included a former Trump administration aide.

In January Gov. Steve Sisolak touted lithium mining in his State of the State speech arguing that “Nevada is home to the most accessible lithium reserves in North America.” The Sisolak administration has also offered financial support to the project. Last year the Governor’s Office of Economic Development approved tax incentives worth about $8.6 million over 10 years.

Those tax incentives frustrated some local residents who felt that the state should not forgo any revenue at a time when funding was needed to build infrastructure for increased mining activity.

According to Evans the company plans to answer those concerns and reinvest the tax incentive in the local community. Evans said that “the benefits of that should flow to the community itself.”

At meetings in Orovada Tim Crowley the former head of the Nevada Mining Association has represented the company. He serves as Lithium Americas’ vice president of government and community relations for its Nevada division Lithium Nevada Corporation.

In one meeting last month as local residents and a group of protesters camping out at the mine grilled Crowely he said the company’s internal canvassing had suggested widespread support.

“We know from canvassing this area and sponsoring the BuildNV program that there are many people right from this community who are looking forward to this project” Crowley said in April.

One of those supporters is Loyd Sherburn a rancher in Orovada who sold water rights to the mining company. If the economy needs more lithium he would like to see mining done in the United States where there are stricter environmental standards than in other countries.

“I’m a firm believer that we should be energy [independent] in this country and not dependent on someone else to shut something down because they go ‘Hey we just took all the lithium from Argentina and you ain’t getting any more’” Sherburn said. “So I see this project going in. I just want to see it done as environmentally-friendly and safely as we can for our community.”

The process testing facility helped convince Sherburn that the company’s model was sound.

“If they can duplicate what they showed me there my big concerns about dirty air and dirty water have pretty well gone out the window” he said. “Yeah I don’t have any concerns.”

Sherburn has ranched in Orovada for more than four decades and he understands where his neighbors are coming from. It’s on the top of everyone’s mind and people are concerned about the changes the mine could bring. Sherburn said the mine might attract a few more people but most workers he thinks will opt to live in Winnemucca. As for him he plans on staying in town.

“As long as I’m alive I plan on living and dying here” he said.

Illyssa Fogel the owner of the Diamond A Motel in McDermitt a town next to the Oregon border and near the Fort McDermitt Indian Reservation is another supporter of the mine. The proposal didn’t come as a surprise to her either. Geologists have been staying at her motel for years.

Fogel who has a law degree was raised in the Reno-area and she is worried about the effects of climate change. When Fogel bought the motel in the early 2000s she had been living in Los Angeles. But having grown up in Nevada she saw an opportunity for the border town to grow.

At the time in the early 2000s when she purchased the motel and moved to McDermitt Fogel was interested in developing a casino (Fogel had worked in casinos and also had been a lawyer for the Gaming Control Board). At one point she owned the bar across the street from the motel. But her efforts to grow the town hit roadblocks. Now with a lithium mine coming Fogel said she sees a new opportunity for economic growth — while tackling the climate crisis.

She has seen the climate change in the area with warmer winters and warmer summers.

“It's my understanding that this is one of the largest if not the second largest lithium reserve on the planet and certainly the biggest supposedly in the Northern Hemisphere” Fogel said. “Why aren't we working on getting this out and getting rid of carbon emissions and all that kind of stuff?”

Lithium Americas also found an unexpected ally in Glenn Miller a founder of Great Basin Resource Watch one of the environmental groups suing over the mine in federal court. Earlier this month Miller resigned from the group's board of directors.

Miller who spent much of his career criticizing the mining industry said he supports the mine because the U.S. needs a domestic supply of lithium to address climate change which he views as the most serious environmental threat facing the globe. Compared to mining methods used for gold he argued that the processes Lithium Americas plans to use are far more “benign.”

""From the technical perspective I think this is a good mine and mining a deposit that is really important for the country” said Miller who taught environmental science at UNR for decades.

“Most environmental issues are a question of values” Miller said.

A tribe cancels its engagement agreement

Mercury was discovered outside of McDermitt in the early-20th century and was mined through the 1980s. The quicksilver mines that worked the deposit now sit dormant across the valley from the Fort McDermitt Paiute Shoshone Tribe’s reservation. For years the mines employed tribal members bringing stable jobs but also leaving contaminated land and public health concerns.

Eddie Smart’s father mined for mercury and he recounts a detailed history of the mines. There was the Cordero Mine and the McDermitt Mine both considered to be top producers of mercury when they were operational. Each mine left a significant footprint on land that was taken from the tribe. The narrow dirt road to the Cordero mine passes a massive rust-tinted mine pit.

“We’ve been put through the test” he said. “We’re still surviving.”

Earlier this year Smart supported an effort to petition the tribal council to disengage with Lithium Americas. Under previous leadership the tribe’s chairman had entered into an agreement with the company even before federal land managers finished the mine permitting process. Lithium Americas had pledged to invest in the tribe’s workforce and bring high-paying jobs to the area.

Several tribal elders and traditional members felt blindsided by the agreement. They and many Paiute and Shoshone peoples from across the Great Basin said they did not give their consent.

“There’s a lot of people that don’t like it” Smart said of Thacker Pass. “Traditional people.”

Several tribal members like Smart had family members who worked in the mercury mines and they said they know of former mine workers who had cancer. Redstar the tribe’s chairwoman said her grandfather and father worked in the Cordero mine which went online in the 1930s.

“My grandfather passed away from cancer as did my grandmother” Redstar said. “A lot of other family members passed away from that. It was unfortunate that the town or whoever did not inform them of the dangers of this whereas now it’s a little different. You can go in and challenge that and say ‘Hey I want to know how harmful this is going to be.’”

Evans the president and CEO of Lithium Americas notes that the mines permitted today must comply with much stricter environmental regulations including water and air quality permitting.

“A lot of those mines were developed and permitted in a different time” Evans said when asked about the shuttered mercury mines. “A lot has changed since then from a regulatory standpoint from a community right-to-know standpoint and just from a government standpoint in general.”

The company says it remains focused on workforce development and Evans wants economic benefits to go to tribal members. More than 40 tribal members have applied for jobs he noted.

“We have ongoing dialogues with members of the tribe” he said. “We’re committed to offer jobs to folks who want them and to offer the training required to be successful in those jobs as well.”

Billy Bell a tribal councilman started getting involved with the project in February. He learned that the tribe had not submitted comments as part of the federal environmental review process. Bell is not sure why but he noted that the comment process was going on during the pandemic.

“They’d pretty much had everything shut down” Bell said after a community meeting in April.

The environmental review in certain areas is vague he said and he has concerns about how federal land managers addressed cultural resources and water quality considered alternatives and coordinated with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to discuss endangered species.

Bell said he has heard both opposition and support from tribal members.

“I would generally say that it’s fairly equal” he said.

But Bell who voted to disengage with Lithium Americas said it was not only the protests that swayed his opinion. He learned that the tribe had entered into the project agreement with the mining company in 2019 almost a year before the environmental review was completed.

“I had no idea what discussions they had or what they told them” Bell said.

After the Trump administration approved the environmental review for the mine in January two protesters Will Falk and Max Wilbert set up a camp at the mine site. When they first arrived at Thacker Pass snow covered the ground. They have camped out there ever since — sometimes together sometimes trading off sometimes attracting visitors from across Nevada and the West.

Wilbert and Falk oppose the mine in the strongest terms. They believe the energy transition is built on a false premise. For them Thacker Pass encapsulates the environmental impacts of green energy: Is disturbing land and wildlife to mine lithium for electric vehicles truly clean?

“I feel pretty terrible because the planet’s being killed” Wilbert said walking near the camp. “But I also feel like we’re further along now than we imagined we would be. I mean when we started this campaign there was a big element of just jumping off a cliff for us because it was literally Will and I hopping in our cars and driving out here to camp on the side of a mountain.”

Over the past several months Falk and Wilbert have launched a social media campaign that has attracted media attention from across the country. Falk wrote regular op-eds about their opposition to the mine that were published in The Sierra Nevada Ally a regional nonprofit outlet.

On the ground Falk and Wilbert worked with tribal elders and they have helped to organize a coalition that has included organizers from the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada.

On a Wednesday afternoon in mid-May they are meeting with about a dozen tribal elders on the reservation. Elders and traditional members have formed a group known as the People of Red Mountain Atsa koodakuh wyh Nuwu in Paiute. Falk an attorney has helped advise them.

Inelda Sam’s home where the meeting takes place is near the tribal offices on the reservation. Outside her home wild horses are grazing by the road nearby. Sam sits at the end of a table next to Josephine Dick. The tribal elders said the protesters have provided important support.

“They’re supporting us” Dick said. “So we’re supporting them too.”

Sam said that they are also getting support from Indigenous communities long on the frontlines of mining from across the region. The People of Red Mountain Sam said would like to see the tribal council do more to actively oppose the mining project. She is worried about the long-term impact that more mining will have on the community and the tribe’s traditional practices.

“Our future generations our kids grandkids” she said. “That’s why we’re concerned.”

Lewey Sam a tribal member said he does a lot of hunting at Thacker Pass. He said the mine is going to disrupt wildlife in the Montana Mountains home to deer sage-grouse and rabbit. Sam said that hunting there was a part of how he — and many other tribal members — were raised.

“That’s the way I was raised and that’s the way it’s going to be as long as I’m alive” he said.

Over the past several months their opposition has gained more momentum with coverage from national media outlets. Earlier this month several tribal members traveled to Reno for a protest with more than a hundred supporters. Brian Thomas chairman of the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of the Duck Valley Indian Reservation was one of several leaders who spoke at the protest.

Thomas said federal land managers including the U.S. Bureau of Land Management should have consulted with his tribe and he hopes to raise the issue with Secretary of Interior Deb Haaland who was sworn in earlier this year as the agency’s first Native American leader.

“Believe me that we’re going to overcome this” he said.

An encampment meetings and lawsuits

The organizers of the Protect Thacker Pass camp plan to continue protesting at the mine site and they are asking their supporters to be ready to block construction equipment. Even though mine construction could be many months away Lithium Americas had been planning to begin initial excavations and diggings associated with cultural resources work as early as June 23.

As part of litigation brought by environmental groups this year the company agreed to delay ground disturbance until at least July 29th while the court hears arguments for an injunction.

But Falk at the June 12 rally in Reno was already looking beyond the delay: “We really need people to consider whether they can come up to camp whether they can come up to Thacker Pass to put their bodies on the frontlines in case we have to stop any sort of construction equipment from digging up cultural resources from destroying the land at Thacker Pass.”

Evans said that the company respects the right to protest.

“They’re free to protest — as we move forward as well — but as long as it doesn’t imperil the safety of our workers the community or anyone else involved in the project” Evans said.

But Lithium Americas remains committed to bringing the project online and the company is finishing up state environmental permitting and state permitting to use its water rights.

“Our hope is that in the first half of next year we’re moving forward” Evans said.

The company is now proactively reaching out to the community. It recently hired professional facilitators from a firm in Colorado to interview local residents about their concerns. Cerri the Humboldt County Commissioner has pushed for negotiating a Good Neighbors Agreement a binding legal contract that would help the community hold the mining company accountable.

Cerri said he was glad to see Lithium Americas more engaged. When the company first came to discuss its plans and the mine’s impacts some people in the community felt talked down to.

“They were trying to tell us what was best for us” Cerri said. “We didn’t need to hear that.

“We had to push pretty hard to get them to start coming to some of these meetings” Cerri said last month. “They still didn’t think we were serious. Then of course some of the efforts by the protesters out there have also benefited us in the respect that it’s gotten their attention and I think they realize that they need the community’s support for this mine to be successful.”

Evans said the company wants to partner with the community and is willing to make upfront investments. He pointed to relocating the school as an example of that commitment.

“There were concerns about traffic and the school” he noted. “We’ve already come forward [and] we’re interested in replacing that school and moving it if that’s what’s needed.”

Even as the company makes more commitments there is still distrust about the mine.

Parents county staff and educators gathered for a community meeting in mid-May to discuss plans to rebuild and relocate the school. Some worried that the school might not fix the larger issues associated with the mine — the concerns with more traffic and environmental impacts.

After the meeting Jeannie Mertens who runs an auto care shop in Orovada said that her big concern is traffic and she would like to see the mining company pay for a new bypass road.

“You know what? It’s appreciated that they want to do anything at all” Mertens said. “But they want to spend the money on the school because it is way cheaper than building a haul road.”

It’s important she said for the community to reach a mutual agreement with the mine.

“If this mine doesn’t go the next one will because there are claims all over there” she said.

Whether or not — and when — the mine is constructed could be decided by a federal judge.

Two ongoing lawsuits are challenging the federal government’s approval of the mine claiming that the fast-tracked environmental review did not fully consider the lithium mine’s impacts. The lawsuits and ongoing state permitting could delay mine construction and ultimate operations.

In February four groups — Western Watersheds Project Great Basin Resource Watch Basin and Range Watch and Wildlands Defense — filed suit over the federal environmental review.

John Hadder the executive director of Great Basin Resource Watch said that the organization is not opposed to all lithium mining. But he said regulators should not shortcut the permitting process which is meant to consider a project’s impact on the environment and communities.

“If we’re going to move forward with a new era of increased mining we have to recognize that there are communities that are going to be disproportionately affected by these policies and that has to be kept in mind in how we move forward” Hadder said. “What is a just transition?”

The second lawsuit was filed by Ed Bartell an Orovada rancher.

On a cool morning in late-April Bartell opens a gate that leads into Pole Creek one of the two streams that is mentioned in the lawsuit. The whole landscape changes around the water and the sun is glistening off the stream. The lower section of Pole Creek is narrow but Lahontan cutthroat trout an endangered species and the Nevada state fish has been observed in parts of the stream. In the past the Nevada Department of Wildlife has monitored Pole Creek for trout.

The environmental review relying on data from a mine consultant argued that mine activities would have no effect on the species a claim that environmental groups dispute in their lawsuit.

And some ranchers feel that federal regulators are applying a double-standard when it comes to protecting threatened wildlife like the trout. They note that for years the same land managers have emphasized the need to protect habitat for sensitive species including the sage-grouse.

Bartell points out several places where the environmental review misclassified resources in the area. He is also concerned that mining activity will affect the local hydrology which is sensitive to significant changes. Bartell and another rancher are challenging the mine’s water permits.

“It was really frustrating how quickly it got rushed” Bartell said of the mine permitting.

Bartell understands the demand for lithium but he said the Thacker Pass mine presents too many concerns. He is worried about the potential for pollution and the disturbances to wildlife.

“Obviously we need lithium mining but it needs to be done in a sustainable way” he said.

Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Chicago has been around for 125 years and acted as the primary church for three surrounding neighborhoods of Ashland Avenue.

The church held its first mass in October 1892 and was physically moved in 1929.

It took the efforts of 50 men and their horses to pry the 10000 ton church from its foundation move it across the street and rotate it 90 degrees. According to a Chicago Ancestry site the church was moved at a 'foot a minute.'

'It is a magnificent historically and architecturally significant church' said church preservation advocate Julie Sawacki on the steps leading to the church's entrance. 'Imagine tearing something so significant down.'

The church in its present form was built in 1916 and moved across a street by 50 men and horses in 1929

The Archdiocese of Chicago told CBS News that attendance at the church's Sunday masses have steadily declined.

The church simultaneously needs $2 million worth of repairs and without the community's support its likely it will be demolished.

There are a group of parishioners including Hilda Correa who are desperately trying to save the famed religious landmark. Correa and others say the church attracts tourists both Christian and non-Christian.

Correa also alluded to the fact that times are hard. Although she didn't specify what she was talking about - perhaps the years-long pandemic or stubborn inflation - Correa says the church is a place of comfort for those who come to visit.

Hilda Correa left and Julie Sawacki right as well as a number of others passionate about keeping Our Lady of Lourdes alive made impassioned pleas on the steps of the church before its last service on May 19

'The religious aspect is really what's really touching us because losing such a valuable place that people can come especially in these days...'

Our Lady of Lourdes will be holding its final service on May 19 but Preservation Chicago a non-profit organization dedicated to saving city landmarks plans to revive the church and make it into a holy shrine.

'The effort here will probably be long and labored perhaps. There's a lot of different moving parts and a lot of different factors' said Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller.

There is a Change.org petition with 1107 signatures to preserve the church as a historical landmark rather than knocking it down. The goal is to reach 1500 signatures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYXRsYW50YS51cmJhbml6ZS5jaXR5L3Bvc3Qvc215cm5hLWJhcHRpc3QtY2h1cmNoLXJlZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtcGxhbnMtbW92ZS1mb3J3YXJk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,9-acre church redevelopment aims to put downtown Smyrna on map,"The City of Smyrna’s years-long quest to create a more robust and cohesive downtown is taking a significant step forward this month.

The Cobb County city is in the process of purchasing and redeveloping the strategically located 9-acre Smyrna Baptist Church campus—along with an adjacent former Presbyterian church property the city previously acquired—as part of a project dubbed “Downtown the Downtown.”

The church property is adjacent to the mixed-use village considered downtown Smyrna today situated along Atlanta Road about three miles outside the Interstate 285 Perimeter. The city’s Village Green redevelopment is just beyond that with a second location of Suwanee’s popular StillFire Brewing in the works as part of the commercial component there.

The church redevelopment would mark another instance of congregations both urban and OTP selling properties to make way for denser development as metro Atlanta continues to grow.

A recently formed Downtown the Downtown advisory committee met for the first time last week at Smyrna City Hall to review a timeline and next steps regarding the Smyrna First Baptist Church property at 1275 Church St. Negotiations with the church have been ongoing since last year.

According to a project summary provided to Urbanize Atlanta city officials plan to issue a Request for Proposals on May 15 seeking ideas from development firms for the church property. The project is considered part of Smyrna’s placemaking B.O.L.D. Downtown Master Plan.

Exactly what the church property may become has not yet been determined.

A process involving “extensive citizen input” and “careful market analysis” will steer what redevelopment looks like according to city officials. Whichever development firm is hired will help in the public engagement phase per the city.

One building that will remain standing the church’s stone chapel is expected to be converted to public uses such as live performances and community events.

Bids for the church redevelopment will be reviewed over the summer and the project is scheduled to be awarded in August. The public engagement phase is slated to kick off sometime this fall.

City officials expect construction to begin in 2027. The church will keep operating at its current location for two years as its new facilities are built nearby on Atlanta Road per project officials.

Travis Lindley Smyrna Ward 3 Councilman and chair of the advisory committee called the Downtown the Downtown redevelopment initiative a “tremendous opportunity” that will be guided by “a strong and meaningful public engagement process” in an announcement this week.

• As Braves season unfolds another project near Truist Park tops out (Urbanize Atlanta)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL2VwaXNjb3BhbG5ld3NzZXJ2aWNlLm9yZy8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L2NvbW1pdHRlZXMtaGVhci10ZXN0aW1vbnktb24tYWRkaXRpb25zLXRvLXRoZS1jaHVyY2gtY2FsZW5kYXItcHJvcG9zZWQtaHltbmFsLXN1cHBsZW1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Committees hear testimony on additions to the church calendar proposed hymnal supplement,"[Episcopal News Service] The legislative committees on Prayer Book Liturgy & Music tackled a weighty agenda during its May 8 meeting receiving testimony on eight of the 23 resolutions scheduled for a hearing.

Most of the people who signed up to testify addressed resolutions that would add people to the official church calendar. Because the calendar often known as Lesser Feasts and Fasts is considered part of the Book of Common Prayer any changes require action by two consecutive General Conventions.

Resolution C021 would affirm a second reading and place Élie Naud on the calendar. Naud was a French Huguenot who came to New York in the 1700s after spending time as a galley slave. He became a member of Trinity Church Wall Street where for 15 years he worked with Black slaves and Native Americans to prepare them for baptism. He later became a member of Église du Saint-Esprit a French-speaking Episcopal parish in New York and he also started a school for poor children and the children of slaves.

St. Esprit’s rector the Rev. Nigel Massey who has served the church for 30 years spoke in favor of the resolution. Early in his tenure serving the church he read a former rector’s history of the parish and was struck by a sentence that has stayed with him ever since: “Our church can claim at least one who in another community would have been canonized as a confessor and missionary the saintly Élie Naud slave and servant of slaves.”

Parishioners Wendy Range and Joris Burmann also supported the resolution. Range described how the church annually commemorates Naud’s death on Sept. 7 with prayers in French and English at his grave in the Trinity Church Wall Street’s churchyard. Burmann who also is a postulant for Holy Orders in the Diocese of New York said Naud could serve as “an ecumenical bridge” both for individuals and for churches since many people have been members of other denominations before finding The Episcopal Church

Four people three from the Diocese of Hawai’i spoke in favor of A124 which would approve on first reading the addition of Liliʻuokalani of Hawai’i to the calendar. A confirmed member of the Cathedral of St. Andrew in Honolulu she was queen of the Hawai’ian Kingdom when her government was overthrown in 1893 by forces backed by the U.S. Navy. With her people facing such overwhelming force she chose not to fight to hold her crown and urged her people to respect her decision. She later was imprisoned.

The Rev. Steve Costa archdeacon of the Diocese of Hawai’i said that through her selfless service to her people and her surrender to prevent the deaths of others “she personified the beloved community long before we even thought of these things.” He also noted that Liliʻuokalani had composed what is known as the Queen’s Prayer or Ke Aloha o Ka Haku which still is sung by almost every church in Hawai’i on Sundays.

Two other Hawai’i deputies Mary Carpenter and Ryan Kusumoto also spoke in favor with Carpenter calling Liliʻuokalani “a model of the living native Hawaiian spirit for most of us Indigenous Pacifica people” while Kusumoto praised her selflessness in saving her people at the cost of her crown. “She stood down so her people could stand up” he said. “If she did not surrender to the American militant colonizers there may not be native Hawaiians here today.”

House of Deputies Vice President the Rev. Rachel Taber-Hamilton a member of Shacken First Nation said that recognizing Liliʻuokalani would be an important part of “the church’s overall commitment to reparation and reconciliation with the Indigenous peoples of every land in which our church had a part in weaponizing theology to justify genocide.”

The commemoration of Howard Thurman a Black pastor educator theologian and civil rights leader on first reading was proposed in C011 by the Diocese of California and in C012 by the Diocese of Northern California. The two resolutions differ only slightly in their language and Northern California deputy the Rev. James Richardson spoke in favor of both. The explanation accompanying each one describes well his “biography and influence on the civil rights movement which was enormous and the reasons for adding him to the calendar” Richardson said. He noted that while about 300 people currently are commemorated in The Episcopal Church’s calendar only about a dozen are African American and fewer still are African American theologians.

Thoma Lipartiani from the Convocation of Episcopal Churches in Europe joined the meeting from the Republic of Georgia to support Resolution C020 adding Ilia Chavchavadze of Georgia on first reading. He described Chavchavadze as a public figure journalist publisher writer poet and human rights activist “who united Georgian society around three cornerstones of our nation – language homeland faith.” Chavchavadze was canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church in 1987 according to information provided with the resolution.

Turning to matters of liturgy James Frazer a member of St. Stephen and the Incarnation in Washington D.C. suggested a variety of changes to Resolution A114 which would authorize two expansive language versions of the Book of Common Prayer’s Eucharistic Prayer C. Frazer offered some changes in and reorganization of some proposed wording.

Deputies committee chair the Ven. Stannard Baker of Vermont asked Marty Wheeler Burnett associate professor of church music and director of chapel music at Virginia Theological Seminary to speak about two resolutions dealing with hymns and hymn texts – A130 and A131.

Burnett who also is a member of the Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music said that A130 came out of a 2022 General Convention resolution mandating the commission to examine colonialist racist white supremacist imperialistic and nationalistic language in hymns. Focus groups since then have shown “widespread interest in and need for alternative versions of problematic texts” she said.

The resolution calls on the Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music to develop and for Church Publishing Incorporated to publish a digital collection of alternative versions of hymn texts that congregations could use with permission of the diocesan bishop. Burnett noted that copyrights can be an issue on all hymn texts and any that the commission would include in this new collection would have permissions secured as needed.

She also spoke in favor of A131 which calls on the commission to develop a new supplement to the Hymnal 1982. “It has been 20 years since The Episcopal Church published a hymnal supplement and much has happened in 20 years” she said. “It is time.” Current hymnal supplements are Come Celebrate! (1991) and Wonder Love And Praise (1997).

Among the resolutions that drew no testimony were second readings authorizing calendar additions of the consecration of Barbara Harris; Harriet Tubman; Simeon Bachos the Ethiopian eunuch; and Frederick Howden Jr.

Action will be taken on all these resolutions at a future meeting. They then will be considered by the 81st General Convention when it meets in Louisville Kentucky June 23-28.

Kaitlyn Fisher was charged with three counts of felony grand theft on May 3.

Court documents say on Oct. 14 2022 an employee of the Presbytery of Kendall reported that Fisher the administrative clerk had been embezzling from church funds.

The Presbytery of Kendall is an organization that oversees the Presbyterian churches in the eastern Idaho area. According to a church newsletter obtained by EastIdahoNews.com Fisher was the administrative executive assistant.

EastIdahoNews.com has attempted to contact the Presbytery of Kendall by phone and email for comment and we are awaiting their response.

The reporting party told police the staff had not met for annual financial review meetings since the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time she repeatedly asked Fisher who acted as a secretary and bookkeeper for a summary of the church organization’s financials.

In October 2022 the board of trustees chair obtained the organization’s bank statements after asking the banks directly.

In the statements the employees reportedly discovered “numerous unauthorized purchases and transfers out of both accounts via Venmo and Paypal as far back as 2020.”

The two employees confronted Fisher on Oct. 10 where she allegedly admitted to making the unauthorized transfers and purchases.

On Dec. 6 an Idaho Falls Police officer contacted Fisher about the allegations and she denied stealing the money.

Over a week later the officer contacted a criminal investigator with the Idaho State Tax Commission who was able to issue and serve subpoenas for Fisher’s PayPal and Venmo account records.

In the transaction history investigators discovered at least $338458 worth of unauthorized purchases made from Fishers account allegedly using church funds between January 2019 and October 2022.

According to police reports Fisher used the money to buy a red 2018 Honda 4-wheeler from Action Motor Sports to pay The Yard Butler a local landscape designer and debited between $280890.01 and $281474 from the church organization’s Wells Fargo account.

Venmo account records showed Fisher’s Venmo account was linked to the church’s Wells Fargo account as a payment method for transactions.

Transaction descriptions further show Fisher allegedly used the money to pay for child care furniture a dog dog waste cleanup food gasoline her mortgage and supplies/labor to finish the basement of her new house.

Between July and October 2022 alone Fisher allegedly spend at least $38801.84 from the church’s Idaho Central Credit Union account.

A warrant was issued for Fisher’s arrest on May 3 and she was booked into the Bonneville County Jail on May 7. Her bail was set to $30000. She posted bond and was released on the same day.

Fisher is expected to appear for a preliminary hearing on May 29. If convicted she could face up to 42 years in prison.

Though Fisher has been charged with these crimes it does not necessarily mean she committed them. Everyone is presumed innocent until they are proven guilty."

Opinion contributors

As the Ohio General Assembly churns through the final stage of negotiations for the next two-year budget a provision added late in the game to the Senate’s budget version threatens to harm thousands of Ohioans who depend on affordable housing. It is certainly bad timing given Cincinnati’s recent community focus on solving our affordable housing gap.

Language added by Senate President Matt Huffman would raise property taxes dramatically on one particular category of housing driving as many as a third of those properties into severe economic distress. The result could be bankruptcies and foreclosures uprooting already vulnerable families and rattling local economies. The amendment would affect an estimated 207000 units of existing affordable housing and 3700 properties throughout Ohio and discourage the construction of new affordable housing.

There is no broad base of support for the proposal. We urge lawmakers to drop it from the final bill.

At issue are properties that receive various different types of federal affordable housing assistance. Traditionally these properties have been valued for tax purposes using a formula based on the income they generate for their owners. Because rules of the federal programs have governmental rent and occupancy limitations these properties typically are valued below what their market value would be if the rent restrictions weren’t in place. This is a common-sense and long-standing approach toward valuing rental property based upon the income it generates.

Taxing a rent-reduced property as if it has the ability to generate a market-rate income doesn’t make sense.

But the budget language in question would require county auditors to value these properties based on higher market-level rents ignoring the fact that the owners are legally prohibited from collecting them.

Tony DiBlasi executive vice president of operations and asset management for the Ohio Capital Corporation for Housing (OCCH) told the Senate Finance Committee recently that the change ""would have an absolutely devastating impact on affordable housing properties across Ohio."" Real estate taxes could double or triple.

Defaults by property owners would spread the damage to lenders and many community banks that have supported affordable-housing development. Those who spoke against the proposal in committee included a representative of the Ohio Bankers League who said as many as 35% of affected properties could face “extreme financial distress.” As the housing crisis taught us financial distress has a dangerous ripple effect – leading to loan defaults property disrepair and costly disruption for residents and the surrounding community at large.

Perhaps worst of all for Ohio families this enormous financial disruption would discourage future construction of affordable housing at a time when Ohio already faces a severe shortage. Good jobs for contractors laborers and small businesses won’t come to fruition. Countless additional units for low- and moderate-income Ohio families and seniors will be sidelined.

With more than 400000 households spending half their income or more on rent a backbreaking tax increase for affordable-housing providers makes no sense.

This isn’t the first time this bad idea has surfaced. In 2019 Senate Bill 36 would have mandated essentially the same change. It was opposed by more than 75 local and statewide groups and had few proponents. It faded away after a few hearings.

Still affordable-housing supporters and owners recognize that accurately valuing these properties for tax purposes is complex and that counties should have a standard method to follow. Accordingly they have been conferring with the County Auditors Association of Ohio since 2019 and a pilot program involving a standardized method is under way.

The language in the current Senate budget bill undercuts that progress.

We’re encouraged but not surprised that the idea is drawing even more opposition now than two years ago. The list of allied organizations has topped 250 and is still growing. We’re relieved that a number of Republican senators have joined in a move to strike the language.

They evidently have judged that this provision would exacerbate the affordable housing problems their communities already face like we do here in Cincinnati.

The lives of many Ohioans including a significant number of our seniors depend on quality affordable housing. As those in Ohio’s finance sector have pointed out so does a vibrant economy.

It is increasingly clear to many Ohio communities that low- and moderate-income folks with stable housing are better able to take care of their health find and keep employment and care for their children.

Undermining affordable housing in this manner is a mistake Ohio doesn’t need to make.

The project comes in response to livelihood disruptions caused by the pandemic. With lockdown restrictions making travel between towns difficult many farmers and fishers have had difficulty selling their produce. Regional tourism has also plummeted pushing coastal communities once reliant on visiting tourists further into poverty.

Loss of livelihood and rising poverty has also placed additional pressure on natural resources as ailing communities increasingly turn to fishing to meet their daily needs.

To counteract this WWF-Philippines will oversee the construction of food sheds in twenty communities across the island of Dumaran. A third-class municipality in Northeastern Palawan Dumaran is separated from the mainland by a thin stretch of water – and in turn has suffered resource shortages throughout the pandemic.

“What they need is a way to grow their own food in the absence of stable livelihoods. With a food shed you can grow healthy food for less land with less of an impact to the environment. Food sheds offer a very good very stable supplement to their current food production methods” added WWF-Philippines Project Manager Monci Hinay.

Hinay has overseen the construction of food sheds in farming communities across the country. Through the Sustainable Food Systems program he and his team have promoted sustainable livelihoods and food securities in towns struggling with sparse resources.

The food sheds slated for construction in Dumaran are a combination of low-tech low-cost gardening innovations that are easily replicable in rural communities. Made of bamboo poles and recycled plastics the food sheds combine container gardening and hydroponics systems in a multi-level food production system that can handle both poultry and a wide variety of crops.

Each food shed also lowers environmental pressure from fishing communities. With a sustainable supply of fresh produce growing in each food shed their reliance on fisheries decreases granting fish stocks room to grow.

Home to endangered species like the Philippine Cockatoo and the Philippine Pangolin Dumaran is a biodiversity hotspot and an important site for conservationists. Dumaran and the neighboring Araceli are part of a group of six municipalities that comprise the Northeast Palawan Marine Protected Area (MPA) Network a system of connected MPAs established by WWF-Philippines for the conservation of the regions’ marine resources.

“We’re looking at a win-win scenario both for these communities and for the environment. People need to eat. The environment needs room to recover. With these food sheds both is possible” said Hinay.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbGFidXNpbmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2FkdmVydG9yaWFscy93aG9zLWJyb2tlcmluZy1sb3MtYW5nZWxlcy1sZWUtcG9sc3Rlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who's Brokering Los Angeles: Lee Polster,"Lee Polster

For more details read on:

In these difficult times Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham initiated and managed a full-fledged campus placement drive inviting firms to conduct online recruiting for its students maintaining true to its aim of providing the greatest possible opportunities for students. In order to make recruiting easy for both students and recruiters Amrita has put up a virtual interview technique for the entire batch of its School of Engineering students. With the pandemic crisis causing anxiety and uncertainty about the future Amrita University is working to ensure that all students have the opportunity to build a secure future by sticking to its core value of adapting to the present circumstances in the most efficient way.

Despite the fact that physical campus operations were halted Amrita University’s primary activities were unaffected since the school had been prepared to deal with the impact of COVID-19 and its consequences from the start and had implemented modifications to minimize the impact on students. As a result Amrita collaborated with all of its recruitment partners to conduct the annual placement drive entirely online.

In 2020 the virtual placement technique recruited over 90% of Amrita’s B. Tech and M. Tech students with multinational firms such as Microsoft and Cisco recruiting from Amrita Schools of Engineering across regions. Amrita’s 2020 job search began with Cisco a multinational corporation situated in the United States.

Through an online recruitment process that comprised over 50 companies students were recruited for internships (with stipends starting at Rs. 60000 per month) and positions (starting from Rs. 14.37 lakhs per annum). During the same campaign Atlassian an Australian multinational firm offered the highest salary of Rs 56.9 lakh per annum.

Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham’s education is built on a well-rounded curriculum that is adequately reinforced with value-based education. Every student at the institution benefits from frequent student exchange programs integrated courses and dual-degree programs with leading universities throughout the world.

Furthermore as part of its overall framework for academic involvement the university emphasizes the development of sustainable communities. This is accomplished by developing a curriculum that emphasizes experiential learning. Students at Amrita are supposed to develop the essential knowledge skills and values to implement sustainable solutions in vulnerable and rural communities. Students can apply their expertise to address social challenges through programmes like HuT and Live-In Labs. HuT has a long-standing engineering research institute that employs robots to find solutions to societal problems.

Amrita University announced its flexible admission techniques this year in order to make it easy for students to enrol. The Amrita Entrance Examination (AEEE) the Remote Proctored Examination (CBT or RPE) the JEE Mains 2021 or the SAT or Pearson UG Entrance Examination (PUEE) Score are the entrance examinations that Amrita accepts. Because of three more admission entrance possibilities students at Amrita have a better chance of getting into the university.

Quote By Maheshwara Chaithanya(Chairman (B.Tech Admissions) Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham)

Amrita believes in “Education for Life & Education for Living. Students passing out from Amrita will be the problem solvers for the society enriched with values. We believe that the knowledge gained from science and technology should be used for the benefit of the society and mankind.

A real estate development agency that had been booked by the Central Crime Branch police in March 2019 for allegedly cheating many of its investors is once again in trouble this time for allegedly cheating a bank.

The Cubbon Park police have booked Nitesh Estates for cheating Yes Bank for defaulting on a ₹712 crore loan. A case was registered against the company and its promoter Nitesh Shetty on Saturday based on a plaint by a Mumbai-based representative of Yes Bank. “The promoter and staff have been charged for cheating and criminal breach of trust. The complaint Mr. Joshi said the company has its head office on MG Road and opened accounts with a Yes Bank branch on Kasturba Road and also in the Mumbai branch for financial transactions” said a police officer.

In 2016 it availed of a ₹712 crore loan for various projects from both the banks. “However after a few instalments the company defaulted on the loan and despite repeated reminders failed to respond” said the police.

Incidentally the police had registered a case against the company in 2019 for duping several of its investors and refusing to hand over the flats. At the time the then commissioner T. Sunil Kumar handed over the case to the CCB for a detailed probe.",,,,,,,,,

The deal announced on late Friday sees HSBC take another significant step in a wider retreat from slow-growing European and North American markets where it has struggled against larger domestic players.

HSBC has agreed to sell its French retail banking business to Cerberus-backed My Money Group taking a loss of about US$2.3 billion to exit from the market and focus on Asia.

“Our aim would be for the bank to return to profitability three years after we have taken control of it” My Money Chief Executive Eric Shehadeh said in a statement. Any job cuts would not happen until 2024 or 2025 he added.

The deal marks HSBC’s second exit from a major Western market this year following the sale of its US retail banking businesses to Citizens Bank and Cathay Bank as chief executive Noel Quinn cuts his losses in markets where the banking group has long struggled to make money.

Low central bank interest rates and competition from domestic players have combined to make traditional deposit-taking retail businesses unattractive in many developed markets in recent years especially where banks are subscale.

HSBC lost its crown as Europe’s biggest lender by assets at the end of 2020 in a year marked by turbulence caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. BNP Paribas SA’s total assets of €2.52 trillion exceeded HSBC’s €2.44 trillion according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The sale of its French business would be at a nominal €1 HSBC said adding that the business would have a net asset value of US$2 billion with the British bank agreeing to make up any shortfall in that valuation. HSBC will retain other parts of its French business including its investment and business banking units.

My Money formerly known as GE Money Bank is owned by funds under the management of Cerberus Capital Management. It intends to resurrect the Credit Commercial de France (CCF) brand which HSBC bought for some €11 billion 21 years ago. The firm also plans to invest €200 million in the HSBC unit’s technology infrastructure.

Under French law the two parties have to consult employees on the deal and if HSBC and My Money decide to proceed it could be signed in the third or fourth quarter of this year with completion due in 2023.

HSBC put its French retail business under “strategic review” in September 2019 with a sale launched in December the same year. The business made a loss before tax of €288 million in calendar 2020 HSBC said.

French banks which initially studied the dossier all walked away. The acquisition though will add to Cerberus’s purchases of banking assets in Europe where the US private equity group already owns stakes in German lenders Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhaGVyYWxkLmNvbS92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDIxMDYyMDAwMDE2MdIBOGh0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYWhlcmFsZC5jb20vYW1wL3ZpZXcucGhwP3VkPTIwMjEwNjIwMDAwMTYx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[Life Unprepared] South Korea’s rapid financial digitalization in eyes of seniors,Yang Kyung-soon a 72-year-old grandma living in a small neighborhood in Uiseong North Gyeongang Province takes a two-hour round-trip bus journey to visit her bank.

The City of Buckhannon has scheduled the Independence Day fireworks show to take place during Create Buckhannon’s Festival Fridays event which will feature the band Stonestreet playing variety and top 40 hits and the regular lineup of local vendors selling West Virginia-grown and produced items.

City recorder and information coordinator Randy Sanders said city officials have not set an exact time the fireworks show will start but he encouraged everyone to converge on Main Street to enjoy the show around dusk.

“The staging area is behind Walgreens Premier Bank and Citizens Bank of West Virginia so as in the past the best areas to see them are around Walgreens and Community Bank parking areas and you can go back towards the courthouse and Jawbone Park – those are the better parts of the town to see the fireworks” Sanders said.

Festival Fridays will kick off the same day at 5 p.m. and everyone is welcome to enjoy live music food a variety of vendors and the Buckhannon-Upshur Farmers Market.

“The top 40 and variety group Stonestreet will be performing hits that we all know and love” Sanders said. “Come dusk you should be encouraged to head off to Main Street and head up to this area to see a good show.”

A city press release issued Thursday said Buckhannon mayor Robbie Skinner was excited to announce that following a Festival Fridays hiatus in 2020 due to the pandemic the fireworks display would once again occur in conjunction with Festival Fridays as it did in 2019.

The release thanked city councilwoman Pam Bucklew who organizes special events in Buckhannon and city finance director Amberle Jenkins for working to ensure “this year’s event goes off without a hitch.”

“The public is invited to attend this free event and enjoy all that Festival Fridays has to offer and we encourage them to make their way up onto Main Street at dusk to have a great view of the fireworks display that will be staged behind Walgreens and Premier Bank” the release said. “Great viewing will be available from many areas of the downtown particularly around the Upshur County Courthouse Community Bank Walgreens CVS etc.”

Now it’s helping to raise the bar industry-wide by supporting the Personal Care Products Safety Act.

This landmark bill will strengthen consumer protections in personal care and cosmetic products including a requirement for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to define “natural.”

Global guidelines for natural cosmetic products

Burt’s Bees has been on a mission for over 30 years to develop effective and accessible natural skin care and beauty products. Over that time the brand’s made it a priority to clearly state on its product labels the percentage of ingredients derived from nature.

That’s not common practice even within the natural skin care category. With consumers’ growing preference for natural products they would greatly benefit from common global definitions for natural ingredients and products.

Given its decades-long advocacy for clear standards around the term “natural” the Burt’s Bees team jumped in to advance the development of the first international consensus-based guidelines for natural and organic cosmetic products: International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 16128 – Guidelines on Technical Definitions and Criteria for Natural and Organic Cosmetic Ingredients and Products. (Check out the infographic below to learn more.)

The Burt’s Bees team participated in ISO’s consensus-based standards development process alongside industry experts academics regulators ingredient manufacturers and NGOs from around the world.

“Burt’s Bees has long advocated for clear standards and definitions of natural so we’re excited to see the bill require that FDA define ‘natural’ in cosmetics law” said Matt Gregory vice president & general manager – Burt’s Bees. “This will help build trust and transparency in this fast-growing segment of the personal care category. It also supports our broader corporate commitment to ingredient transparency.”

We expect ISO 16128 to provide uniform criteria for the natural skin care industry just as ISO standards have done for other industries. Burt’s Bees is applying ISO 16128 across its cosmetic products to guide how it calculates natural origin percentage.

Currently Burt’s Bees products are on average 99.6% natural origin.

Promoting ingredient transparency

Developing clear standards for natural beauty products and ingredients is a significant achievement in the area of ingredient transparency — a priority for many consumers and part of the Clorox IGNITE strategy.

As part of IGNITE Clorox is committed to driving ingredient transparency by increasing our use of SmartLabel to provide information on ingredients and other consumer-relevant topics. Because we know some consumers also care about what’s NOT in their products in December 2020 we published our restricted substances list for our U.S. retail cleaning products. We plan to develop and share restricted substance lists for additional product categories.

The atlas was created by the Centre of Excellence for Geothermal Energy (CEGE) at PDEU and is in the final stage before it is submitted to the state government for further exploration.The 17 potential sites explored in Gujarat by the researchers are Dholera Unai  Gandhar Chabsar Ghogha Harsani Kawi Khedpada Khar Maktapur Warha Mithapur Tuwa Tulsishyam Savarkundla Lasundra and Lalpur.Prof Anirbid Sircar head of CEGE and dean of R&D at PDEU said the results are encouraging with the majority of sites having medium to high enthalpy (total heat potential). “The sites were chosen based on geophysical surveys of gravity magnetism seismic activity and magneto-telluric surveys. In the majority of the cases hot water springs are surface manifestation of geothermal energy” he said.The researchers went a step further with analysis of geophysical data to project possible energy values of the sites. “Temperature logs are also used to understand the subsurface gradients. An integrated geophysical data interpretation helped us identify the subsurface geothermal anomalies” said Prof Sircar.When commercial/ non-commercial entities harness geothermal energy what factors do they consider? How do our sites measure up on those parameters? Prof Sircar said that they should consider the prognosticated energy resource for a particular site.“Depending on enthalpy range and heat capacity they should decide whether it should be used for power generations or indirect applications such as greenhouses horticulture sericulture food drying honey processing mushroom cultivation etc.” he said. “In low enthalpy area a hybrid approach can also be adopted. For example we are exploring the solar-geothermal model in Dholera. Similarly wind-geothermal model can also be adopted depending on the site conditions.”The researchers said the atlas has shown potential to industry for both direct and indirect applications. They pointed to applications such as potato cold storage milk pasteurization honey processing etc. around such sites. They added that help from industries can demonstrate the commercial viability of such projects.What makes Gujarat an important region to explore geothermal energy? Prof Sircar said that the Deccan traps are exposed in Gujarat. “The thickness of Deccan basalt varies from 400m to 1200m. Deccan basalt can hold a lot of heat. If we can drill through it we can extract a lot of heat from dry rock a method known as an enhanced geothermal system” he said adding that the technique has successfully been used in countries such as Australia  France and the US.CEGE is already working at Dholera and Unai. At Unai the team has found the hottest well in Gujarat with a surface temperature of 70 degrees celsius. The Centre of Excellence is also working on projects to showcase the capacity of geothermal energy for food drying and balneology (the medicinal effects of hot water springs).,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvcGV0cm9sLWRpZXNlbC1wcmljZXMtdG91Y2gtbmV3LWhlaWdodHMtYWZ0ZXItZnJlc2gtaGlrZS92aWRlb3Nob3cvODM2ODg2NjQuY21z0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9lbmVyZ3kvb2lsLWdhcy9wZXRyb2wtZGllc2VsLXByaWNlcy10b3VjaC1uZXctaGVpZ2h0cy1hZnRlci1mcmVzaC1oaWtlL2FtcF92aWRlb3Nob3cvODM2ODg2NjQuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Petrol diesel prices touch new heights after fresh hike,After remaining steady for a day fuel prices once again raised on June 20.

You have successfully cast your vote Login to view result

teaches earth environmental and planetary sciences at Brown University . Speaking toat Clemens discusses how a monsoon is made the impacts of global warming on the rain — and why India’s monsoon is special:We look at ocean sediments that build upon the seafloor over time and examine their chemical physical isotopic and biological properties. Through these we reconstruct changes in monsoon winds and rainfall across time. Studying the monsoon is important because it’s one of the largest expressions of the movement of water and energy in the atmosphere on Earth. It is responsible for much of the rainfall that tropical and subtropical continental interiors receive and it’s shaped by very powerful meteorological environmental and climatic drivers.The location or the latitude and longitude of Africa India and parts of Asia conspire such that when summer begins these continental interiors start to heat up quite strongly. That creates low density air along the surface of these continents. This moves upwards into the atmosphere and creates a vacuum. This draws air masses inwards from the ocean into India. Surface air masses are one reason why the South Asian monsoon is so strong — the unique geography of the Indo-Asian landmass confines and intensifies the circulation of these air masses which further power the monsoon. With the Indian monsoon the air masses originate in the southern hemisphere of the ocean and then the vacuum pulls these up across the equator into the Arabian Sea where these air masses curve to the right into India. It thus draws a tremendous amount of moisture and energy from the southern hemisphere into Asia — that’s a unique component of monsoonal circulation in India not shared by any other monsoon in the world.The Indian Ocean is absolutely central — most of the monsoon’s energy that’s released over India comes from the ocean. It’s extracted out of the waters and hidden in the atmosphere as latent heat. It’s expressed only when that moisture condenses and causes rainfall.Numerous models find that increased Co2 levels will result in a warmer planet — this means more moisture in the atmosphere which will cause increased rainfall in the South Asian monsoon. We have tested these predictions using sediment records off the coast of India and we’ve verified that indeed with future Co2 increases caused by anthropogenic or human action there will be more intense monsoon rain. Importantly there are two opposing forces at play here. Anthropogenic aerosols in the atmosphere over India decrease moisture and reduce the Indian monsoon’s strength. But alongside rising Co2 is intensifying the monsoon. So we have two forces pulling at opposite climatic ends. But I would predict increases in monsoonal rain in terms of mean annual rainfall levels.Yes but in a different timescale. We examine changes in rainfall from 20000 to 100000-year cycles. In these timescales there is a lot of variability associated with changes in Earth’s orbit and how much solar radiation comes into the system. Earth has three components of orbital-scale variants — the circularity of Earth’s orbit the spin axis or tilt of the planet and the precision of that spin axis with respect to the sun stars and the equatorial plane. All three change over time and alter the amount of solar radiation coming to a specific latitude by upto 12% even which is a lot. Such orbital scale variability becomes a huge driver of change in monsoon patterns over long timescales. In the short term changes in solar exposure play a role in warming up the landmass — that’s how monsoon circulation is initiated. But other factors drive how strong or weak the monsoon is each year.Most weakened monsoons in India are associated with El Nino events or condensation being drawn away to the equatorial Pacific Ocean  with consequent effects on the Indian monsoon. Another factor is the Indian Ocean dipole or a difference in sea surface temperatures between opposite poles or parts of the ocean. A positive dipole phase means warmer sea temperatures in the western Indian Ocean and cooler temperatures in the east. This has been causing high rainfall and floods in east Africa and droughts and heatwaves in Australia . With increased Co2 levels temperature and circulation in the equatorial Pacific and Indian Ocean will have an even stronger impact on monsoons everywhere.I’ll share a story. Some years ago several scientists were at a seminar discussing the American monsoon. An Indian academic suddenly remarked ‘You know I work on the North American monsoon but I’m from India — now that really is a monsoon!’ This observation stayed with me. If you define a monsoon as the seasonal change in wind direction and rainfall then there are monsoons all over tropical and subtropical areas. Even the south-west United States has a monsoon in this context as do South America and Australia. The monsoons are global but India’s monsoon is truly incredible — it is one of the most unique systems on Earth in terms of its energy its intricate natural systems and its interrelationship with human society",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9lbmVyZ3kvcG93ZXIvbnRwY3MtamhhYnVhLXBvd2VyLWJpZC1oaXRzLW5wYS10YWctaHVyZGxlL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgzNjk3NjQwLmNtc9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9lbmVyZ3kvcG93ZXIvbnRwY3MtamhhYnVhLXBvd2VyLWJpZC1oaXRzLW5wYS10YWctaHVyZGxlL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MzY5NzY0MC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NTPC’s Jhabua Power bid hits NPA tag hurdle,"

State-owned power giant NTPC Ltd faces a Section 29A hurdle in its bid for Jhabua Power a clause embedded in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) that prevents bidders from buying insolvent companies if they themselves or their associate companies have a track record of default according to multiple executives.NTPC owns stakes in Ratnagiri Gas and Power Ltd and Konkan LNG. Both companies had defaulted on loans prior to the commencement of Jhabua Power’s insolvency proceedings.The state-owned power giant that accounts for a fourth of India’s energy generation has made a ₹1900 crore offer for Madhya Pradesh-based Jhabua Power under IBC rules. It has revised its offer downward citing the impact of Covid-19.However its offer has run into trouble over concerns over the designation of the accounts of its associate companies as non-performing assets by banks.CARE Ratings downgraded credit facilities of Ratnagiri Gas and Power Ltd to ‘Default’ status on October 19 2020 and had downgraded the status of Konkan LNG’s credit facilities to ‘Default’ on March 7 2019 according to two separate notes accessed by ET.As per IBC rules if a bidder or its associate companies have any accounts that are classified as non-performing assets with banks one year prior to making a bid for an insolvent company its bid could be disqualified unless it agrees to repay all dues including interest to the banks and clear its accounts.Arcelor Mittal was forced to repay all dues of Uttam Galva Steel a company that had been declared a non-performing asset by banks and in which it had a 30% stake to become eligible to bid for Essar Steel.Emailed queries to NTPC Ltd and Jhabua Power’s resolution professional Abhilash Lal remained unanswered as of press time.NTPC is said to have entered one-time settlements with banks for both the associate companies though it has not cleared all dues a mandatory requirement as per the rules.Experts noted that the legal test would be to ascertain whether NTPC had management control of these companies and these could be classified as associate companies.“In the case of NTPC it remains to be seen if the conditions of management and control apply to their investments in the two defaulting companies. If so IBC does mandate that all dues including interest should be cleared before their bid could be eligible” said Aditya Shankar advocate Supreme Court of India.NTPC’s offer competes with one from Adani Group and Gautam Thapar’s Avantha Holdings. The latter also happens to be the promoter of Jhabua Power.Banks have rejected the Avantha Holdings offer citing investigations by government agencies into Thapar group companies.

This week against the usually mundane backdrop of a sports tournament pre-match press conference came a reminder of the power of sports star brands. Before a word had been spoken Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo regarded by many as the best footballer on the planet took his seat in front of the media and removed from view two bottles of Coca-Cola which had been positioned in front of him as part of the company’s 2020 UEFA European Football Championship sponsorship deal. He then picked up a bottle of water and said “Água” followed by: “No Coca-Cola.”

What was seemingly a throwaway gesture went viral spawning memes online discussions and even jokes from other players. It also led to questions over the player’s stance with videos shared of an old advert in which Ronaldo endorses Coca-Cola – although the response to that has included further praise for the now health-fanatic star “growing up” “maturing” and “learning to be more responsible”. Above all the incident seemingly had a significant impact on the soft drink giant’s share price. The day after the incident media reports linked Ronaldo’s actions to a $4 billion drop in Coca-Cola’s market value (although its share price has since bounced back).

Speaking to The Guardian a spokesperson for Euro 2020 stated that “players are offered water alongside Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar on arrival at our press conferences” and that everyone “is entitled to their drink preferences”.

This comment coupled with Ronaldo’s actions may have sparked a trend. The day after Ronaldo hit the headlines French midfielder Paul Pogba removed from sight a bottle of Heineken beer – another tournament partner – that had been placed in front of him at a news conference (albeit without the same seismic impact on the company’s share prices). Tournament organisers are clearly concerned having issued a warning over the behaviour and threatening team fines.

The question now is whether this is a sign of things to come and if so how players’ attitudes towards big sponsors could affect product positioning. Although some in the media have voiced the hope that it could mean the end of product placement realistically that is not going to happen. Whatever the future of this sort of brand interaction there are a number of aspects of this week’s incidents to reflect on.

The first is that these actions perfectly illustrate how player brands – and the values that they communicate – have now become as powerful as their more traditional corporate counterparts. Ronaldo undoubtably sits near if not at the top of the sports personality pile in terms of brand strength. But as we have written on WTR previously a swathe of leading footballers are embracing trademark protection to underpin brand-building efforts.

In May we analysed the portfolios of a number of key players. While Barcelona’s Lionel Messi is a step ahead of any other footballer (with 115 marks) Ronaldo owns 53 trademarks and Pogba 46. Such players inevitably reach a point where they are not only financially comfortable (Celebrity Net Worth estimating that Ronaldo’s net worth is $500 million and Pogba’s $125 million) but increasingly looking at post-playing plans. Thus they will begin to align with companies that they can build meaningful relationships with over the long term and are less minded to appease tournament sponsors that do not align with their personal brand values. In short this sort of player power is not going to go away.

So what does this mean for brands? The good news is that companies that can align strategically with such players will reap the rewards. In fact with consumers increasingly seeking authenticity in the brands that they buy into there is clearly a growing opportunity to be seized on in leveraging shared values with major sports stars. Player tie-ups have long been lucrative. But they will become even more so where aligned with truly shared values and brand DNA.

On the flip side there is an increasing need for brands to consider how to respond to incidents where values collide. The response from Coca-Cola and Heineken this week has been muted. Perhaps this silence was a strategic decision. Or perhaps it is because this was so unexpected. In future sponsors cannot afford to be caught off guard by clashes. At the very least companies sponsoring tournaments teams and athletes need to have a risk management plan in place – a playbook on what to do (or not to do) should they find themselves the centre of discussion.

Ultimately this sort of incident rarely delivers a lasting blow. Coca-Cola and Heineken are strong brands and will soon be looking at this through the rear-view mirror. However the incidents of this week highlight how prominent public figures can significantly influence the perception of a brand through even the smallest of gestures. Therefore it is merely responsible management to consider how and when to react should your brand be placed in that position.

When Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Pogba removed Coca-Cola and Heineken bottles during Euro 2020 press conferences it showed sports stars are rejecting sponsors' products that fail to correspond to their personal values analysts say.Ronaldo has a combined social media audience of around 500 million followers so when he speaks it has an impact.The 36-year-old Portugal captain is a fitness fanatic and made clear what he thought of the Coca-Cola bottle set out in front of him as he spoke to the media on Monday before his country's opening match against Hungary.He shifted the bottle out of sight of the cameras before saying in Portuguese: ""Agua!"" appearing to encourage people to opt for the natural choice instead.Ronaldo went on to score twice in the 3-0 win against Hungary to become the all-time top scorer in European Championship history.The next day France midfielder Paul Pogba who is Muslim and does not drink alcohol made a similar gesture by removing a bottle of Heineken beer during his press conference. The fact that it was a non-alcoholic version did nothing to lessen the message.""We're in a new era where athletes seem to be reclaiming their voice. They seem to reserve the right now to speak and behave in ways that are consistent with what they think what they feel what their values are"" said Professor Simon Chadwick the director of the Centre for the Eurasian Sport Industry at Emlyon Business School in France.Ronaldo has been happy to endorse sugary soft drinks in the past -- in fact he did promotional work for Coca-Cola in China in the mid-2000s and has worked for their rivals Pepsi But Chadwick told AFP the Portuguese superstar was saying very publicly: ""As an individual I have the personal right to move on from whatever I did in the past.""I am entitled to change my opinion I am entitled to shift my values I am entitled to object to products that are not consistent with what I am or what I am trying to represent.""The reach of social media gives such protests more power than ever before.""I call it side-swipe activism"" Chadwick said. ""Whether you are online or you are in the physical world if there is something in front of you that you don't like or isn't aligned with your own values you just move it out of the way.""- Headache for sponsors - Some reports suggested Ronaldo's gesture caused Coca Cola's share price to fall by $4 billion at one point but many analysts said the footballer might not have been responsible.Gregori Volokhine President of Meeschaert Financial Services in New York said the drinks giant's shares finished 0.25 percent down in line with the overall dip in the Dow Jones that day.""With a market value of $235 billion that corresponds to just over $500 million. We wouldn't even have noticed if there hadn't been this controversy"" Volokhine said.So what is the impact for brands when top sports stars reject the products of the sponsors who pay tens of millions of dollars to be associated with an event such as Euro 2020?""It is too early to say"" said Bertrand Chovet head of Brand Finance France.""Product placement could though be more nuanced these days. But the players benefit from these sponsors so they are acting in a slightly contradictory way.""Coca-Cola and Heineken did not respond to AFP's request for comment but UEFA 's tournament director Martin Kallen said: ""The revenues of the sponsors are important for the tournament and for European football.""Chadwick believes such protests are a serious headache for sponsors.""This poses a big challenge because the two extremes are probably the only way forward for sponsors. Either you take away all the logos or you vigorously enforce the contractual rights associated with a sponsorship deal"" he said."

In the defensive end goalie Kristen Campbell put a stop to all 26 shots fired her way. With game one behind them Toronto has pulled ahead of Minnesota 1-0 in the best-of-five series.

""It's what I believe I expect and I think what the group expects as well"" head coach Troy Ryan said in postgame remarks. ""Being everything we thought it would be I think the atmosphere was incredible. I think our performance was pretty good and I think it's a great stepping-stone for us to continue to build on for this series and hopefully moving forward.

For Turnbull the win came as a result of weeks of regular season preparation adding that the team was ""proud"" of its execution throughout their first playoff game.

""The whole season we’ve been building and building waiting to get into playoffs and trying to find our game every week and get better so that when players arrived we are ready to go"" Turnbull said. ""I think there’s still a few areas that we can keep improving on but overall we’re pretty happy with where we’re at so we’re excited to get back on the ice for game two.""

The postseason outing continues a record-breaking regular season for the young league. In total the PWHL set six attendance records for women’s hockey this year with nearly 400000 fans showing up to watch the inaugural teams take the ice over the 72-game season.

Date 19.06.2021 Read time 5 Min Swapping an issue of a football magazine for Autosport sparked Matt Bishop's love of motorsport taking him on a journey that has given him a front-row seat for some of the most exciting moments in Formula One history.

Now Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team’s Chief Communications Officer Matt was previously the editor in chief of respected publication F1 Racing and became a mainstay of the Formula One world in the mid-1990s.

A 10-year stint with McLaren meant Matt was present as Lewis Hamilton made history against the odds in Brazil to win his first World Championship in 2008.

Matt was also one of the founding staff of the all-female Formula 3-level championship W Series which launched in 2019 before returning to Formula One with Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team ahead of the 2021 campaign.

Matt is the latest interview in our exclusive #IAMSTORIES | VOICES series. He shares his experience of being at the centre of one of Formula One's most famous moments and how he was inspired by Lawrence Stroll to return to Formula One.

#IAMSTORIES | VOICES Matt Bishop on 25 years of living and breathing Formula One From the drama of the 2008 Brazilian GP to joining Aston Martin's return to the Formula One grid. Matt Bishop has been at the very heart of some of the most memorable moments in Formula One history. This is his story told in his own passionate words. This is #IAMSTORIES | Voices.

""I first fell in love with motorsport in 1972. I had a subscription to a kids' football magazine called Shoot as part of my pocket money.

“I went to the local newsagent to pick up my copy of Shoot. And on the newsagents counter I saw this magazine called Autosport. I said to the newsagent: ‘Can I swap Shoot for Autosport?’. He said: 'Of course you can'. So I took home Autosport instead. I was hooked.

""The first type of racing I wrote about believe it or not was greyhound racing because in my misspent youth one of the jobs I had was [at] a bookmaker - as a betting shop manager.

""And then I was headhunted by [publishing house] Haymarket to become the launch editor - or the second editor they had a fledgling editor for the pilot issues - of F1 Racing.

""That was in 1996 so I've skipped through a few years now. I was 34 then and that was me full-time in Formula One. I've barely had a waking thought that wasn't about Formula One over the past 25 years.

""I was communications director of the McLaren team in 2008. 2008 was and probably always will be one of the most dramatic seasons of Formula One.

""Felipe Massa won the race [in Brazil]. As he crossed the line he was celebrating his race win at home in Sao Paolo and his World Championship. And then unbeknown to the Ferrari guys while they were celebrating their win we suddenly saw that Lewis [Hamilton] was going to overtake Timo Glock's Toyota. On the last corner of the last lap of the last race of the year. You couldn't make it up could you? And he did it.

""As he did it we just rushed across the pitlane and up to the pitwall and saw him go past in P5. Felipe Massa thought he was champion for 40 seconds. But he wasn't. Lewis Hamilton won the World Championship.

""It was the most extraordinary experience and really one of the greatest days of my life still.

""As I was taking Lewis from TV crew to TV crew - in that extraordinarily congested euphoric for us Interlagos paddock - suddenly crawling through the legs and between the bodies of the cameraman and the interviewers and the journalists was Felipe Massa: 'Congratulations Lewis'. Well how about that for proper sportsmanship?

""I joined Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team in January and I'd been out of Formula One for a little while. I was made aware that Lawrence Stroll obviously the Chairman of Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team would like to see me.

""He said: 'I would like you to come and work for us as our Chief Communications Officer'. Having been absolutely inspired by the way he talked about his ambitions for the team and his mission to make it successful the answer yes came very very fast.

""I don't know when we will be successful but I do know we will be successful.""

Then as new sports department management took the reins I was given the chance to take home the same money I would have made by working through next spring if I left this summer instead.

So yeah they’re gonna pay me to not write. I’m sure readers players coaches and general managers throughout the land wish someone had hit upon this solution long ago but better late than never right?

And from my end who doesn’t aspire to be Chase Daniel?

I came here 38 years and one month ago from The Charlotte Observer. No one asked me to come but the people in charge ended up letting me hang around a very long time and I am grateful.

I was headed to Philly regardless because my lovely and talented wife whom I met at The Observer got a job at The Inquirer. (She left that job a long time ago and is now wrapping up a second career as a teacher.) By the time we moved into a cockroach-inclusive apartment at 20th and Green in Fairmount I had managed to talk my way past the door at the Daily News initially as a summer replacement copy editor on the news desk.

I tiptoed back into sports when no one was watching and after several years of editing returned to writing. Those mid-’80s nights as a copy editor absorbing how Stan Hochman Mark Whicker Ray Didinger Rich Hofmann Phil Jasner Elmer Smith Paul Hagen and some others did it basically helped me forge whatever style it is that I eventually tried to fob off on readers.

I began a 13½-year run covering the Flyers in 1989 despite starting out knowing as much about hockey as you’d expect someone raised in North Carolina in the ’60s and ’70s to know. I treasure those years -- for the work I got to do the places I got to go and for the people I got to meet.

There couldn’t have been anything much better in daily journalism than being a Daily News sportswriter in the ’90s. We traveled anywhere we wanted wrote whatever we wanted most of the time using as many words as we thought we needed. Yes we had great resources but we also had leaders who understood what worked.

When The Inquirer absorbed the Daily News staff a few years back I wondered if my style would fit if the other side of the office’s central corridor would be stuffy and rigid. But everyone has been great. I was made to feel welcome.

I can thank people by name privately without boring you with that and I’m pretty sure you don’t care about this story I wrote or those stairs I sprinted up to meet a deadline or that days-long series of flights to some distant Olympiad many years back.

I do relish having taken part in the coverage in one capacity or another of a bunch of Super Bowls -- most notably LII -- along with a bunch of Stanley Cup Finals one World Series one NBA Finals one Summer Olympics and four Winter Olympics. Because of the drying up of resources in the biz that’s a dance card a lot of younger more talented writers will never have a chance to fill. I’ve led a privileged writing life a better one than my skills ever warranted.

The folks at what was then Comcast SportsNet somehow thought it was a good idea to beam me into your unsuspecting living rooms once a week or so for about 20 years. They eventually wised up. I plan to spend part of my retirement sorting through a large collection of out-of-date neckties acquired during that time. I’m told hobbies help with the adjustment.

This might be the place to give a shoutout to all the copy editors over the years who puzzled over why I thought 4-for-7 was 50% or who when tasked with writing my headline had to figure out exactly what the hell I was trying to say.

But more than anything else what I want to do here is thank you the audience. I’m sorry I wasn’t ever quite as good as I wanted to be or as good as you deserved. I never stopped trying to get better and despite vast shortcomings I think I’m more polished now than I was 10 or 20 or 30 years ago.

That’s one reason I’ve kept at it so long the thought that I might one day get it right like the thousand monkeys eventually typing Shakespeare.

I never applied for a job in any other market. Maybe that betrays a lack of ambition. It definitely reflects my view that this is the place. There is no big city in the country where sports matters more where if you are covering say the Eagles you know that people are dissecting every paragraph reading every word.

The trend in the business as long as I’ve been in it has been toward shorter and shorter stories and I always nod agreeably when editors preach this gospel. But I also know that if I were to write 2000 words tomorrow on how Nick Sirianni chooses the Eagles-themed T-shirts he wears to practice and if I were to miss a typo 1967 words in I would hear about it on Twitter and through email.

For me sportswriting has always been as much about the writing as about the sports. That perspective is becoming rare in the biz. So much of what seems to be in vogue today is foreign terrain to me and I don’t like that feeling because I never wanted to write like “an old guy.”

Way back when I started out sports was attractive because it encouraged a certain writerly style more so than news reporting. You were granted freedom to have a voice to be whimsical or sarcastic. I might have tested the limits of that freedom a time or two. Thanks for indulging me.

I’m probably still going to write a bit somehow somewhere. Maybe even here from time to time if the stars align.

Fourth Ave. and Beakes Sharon Gillespie is dancing. While an Observer photographer clicks away Gillespie seventy-five snaps her fingers sways and sings snatches of “Blue Moon” and “Under the Boardwalk.”

She’s remembering evenings sixty years ago when neighborhood boys would gather to sing doo-wop while a teenaged Sharon Longmire listened from her window across the street. “That was so special!” she says.

She relishes her memories of the “old neighborhood” as she and others call the once predominantly black area north of Kerrytown. She remembers how it embraced her when at age nine she left her grandmother’s house in Lawton Oklahoma to join the mother she hardly knew in Ann Arbor. (Her father also lived in Oklahoma.)

“I cried and cried” she recalls. Her mother a nurse’s aide had recently remarried and gave birth to two more daughters in the next few years. When the marriage ended the family moved briefly to Ypsilanti but to Gillespie’s relief soon returned to the old neighborhood.

She felt blessed to live in a place where “everybody looked out for everybody else.” She has happy memories of ice skating at what is now Wheeler Park buying penny candy from nearby stores and even the time when showing off she rode her bike hands-free and crashed into a tree.

Only her pride was hurt. “I was a little tomboy!” she says laughing.

Retired from an administrative assistant job at U-M and living on the far west side Gillespie is not impressed by the “big ugly houses” that have replaced many of the small frame homes and bungalows of her youth. And “don’t get me started on the ‘Water Hill’ thing!” she says. “Gentrification came to our neighborhood.”

The beginning of the end came in the mid-1960s when Ann Arbor banned racial discrimination in housing. The federal government caught up several years later and over the decades most black residents moved away or passed on. Gillespie sees the irony: the end of segregation freed the neighborhood and then killed it. “You gain something you lose something” she says.

In Oklahoma she says black children were taught “how to act around white people so we wouldn’t get killed.” Ann Arbor’s integrated classrooms were safer but at the end of the school day the white students “went their way and we went ours.” Though Gillespie enjoyed her time at Ann Arbor High she says that for many years after graduation in 1962 she and the other three dozen or so black grads that year didn’t attend class reunions.

Then as their fortieth reunion approached Gillespie was invited to join the planning committee. “I was like a detective” she recalls. “I found all the black people in my class except for two.” She and others have taken part ever since.

Pre-pandemic she also enjoyed the annual Old Neighborhood Picnic with other former residents and small get-togethers with “Mrs. Arnold’s kids.” When she was a girl Summit St. neighbor Helen Arnold would spot her and her friends playing outside and summon them into her home for Bible study. No one dared say no.

Years later Arnold invited them to a reunion. “We were all so happy to see each other again!” Gillespie remembers. Arnold passed on years ago but “her” kids continue to meet.

Married at seventeen she gave birth to a son Kelly and soon divorced. She worked at the National Bank and Trust employee cafeteria on Main St. (now Chase Bank) then took a job in the print shop of a nonprofit called the Commission on Professional and Hospital Activities. She was already a crackerjack typist and CPHA paid for her to learn computer typesetting. She moved on to a couple of printing firms and often trained people at other companies.

After two more brief marriages she found a life partner in Raymond Gillespie. They had twenty-one happy years together before he died suddenly of a heart attack in 2006. “I still miss him so much” she says. Kelly her only child died of cancer soon afterward.

She cared for her mother in her last years and grateful for the help of Arbor Hospice volunteered there after retirement. It’s just one of a long list of commitments from the Salvation Army to the Alpha House family shelter. Remembering how her husband died while she was at work she a joined a hospice program called No One Dies Alone. She’d visit people nearing the end to sing with them or if they wished pray together.

She’s also very active in her church St. Paul Missionary Baptist; an informal counselor to young women in rehab; and an honorary aunt to many young people. “I guess I’m a good listener” she says.

Gillespie recently dipped her toe back in the dating pool but pulled back when she learned that several men who expressed interest hadn’t been vaccinated against Covid-19. It was their loss because Gillespie radiates exuberance.

She still works part-time twice covering for Observer staffers on maternity leaves. When people here learned that she was being profiled one sent a question: “Ask her if she still has Smokey Robinson’s shoes!”

“Smokey! Yes!” she shouts when I ask.

Just before they hit it big she explains Smokey Robinson and the Miracles played the long-gone Como Club on Green St. Afterward “they were headed out the door and me and my girlfriend asked them for an autograph. He had his [performance] shoes off and handed them to me. They were beige suede buck shoes.” Robinson signed and left. “I had to go out and say ‘Smokey you forgot your shoes!'”

Gillespie is looking forward to Juneteenth but this year she won’t be competing in the cakewalk at Wheeler Park–the NAACP’s commemoration of the end of slavery has gone virtual (see Events June 19). She’ll also miss the African American Downtown Festival canceled again by the pandemic.

She enjoys the street fair on Ann St. and N. Fourth Ave. as much as anyone but wishes more people knew the history behind the concerts and barbecue. When she was was growing up this was Ann Arbor’s black business district.

“The restaurants barbershops the bars the beauty parlors–that’s where the black people met” she says. “That was our home.”

Correspondent

FAIRHAVEN — Members of Town Meeting on June 12 cautiously decided they want to advance a proposal to establish a town-owned broadband network.

Article 34 at Annual Town Meeting was to establish a municipal light plant or locally owned utility for internet infrastructure. The article passed with a two-thirds majority vote 143 to 20.

This is the first of two town meeting votes required for the proposal with the second one likely happening in the fall.

Massachusetts law allows a city or town to establish its own telecommunications system and/or broadband network under the designation of a utility like gas and/or electricity.

The project is being proposed in order to allow for increased internet and cable options in town which means lower rates. Fiber optics would allow for the fastest internet speeds about several millions of megabits per second.

After a video presentation explaining the benefits of a municipal light plant Selectman Robert Espindola representing the Broadband Study Committee spoke on behalf of the article.

“This came about after years of the Board of Selectmen and cable department receiving many complaints about the quality issues and service in general from our internet provider” said Espindola.

Espindola explained that this first vote does not bind the town financially to anything. The first vote is about gathering support to learn more. “The motion does not commit us to anything. It only signals an interest level from the community. No funds are being requested at this time.”

Approving the municipal light plant doesn’t automatically mean the town will build its own fiber optic network. It just allows the town to seek the funding. Besides borrowing much of the funding for the network would come from rate payers wishing to opt into the network. At least 40% of property owners in town are required to make the municipal light plant sustainable.

The project would be entirely voluntary for residents. No tax dollars would be used to fund the network which is something Espindola made abundantly clear several times at Town Meeting.

There was naturally some skeptical voices in attendance who believe this venture to be too costly. “I agree we need more competition but we won’t save money in the long run” said Gary Lavalette Town Meeting member. Lavalette stated his research concluded that because the town doesn’t own any of its utility poles it will cost $50 a month per pole to have fiber optics.

Espindola responded that pole costs have been factored into estimates for building out the network which would be in the range of millions of dollars. Exact figures won’t be determined until later on in the approval process.

According to the video presentation internet costs through the town’s own network are projected to be $55 to $60 a month lower than the $85 on average it costs homeowners with Comcast as their provider. The town would also have internet speeds 10 times faster than what it is currently.

Espindola concluded with “I wouldn’t advocate for anything that didn’t save the town money.”

Plenty of people expressed their support for this proposal or at least were willing to push it along to the next stage where more answers and information will be provided.

When one resident asked why so few cities and towns are going with this option if it is so wonderful; another resident responded that Comcast actively lobbies against them.

Resident James Anderson encouraged people to think about the future and how critically dependent most of us are on the internet. “They say the only thing certain are death and taxes; I’d add to that increased fees from Comcast” he said.

“They raise my rates every 6 months to a year. This light plant would give the town control. Customers save [30% to 50%] on their bills on average. It is a cost with significant benefits and positive outcomes” said Christopher Fidalgo resident.

Residents can expect much campaigning in the future months leading up to the needed second town meeting vote to approve the municipal light plant.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

MARK LEVIN FOX NEWS HOST: Hello America I'm Mark Levin. This is LIFE LIBERTY & LEVIN.

American Marxism: this is a topic I'm going to be covering for many many months. Why? Sounds weird doesn't it? Yes it sounds weird but it is surrounding us. It's in our everyday life.

Marxism has spawned a number of movements in this country over the course of decades. But it has now reached its pinnacle. Whether it's critical theory critical race theory critical gender theory critical immigration theory which comes under different names the so-called Green New Deal movement which is a Marxist attack a de-growth movement borne in Europe exported to the United States. That is a war on your lifestyle a war on your income a war on your private property a war on capitalism.

It's true. It's here. It's now.

I've written a book called ""American Marxism."" I don't make any bones about it. We've got to take the language back. We've got to take the narrative back. And we need to confront this.

It's in our schools. It's in our immigration policies. It's in the Executive Orders issued by the President of the United States.

It's in our corporations. It's in our media.

Some of these people are unwitting who are promoting it. Some of them are surrogates who are useful or really useless idiots.

And so that's why I've written ""American Marxism."" You can see it in Congress. You can see it playing out right now.

They talk about the squad. This isn't a squad. This is a cabal of Marxists who hate this country some of them first second generation immigrants into the country who bring their attitudes and their indoctrination into the country and are at war right there in the Halls of Congress against our own country.

They have found a home in the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party has no intention of doing anything about this.

What has Nancy Pelosi done? She's been a quisling. She's been weak. Why? Because their numbers are increasing.

When you have open borders and people are coming into the country and they're not vetted and you don't know who they are and when you have people in our country who welcome them by trashing America from elementary school the middle school the high school and beyond -- trash America. And our media a President of the United States who trashes his own country in the most devilish and vile terms. Well people aren't going to assimilate into our culture when our culture is under attack from within.

And so where does this all come from? Well we know where it all comes from.

Now the media aren't going to tell you where it all comes from. The Democratic Party is not going to tell you. Black Lives Matter -- Black Lives Matter is a Marxist organization. How do we know? They don't confess it they celebrate it. Antifa what is it? It's a Marxist anarchist organization. How do we know? They say so. They're proud of it. The media won't say it. They're just peaceful protesters trying to bring in racial justice.

This has nothing to do with racial justice. It has nothing to do with justice of any kind. This is a full scale multilevel intersectional attack on our system of government on our founding on our principles and the biggest political party in the country the Democratic Party represents this movement.

The media in this country with very few exceptions represents this movement. Our educational system starting with our colleges and universities has fomented promoted created mobs promoted violence coming out of our classrooms and now has leached into our elementary schools secondary schools and high schools. Maybe they'll call it critical race theory maybe they'll call it social justice. Maybe they'll call it equity.

They'll call it whatever they will. It's all the same thing.

Some of them are completely out of the closet. Now look at Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders calls himself a democratic socialist. He is not a democratic socialist. He's an old Marxist. He's an old New York Marxist who has a massive soapbox.

He is in charge of the Budget Committee. He is driving the finances in this country and he is driving them into the ground. Trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars of spending and on what? To whose benefit?

You already see the beginnings of inflation and once the inflation monster is out of the box that's going to affect each and every one of us. Why? Because it devalues the currency. You're income your pension your savings and price of goods and services go up.

So while the value of the dollar goes down the price goes up guess what happens? More people are impoverished. And what will the answer be from Biden and his fellow Democrats? More spending more government more centralization.

And by the way these policies come with what? They come with this -- an iron fist. As the police they get stronger and stronger and stronger. Did you hear the Attorney General earlier this week? What did he say? The greatest danger is domestic terrorism.

And what's the greatest danger in domestic terrorism? White supremacy. Who are these white supremacists? The Klan? The neo Nazis?

Well we have a big enough F.B.I. We have enough prosecutors. Go get them. Who is stopping them?

Now what was interesting during his press conference I didn't hear a single name of any organization of any person of any investigation of any prosecution that's going on. And this is the game they're playing.

White supremacy the white dominant society this is critical race theory. This is the 1619 Project. So you'd hate America because there's just too much whiteness in its founding; hate the founding dismiss every document and everything the framers did.

White supremacy white domination -- then they talk about the Klan and the neo Nazis. There's over 16 million people in this country that the government identifies and labels as white Caucasian. Are we all members of the Klan? Are we all neo Nazis? How absurd. How disgusting.

You have Republican legislatures that are trying to get their election system back since the COVID virus and since the system was changed illegitimately by judges by governors by Boards of Elections by Secretaries of State.

The Federal Constitution gives this power to the state legislatures to no one else. They did it purposely because they wanted the representatives of the people of each state to make those decisions.

So Joe Biden goes out on a blasphemous campaign a poisonous cancerous campaign and accuses those legislators of conducting Jim Crow-like activities to suppress the vote.

Now Joe Biden knows something about Jim Crow activity since early in his Senate career he was a Jim Crowster. He supported segregation. He opposed integration in our cities. He didn't want his kids to attend integrated schools in the inner city called them potential jungles.

That's Joe Biden. So he knows something about it. But he knows nothing about what's taking place today.

So the state legislators want to go back to pre-COVID. Was pre-COVID Jim Crow? And the Attorney General of the United States says ""I need to double the number of civil rights division attorneys I have"" and they have a new civil rights leader who is a bigot an out and out bigot.

Why does he want to double the civil rights attorneys? To go after these Republican states because you see what they're doing is the worst thing since the 1960s when Robert Kennedy was Attorney General of the United States.

You see what's going on here? They are saying that people with whom they disagree are potential domestic terrorists. They lump everybody in with the Klan. They lump everybody in with the neo Nazis. And by the way if you're not white and you love America and you're not part of this counter revolution this American Marxism movement you know what they say about you? And there are many of you -- black Hispanic interracial what have you -- they say you have been colonized.

Your mind you belief systems have been destroyed. You've been colonized. You may be black you may be brown you may be yellow you may be red you may be interracial it doesn't matter because you're one of them.

If you're not down for the revolution you're one of them.

That is why I've written this book ""American Marxism"" to expose them to expose it all and then at the very end to discuss a number of things that we must do can do to claw back and get our country back get our country back the left -- or what? The white people get their country back.

No red blooded American Yanks of every shade every background every ancestry and every religion.

Now I have a couple of really fine guests tonight. And the first guest is Dr. Zuhdi Jasser. Now why do I have Dr. Zuhdi Jasser on this program?

Number one he's an American patriot. He served in the U.S. Navy. Number two he has been fighting these domestic Jihadists and others for years.

He is a man of great courage. He's an American-Muslim. His family left Syria under horrific conditions and came to the United States. And they and he are great patriots.

You don't hear about Zuhdi Jasser instead we hear about Omar and Tlaib and CAIR and these other hate American individuals and hate American organizations.

Well I wanted to bring Zuhdi Jasser in so we could have an honest discussion about what's going on in this country and the growing wing in the Democratic Party of this element this radical Marxist element anti- Semitic anti-American element.

Zuhdi Jasser how are you my friend?

DR. ZUHDI JASSER PRESIDENT AMERICAN ISLAMIC FORUM FOR DEMOCRACY: It's great to be with you Mark. Thanks brother. How are you?

LEVIN: I'm doing great. And I want to thank you for everything you do. You're the President of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy. You're a Senior Fellow at the Center for Security Policy. You're an Internal Medicine specialist former U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander. You wrote a fantastic book ""A Battle for the Soul of Islam.""

Zuhdi Jasser the battle for the soul of Islam in the United States at this point. When you look at Tlaib and and Omar and others who are just rabid anti-American anti-Semites and in my view out of the closet Marxists. This is a real battle and you saw this battle early on. How is that?

JASSER: Well I have to tell you this isn't new to us. As you know my family and I did not only escape Syria but we escaped this synergy that happens in the regimes across the Middle East between the far left Marxist socialist and the Islamists. We call it the Red Green Axis.

And whether it's Saddam Hussein working with the Hamas Assad is working with Hamas and Damascus; Tehran working with Venezuela -- this is an old playbook. And a lot of these evangelical Islamists left Somalia left the Palestinian areas came to the U.S. not because they love America but came because they are evangelizing their Islamism. They want to come in to weaken America.

And then there's the rest of us I think the majority of Muslims here in America that came to be free came to be able to practice our religion like we could in now so-called Muslim countries came to celebrate individualism democracy not Marxism. And you see now with Black Lives Matter and a lot of these other new movements they're using the playbook Mark that I was talking about in my congressional testimony back in 2011- 2013 to the Senate to the House.

I told them I said Islamophobia is being used as a bludgeon to prevent you from criticizing Muslims calling you bigots and racists because they don't want to deal with theocracy. And now we see the same thing in critical race theory and anyone who is critical of the far left is called a bigot. And the 1619 Project is to the Marxist what the Protocols of the Elders of Zion is to the Islamists in demonizing Jews and the rank anti- Semitism of political Islam.

LEVIN: When we come back Zuhdi Jasser I want to ask you this: why do you think the Democratic Party is so inviting of these kinds of individuals and organizations? Why do you think the media is so embracing of these rebel ideologues who are enormously dangerous to this society?

We'll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

LEVIN: Welcome back America. Zuhdi Jasser President of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy and a very courageous man out there in Arizona.

Zuhdi why do you think the Democratic Party is actually embracing and encouraging these individuals in this movement? Why do you think the media are doing exactly the same thing?

JASSER: There's multiple reasons. Part of I tis ideological. They are collectivists. They're anti American. They really don't appreciate or love the institutions but I have -- in America which is based on our Founding Fathers our constitutionalism our classic liberalism and liberty if you will.

But at the end of the day Mark they're afraid of them. They're afraid of the Islamists and I have to tell you the Democratic Party has lost its way.

You know you think of Tom Lantos. When I was a physician to Congress I got the honor of knowing Tom Lantos a Hungarian refugee who came to America who was a Holocaust survivor. The Lantos Commission is about his work about standing up for American ideas of human rights abroad. So that's the Democratic Party of the middle 20th Century that now has been lost to this anti-Semitism to political Islam and the Red Green Axis where the center the pro-American part of the Democratic Party has been snuffed out by anti-American folks that have a worldview that's globalist.

So think of the U.N. when you want of think the Democratic Party. Who is running the U.N.? Why does the U.N. supposedly built post World War II to protect democracy is now actually anti-democracy spends over half of its time attacking the only liberal democracy in the Middle East Israel because it's driven by the Venezuelas by the Irans the Chinas of the world.

So you see a synergy globally of jihadists and socialists and the democratic socialists in America are all too willing to let Congress turn into the U.N. where American citizens are left to be subservient. Immigration now is no more about coming to freedom it is about basically letting anybody come in without any ideological filter.

And Omar and Tlaib are prime examples of folks that come here not because they celebrate American ideas but because they want to weaken our institutions.

LEVIN: Those are very very important number of points you raise. Number one look at Bernie Sanders. Nobody dares to seriously question Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is a Marxist. He attracts these domestic Jihadists. Many of them ran his campaigns in local areas or in states. He doesn't have to answer for any of them.

If you were to ask Black Lives Matter members or leaders if they support any politician it would be Bernie Sanders.

When there's violence done by Bernie Sanders supporters the media basically squelching. For instance what took place four years ago when the congressional baseball game took place. The media was very low to mention that the shooter who almost killed Steve Scalise and two police officers among others was a Bernie Sanders supporter.

And then you look at January 6 you look at what took place there and they are trying to paint every single Trump supporter as a white supremacist. The Attorney General gives this outrageous speech where he draws in the media to his own employees at the Department of Justice where I was once Chief of Staff.

There is a lot going on in this country in terms of a movement towards tyranny that concerns me greatly. Do you agree or disagree with that?

JASSER: I couldn't agree more. I mean it starts with Biden from the top. He had a tarmac staged embrace of Rashida Tlaib in which he called her a fighter called her courageous and she is no different than Abbas's Fatah in her secularism and her embrace of Hamas as Omar is basically a Hamas supporter. And at the end of the day the Democratic Party is embracing them.

You see now sort of an unleashing of jihadists. Abrar Omeish she is a School Board representative who is 24 years old gave a commencement speech to Justice High School in which she told the folks in Northern Virginia to embrace jihad against the white supremacists against the capitalists.

So you see now the Democratic Party -- she's a Democratic elected official whose father is one of the founding folks in the Muslim Brotherhood Esam Omeish that even Obama couldn't appoint and was dismissed from the Immigration Commission in 2007 because of how radical he is -- I'm sorry 2009.

So at the end of the day you see now coming to fruition this sort of farm team of jihadists working with a farm team of progressivists that have taken over the far left and Americans are sort of sitting back watching this. Day-to-day we sort of respond to this tweet and that tweet and it's more than single tweets. It is a resume of radicalism that Omar Tlaib the far left have that we are ignoring at our own destruction.

LEVIN: And Joe Biden is ignoring it too. We have open borders. We have no idea who is coming into this country. We can't assume everybody is on the up and up because that's just not the way the world works and Joe Biden doesn't seem to give a damn.

Joe Biden as you said embraced Tlaib. She's among the worst politicians that this nation has ever seen quite frankly. She is very open about her views and her anti-Semitism and anti-Americanism. Joe Biden embraces her.

Apparently Joe Biden's Chief of Staff spends a lot of time talking to that wing of the Democratic Party wanting to know what they want. And then we have even worse than that then we have them constantly going on about the State of Israel as an apartheid country. They've all but said that it should be pushed into the Mediterranean Sea.

They were trying to take steps to prevent us from supporting Israel when rockets were fired into these Israeli population centers by Hamas of all things. We know this Zuhdi Jasser.

Now ""The New York Times"" knows this. ""The Washington Post"" knows this. NBC ABC and CBS know this. MSNBC and CNN know this. Why do they pretend that they don't? Why do they act like it is Israel or it is the United States that is at fault? These media corporate institutions -- I mean CNN is owned by AT&T MSNBC and NBC are owned by Comcast. What in the hell is going on with these corporations? In these corporate boardrooms? Are they cowards too?

JASSER: It's just the utilization at any cost of identity politics and the Palestinian narrative fits the identity-politic of the aggrieved victims when in fact even the term cycle of violence that they say implies a moral equivalency which doesn't exist.

Hamas starts these wars and attack schools and attack civilians and then when Israel responds to defend itself it somehow becomes a cycle. And this is what Omar says that is celebrated by the left as she sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee that she has no business sitting on.

While she and Tlaib also defend BDS. BDS is the Boycott Divest and Sanctions Movement. As you know Mark that is basically a movement to destroy all of Israel's economy and wipe it out. So to say that that somehow that's compatible with sitting on the Foreign Affairs Committee I've testified that we should have security clearances limited on whether they believe in political Islam or not and they've not done that.

The left needs to wake up and America needs to wake up about the threat of their ideology

LEVIN: If an enemy of America and outspoken enemy of America is sitting on that Foreign Policy Committee. You have a man in Swalwell who literally slept with a Chinese communist spy who remains on the Intelligence Committee.

You have the inability of the leadership of the Democratic Party in the House to take control of these growing elements within its caucus. And you have Chuck Schumer the Majority Leader of the Senate Democrat from New York Jewish like me who says absolutely nothing to condemn this growing poison within his own party because he fears that AOC may challenge him in a Democratic primary.

This is a disgrace and there sits Joe Biden throwing around the term Jim Crow where it doesn't apply knowing it doesn't apply talking about a white supremacy a white majority dominated society when the violence that we saw all last summer from the Marxist elements were the violent rhetoric and the anti-Semitic rhetoric that we're hearing from Congress is coming out of his party and he says nothing.

I'll be right back.

JON SCOTT FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Welcome to ""FOX News Live."" I'm Jon Scott.

Tropical Depression Claudette claiming the lives of 12 people in Alabama 10 of the victims including nine children died in a 15-vehicle crash near Greenville. Police say the vehicles likely hydroplaned on wet roads and a man and a young boy died when a tree fell on their house just outside Tuscaloosa.

Police now say last night's deadly crash at a Florida Pride Parade was a tragic accident. According to investigators the 77-year-old driver who took part in the parade accidentally hit the gas killing one person and seriously injuring another. No charges have been filed against the driver.

And a volunteer for New York mayoral candidate Eric Adams was stabbed multiple times today during a campaign event in the Bronx. He suffered nonlife-threatening injuries.

I'm Jon Scott. Now back to LIFE LIBERTY & LEVIN.

LEVIN: Welcome back America. Zuhdi Jasser you've written in ""Newsweek"" about this fusion of Black Lives Matter which is a Marxist anti-American anti-Semitic organization and these modern Islamists of which we've been talking. Describe that a little bit further for us.

JASSER: This is so important Mark because it's not just about our Muslim reform and against political Islam that is -- the far left the Black Lives Matter movement wants to destroy our institutions just like the Mao Chinese Revolution did just like the far left Marxist revolutions from Venezuela to the Soviets Chinese et cetera. It's the exact same mantra which is destroy the institutions of democracy destroy the institutions of capitalism and individualism and allow then an autocratic socialist entity take power.

We saw it. My parents saw it in Syria in Iraq. China is all about it. It's the same type of movement. That's why they tear down our statues in their protests and their violent riots from Portland to Washington. It's the exact same movement.

Employ us in the Muslim reform movement to help you because we know their playbook and we are willing to be leaders at the head of the spear if you will.

LEVIN: It's interesting they talk about American History. They talk about the Confederacy. They talk about these various generals. They talk about the Founding Fathers. You know who they don't talk about? They don't talk about Marxism.

They don't talk about how a hundred million people lost their lives under the doctrine of Marxism. They don't talk about how Mao Zedong murdered 60 million of his own people. They don't talk about how Stalin murdered 25 to 30 million of his own people. They don't talk about how current Communist China has rounded up Uyghurs two and a half million who are tortured who are raped who are murdered.

And I'll talk about that as a matter of fact many of the supporters of Black Lives Matter defend Communist China. So these are massive gulags. These are massive genocidal states. Bernie Sanders never criticizes them he criticizes America.

We have slavery going on in this world right now. Throughout the world we have it going on in Africa we have it going on in the Middle East. We have going on in the in the Far East. As I said we have it going in Xi's China. Real live slavery today not 150 years ago; slavery today of black people of Muslim people white people all kinds of people.

Nothing not a word.

You look at Black Lives Matter. What the hell have they done in our inner cities to help our communities? They don't fight for school choice. They don't fight against enshrining Democratic Party iron fisted rule which has destroyed so many of these cities. They don't fight against crime in these cities where black on black murder is through the roof.

Black Lives Matter -- that's a very nice title. But when it comes to actual blacks that is African-Americans what the hell do they do? And Antifa Antifa is a movement that was imported into the United States. It started in London. It's been heavily funded. It's now in the United States.

And so quickly I'll ask you this. And it's not a fair question but I'll ask anyway because you're a very wise man. Where do we go from here?

JASSER: We have to develop a coalition Mark of those who love America that don't tweet about our soldiers being terrorists like Omar does; but actually talk about that the value that we bring to the world in advancing capitalism and freedom and liberty and recognize the Black Lives Matter movement and the far left for the destructionists that they are just like the Taliban destroyed the statues in Afghanistan the Black Lives far left movement is trying to destroy America's institution.

I believe the majority of Americans don't want to destroy our institutions don't see us all as racists but see us as promoters for freedom and liberty not only domestically but globally. And many Muslims Arabs and others that came here want to celebrate that and it's only the minority of Islamists that don't and we can defeat them Mark.

LEVIN: Beautiful. You should have been the Senator from Arizona. I wish Governor Doocy had listened to me over the airwaves and said that's the man that needs to be your Senator replacing John McCain. But he didn't.

Zuhdi Jasser keep at it baby. We appreciate it.

JASSER: Yes sir.

LEVIN: We'll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

LEVIN: Welcome back America. I want to continue on this topic. Honestly if I don't do it nobody is going to do it so I'm doing it.

We have a great guest in Congressman Lee Zeldin. Let me tell you a little bit about Congressman Lee Zeldin.

He sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee with Omar as a matter of fact. He served four years in the Army on active duty. During that time he served including as military intelligence officer prosecutor military magistrate while assigned to the Army's Elite 82nd Airborne Division.

In the summer of 2006 Congressman Zeldin was deployed to Tikrit Iraq with an infantry battalion fellow paratroopers in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. You're a great patriot and hero Congressman. I know you've announced that you're running in the Republican Primary for Governor of New York.

Let's focus a moment on New York. We saw something a few weeks ago that was utterly shocking. As the terrorists in the Gaza Strip Hamas were firing missiles into Israel and Israel was defending itself. You had individuals with Palestinian flags chasing down Orthodox Jews in trucks in a parking lot.

You had the so-called Diamond District under attack by dozens of thugs who were attacking Jews randomly on the street. You could see in Los Angeles the swastika was being painted on synagogues and that Jewish community has been under attack both by Black Lives Matter a few weeks ago. What do you make of all this Congressman?

REP. LEE ZELDIN (R-NY): It was sickening to watch and I'm in New York. I represent a congressional district in New York. I'm Jewish and I am a strong backer of religious freedom here in the United States and all around the world.

You saw men and women being attacked because they were Jewish. It was raw violent hate. Here in New York it is a consequence of not just the rise of anti-Semitism but elected officials in New York City in Albany turning their backs on law enforcement.

They supported the defund the police move in New York City where last year they took out over a billion dollars from New York City's budget for the NYPD. They got rid of bail where now people are getting released in the same day. It's not that they're fearful that they're going to get caught they know they're going to get caught but they are confident that after they do get caught they'll be released again.

It's a convergence of a number of forces. NYPD now morale low; retirement packets surging; suicides increasing and you end up left with innocent men and women of different backgrounds. We saw other communities under attack. But as you point out most recently with the Jewish community and law enforcement doesn't have their back the way that they want to.

It's a sickening erosion of public safety and raw hate that is hurting people physically and it is coming without consequences.

LEVIN: Now the Attorney General -- I mentioned this earlier in the program was Zuhdi Jasser -- had this big press conference. He calls in the media. He wants it to be a sterling iconic moment where he says we have domestic terrorism going on in this country; that we're going to increase our resources and focus on it.

He compares himself to Robert Kennedy in the early 60s and he talks about white supremacy. But he never once talked about the fact that the F.B.I. statistics show that when it comes to religious hate crimes overwhelmingly almost 60 percent are against Jews. And he doesn't mention exactly who it is that is involved in these hate crimes against Jews.

I'm no fan of neo Nazis and Klansmen. As a matter of fact if we can wipe them out that's fine by me. But it's not Klansmen and neo Nazis in the Deep South. It's other people who are doing this to Orthodox Jews in particular in your state and especially in Brooklyn New York. But he didn't mention it. He certainly didn't emphasize it. What do you make of that? Does that concern you?

ZELDIN: It is greatly concerning because it's about shifting political narratives. It's about domestic politics and inconveniently avoiding truths. And it's -- you know unfortunate when we're trying to tackle a problem and people who should be part of the solution can't even identify what exactly the problem is. And we've seen this in the Halls of Congress with members like Ilhan Omar Rashida Tlaib and others who empower them others who are close to politics people like Linda Sarsour who and others who influence people who are members and all across the entire country.

There are others who promote the BDS movement and raw anti-Semitic hate and if we're going to actually do something about it you can't be silent you can't cower to it. Because if you're silent what happens with these individuals in this movement is that they become elevated they're empowered. In a way you can embrace them through silence.

When really what you should be doing is identifying it confronting it and crushing it. And that first piece in order to confront and crush it is to identify the threat.

This isn't new. I remember towards the end of the time of Barack Obama's period in the White House there was an issue with Democrats identifying radical Islamic extremism as being a threat. Fast forward to today they are unwilling to identify what is causing these violent attacks so you can't confront it and crush it.

You're willing to identify it. I'm willing to identify but when you have people who are part of the Department of Justice the F.B.I. and they're not willing to call it balls and strikes accurately. As a consequence you end up elevating and power embracing it and people actually get hurt as a result of it.

LEVIN: We'll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

LEVIN: Congressman Lee Zeldin you know I see a fusion of these radical Marxist movements a fusion of anti-Semitism with some of the radical Muslim movements and people in the House that we've talked about among others. And all this action really is in the Democratic Party or it's on the fringes of the Democratic Party.

I hear nothing from Biden. I hear nothing from your senator who like us is Jewish Schumer. I hear nothing from your Speaker of the House. In other words the Democratic Party is either appeasing this movement or these movements are embracing them. What do you want to say to these so-called leaders?

ZELDIN: Lead or get out of the way. I mean Pelosi Hoyer and Clyburn the top three in the House have been serving there now for -- in the House of Representatives for over 104 years. I mean it's time to move on. If you're not willing to lead when you're confronted with people like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib and they're pushing anti-American propaganda if you're going to tolerate it well it's time to move on.

We don't care about your power your prestige your perks as if that is the reason why we are all living here in your world.

We care deeply about our country. I still serve to this day in the Army Reserve. I'm a Lieutenant Colonel. It's an honor to wear our nation's uniform. I'm surrounded by people who believe in a cause greater than themselves. There are individuals who come to Congress because they love our Constitution our freedoms and liberties. There are people who serve in our Armed Forces willing to give their lives to defend it.

And because Nancy Pelosi wants to be the Speaker of the House she likes the feeling of that gavel in her hand. She likes to be in control. Even though she's been there as long as she has been there she is still there. She's still holding on to her power and she's gone out of her way to say she is not rebuking Ilhan Omar for equivocations trying to draw equivalencies between the United States Israel and Hamas and the Taliban.

I mean Ilhan Omar shouldn't have been appointed to the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the first place. I was the first person to speak out against it when she got to Congress. I was on your show right here three years ago almost to the day. We had then House member Ron DeSantis how much things have changed since June of 2018 and we were talking about foreign policy.

Ilhan Omar gets elected to the House. Rashida Tlaib gets elected to the House. Pelosi become Speaker again. And when you have someone who is willing to blame U.S. foreign policy for the Al-Shabaab attack in Kenya blame U.S. foreign policy for the suffering of the Venezuelan people instead of blaming Maduro and all of the anti-Israel anti-Semitic hate requesting leniency for ISIS fighters saying that on 9/11 some people did something.

And most recently the equivalency I just drew you shouldn't be serving on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and it says a lot about Nancy Pelosi and her people that they have no problem with this and Eric Swalwell gets to serve on the House Intelligence Committee despite the background on him.

Where is the accountability? It's about double standards. It's about moral equivalencies and slippery slopes. And if there's something that needs to be confronted with anti-Semitism they won't singularly emphatically unequivocally and forcefully go after anti-Semitism. Instead they have to draw up all hate matters resolutions and draw equivalencies to other religions and backgrounds and hate.

But meanwhile when it's those other forms of hate they'll go after it singularly.

Meanwhile people like they'll say you know Steve King can't serve on any House Committees they'll say that Marjorie Taylor Greene can't serve on any House Committees; if you want to go there if that's where your standard is how the heck does Ilhan Omar get appointed and stay on the House Foreign Affairs Committee? I'm on two committees in the House -- Financial Services and Foreign Affairs. I'm with Maxine Waters and Al Green and Rashida Tlaib and AOC and others on Financial Services and I'm with Omar on Foreign Affairs.

And I just -- I'm saddened about this moment we're in right now. But I'm also encouraged that as long as all of your viewers are doubling down and tripling down for their passion their principles and beliefs to do something about it we can correct this November 8 2022. We have to for the sake of our great country.

LEVIN: Very well said and it's amazing that Joe Biden has decided he wants to be the Civil Rights President and the greatest Civil Rights issue of our time has nothing to do with what he is talking about critical race theory. That is a racist anti-American Marxist theory.

No right in front of his face he sees what has been taking place in this country. He wants it to be the Klan and the neo Nazis. And as I've said a thousand times before crush them. Who is stopping you? Go get them. Get them. Crush them.

But what is happening in our streets? Joe Biden is either silent or passively supportive. And he is the President of the United States. He's in charge of his party and it is a damn shame. What a disgrace.

CONGRESSMAN Lee Zeldin I wish you all the luck in your gubernatorial race and God bless you.

ZELDIN: Thank you Mark.

LEVIN: We'll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

LEVIN: Welcome back America. As you know by now we've done this program for several years. It's a unique format. It's a long form interview format which is what I've always wanted to do. And the reason is for the reason you saw tonight and you see every Sunday night that I do this show.

We have an opportunity to dig deeply into issues with very important guests not a conga line of guests not a conga line of issues. To me this is very very important. And what's important most to me right now is saving our country.

At every program going forward like every program in the past it is going to be focused on that.

My new book ""American Marxism"" already has 150000 pre-orders. That is unheard of in the publishing industry. It's unheard of with any quote- unquote ""conservative author.""

So I want to thank those of you who are doing it encourage others of you to do exactly the same. It's called ""American Marxism"" for a reason.

What you've heard discussed tonight the fusion of Marxism and this jihadi movement that's growing in the United States is only a little piece of what's going on. These various movements that have been spawned from Marxism.

No I'm not a conspiracy theorist. That's the whole point of the book. The book is to tell you who is behind this what are their names? What are the institutions here in the United States? We need to know who our enemies are in order to have a fighting chance to push back and reclaim this magnificent country.

The first chapter in the book is called ""A Tear"" because some people just don't believe it. ""The counterrevolution to the American Revolution is in full force. They can no longer be dismissed or ignored for it is devouring our society and culture swirling around our everyday lives and ubiquitous in our politics schools media and entertainment.""

""Once a mostly unrelatable fringe and subterranean movement it is here it is everywhere. You your children and your grandchildren are now immersed in it and it threatens to destroy the greatest nation ever established along with your freedom family and security.""

""Of course the primary difference between the counterrevolution and the American Revolution is that the form of seeks to destroy the American society and oppose autocratic rule and the latter sought to protect American society and institute representative government.""

This is a daunting task but it's a task of this generation you and me must undertake and I have every faith in you and I hope you have every faith in me.

See you next time on LIFE LIBERTY & LEVIN.

(Who’s paying for this?) Russian Space Forces Rocket Soyuz 2.1b Launch Location Plesetsk Cosmodrome Russia Payload mass ~6500 kg (14330 Ib) Where is/are the satellite(s) going? ~500 km Sun-Synchronous orbit (SSO) Will they be attempting to recover the first stage? No this is not a capability of Soyuz Where will the first stage land? It will crash on the land of Ust-Tsilemsky District Komi Republic Will they be attempting to recover the fairings? No this is not a capability of Soyuz Are these fairings new? Yes How’s the weather looking? TBD This will be the: – 1st launch of the Pion-NKS military satellite

– 6th launch of a satellite for the Liana surveillance system

– 63rd launch of Soyuz 2.1b

– 58th orbital launch attempt of 2021 Where to watch If available a livestream will be listed here

What does all this mean?

The Russian Federal Space Agency will launch the Pion-NKS No. 1 (14F139) satellite on a Soyuz 2.1b launch vehicle into a Sun-synchronous orbit. The rocket will lift off from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia. This mission will mark the first of two launches of the Pion-NKS satellites for the Liana electronic intelligence (ELINT) constellation.

Pion-NKS No. 1 Mission

Liana Constellation

Liana is a new Russian military surveillance constellation that will consist of two series of satellites: Lotos-S1 and Pion-NKS. Both of them are intended to gather data on foreign military forces located on the ground on water and in the air. However they work a little bit differently Lotos-S1 has a passive radar system whereas Pion-NKS has an active one.

Liana is the successor of the Soviet reconnaissance system Legenda-Tselina that was also used for target designation and guidance of high-precision weapons. One of its components active satellites US-A had such a powerful radar that it had to be equipped with a nuclear reactor. Only this type of source could provide the system with enough energy. This caused an international scandal in January 1978 when during an emergency deorbiting of the satellite radioactive debris crashed and contaminated over a 124000 square kilometer area of the Northwest Territories in Canada. As a result the Liana constellation will not use nuclear energy as a power source.

As of today only Lotos-S satellites have already been deployed into orbit (1 Lotos-S and 4 Lotos-S1 which is a modernized iteration of Lotos-S). The latest launch of Lotos-S1 took place in February 2021.

Pion-NKS No. 1 satellite

Due to the classified nature of this mission very little is known about the characteristics of the Pion-NKS satellite however its purpose is far from a secret. Pion-NKS is a military reconnaissance satellite. Its model was first presented to the public in 2017 at the naval showcase in Saint-Petersburg. The main aim of this satellite is surveillance of foreign military forces.

According to Russian media sources Pion-NKS will be able to detect small objects like cars of potential enemy forces in real-time. By receiving and analyzing radio signals this satellite will help to understand what type of military equipment was detected and provide its coordinates. In contrast the Lotos-S1 series of satellites are specialized in the interception of different information including communications.

What is Soyuz 2.1b?

ROSCOSMOS’s Soyuz is a multi-use medium-lift launch vehicle that was introduced in far 1966 and since then has been the workhorse of the Soviet/Russian space program. It is capable to launch civilian and military satellites as well as cargo and crewed missions to the ISS. Over the decades several variants of the Soyuz rocket have been developed. Soyuz 2.1b is one of its latest iterations that belongs to the Soyuz-2 rocket family.

The rocket consists of three stages all of them are expendable. When launching to the ISS Soyuz-2 can be flown with either a Progress capsule or a Soyuz spacecraft.

Soyuz 2.1b is about 46.3 meters (152 ft) in height and 2.95 meters (9 feet) in diameter. The vehicle’s total lift-off mass is approximately 312000 kg (688000 lb). The rocket’s payload lift capacity to low-Earth orbit (LEO) is between 6600 and 7400 kg depending on the launch site.

320 s vacuum 258 s sea level

321 s vacuum 359 s vacuum

Side Boosters

The first stage of the Soyuz 2.1b rocket is composed of 4 side boosters that are powered by RD-107A engines. Each one of the boosters has a conical shape and a dry weight of 3784 kg. It is approximately 19.6 meters in length with a diameter of 2.7 meters. Each side booster has two vernier thrusters that are used for flight control.

The RD-107A engine runs on rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) and liquid oxygen (LOx). The propellants are stored in the pressurized aluminum alloy tanks the kerosene tank is located in the cylindrical part of the booster and the LOx one is in the conical section. Each one of those engines have 4 combustion chambers and together they are capable of producing a thrust of 840 kN at sea level and 1020 kN in a vacuum.

Perhaps the most spectacular moment of the Soyuz-2 rocket’s launch is the separation of the first stage. It happens approximately 2 minutes after the launch. The boosters perform a pattern known as the “Korolev cross” (named after Sergei Korolev a very important figure of the USSR space program and history).

Second and Third Stages

The center core stage is powered by a single RD-108A engine and the upper stage is fitted with a single RD-0124 engine. Both of these engines run on RP-1 and LOx and have 4 combustion chambers. The second stage is 27.1 meters long with a diameter of 2.95 meters and a dry mass of 6545 kg. It has 4 vernier thrusters for three-axis flight control.

The third stage of a Soyuz-2 rocket has a height of 6.7 meters a diameter of 2.7 meters and a dry mass of 2355 kg. One interesting thing about the RD-0124 engine on this stage is that it starts its ignition sequence prior to stage separation. This process is called “hot fire staging”.

Clay County Sheriff Terry Miller said he believes there were 11 people aboard the Tennessee church bus and that they were all taken to hospitals.

He said two of the church bus passengers were airlifted to hospitals in Memphis while the others were taken to hospitals with either minor injuries or to be evaluated.

Miller did not have information on the number of people in the vehicle that collided with the bus.

He said the crash happened at about 1 p.m. along Highway 67 north of Corning.

“Apparently (the bus) was struck by another vehicle that caused the bus to veer off the road” Miller said.

Corning is near Arkansas’ border with Missouri and about 170 miles (273 kilometers) northeast of Little Rock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGUtbGVhZGVyL25hbWUvbWlsZHJlZC1zb3NvbmthLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTEwNzQ4NzM20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mildred Sosonka Obituary (1934 - 2021) - Bath NY - The Leader,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/the-leader/name/mildred-sosonka-obituary?id=10748736 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGUtbGVhZGVyL25hbWUvbWlsZHJlZC1zb3NvbmthLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTEwNzQ4NzM20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJnYXpldHRlLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2JwczExNTU5NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Richard L.

This is a preview from our weekly newsletter. Each week I go ‘Beyond the News’ and handcraft a special edition that includes my thoughts on the biggest stories why it matters and how it could impact the future.

Tesla has tapped a new type of automotive glass from supplier AGP for the Plaid Model S invoking the thought that everything even the finest details of the vehicle was considered a possible improvement for the company’s rebirth of the all-electric flagship sedan.

Many months ago Teslarati stumbled across a list of Tesla’s suppliers through international connections. These suppliers were shipping massive volumes of whatever product they were giving to Tesla on cargo ships and we noticed that there was a company called AGP that was shipping windshields and other automotive glasses to the company’s Fremont Factory.

It turns out that AGP has been providing Tesla with automotive glass for several years. Back in 2016 AGP provided glass for the Model X’s panoramic roof and windshields. However Tesla utilized AGC Automotive’s windshields for its cars according to Investopedia.

AGP is a Peru-based company that specializes in all types of automotive glass but what they’ve done for Tesla is especially interesting. The company has been in business for 50 years but just like everything else it changes and the automotive industry is no different. As electric vehicles have become more mainstream technologies surrounding the development of these new sustainable automobiles are popping up left and right. AGP’s eGlass for electric and autonomous vehicles is no different.

Now AGP says on its website that it collaborates “closely with the companies that are leading the new wave of the electric and autonomous vehicles of tomorrow.” When I first stumbled across AGP many months ago on the cargo ship list for Tesla there was no indication that there was an official partnership so I looked into it a tad further. I reached out to AGP and received a response that thanked me for my inquiry but refused to confirm or deny whether it was in any sort of professional relationship with Tesla. Ironically AGP gave the answer we needed because responding to me was all I needed to know.

Many may ask “What’s the significance of what glass Tesla is using on its cars?” There are plenty of automotive glass suppliers out there that are worth their weight in gold providing high-quality windshields and windows for vehicles on the road. Of course consumers are going to want something that is relatively high quality because nothing is worse than driving behind a tractor-trailer on the Interstate just to have a chip or small crack on your windshield from something as tiny as a pebble. While strength is undoubtedly a need for all windshields EVs require a slightly different bit of development.

One of the biggest focuses for EVs is their drag coefficient. Why is it so important? Because aerodynamics are crucial to the performance range and effectiveness of electric vehicles. As high-quality long-range batteries are hard to come by in the EV sector manufacturers look for every advantage they can get to achieve robust range ratings. While Tesla is the leader in EV range figures the company is still looking for ways to get all of its vehicles to or near the 400-mile threshold.

Aerodynamics are a great way to do that. And Tesla undoubtedly worked extremely hard to achieve the best-in-class drag coefficient of .208 beating out the Lucid Air’s impressive .21 coefficient.

We knew aerodynamics was going to be a big part of the Plaid Model S when it was spotted at the Nürburgring two years ago. The vehicle was sporting a large spoiler a huge rear diffuser and the new eGlass from AGP is just another addition to Tesla’s attempts to make the Plaid Model S the most aerodynamic vehicle in its lineup.

We finally confirmed that AGP was providing the highly aerodynamic and EV-specific automotive glass to the Model S Plaid thanks to Tesla Raj who took a picture of the manufacturer’s sticker on the window of the all-electric sedan at Tesla’s Delivery Event on June 10th. This all confirmed Teslarati’s discovery of AGP in its supplier list several months ago and also confirmed that the two companies had a partnership despite AGP’s unwillingness to provide a comment (which we understood why!)

It makes me think about what Elon Musk may have needed to work on for the final week of Plaid development. When he had announced that the event was going to be delayed a week due to “tweaks” I wondered whether it was software or hardware. While it was likely a software fix that needed to be addressed it could have been related to the drag coefficient which Tesla proudly displayed at the Plaid Event on the 10th. Nevertheless the vehicle has finally been released to pre-orderers and the fastest production car that has ever run the 1/4-mile drag is here and it’s taking down anything in its path.

A big thanks to our long-time supporters and new subscribers! Thank you.

Unfortunately tastiness doesn't always mean healthy and there are many bakery treats at the warehouse that fit this bill.

The sweet treats on sale at the bakery are seasonal so before we talk about the overall unhealthiest pick let's take a look at some of the items available right now. For more information about what shouldn't be on your next grocery list here are the Costco Foods You Should Always Avoid According to Nutritionists.

Seasonal bakery favorites like the ""grown-up Poptarts"" are back.

Not only is the weather heating up but so is the fresh summer fruit! Berries are juicy and ripe right now meaning the Raspberry Crumble Cookies (aka ""grown-up Poptarts"") at Costco are on display at the bakery. A 12-pack only sets you back $8.99 which comes out to about $0.75 a cookie. While that's a bargain for your wallet it's not a deal for your health.

One cookie has 320 calories 40 grams of carbs 17 grams of fat 21 grams of sugar and 2 grams of protein. In total that amounts to about 5 teaspoons of sugar per cookie—and eating this much of the sweet stuff can lead to serious health issues.

The same goes for the Cinnamon-Pull-Apart rolls.

News broke back in October of 2020 that Cinnamon-Pull-Apart rolls were being discontinued and some Costco members were devastated. However this treat made a comeback earlier this year. Fans have called them ""amazing"" ""bliss"" and ""delicious"" (but also a ""calorie bomb"").

Indeed one roll has 250 calories 35 grams of carbs 10 grams of fat 16 grams of sugar and 4 grams of protein. Luckily 12 come in one tin so they're super easy to share! They're also not the worst item in the Costco bakery section . . .

The oversized muffins aren't great either.

""The problem with oversized muffins is that having larger-sized packages and actual items increases how much you actually eat"" registered dietitian and owner of the food blog The Oregon Dietitian Megan Byrd told Eat This Not That! last year.

One blueberry muffin alone has 580 calories 68 grams of carbs 30 grams of fat and 34 grams of sugar. That's like eating five Oreos. Imagine that being your breakfast! If it is then you'll likely experience these side effects throughout the day.

The #1 worst Costco bakery item is . . .

6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

. . . the cheesecake! One slice has 420 calories 34 grams of carbs 29 grams of fat 18 grams of saturated fat 27 grams of sugar 330 milligrams of sodium 115 milligrams of cholesterol 6 grams of protein and 1 gram of fiber.

As Lauren Manaker MS RDN LD CLEC founder of Nutrition Now Counseling author of Fueling Male Fertility and member of the Eat This Not That! Medical Expert Board explains:

Of course most baked goods are chock-full of fat and sugar but the plain cheesecake contains way too many of both to be considered a good-for-you choice. While eating certain fats is an important part of an overall healthy diet experts recommend limiting saturated fat intake as eating too many of these fats is linked to an increased risk of outcomes like heart disease and stroke. The American Heart Association recommends that for a 2000 calorie diet people should not exceed around 13 grams of saturated fat per day in their diet. And one slice of this cheesecake contains 18 grams of this fat—5 grams more than what the max is! And when it comes to added sugars the new Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggest that no more than 10% of people's calories should come from these sugars. So for a 2000 calorie diet that would mean no more than around 50 grams of added sugars should be eaten every day.

Manaker says the cheesecake is her favorite. If it's also your favorite try slicing a serving in half for a more sensible treat.

Please check the time stamp on the story to see when it was updated last.

Chocolate sugar flour eggs butter—all the good bad things. These delicious ingredients are staples in many desserts including chocolate chip cookies. We hate to be the bearers of bad news but there is one delicious dessert you really shop stop buying the next time you go to Costco: chocolate chip cookies.

We know we know – but hear us (and an expert!) out.

With each 210-calorie you’re also having 11g of fat 27g of carbs 3g of protein and only 1g of fiber. Sure you could burn it off with a 20-minute jog or a 30-minute bike ride. But health experts say that cookie really isn’t worth the game.

Health & Wellness Expert Erin Stone explains “ These cookies may taste good but they are extremely harmful to your health.” We all know sugar isn’t good but Stone warns of the serious health concerns to be mindful of. “Diabetes can develop as a result of the excessive sugar level according to experts. Not only that but the calories in these cookies are incredibly high and these fats can contribute to obesity and weight gain. Although these cookies are enormous and visually pleasing they are highly hazardous to one's health.” Beyond that portion control is a major consideration. Stone added “The chocolate chip cookie from Costco is big enough to feed three people at once. As a result eating the entire cookie will be detrimental to your health in the long run.”

Yes they’re delicious but no you shouldn’t buy them. While a chunky chocolate chip cookie may provide some emotional comfort there may be scientific explanations for why it’s almost impossible to each just one cookie.

Some research suggests that ingredients in chocolate chip cookies may have additive properties with cravings comparable to drugs like cocaine. This is why it’s hard to really have limit your consumption (or portion control). It’s also why it might be the best idea to avoid them altogether.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvY29zdGNvLWV4cGFuZGFibGUtZG9nLWNhcnJpZXItcGVyZmVjdC0yMDEyNTI5MTQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco Has an Expandable Dog Carrier That's Perfect for All Your Summer Travels,"Finding a pet carrier that your furry friend feels comfortable staying in is never easy.

While Costco's food court may have some healthier fare available (check out our list of The Best & Worst Menu Items at Costco's Food Court) there's one item on the store's menu that dietitians say you should never order no matter how tempting it may be.

""Avoid the churros"" recommends Diana Gariglio-Clelland staff RD at NextLuxury.com. ""While they may seem like a steal cost-wise these churros are just fried bread with a ton of added sugar.""

Per serving these treats pack 570 calories—approximately 29% of your daily total if you're eating a 2000-calorie diet—and 20 grams of fat including 8 grams of saturated fat over half the 13-gram upper limit of saturated fat most adults should consume in a day.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

A serving of Costco churros also contains 550 milligrams of sodium and 88 grams of carbohydrate. Contributing to those carbs are the churros' 25 grams of sugar per serving—the exact 25 grams of added sugar the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends adult women consume in an entire day and close to the 36-gram upper limit recommended for adult men.

The Best and Worst Costco Foods for 2021

In addition to the churros' less-than-stellar fat sugar and sodium content ""refined carbs such as white bread and sugar don't bring anything to the table nutrition-wise"" adds Gariglio-Clelland.

However if you do find yourself jonesing for dessert after your Costco trip there are better choices to be had.

While it's not exactly healthy food ""if you want a dessert soft-serve frozen yogurt would even be a better choice because at least it provides some calcium and protein"" says Gariglio-Clelland.

King James II (AD 1430 – 1460) of the line of Stewarts was the son of King James I and Joan Beaufort but succeeded his father at the age of six after James I was assassinated in AD 1437 in a sewer tunnel whilst trying to flee from Sir Robert Graham of Kinpont and a group of conspirators.

Regency over the boy king was given to Archibald Douglas 5th Earl of Douglas who headed the Scottish government as lieutenant-general of the realm during the minority of James until AD 1439.

After Archibald’s death power was shared amongst William Crichton 1st Lord Crichton and Lord Chancellor of Scotland Sir Alexander Livingston of Callendar and James Douglas Earl of Avondale.

The Douglas clan were the most prominent family in lowland Scotland during the Late Middle Ages and were considered a threat to rival families and even the throne through their influence over the crown.

In AD 1440 Crichton Livingston and James Douglas conspired to break the power of the late Archibald Douglas’s family and invited the 16-year-old William Douglas 6th Earl of Douglas and his younger brother to dine with the boy king at Edinburgh Castle.

According to legend whilst they ate a black bulls head was placed before William and his entourage which symbolised death. The two brothers were then dragged out to Castle Hill and given a mock trial with trumped-up charges claiming they had protested against the king and were named as traitors to the crown and beheaded. In another account the king pleaded for their lives but the pleas were ignored and they were beheaded in the castle yard.

Despite the murders the Douglas family emerged to dominate the Scottish court and filled posts of government with their family and supporters. When James II finally came of age to rule over Scotland he found that the Douglas clan had a monopoly over his court and spent much of his adult life feuding with the clan.

James would repeat events of the past by inviting William Douglas 8th Earl of Douglas to Stirling Castle in AD 1452 under the promise of safe conduct. The King then accused the Earl of conspiring to rival royal authority by forging links with John Macdonald and Alexander Lindsay and drew his dagger stabbing William Douglas 26 times.

After an intermittent civil war between the crown and the Douglas clan the Parliament of Scotland declared the Douglas lands forfeit and permanently annexed them to the crown along with many other lands finances and castles.

The Black Dinner (and the Massacre of Glencoe in AD 1692) would later serve as the inspiration for “The Red Wedding” in George R. R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire and the adapted TV series The Game of Thrones.

They are accused of conspiring with a senior royal — Prince Hamzah a half-brother of the king — to foment unrest against the monarch while soliciting foreign help.

The palace drama erupted into the open in early April when Hamzah was placed under house arrest. It has since broken taboos in Jordan and sent jitters through foreign capitals with Western powers rallying behind Abdullah an indispensable ally in an unstable region.

The case exposed rivalries in Jordan’s traditionally discreet Hashemite dynasty and spawned unprecedented public criticism of the monarch. The defendants are the most senior establishment figures to appear before the security court which typically goes after drug offenders or suspected militants.

“As far as I know there has not been a case this big in the history of Jordan” said defense lawyer Ala Khasawneh. The state news agency Petra said the trial starts Monday.

The 41-year-old Hamzah is the central figure though he is not facing charges. In clashing narratives he is either a champion of ordinary Jordanians suffering from economic mismanagement and corruption or a disgruntled royal who never forgave Abdullah for taking away his title of crown prince in 2004 in favor of the king’s oldest son.

The indictment leaked to state-linked media alleges Hamzah “was determined to achieve his personal ambition” of becoming king. It says the prince and the defendants — Sharif Hassan bin Zaid a royal and Bassem Awadallah a former royal adviser — conspired to stir discontent.

Security agencies began monitoring them in mid-March at a time of public uproar over an oxygen outage at a hospital in the town of Salt that killed eight coronavirus patients.

Hamzah met with bereaved families just after the king visited Salt. The indictment alleged that the prince “took advantage” of the families’ pain to spread a populist message.

Hamzah’s popularity stems from ties he has nurtured with Jordan’s tribes the bedrock of Hashemite rule. Atef Majali a tribal leader in the town of Karak said he and other sheikhs have met with the prince more than a dozen times over the years but denied the king was criticized at these events.

The indictment alleged that Hamzah and the two defendants were working on social media messages the prince was to post with the aim of “inciting some groups in society against the ruling system and state agencies.”

Hamzah has denied sedition claims saying he is being punished for calling out corruption and mismanagement.

On April 3 the day he was placed under house arrest more than a dozen tribal and public figures were arrested including his chief aide. Only Awadallah and bin Zaid remain in detention.

The prince is not in legal trouble with the king saying the matter is being dealt with by the family and that his half-brother remains under his care. The royal court has declined comment when asked if Hamzah can leave his Amman palace or communicate with others. Atef Majali said Hamzah’s staff was not allowed back to work.

Khasawneh who represents bin Zaid a distant cousin of the king said his client is “in shock” and plans to plead not guilty. In addition to sedition and incitement Bin Zaid is also charged with narcotics possession after two pieces of hashish were allegedly found in his home.

The lawyer said he plans to call Hamzah to the stand — potentially amplifying the sensationalist nature of the trial. It’s not clear if the palace eager to tamp down the crisis would allow the prince to make his case on such a public stage.

Khasawneh said his client plans to fight the charges and brushed aside questions about a possible plea deal. During security court trials defendants stand in a courtroom cage. Awadallah and bin Zaid are expected to be confined to the cage as well wearing the blue uniforms of detainees said former state security court president Mohammad al-Afeef who represents Awadallah. The defendants who are held at an intelligence compound in Amman face up to 20 years in prison.

In the days leading up to the trial a broader narrative has surfaced though it is only alluded to in the indictment.

In this version the alleged conspirators sought foreign help to exploit the king’s perceived vulnerability at a time when he was under pressure from the U.S. and Saudi Arabia to accept a now-defunct Trump administration Mideast plan often referred to as the Deal of the Century. Jordan has expressed concern that the plan would weaken the monarch’s historic role as guardian of major Muslim and Christian sites in contested Jerusalem and a pillar of Hashemite claims to legitimacy.

Allegations about foreign outreach focus on Awadallah who holds Jordanian U.S. and Saudi citizenship once served as the king’s official envoy to Saudi Arabia and has close ties to Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.

In Jordan Awadallah has been widely blamed for economic policies seen as mainly benefiting the rich and has been dogged by corruption suspicions. In Riyadh he had been visibly involved in efforts to draw foreign investments.

The indictment alleges that Hamzah and bin Zaid invited Awadallah to join them because of his foreign ties. At one point Hamzah allegedly asked Awadallah: “If something happened to me in Jordan will the Saudi officials help me or not?”

Saudi Arabia a major financial backer of Jordan immediately sent its foreign minister to the kingdom after the crisis erupted publicly reaffirming support for the king.

Mohammed Momani a member of Jordan’s senate and a former information minister maintained that there was a link between the alleged sedition plot and regional politics.

“When you see that Jordan is under pressure from its major allies because of the Deal of the Century then you probably saw this as an opening or as a possibility or an opportunity to solicit some support from the outside world” alleged Momani who said he was briefed on the investigation.

Momani alleged that bin Zaid had approached a foreign embassy “trying to ask them for their reaction” if the alleged conspirators put their plan into motion. He did not identify the embassy.

Jordanian officials have said the alleged plot was uncovered in time but posed a threat to stability.

Critics said claims of a threat seem overblown noting that any plot would have required the backing of the security forces.

“I cannot find any evidence that would lead to this kind of trial” political analyst Amer Sabaileh said. He and Momani are among 92 members of a political reform committee formed by the king to deal with the crisis.

Sabaileh said the saga may have caused lasting damage.

“It has opened the Hashemites’ door for ordinary people to look inside and I think this is not good regardless of how it happened” he said. “It’s better for this family to be united and not to show that there is this kind of competition or sense of revenge.”

It all started in a gym and the rest as they say was history for Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Prince Daniel.

The pair met after a training session at the then-Daniel Westling's fitness centre in the mid-2000s. After a long romance the pair announced their highly-anticipated engagement in February 2009.

A year later on 19 June 2010 Daniel and Victoria said ""I do"" in Stockholm Sweden in front of family friends and millions of royal spectators.

Last year the Swedish royal couple marked their tenth anniversary by releasing a series of portraits captured by photographer Elisabeth Toll at the picturesque Gustav III's pavilion close to Victoria and Daniel's home at Haga Palace.

The parents to Princess Estelle and Prince Oscar continue to be #relationshipgoals. Here is a look at Victoria and Daniel's sweetest moments as they celebrate their 11th wedding anniversary.

In this report Legit.ng will be looking at five times the monarch wore different stylish crowns.

1. Castle-like crown

In an Instagram post on Tuesday June 15 Obada Abdul-Rasheed posted a very beautiful photo where he was apparelled in blue majestic agbada.

To complement the outfit the monarch wore a crown with an elaborate top. The pattern on the crown looks like the overground of a castle.

2. Red crown beaded with precious stones

This crown is arguably the most beautiful among the king's collection. The red crown is beaded with precious stones that look like diamonds.

3. Golden crown

The golden crown does not have the flamboyant look of others. Its simple look speaks more of royalty than fashion.

4. Blue with a touch of stones

This crown has the same structure as the aforementioned one. What differentiates them are the stones this has and its blue colour.

5. Golden with visible stones

The golden beaded crown bears a semblance to the UK royal imperial crown. Unlike others from the king's collection with small stones the beads on this one are bigger.

Meanwhile Legit.ng earlier reported that the Oluwo of Iwoland denied claims that he was suspended on Friday February 21 by the Osun traditional rulers' council because of his assault on the Agbowu of Ogbaagba Dhikrulahi Akinropo.

In fact on his official Instagram page the Oluwo said that he was suspended on ""the guise of his conduct (been too flashy stylish human rights defender and swagging).""

Oba Akanbi said that he was only suspended by the council from attending meetings and taking part in some activities in Iwo.

""I had another friend killed right there"" he added pointing to the grass a few dozen feet away. He said that death was ""two or three years ago.""

Another homeless man died after being stabbed in the neck at the end of March just a block away from the park in front of the Haven of Rest Ministries on East Market Street.

On Thursday about a dozen members of the group Serve the People Akron served dinner to Robinson and several dozen other homeless people some of whom had come over from the nearby Haven which is not affiliated with the group.

The volunteers have prepared meals since last August at least two days a week on Thursday and Sunday afternoons and also on Saturday mornings for breakfast. Whether they will be able to continue is in question as the city has announced it will return to its pre-pandemic policy of clearing homeless encampments on public property.

It's uncertain how many people will remain because some have been provided emergency vouchers for housing while others say they are just going to find a less high-profile location to camp out. Some who accepted vouchers have left tents trash and other belongings behind between the park's boundary fence and the railroad tracks.

Notices to remove belongings were posted at the park and surrounding area last week when the city announced that in coordination with CSX Railroad it will clear any property remaining in the park and on adjacent railroad land starting Monday.

City sets 'housing first' policy

During the pandemic the city chose a hands-off approach to the city's homeless as shelter space was scarce due to population restrictions on group settings and many homeless were fearful of being grouped up in such settings.

The city said that for 14 months its policy of not dispersing encampments was per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to prevent community spread of the coronavirus within the city's homeless population and beyond.

But following the state's June 2 lifting of COVID-related health orders and restrictions Akron lifted the moratorium and has chosen to adopt a ""housing first"" approach to the homeless population.

Homeless camps around Grace Park will be the first to be cleaned up starting Monday said Eufrancia Lash Akron's deputy director of public service and neighborhood assistance. After that the city will focus on other areas where people camp.

""We understand it's a wide issue we're kind of banging it off in bite-sized chunks"" he said. ""We're not discounting the other encampments; we understand that there are many other encampments.

""As time and additional funds allow we will expand our efforts but we have not expanded our efforts as of yet. We are taking it very slowly because we want to make sure we are able to document these residents and give them the appropriate transitional housing.""

Lash said that over the past year the city has been working with agencies that provide resources to homeless individuals such as mental health or recovery care transitional housing and the COVID-19 vaccine.

He said providers have routinely visited known camps to offer support services and to help get them into temporary and permanent housing if they were willing. At least 75 have been vaccinated.

During the winter's coldest days the city opened warming centers and members of the Summit County Continuum of Care in connection with Community Support Services Inc. (CSS) opened an emergency shelter to house people overnight who were unable or unwilling to go to the area’s shelters.

The funding for that shelter was provided through an emergency shelter grant secured by the city of Akron through the federal CARES (Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security) Act.

With an estimated 500-plus homeless people in the county the majority of them in Akron Lash said the city allocates almost $2 million annually for affordable housing homelessness prevention and emergency shelters.

He said there had been around 30 or 40 people living in the area around Grace Park and added many of them had accepted housing vouchers from CSS outreach specialists.

He did not have an exact figure and CSS did not respond to messages seeking details.

Of the people who remained at Grace Park Lash said ""they've gone back and forth between being houseless transitioning over to the Haven of Rest and going back and forth between the various encampments in the area.""

He said the city's ""housing first"" approach follows National Alliance to End Homelessness research that shows providing shelter to homeless people helps individuals exit homelessness and improves their sense of autonomy and empowerment.

""It is the city’s position that the housing first approach is best to help those experiencing homelessness break that cycle and get into safer and more stable living situations"" he said.

Seeking a place to stay

Volunteers with Serve the People said they are skeptical of the city's approach.

""We don't really know how expansive it is or how many people are actually getting housing and additionally we don't know if this is actually a long-term thing — or a bill just paid for a couple weeks and the folks will be back on the streets"" said Nick Cacioppo a member of the group.

He said not everyone has been offered a voucher.

""They are regularly denied by CSS because they say that you know they're not struggling with an addiction and they're not unstable so they can find shelter at the Haven of Rest.""

Several of the homeless residents who remained at Grace Park last week said they would like to have a place to live but are facing obstacles.

They could find shelter at the Haven of Rest but the facility's rules including a curfew and other policies make it difficult for some to stay.

Robinson 48 said he does not want to stay at the Haven and has a safe place away from the Grace Park area. He said it's secluded and near the police station downtown. However if offered a voucher for emergency housing Robinson said he would take it.

""Sure I'll stay in a hotel"" he said.

A 58-year-old man named Mike who also camps out around Grace Park asked that only his first name be used. He said a CSS caseworker knows who he is but hasn't offered him a voucher. He also said the agency is trying to get him housing through the Akron Metropolitan Housing Authority. He said he was not allowed at the Haven of Rest because he did not return before the doors closed.

John Amaty a man in his late 50s whose tent was still standing Thursday said he was kicked out of the Haven but did not explain why. He plans to find a more secluded place to set up camp.

Gary P. Haidet in the park visiting his friend Amaty said CSS helped him get a room in a shared apartment where he's been living for the past three months. He said there are several others living in the building with him and they get along well.

Some said they are desperate for a place to stay including Keith Reed who returned to his hometown about six months ago after living in Nevada.

Reed said he had been staying at the Haven of Rest for a month until he went to the hospital emergency room and did not return with the proper paperwork the week before. Reed said he was turned away the next day because he had been drinking beer and then again the next day after ""talking to someone for five minutes"" outside the facility.

""I'm 57 years old and I cried"" he said but added ""God said he will fight for me if I remain calm.""

Reed was staying in a tent he said someone bought for him.

Outside the Haven of Rest a couple dozen men were gathered around 6 p.m.

One of them sitting across the street in a parking lot wore a Vietnam Veteran baseball cap and smoked a cigar.

He identified himself as ""Eisenhower"" and said the men were outside waiting for help. He had good things to say about the ministry.

""They're angels in there. They help people"" he said.

June 19 2021

Story By Mike McGlothlin

When the decision makers behind the Outlaw Diesel Super Series decided to introduce the 5.90 Index class they did their organization a huge favor. The category has grown in leaps and bounds since its debut just a few short years ago and the competition is second-to-none. It might be index racing but it’s very close and extremely fast. And unlike many other diesel racing classes it isn’t primarily dominated by Cummins power plants. Within the ranks of 5.90 there are a host of Duramax-powered GM’s and even Power Stroke-propelled Fords. It’s a class without weight restrictions turbo limits or any one-size-fits-all approach—and with 19 racers following the ODSS race schedule in 2021 it’s downright entertaining to watch.

Below you’ll get a glimpse of what you’re in for when you take in a 5.90 race: two top-tier GM’s—both of which already have a win under their belt so far this season—and a consistent third-gen Cummins that’s currently Second Place in points. Each build is different but on race day their goals are the same: running the number.

Buddy Callaway’s Battle-Hardened GMC

Like something out of a Mad Max film Buddy Callaway’s ’03 GMC Sierra 2500 shortbed looks beat up and thrown together—but it’s one of the most consistent trucks in the class. The 4500-pound GMC is nothing like some of the full tube chassis builds in 5.90 but the setup works extremely well. Buddy regularly cuts 1.31 to 1.33-second 60-foots thanks in part to a four-link rear suspension with coil over shocks and a Twisted Diesel 4L80E transmission he tunes himself using a Powertrain Control Solutions TCM-2800. And in addition to its lack of an Allison the front IFS is gone too. Instead a King Pin Dana 60 with leaf springs is present while a 14-bolt AAM 10.5-inch rear axle resides out back.

The Duramax That Defies All Logic

Unbelievably Buddy campaigns a bone-stock 300000-mile LB7 Duramax. And being that his truck has been as quick as 5.73 in the past he lays claim to the fastest stock engine LB7 Duramax in the world. No hard-part changes have been made. Even the factory head bolts are still intact! But that doesn’t stop Buddy from making the Duramax turn 4500 rpm or belt out 1200 hp. The common-rail V-8’s fuel system has been upgraded in the form of a 12mm stroker CP3 and 200-percent over injectors with Danville Performance fine-tuning the ECM.

Stock Turbo 1200 HP!

Along with the engine the factory 60mm IHI turbocharger is still aboard Buddy’s LB7. This is a turbo that’s not exactly known for being indestructible and if you ask Buddy he’ll tell you he has no idea how it’s still alive. In conjunction with the engine the OEM turbo has 300000 miles on it and has survived more than 200 passes in the 5’s. Near the firewall you can catch a glimpse of the four-stage nitrous system that’s employed to send the GMC into orbit. While his combination may seem a bit ragged-edge (300000-mile engine stock turbo etc.) Buddy’s Sierra is ultra-consistent and has brought him several big wins including the W at Rudy’s Spring Truck Jam back in April.

Chad Keeter’s Consistent Cummins

Consistency does it and Chad Keeter is well on his way to a solid run at the points chase in 2021. Chad and his third-gen Dodge finished runner-up (to Buddy Callaway) at Rudy’s Spring Truck Jam back in April going 5.91 at 122 mph right off the trailer no less! At the Outlaw Diesel Revenge event in May he went out in the second round of eliminations due to a double breakout but still secured enough points to remain tied for Second Place as we went to press. Also while in Indy (and just to show you how close the racing is in 5.90 Index) Chad qualified 12th with his 5.957-second pass (which was right behind a 5.956 a 5.950 and another 5.950). His ’06 Ram rides on 16x10-inch Raceline wheels and 30x14 M&H cheater slicks.

Single Turbo Highly-Fueled 5.9L Cummins

Chad Keeter’s strong parts combination begins with a 5.9L Cummins that was built at Miller’s Machine Shop. The fuel system components were supplied by Exergy Performance and consist of 250-percent over injectors as well as a stroker CP3 over a Sportsman pump. An 85mm S400 from Forced Inductions handles boost production an automatic built by Chris Gelbaugh at CG Diesel Performance Transmissions handles the shifts and Hardway tuning ties everything together.

Dustin Sterling’s Big Boost Duramax

Dustin Sterling missed the first race of the 2021 ODSS race year but thanks to the performance he turned in at Outlaw Diesel Revenge in Indy it didn’t much matter. Despite working with a truck that was a bit too fast that weekend (his trap speeds were over 120 mph) Dustin decided to leave well enough alone and let it ride. In hindsight we’re sure he’s glad he did as his ’07 Duramax proceeded to edge out everyone he came up against in eliminations. In the final Dustin grabbed the quicker reaction time over seasoned racer Rick Fletes and pulled out the win despite running the slower elapsed time (a 5.95 to Fletes’ 5.92).

SoCal Engine TSD Compounds

Under the removable front clip on Dustin’s classic body Chevy you’ll find a SoCal Diesel-built Duramax. Its fueling needs are met thanks to injectors and a pair of CP3’s from S&S Diesel Motorsport. The flawlessly fabricated compound turbo arrangement was executed by Truck Source Diesel and combines a big Garrett atmosphere charger with an S400 in the valley. Sun Coast supports Dustin on the transmission side of his race truck’s equation. Dustin has been quoted as saying he won’t be able to make every race on the circuit this year. But if he finds a way to make it happen the chances of seeing a Duramax bring home the 5.90 championship will definitely increase.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9ib29rcy8yMDIxL2p1bi8xOS9pc2FiZWwtd2FpZG5lci1kaWZmZXJlbnQtZG9lc250LW5lZWQtdG8tYmUtc2NhcnktaXQtY2FuLWJlLWZ1btIBbGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9ib29rcy8yMDIxL2p1bi8xOS9pc2FiZWwtd2FpZG5lci1kaWZmZXJlbnQtZG9lc250LW5lZWQtdG8tYmUtc2NhcnktaXQtY2FuLWJlLWZ1bg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Isabel Waidner: ‘Different doesn’t need to be scary. It can be fun’,"Isabel Waidner 47 is the author of three novels including We Are Made of Diamond Stuff which was shortlisted for the Goldsmiths prize and the Republic of Consciousness prize. In their new novel Sterling Karat Gold a non-binary migrant cleaner is arrested after being attacked by bullfighters on a London street; the story also involves UFOs the history of Iraq and the death of the footballer Justin Fashanu. Waidner who hosts the ICA’s online literary chatshow This Isn’t a Dream spoke to me over Zoom from their home in London where they teach at the University of Roehampton.



In your first novel Gaudy Bauble someone called Belá writes “awkwardgarde fiction”. Is that how you would describe your work?

That was my starting point it’s true. I was always thinking about how to produce formally innovative writing to address some of the questions I had about fiction itself and that’s where this term “awkwardgarde” came from but I probably wouldn’t use it now. Gaudy Bauble was more rooted in traditional avant-garde strategies like punning giving agency to the materiality of language. I always wanted to do something different with experimental fiction something contemporary and queer/trans but I also wanted to combine that with an engaging narrative. What I’ve created now is less “awkward”!



Sterling the protagonist of your new novel works as a cleaner while co-producing a crowdfunded performance art project…

That reflects my life until a few years ago. Many people who come to London as migrants especially queer and trans migrants work these jobs while trying to do something more ambitious and at the same time juggling the oppressive structures impacting on our lives. I worked minimum-wage jobs until my mid-30s when Roehampton gave me a scholarship to do a PhD. I’m staging a complexity we don’t always see in novels: working-class characters often do one thing – work – and then maybe they’re a little bit criminal and that’s it.



When Sterling is unjustly put on trial after being assaulted the judge offers to drop the case if he can appear on Sterling’s show…

That was partly for comic effect but it’s true that power structures and institutions that have long participated in the oppression of trans and black people suddenly want a little piece of the pie – if anything is marketable they’re in there like a shot. That part of the novel ended up a bit of a revenge fantasy because it gave the queer main characters the chance to determine the narrative and they take advantage of it. I guess I was saying don’t think we’re so harmless; maybe people in power feel it’s fine now to capitalise on marginalised writers but giving us actual power could result in real change.



Why do you play with real-life figures in your work?

I ask myself that sometimes! Using Franz Beckenbauer as a character let me bring in some of the history of racism and homophobia via the context of football. But there’s autobiographical stuff going on too; I merged figures from my life with the real Beckenbauer. My dad played football so I wanted to use a 70s footballer roughly his age and my “Franz Beckenbauer” is gay and has died of Aids which is what happened to my uncle. One of the things I like to do in my fiction is to produce tension and energy from working across different registers without smoothing over the differences between them.



How easy was it for you to get published?

The art world embraced my work more readily to begin with. I published Gaudy Bauble through Dostoyevsky Wannabe two working-class people operating a print-on-demand press [in Manchester] with zero capital. We submitted it to the Republic of Consciousness prize and then We Are Made of Diamond Stuff was eligible for the Goldsmiths prize because I was British by then. Getting shortlisted meant that without any traditional infrastructure we started to reach a quite wide readership. But people shouldn’t be surprised if my work looks so different; instead people should ask why are other books so similar? Because it’s really simple: when different writers publish work you get different forms of literature. What am I trying to say with my work is that “different” doesn’t need to be scary or boring or hard; it can be fun.



You were born and grew up in Germany; do you see yourself as a German writer?

It’s probably not a coincidence that I’m doing this kind of unusual writing because I had a German education and that shaped me fundamentally: my parents don’t read books but I was introduced to ambitious literature as a kid at a state school and that’s one of the differences of the German education system compared with the UK. But the truth is I feel really alienated from Germany. I come from the Black Forest a tiny conservative part of south Germany and I came to London at 20 not knowing anyone to start a life where I could come out as a queer person. There are lots of us; queer migration used to be a thing but I don’t know how much it’s happening since Brexit.



What have you been reading lately?

America has longer traditions of innovative queer/trans writing and a new press called Cipher Press is publishing interesting stuff like Large Animals by Jess Arndt. This is the kind of writing I’m excited about and it’s coming through in the UK now – Shola von Reinhold [author of Lote winner of this year’s Republic of Consciousness prize] is obviously part of that.



Which authors inspired you to write?

Kafka: as a teenager I read everything. Later I discovered the American queer tradition of “new narrative” writing people like Dodie Bellamy Robert Glück and Kevin Killian whose poetry sequence Action Kylie is about Kylie Minogue. This is the stuff that has most influenced me but it has never really crossed over into the UK; because they’re queer and working class they’re not getting the credit they deserve.

Joanne and John moved their family to the Lake District in 1986 and settled at The Brown Horse at Winster where they soon became popular figures making it the place to go for a fantastic welcoming atmosphere and awesome chip butties. Whilst in the South Lakes Joanne made many long-lasting friendships and enjoyed an active fun-filled social life organising events like mini festivals and fashion shows at the West County Hotel.

A natural born entertainer Joanne was always at her happiest if people around her were having a good time and she could help create lots of happy memories. A walking definition of a ‘people person’ she was always smiling and full of fun. Even if you only met her once Joanne - with her Dublin charm and a cheeky glint in her eye - welcomed you like an old friend and left a lasting impression.

Joanne was immensely proud of both her children - Joanne a successful financial adviser in Kendal and Paul who continues to keep TJ’s bar alive in his parents’ memory in Tenerife. Her only grandchild Charlotte is also showing the potential of following in her Nana’s footsteps - loving to sing or dance for Nana and entertain everyone.

Joanne’s beloved John died in Tenerife in 2006 and in 2018 she moved back to Kendal to be close to daughter Joanne who supported her through her health challenges. She died peacefully at her Kendal home on June 7.

Less than 24 hours after her death the family had already received many hundreds of tributes to a ‘beautiful soul’ and ‘a little lady with a massive personality and heart'.

It was Joanne’s wish to return to Los Gigantes where her ashes will be scattered to join John and sail the seven seas forever more.

The service and cremation will be a colourful celebration of Joanne’s life and will take place at 3.30pm on Wednesday June 23 at Beetham Hall. It is requested that people do not wear black. Donations to St Mary’s Hospice at Home would be gratefully received.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tcGFuaWVzL21jZ3JhdGgtc3RyaWtlcy1kZWFsLXdpdGgtbmV3Z3JvdW5kLWNhcGl0YWwtMjAyMTA2MTctcDU4MXR0Lmh0bWzSAWpodHRwczovL2FtcC5zbWguY29tLmF1L2J1c2luZXNzL2NvbXBhbmllcy9tY2dyYXRoLXN0cmlrZXMtZGVhbC13aXRoLW5ld2dyb3VuZC1jYXBpdGFsLTIwMjEwNjE3LXA1ODF0dC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McGrath strikes deal with Newground Capital,"Listed real estate agency and advisory McGrath has struck a deal with Newground Capital Partners an alternative asset manager with its parent based in Britain.

Cruz 23 landed the cleaner harder punches en route to a wide unanimous-decision victory over his 36-year-old opponent in a fight that turned ugly on the Jermall Charlo-Juan Montiel card Saturday in Houston.

Cruz (22-1-1 15 KOs) took the fight to Vargas from the outset winging — and landing — hard punches to both the head and body although he never hurt Vargas.

Vargas (27-3-2 19 KOs) is known as one of the great brawlers of his generation but perhaps wary of another brawl held back against Cruz boxing at times and engaging when he had openings.

That allowed him to survive but he didn’t do enough to win rounds. Cruz won 100-89 99-90 and 97-92. Boxing Junkie scored it 98-91.

Cruz used his head a number of times when the fighters were entangled. That reached its ugly peak when one last butt caused a horrible gash above Vargas’ right eye with 30 seconds remaining in the fight.

The ring doctor allowed the fight to continue because it was almost over after which a bloody Vargas went down as a result of wild flurry of punches.

With the victory Cruz took another step toward his first title shot. Vargas who has been in so many wars will have to decide whether he wants to continue.

Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry is quite possibly the best shooter the game has ever seen while Philadelphia 76ers guard Seth Curry is just as efficient.

The two of them always show love for each other whenever it’s appropriate and on Friday Steph showed some love to Seth as he was lifting the Sixers to a 104-99 win over the Atlanta Hawks to keep their season alive.

Seth had 24 points and he knocked down six triples and Steph took to Twitter to praise his brother in this one. In fact Steph was actually left speechless at Seth’s performance.

Seth has been huge throughout these playoffs but Friday was probably the biggest performance of his career considering the circumstances. The Sixers are now still alive and they will have to be ready for a battle on Sunday in Game 7 back in Philadelphia.

What a way to celebrate turning 14!

Most kids get something like a new phone bicycle or a computer for their 14th birthday. But when Ken Block is your dad you get to drift in a Fox Body Mustang 5.0. This white convertible pony is very similar to what Vanilla Ice rocked back in the day only it has some special mods for daddy’s little princess Lia. What’s more Hoonigan will be giving the car away later although it hasn’t provided details for that yet.

The restoration of this car was done via CarcaineSupply.com. The build includes Maximum Motorsports suspension components Rotiform wheels Toyo tires and a Borla exhaust. It also includes a Scotidi angle kit to make this the ultimate drift machine. What did you think this car was being set up for regular driving?

Before you start thinking that building a drift Mustang for a 14 year-old is a waste know that Block’s kid is of course already a gifted driver. Lia was able to do donuts in her dad’s Mk II Escort which the man says is “a very difficult car to drive.” Obviously he’s proud of his daughter’s skills.

The plan with this 5.0 Fox Body is to have one of Block’s buddies teach her how to drift using the muscle car. It’s a surprise gift and her reaction to it is pretty funny especially since a video message from Vanilla Ice was part of the presentation. How many teenagers today think that’s cool? We have no idea.

As a bonus in the video we learn what car Vanilla Ice owned before his 5.0 and why he switched. It will make Ford fans laugh with glee but GM owners might not be so happy about it.

This story also helps blow up that narrative the media pushed for years that the youth of today don’t care about cars they only care about their Xbox or some stupid nonsense. We always knew that was bull so it’s great to see people like Block helping to expose the truth. Although Lia did admit the Fox Body is “far from” her favorite ride.

A few months after discovering from a DNA test that most of his ancestors were from west Africa American businessman Kyle Jones got on a flight to Dakar Senegal.

The coastal city was unfamiliar from the language to the dusty streets packed with motorcycles horse carts and hawkers but he immediately felt at home.

“There’s sort of a spiritual connection” said Jones the chief operating officer of ESS Group a professional training and development company near Atlanta.

“To come back and to instantly connect with the land the culture the people was an amazing feeling. It filled a gap which I had been searching for all my life” he told Quartz Africa in an interview.

Jones was one of about 75 people including business leaders mayors and entrepreneurs from the US who came to Dakar this week for “The Return” a seven-day event spearheaded by the organization NuWorld. The goal was to encourage members of the African diaspora to return to the continent both as a form of healing and to build social and economic ties. NuWorld is an umbrella platform encompassing various programs and initiatives led by American entrepreneur Andre Amos.

It was inspired by similar initiatives in Ghana whose president Nana Akufo-Addo declared 2019 the “Year of Return” to commemorate 400 years since the first arrival of enslaved Africans in the US. Ghana staged a marketing campaign throughout the year and saw tourist figures rise by 45% compared to the previous year though it’s difficult to ascertain exactly how many visitors came directly as a result of the campaign. As part of the initiative it granted citizenship to more than 100 African Americans and Afro-Caribbeans.

“It was very successful in Ghana and we wanted to do the same here in Senegal” said the NuWorld coordinator of the event Shantel Gilbert to Quartz Africa.

“To come back and to instantly connect with the land the culture the people was an amazing feeling. It filled a gap which I had been searching for all my life.”

While Ghana’s “Year of Return” was geared toward tourists the event in Senegal focused on promoting business ties. At a press conference in Dakar on Wednesday representatives from the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) an extension of the US Department of Commerce made an impassioned pitch: African Americans could find success in Senegal while helping develop the local economy.

“The contract that you can’t get at home? You may be able to get it here in your other home” said Patricia Hanes director of the MBDA Export Center in Chicago which helps US companies break into African markets.

“The Return” was inspired by similar initiatives in Ghana which declared 2019 the “Year of Return” to commemorate 400 years since the first arrival of enslaved Africans in the US.

A historic Juneteenth initiative

Unlike Ghana Senegal has not made an explicit appeal for members of the African diaspora to return. It is a French-speaking country which makes it less of a natural choice for African Americans.

But Senegal also has several advantages said Gilbert who urged visitors not to see the language difference as a barrier. Senegal is the westernmost point of Africa making it easy to access from the US and like Ghana it holds the historical significance of having been a departure point for slaves bound for the Americas.

Nearly half of the slaves who landed in the US came from the Senegambia region and west-central Africa. Goree Island just off the coast of Dakar was the largest slave-trading center on the African coast from the 15th to the 19th century according to UNESCO. Although some historians dispute Goree’s significance in the slave trade it has become a symbol of the past. As in Ghana’s Cape Coast Castle visitors to Goree who have included Barack Obama—can see the “door of no return” through which enslaved Africans were pushed onto ships.

“Why don’t we do business in a place where we are welcome?”

According to the leaders of the initiative this historical significance makes it the perfect place for them to launch. The idea is for Senegal to be an entry point to the continent said Gilbert. “The Return” will be held again next year and possibly every year on June 19th or Juneteenth a holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the US she said.

Business opportunities for foreign investors

Before the Covid-19 pandemic hit Senegal had one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa. As part of president Macky Sall’s Emerging Senegal Plan the country has set up an industrial park increased energy production and eased business regulations to court foreign investors. The country has also been receiving a fair amount of coverage in global news for Senegalese-American musician Akon’s plans to start a city in Senegal running on cryptocurrency.

US mayors pose with Aliou Sall president of the Mayors Association Of Senegal.

It still ranks 123 out of 190 countries on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business list which considers factors such as ease of paying taxes and registering property. But speakers at “The Return” conference focused on a more emotional selling point: not dealing with racism.

“African Americans have always known that the only way we’re really going to grow and develop is to connect with Africa.”

“Why don’t we do business in a place where we are welcome?” said Marcellus Wade the CEO of an American information and technology company Black Fox which aims to start work in Senegal. Wade said he is interested in Senegal mostly for personal reasons—he also learned about his ancestral ties from a DNA test—but he also thinks it offers good business opportunities.

As for speaking French he said he will learn.

The biggest challenge is simply spreading the word said Frank Jackson former mayor of Prairie View Texas who attended the event with five other mayors of historically black US towns and cities. “The Return” included the launch of a “Sister Cities” initiative which will pair them with Senegalese counterparts.

“People are interested. We need to make them aware that there is a viable program and they will come” Jackson told Quartz Africa. “African Americans have always known that the only way we’re really going to grow and develop is to connect with Africa.”

(KR) earnings digest and more.

Why should the food industry pay more attention to PPI than CPI?

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the most well-known indicator of inflation and “changes in CPI” and “changes in inflation” are usually synonymous. However in the current economic environment the Producer Price Index (PPI) is a far more important indicator of inflation than CPI. Let’s take a look at the underlying reasoning and some key areas that the food industry should watch closely.

How does PPI differ from CPI?

PPI differs from CPI in two critical areas: 1) composition of the basket and 2) price differences

Composition of the basket: PPI encompasses the entire domestic output including purchases by producers retailers consumers and everything in between. Imports are excluded. CPI only considers consumption of U.S. urban households. It does include imports.

Price differences: Price of an item in PPI reflects revenue received by its producer net of taxes. It is more correlated with cost of production. Price of an item in CPI reflects consumer expenditure which includes taxes and implicitly margins of all the intermediaries.



Research shows that PPI is a better indicator of inflationary cycles in the new millennium

Historically CPI and PPI were highly correlated but since 2000 the correlation has fallen substantially. In a recent NBER paper economists from Columbia University provided a structural explanation of the divergence. Over the past two decades offshoring international trades and technology became more important in the global supply chain. Research suggests that the decline in correlation of the two measures is likely to be permanent in this new world economic regime and PPI rather than CPI is a better indicator of inflationary cycles. As such PPI should be the targeting variable in monetary policies.

Key areas of inflation that the food industry should pay close attention to

The tables below show the latest PPI datapoints and food price outlook by USDA-WASDE and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Several commodities are expected to experience significant inflation in 2021: soybeans wheat and pork.

Producer Price Index item Annual 2019 Annual 2020 20-year historical average Forecast range2 2021 % % % % Crude foodstuffs and feedstuffs 0.9 -4.1 2.9 Intermediate foods and feeds 0.5 1.8 3.1 Finished consumer foods 2.0 1.4 2.3 Farm level cattle -0.8 -4.9 2.8 5.0 to 8.0 (+) Wholesale beef 2.0 2.4 3.6 1.5 to 4.5 (+) Wholesale pork 4.6 2.6 1.9 8.5 to 11.5 (+) Wholesale poultry 1.5 -0.5 1.7 13.0 to 16.0 (+) Farm level eggs -34.0 11.0 5.9 5.0 to 8.0 (+) Farm level milk 15.0 -4.4 3.9 Wholesale dairy 4.7 0.3 2.4 0.0 to 3.0 (-) Farm level soybeans -5.5 10.2 4.9 48.5 to 51.5 (+) Wholesale fats and oils -4.3 2.4 5.1 16.5 to 19.5 (+) Farm level fruit -6.1 2.0 2.4 2.0 to 2.5 (+) Farm level vegetables 13.0 3.5 3.8 6.0 to 9.0 (+) Farm level wheat -8.0 7.5 5.0 8.5 to 11.5 (+) Wholesale wheat flour -2.2 1.1 4.0 4.5 to 7.5 (+)

Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics PPI (not seasonally adjusted) and forecasts by USDA.. A negative sign indicates an adjustment downward and a plus sign indicates an adjustment upward.

Domestic and international demand for soybeans remains high as the global economy recovers. China the world’s biggest buyer of soybeans more than tripled its import of U.S. soybeans this year. The rise of plant-based foods increased domestic consumption. USDA predicts farm-level soybean prices to increase 48.5% to 51.5% in 2021. The rising price of soybeans should also lead to price increases for wholesale fats and oils which are expected to rise 16.5% to 19.5%.

Pork exports are expected to increase ~20% relative to pre-pandemic levels. USDA data showed strong shipments to Mexico Canada as well as to Central and South America. Wholesale pork prices are predicted to increase 8.5% to 11.5%.

Tight stocks and lower-than-expected production levels are expected to boost wheat prices throughout 2021. Farm-level wheat prices are now predicted to rise 8.5% to 11.5% and wholesale wheat flour prices are projected 4.5% to 7.5% higher.

Dogecoin fell by 1.93% on Sunday. Following on from a 2.59% decline on Saturday Dogecoin ended the week down by 13.47% to $0.2802.

A bearish morning saw Dogecoin slide to a midday intraday low $0.2554 before making a move.

The extended sell-off saw Dogecoin fall through the day’s major support levels.

Finding support from the broader market however Dogecoin rallied to a late intraday high $0.2897.

While falling short of the first major resistance level at $0.2939 Dogecoin tested resistance at the 62% FIB of $0.2882 before hitting reverse.

The reversal saw Dogecoin fall back through the first major support level at $0.2816 to end the day at sub-$0.2810 levels.

At the time of writing Dogecoin was down by 1.11% to $0.2771. A mixed start to the day saw Dogecoin rise to an early morning high $0.2811 before falling to a low $0.2753.

Dogecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

For the day ahead

Dogecoin would need to avoid the $0.2751 pivot to bring the 62% FIB of $0.2882 and the first major resistance level at $0.2948 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed however for Dogecoin to break out from the 62% FIB of $0.2882.

Barring an extended crypto rally the first major resistance level and resistance at $0.30 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of a breakout Dogecoin could test resistance at $0.32 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $0.3094.

A fall through the $0.2751 pivot would bring the first major support level at $0.2605 into play.

Barring another extended sell-off however Dogecoin should steer clear of sub-$0.25 levels. The second major support level sits at $0.2408.

A sustained fall through the 62% FIB of $0.2882 would form a near-term bearish trend from 8th May’s swing hi $0.7427.

Looking at the Technical Indicators

First Major Support Level: $0.2605

Pivot Level: $0.2751

First Major Resistance Level: $0.2948

23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $0.5691

38.2% FIB Retracement Level: $0.4618

62% FIB Retracement Level: $0.2882

Preferably a 1966 ‘Vette in Milano Maroon just like the one he owned in his 20s. If I could I would find a restored ’66 for Dad and buy it for him just to watch his face light up behind the wheel. Now if I could just find that money tree.

Dad is my biggest fan and reads my posts every weekend here at The Drive (hi Dad!). What I’ve learned from my dad over the years couldn’t fit into one article or even 100 and you may feel similarly about your dad stepdad grandfather or father figure in your life. What did you learn from them?

Kristin Shaw

Of all of the stories I’ve written about people in the automotive industry over the last several years countless numbers of them list their fathers as influences on their careers.

Toyota VP of VP of Project Planning Management Laura Pierce was gently nudged by her father who signed her up for a Women in Engineering day at Purdue University. Flat track champion Shauna Texter-Bauman and her brother Cory Texter were inspired by their dad Randy who was also a motorcycle racer. NASCAR driver Hailie Deegan has the full support and encouragement of her dad X-Games motocross rider and daredevil Brian Deegan.

Fathers have made an impact on people not in the business but as enthusiasts as well. My question yesterday was “Who Taught You How to Drive?” and some people chimed in with wonderful stories about their dads. Here are a few of my favorites:

John Deere and Dad - Christian Peterson

“My Dad taught me how to drive in my first car: A Power Wheels John Deere Gator. I was probably two or three years old. I drove that all over the yard up and down the driveway and even 'helped' haul firewood to the house if we had a fallen tree or branch to chop up. I used it so often that my Dad had to find replacement wheels...I had worn holes in two sets by the time I had outgrown it.

The natural progression was to a riding lawnmower at age 6 or 7 cutting my grandparent's yard every week while my Grandpa watched from an old fold out chair in the open garage.

My vehicles have only gotten bigger and uh actually street legal since. Now I share a hobby with my Dad working on and showing our restored military trucks.”

Grandpa Dad and a go-kart - Maggie Osterberg

“When I was six years old my grandpa bought me a go-kart. He and dad fixed the pedals and seat so I could reach everything started the engine and yelled ""GOOOOO!!!!!"" I drove around a mixed pavement (long long driveway) and grass ""track"" until the gas ran out. Dad came running over to me with tears in his eyes and told be that he was so proud of how I braked into the curves and accelerated out of them.”

Dad's 1960 Austin-Healey 3000 - ExAutoJourno

“My Dad taught me in his 1960 Austin-Healey 3000 (which made for an interesting driving test at the DMV but that's another story). By the time we had completed numerous drives over the mountain roads near our house I had trail braking hitting apexes and the rest down pretty well. Well enough BTW that my high-school Driver's Ed teacher excused me after the first day so the other kids could have more behind-the-wheel time in that big ol' Chevy Bel Air.

Like just about everyone else I was really jazzed to get my license on my 16th birthday. So jazzed that I didn't realize what a massive comedown it was to have to use my late grandfather's '50 Chevy as a DD. I soon replaced it with a $50 Hillman Minx which for no good reason I wish I still had. I miss the Healey too which left the family after 41 years. And most of all I miss my Dad.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vcWN0aW1lcy5jb20vcGhvdG9zLWl0cy1mb29kLXRydWNrLWZpZ2h0LXRpbWUvY29sbGVjdGlvbl85YTQ0OGVkYy04Y2ZjLTUzMmMtOWJhMi0wYmU3YzkwMGI3NGYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: It's Food Truck Fight time - Davenport,"Register for more free articles.

DAL,Delta Air Lines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9kZWx0YXMtbmV3LXN0YXRpb24tY2hpZWYtd29ya3MtdG8tYnVpbGQtYmFjay1tc3AtaHViLWFmdGVyLXBhbmRlbWljLzYwMDA2OTk2OS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta's new station chief works to build back MSP hub after pandemic,"The lights have turned back on at Delta Air Lines and a new station chief at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport is rebuilding a local operation depleted by the global pandemic's brutal impact on aviation.

The coronavirus grounded the industry and Delta the dominant carrier at MSP lost 500 of its local workers in a rapid downsizing a year ago. Unlike many airlines Delta managed to avoid large furloughs and firings through a variety of employee incentives.

But locally said Mary Loeffelholz Delta's new vice president of MSP airport operations ""We lost a lot of senior people and this is one of the more senior stations.""

MSP is Delta's second-largest hub — the former home of Northwest Airlines which merged with Delta in 2009 — and has consistently been a top-performer for on-time departures and baggage handling.

After a gradual rise in passenger loads this year the airline — and in turn MSP airport — saw a sharp uptick on May 1 when Delta unblocked its middle seats.

The skies over MSP are buzzing again with arriving and departing passenger jets that are full again even as the government continues to require mask-wearing at airports and in the air. Delta will operate 338 daily flights at the airport next month down from the 448 daily flights two years ago but markedly higher than the 187 daily flights of July 2020.

MSP-based Delta flight attendant Richard Schutz described it as going ""from zero to 100 overnight.""

Loeffelholz is tasked with building back service training new leaders and overseeing construction on a large new airport lounge to lift Delta's presence at one of its marquee airports.

For Loeffelholz it's a homecoming a decade in the making. Her 25-year aviation career started as an environmental engineer at Northwest. The merger pulled her into executive-level positions at Delta's headquarters in Atlanta where she led international operations and Los Angeles where she oversaw the massive LAX terminal renovation over the past three years.

But she never actually left Minnesota. With her husband and kids still living in Edina Loeffelholz was one of many Northwest veterans who joined Delta but maintained a Twin Cities residence.

Four years ago she even joined her husband in opening Dampfwerk Distillery in St. Louis Park making European-style craft spirits inspired by the family's German and American roots.

Loeffelholz took over at MSP last October. ""Being in my own bed multiple nights in a row now just getting reconnected in the community. I love it"" she said.

Her primary focus has been on rehiring customer service workers and much of Delta's senior leadership at the airport. Communicating with a team of 1300 employees and training new hires during the pandemic's peak was difficult she said.

""When you think about that lost experience how do you maintain that continuity?"" she said. ""How do you bring new people and make sure that proud history continues. It's a constant rebuilding almost rebirth process.""

The company held two job fairs in May and made 170 conditional job offers — and is still hiring.

But Loeffelholz's experience with ""building big buildings"" for Delta is also playing a role. A key part of her job right now she said is ""staying ahead of the building process.""

""Some of its tactical but really strategically what are we going to look like a year from now from a facilities standpoint?"" she asks herself.

Both of Delta's airport lounges which it calls Sky Clubs at MSP are now open without any capacity restrictions. The main club is back to serving buffet-style food while the smaller one on C concourse is still serving packaged foods.

Last Wednesday Loeffelholz said got word that revamped plans for a new Sky Club at the end of the G Concourse were approved. Before the pandemic Delta was planning for a new Sky Club but had to put nonessential capital improvement plans at MSP and its other airports on hold.

Now Delta's new MSP lounge will be more than 17000 square feet with a 3000-square-foot indoor-outdoor sky deck.

""We are really excited. We are designing the ability to open up the walls where you get the outdoor experience brought in as well as the pure outdoor deck"" she said.

Delta aims to begin construction on the lounge which will offer views of planes landing and taking off over the Minnesota River valley in November. That will be another piece in a broader MSP renovation project that includes much of Concourse G as well as the front entry at Terminal 1.

""Everyone is suffering from materials and supplies shortages so we are aiming to open in 2023"" Loeffelholz said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS93aHktZGVsdGEtYm9laW5nLTc3Ny0yMDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Delta Air Lines Took On The Boeing 777,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS93aHktZGVsdGEtYm9laW5nLTc3Ny0yMDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vamFzb24tYXRlbi93aXRoLWp1c3QtOC13b3Jkcy1kZWx0YXMtY2VvLXRhdWdodC1hLWJvbGQtbGVzc29uLWZvci1ldmVyeS1sZWFkZXItaW4tMjAyMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With Just 8 Words Delta's CEO Taught a Bold Lesson For Every Leader in 2021,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/with-just-8-words-deltas-ceo-taught-a-bold-lesson-for-every-leader-in-2021.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vamFzb24tYXRlbi93aXRoLWp1c3QtOC13b3Jkcy1kZWx0YXMtY2VvLXRhdWdodC1hLWJvbGQtbGVzc29uLWZvci1ldmVyeS1sZWFkZXItaW4tMjAyMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbHRhLWRlbGF5cy1qbmItY3B0LXJvdXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta delays its most anticipated long-haul route of 2021,"Plans for Delta's hotly anticipated new triangle route to Johannesburg (JNB) and Cape Town (CPT) have changed yet again. While this service has been delayed for the sixth time to Aug. 1 2021 (per Cirium schedules and confirmed on Delta's website) this time the carrier has now decided to drop plans to fly to Cape Town altogether.

When Delta first announced its two-city South Africa service the carrier planned to start flights on Oct. 24 2020. It was then delayed to Jan. 8 2021 then March 27 2021 then June 5 2021 and then to July 2 2021. While Delta's flight to South Africa is still projected to fly on Aug. 1 the service will now only run directly from Atlanta (ATL) to Johannesburg.

Delta is also tweaking the operating frequency. From Aug. 1 through Sept. 8 the carrier plans to run three weekly flights on Sundays Wednesdays and Fridays in the eastbound direction and on Mondays Thursdays and Saturdays in the westbound direction.

From Sept. 8 on Delta will increase the flight to daily service.

The month-long delay comes as South Africa has just logged its first confirmed cases of the Delta coronavirus variant while still dealing with its own virus variant that appears to be more infectious. The U.S. government on Jan. 26 2021 banned travel from South Africa with the exceptions of U.S. citizens and legal U.S. residents due to the more contagious South Africa variant.

Before the pandemic Delta operated daily non-stop flights from Atlanta (ATL) to Johannesburg (JNB) on a Boeing 777-200LR. However the airline's 777 fleet was retired late last year.

Delta uses enhanced Airbus A350-900

Flying an A350 from JNB to ATL initially presented Delta with a problem. Due to the city's high elevation the A350 couldn't reach Atlanta at maximum payload. That's why the carrier originally added the tag flight to Cape Town (CPT) allowing the plane to refuel at sea level before beginning the 8130-mile trek back to the U.S.

The route will now be flown by the carrier's flagship Airbus A350 outfitted with 32 fully enclosed Delta One business class suites 48 Premium Select premium economy seats and 226 economy seats. The flight time will run about 16 hours -- Delta's longest flight and will no longer need a stop in CPT anymore and will just fly directly from ATL to JNB.

Paid fares on the inaugural flight start at a whopping $2500 round trip in coach and $3700 in Premium Select. Delta One Suites are sold out as of press time. One-way award redemptions start at 140000 250000 and 465000 SkyMiles respectively.

Big three launches other ultra-long-haul flights

Despite the pandemic the ""Big 3"" U.S. airlines are all slated to launch a slew of new ultra-long-haul flights this year.

United Airlines launched its flagship Johannesburg route on June 3 2021. Following the successful late 2019 launch of a Newark (EWR) to CPT nonstop the Chicago-based carrier is planning to launch a second South Africa flight to JNB using a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner.

United is also planning a new San Francisco (SFO) to Bangalore (BLR) flight which was just delayed again this time to Aug. 1.

American Airlines' long-haul plans for 2021 include a new Seattle (SEA) to BLR flight three Tel Aviv routes (from Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) Miami (MIA) and New York (JFK) and multiple new international hops from New York-JFK including Athens (ATH) Santiago (SCL) Rio de Janeiro (GIG) and Tel Aviv (TLV). (JFK-TLV flights launched on May 6 2021.)

Additional reporting by Stella Shon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvZGVsdGEtNzM3LTc1Ny1uZXcteW9yay1zZWF0dGxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comparing Delta's 737-900ER and 757 on New York-Seattle,"If I were to tally up all of my flights over the years New York-Seattle probably tops the list of routes I’ve flown the most. It’s a rather long domestic flight with varying levels of competition and an on-again off-again flirtation with premium transcontinental services.

I often book Delta on this route as it tends to operate intentionally equipped aircraft with an elevated level of service but on my most recent trip I booked a screaming JetBlue fare in its Mint-configured A321 only to see it downgraded to an unrefurbished A320. I canceled and rebooked on Delta with a 737-900ER and A330-900neo scheduled for the roundtrip though the A330 was quickly swapped out for a 757-200ER on the return.

I have written in the past about how I prefer to fly Delta due to its incredible levels of product consistency and operational reliability but in a COVID-ravaged world things are a bit different and a whole lot less predictable.

My morning 737-900ER flight from JFK to Seattle was delayed by 30 minutes the night before departure an indication that adverse weather in New York was stretching Delta’s crew availability thin. This likely would not have been as noticeable pre-COVID as Delta would have been much more likely to assign a new crew member to the flight and get out on time. The same flight was delayed more than four hours the prior day so at least I dodged that bullet. (My return flight was also delayed more than half an hour due to a late loading of bags and freight.)

The interiors of the 737-900ER and 757-200ER are strikingly similar to each other despite the 14-year age difference with the 737 sporting some visible updates such as more modern passenger service units and overhead bins.

Hand sanitizer offered outside the lav on both aircraft was a nice touch.

By and large both the 737 and 757 aircraft provide extremely comparable experiences. My seat in the Comfort+ economy class section provided me with ample legroom on both flights. And both offered the same Panasonic Eco Series 9-inch IFE monitors with abundant video content and about a dozen live TV channels.

Both aircraft featured two AC power outlets per set of three seats in addition to the low-power USB port in each IFE monitor.

One noticeable difference between the two aircraft is the inflight Wi-Fi system.

While both offer satellite-supported connectivity from Intelsat branded as Gogo the 737-900ER is outfitted with the newer 2Ku system while the 757 features the older traditional Ku-band system. The former facilitates streaming video onboard while the latter does not (the antenna hump atop the aircraft is higher with traditional Ku).

Using my one hour of free Wi-Fi provided by T-Mobile netted quite a better experience on the 737 with regular Ku on the 757 struggling to keep up with basic tasks such as browsing and social media.

On the 737 one could avail of Wi-Fi by the hour or for the full flight. A one-hour browse pass cost $6 while a full-flight browse pass came in at $20. The one-hour stream pass started at $10.

By comparison the traditional Ku-band system on the 757 offered a half-hour browse pass for $11 while the full-flight pass was an unreasonable $40.

Both the 737-900ER and the 757 aircraft are slated to be upgraded to Viasat-powered Ka-band Wi-Fi by the end of 2021. This will be the fourth Wi-Fi upgrade for each type as they previously offered Gogo’s air-to-ground ATG-4 system and prior to that the legacy ATG solution.

The soft product on select Delta transcon flights is typically an outstanding value-add but things are different in a COVID world. Prior to the pandemic Delta offered a complimentary meal to all passengers on select transcon flights including JFK to Seattle.

The meal offered was typically in my opinion better than most buy-on-board options offered by most airlines. Unfortunately these meals and most inflight services became a victim of COVID.

The near six-hour flight to Seattle only offered a choice of a small energy bar and a bag of mini pretzels.

A limited beverage selection was also available including free alcoholic beverages for Comfort+ passengers who knew it was a benefit of that seat (menus were not on offer).

I bought a sandwich from a local deli on the way to JFK and ate it onboard a move I typically frown upon. With these limited services on long flights however I felt I had to do it.

The return flight to JFK occurred on the first day of the resumption of full meal service in First Class/Delta One on select transcon routes including JFK and Seattle.

Back in Comfort+ and Main Cabin though not much had changed.

The limited selection is now served from a basket rather than an aisle cart and Flight Fuel snack boxes have made a return for purchase.

There is however still no option to purchase fresh food nor has Delta brought back the complimentary meal for economy passengers. It would be nice if Delta loaded its menu onto the IFE system so passengers could know their full options before the flight attendants get to their row.

It’s surprising to me that Delta has lagged rather than led the pack in the resumption of certain soft product offerings. If travel is truly back as the airlines tell us at least domestically in the US the services offered before COVID should be back as well.

TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares have rebounded from their retreat a day earlier tracking Wall Street's recovery from the Federal Reserve's reminder it will eventually provide less support to markets.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 jumped 2.8% in morning trading to 28785.24. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 1.4% to 7336.30. South Korea's Kospi rose 0.6% to 3260.11. Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged up 0.1% to 28522.78 while the Shanghai Composite gained 0.9% to 3559.32.

Although the latest bout of jitters over a possible easing of help from the Federal Reserve and other central banks appears to have passed analysts said rising coronavirus cases in the region remained a concern.

“Much of the region is dealing with renewed waves of COVID-19 infections. These waves especially in the case of India Indonesia and some other countries in Southeast Asia are the most severe yet” said Venkateswaran Lavanya at Mizuho Bank in Singapore.

On Monday the S&P 500 snapped 1.4% higher to 4224.79 recovering nearly three-quarters of its worst weekly loss since February. Oil producers banks and other companies that were hit particularly hard last week led the way.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.8% to 33876.97 and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.8% to 14141.48.

Investors are still figuring all the ramifications of the Fed’s forecast that may start raising short-term interest rates by late 2023. That’s earlier than previously thought. The Fed also began talks about slowing programs meant to keep longer-term rates low an acknowledgment of the strengthening economy and threat of higher inflation.

The market’s immediate reaction to last week’s Fed news was to send stocks lower and interest rates higher. Higher rates would make stock prices which have been climbing faster than corporate profits look even more expensive than they do already.

But it’s not like the Fed said it will hike rates from their record low of nearly zero anytime soon.

“If markets are worried about a march back to more normal monetary and fiscal policy as the economy recovers it will be a very long march” Barings chief global strategist Christopher Smart said in a note. In the meantime support from both the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government should continue to help stock prices even if they do look expensive compared with history he said.

Companies whose profits are the most closely tied to the economy’s strength and inflation were among the market's strongest on Monday.

Hess Marathon Oil and Devon Energy all rose at least 6.9% as energy stocks rallied with the price of oil. Banks were also strong with Bank of America up 2.5% and Wells Fargo climbing 3.7%.

High-growth companies able to flourish almost regardless of the economy lagged behind in a reversal from last week’s trend when investors rattled by the Fed piled back into the biggest winners of the pandemic.

Amazon slipped 0.9% and the lagging performance for tech meant the Nasdaq trailed other indexes.

More bumps may be ahead for markets which had been mostly quiet for weeks before the Fed's announcement. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak before a House subcommittee on Tuesday about the Fed's response to the pandemic.

In energy trading benchmark U.S. crude picked up 13 cents to $73.25 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It jumped $1.83 to $73.12 on Monday. Brent crude the international standard gained 23 cents to $75.13 a barrel.

In currency trading the U.S. dollar rose to 110.39 Japanese yen from 110.31 yen. The euro rose to $1.1918 from $1.1914.

In the residential sector the COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on space requirements for staff and labour accommodation increasing focus on filling the market gap for a quality product featuring sufficient facilities and amenities.

In addition the focus has shifted towards millennials as a key consumer class with a requirement to reconfigure homes as digitally enabled spaces as well as increasing demand for smaller living spaces with developers responding by introducing greater proportion of apartments and townhouses within megaprojects CBRE said.

The future of work

CBRE said recent government initiatives will force regional occupiers to review their office footprint across the Middle East after the kingdom announced that foreign companies must base their regional headquarters there.

Physical offices are here to stay but real estate companies will carry out portfolio optimisation via a mix of traditional flexible spaces.

“Increased flexibility from local landlords [will] be critical to future success” CBRE said.

Meanwhile in retail there will be an increased focus on creating a retail experience to attract shoppers but in hospitality the recovery is likely to be longer as the kingdom kept its borders closed to international tourists until May 17th.

“Government-led projects are expected to become the powerhouse of the tourism sector in KSA once fully completed.

“The delivery of the first phases of projects such as the Red Sea or Al Ula will participate in the creation of a new perception of the KSA as a leisure tourism destination.”

Industrial and logistics

The kingdom also has a wide-ranging plan the National Industrial Development and Logistics Program to transform Saudi Arabia into a global industrial and logistics hub.

“Major infrastructure improvement projects targeting air rail and road infrastructure combined with plans to establish eight special economic zones by 2030 will underpin demand for institutional quality industrial and logistics real estate.”

Food security and cold storage space is expected to form a key component of speculative development in the industrial and logistics market the company said.

Stepping Stones educates 2.5 – 5 year olds in English and has been around for over 40 years.

This is Stepping Stone's philosophy:

We believe that early childhood is a time of natural exploration and discovery. We know that young children learn by “hands on” experiences.

Our teachers are highly qualified to scaffold each child’s growth and development in a natural way to help them discover answers to their curiosities about the world around them. Children come into our world eager to learn and discover and the teachers want to support and engage them in a way that will turn them into lifelong learners.

We have a multi-cultural play-based curriculum that encourages learning through art language music pre-math pre-reading science and socialization. Although we prepare children for kindergarten we do so in a way that makes learning a more natural and fun experience and focus more on the children’s interests when we build our emergent curriculum.

Here's a detailed review of Stepping Stones if you are considering sending your child or children there. I have visited the school five times and have spend a total of 4.5 hours speaking to the admissions director and teachers and observing the students.

Stepping Stones Preschool Review

Facilities 4/5 stars:

Stepping Stones is located in a church like many other preschools. The school does not have a religious denomination and is open to all faiths. They have a wonderful open area and four separate classrooms separated by age groups.

Location 5/5 stars:

Stepping Stones is in one of the best locations in all of San Francisco given its walking proximity to Golden Gate Park the largest and most family friendly park in the city

The Inner Sunset neighborhood is one of the best neighborhoods in San Francisco for raising a family due to the concentration of single family homes unlike most of the city. The neighborhood is diverse affordable and friendly.

The people who live in the Stepping Stones neighborhood feel like your middle class salt of the earth people from yesteryear. There is no snobbery like you might experience in the Pacific Heights Marina Presidio Heights or Cow Hollow neighborhoods where the demographic is extremely homogenous.

Further if you are financially savvy Stepping Stones is near Golden Gate Heights Redfin's top 5 neighborhoods in the entire country for property price appreciation.

More single family homes means more family and family friendly activities in the neighborhood.

Diversity 5/5 stars:

Unlike other top-ranked preschools who consist of mostly caucasian kids Stepping Stones is incredibly diverse and reflective of the diversity of the city. San Francisco after all is a minority majority city. For all the kids to come from rich and white backgrounds is unfortunate to prepare your child for the real world.

Teaching 4/5:

All teachers are required to have Bachelor of Arts degrees. Stepping Stones also has a great male preschool teacher named Andrew who I've seen at the California Academy Of Science's every week when his son was 0-2 years old.

The teachers back each other up and are great based on my four hours of observation. Feedback from parents has been universally positive.

Stepping stones also has a low child-teacher ratio of 6:1 (2 teachers per class of 12).

Schedule 5/5:

For working parents Stepping Stones has the ideal schedule. You can drop your kids off at 7:30am free of charge and pick them up as late as 5:30pm also free of charge. The founders of Stepping Stones were both working parents hence this focus on schedule flexibility.

Tuition 4/5:

Preschool is not cheap anywhere in San Francisco and Stepping Stones is no exception. For full-time enrollment the cost is about $1950 a month. For part-time enrollment the cost is around $1500 a month. The school is year around.

Curriculum 4/5:

Here is Stepping Stone's curriculum in their words: Our main teaching philosophy is focused on the concept of community. We want the children to learn what it is like to be a part of the community and how they can contribute to the community.

We take daily walks in the Inner Sunset community and we know all of the surrounding businesses where we also take mini field trips.

For example Easy Breezy and Hometown Creamery open their doors for us before their business hours to allow the children to take a tour and Park Smile welcomes us to visit and chat about dental hygiene.

For Halloween we go trick-or-treating in the neighborhood. And as a way to say thank you and to give back to our neighbors we take the children caroling in December. We also visit and invite SFFD and SFPD into our school every year to talk to the children about different ways to be safe.

In addition to teaching the children about our neighborhood community we also teach the children how to be a part of their school community. We encourage the older children to help out in the younger classrooms and we also teach children to ask their fellow classmates for a helping hand to see if they can solve the problem together before asking a teacher. Our end goal is to mold our children into kind tiny humans who know how to navigate living in a city.

Our Pre-Kindergarten class takes monthly field trips to the California Academy of Sciences. We are taking advantage of our close proximity to the museum. We take the children to document in their science journals – explore observe document and label. And then we take them back every month to observe and document any changes. At the end of the year parents can see the fine motor development in their journals as well as the growth in their observations (teachers write down their words for their observations).

Parental involvement 5/5:

Because Stepping Stones is located in a family friendly mostly single family neighborhood parental involvement is much higher than other neighborhoods.

It's extremely easy to get to know other parents build friendships organize playdates and feel apart of a community. This community feeling is huge for especially stay at home parents who need a social outlet.

Safety measures 4/5:

With COVID-19 Stepping Stones preschool is proactively implementing safety measures to protect the health of its students and teachers. Many new rules are in place including teachers wearing masks all day moving to mostly outdoor school at Golden Gate Park grouping siblings and more. Please ask the school about their safety measures. It is quite detailed.

Stepping Stones Overall Score: 4.2/5

Stepping Stones is one of the best preschools in San Francisco. It is a true reflection of the spirt of San Francisco given its location and diversity.

If you are rich and want to start your kids down the pressure cooker road that resulted in 33 parents getting prosecuted by the Department of Justice in 2019 Stepping Stones preschool may not be for you.

See: The Wide Implications Of The College Admissions Scandal

But if you want a diverse loving and wonderful environment in a family-friendly neighborhood Stepping Stones is a fantastic option.

At the end of the day all your little one needs is a lot of love and attention. Stepping Stones gave the biggest amount of love I have ever experienced each time I visited.

As schools gradually open up after months of shelter-in-place I'd definitely consider Stepping Stones preschool as a top choice in San Francisco.

(WTVF) — A man was arrested in Smithville on multiple charges including two counts of aggravated kidnapping and one count of aggravated sexual battery.

Cookeville police say that 29-year-old Tyler Justin Hall was found at a Dollar General in Smithville on Sunday by local authorities following a kidnapping incident at a Sam's Club in Cookeville the day prior.

On Saturday night around 11:56 p.m. Cookeville Police were notified by White County police about an incident at a Sam's Club.

Around 10:34 p.m. that night two employees were standing in the parking lot when they were approached by Hall where he held them at gunpoint and told them to drive towards White County.

Near a Walmart in White County one of the victims was able to wrestle the gun away from Hall.

Hall then ran away from the scene.

Shortly after the incident Cookeville PD sent out a release asking for assistance in finding him.

A McDonald's employee reportedly resigned by posting an angry note in a local drive-thru.

The worker apparently hated the job so much they closed up shop early Saturday night.

The note captures the trend of employees 'rage-quitting' their jobs in a tightening labor market.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

A McDonald's employee who worked at a branch in Louisville Kentucky apparently quit their job by posting a sign at a drive-through on Saturday night.

A photo of the sign read: ""We are closed because I am quitting and I hate this job."" It was shared on Twitter by a user Great Ape Dad who spotted the posting the following morning.

He later explained in a follow-up tweet that the sign was stuck up by a night shift manager who had ""suddenly quit"" the night before and closed up shop early Today reported.

Great Ape Dad told Today he was en route to pick up the new BTS meal for his wife when he came across the note. ""I took a picture uploaded it to Twitter not thinking much of anything about it"" he said. ""And much to my surprise it's had quite a success.""

-Great Ape Dad 💪🏿🦍 💪🏾🐵 (@GreatApeDad) June 14 2021

Apparently employees were unaware of the note until he pointed it out to them.

""I used to work in the service industry myself"" the user added. ""I think that people are just frustrated especially the working-class people who are there in the front line … things that are in a boiling point where I can definitely see where someone on a Saturday night that doesn't want to be working the drive-thru - wants to just call it quits.""

McDonald's did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on this story.

US employees are increasingly ""rage-quitting"" their jobs as a tightening labor market means that companies must reckon with the often unfavorable conditions and low pay they are offering.

Story continues

Frustrated employees are often choosing to depart their roles rather than wait around and hope things will change.

In an interview with Insider's Áine Cain a former employee at Dollar General rage-quit her job in the springtime of 2021 after finding her drowning in an increasingly fraught work environment.

""By the time you get down to that lowly stay-at-home mom that just wanted a part-time job - who is earning less than a hundred dollars a week because she's making $7.25 an hour and only working 10 hours a week - it's not worth it"" the employee told Insider.

After 45 years in the business the couple retired April 19 turning the keys over to a new owner.

Independent grocers are fading from the retail landscape and it's not hard to see why. The Gallions were always working always thinking of the store. Even on days off there was paperwork to do calls to answer.

Even now those old habits die hard.

For Donna Gallion it starts as soon as she puts her hands on a shopping cart. Is that head of lettuce past its prime? What about those strawberries? And that seasonal display could use a little straightening.

Same goes for Norm. There are no suppliers to call no deliveries to arrange no thinking about what seasonal items he needs to order that customers will be wanting around holidays or summertime.

These days the constant ringing of the phone is replaced by a quiet that is only interrupted by their Schnauzer Jake who lets out a cheerful bark when the doorbell rings.

Norm and Donna both 68 were ready for a change of pace but after nearly five decades of constant work retirement feels well different. Forty-five years running a grocery business will do that to you.

""I went to the store for just a few things the other day and I was there an hour"" Donna said. ""Talking to customers and employees.""

When it began

The Gallions high school sweethearts were just 22 when they bought a small mom-and-pop store in Orleans owned by Bill and Margie McCart in 1976. Norm always knew he would own his own business. Both his parents were self-employed. His mother owned restaurants in Campbellsburg and Orleans his dad hauled lime and stone for a living.

Norm also said he wouldn't work seven days a week but life as an independent grocer is nonstop.

For a time Norm kept his job in Evansville and Donna ran the store. In 1981 they moved to the present Maple Street location which had been a furniture store. As the business grew Norm quit the job in Evansville. Between calls from customers suppliers and employees Norm's phone was seldom silent for long.

""It was a dream to own our own store"" he said. ""I always thought it was neat to help my grandmother shop and I had worked at Lindley's IGA.""

The two soon found their niches in the business. For Donna it was out on the floor stocking product making sure the deli and produce sections were fresh and running the register. Norm focused on the business side. It was hard work but also a lot of fun. Looking at old photos Donna points to the time she dressed up as Big Bird in another she's kicking up her heels dressed in a Cookie Monster costume for a parade.

""We did a lot of crazy things"" she said with a laugh.

For a store Oktoberfest promotion Norm dressed in lederhosen. At Christmas Santa Claus visited the store.

They raised three children: Mandy Crissy and Jeremy and put them through college. All three are accountants living north of Indianapolis. The couple has four grandchildren.

They always managed to take two weeks off for family vacations when the kids were young and after the kids were grown they took one week off each year.

The store would shut down for the day at 1 a.m. and then open back up at 5 a.m.

In the early days of the big store there were four groceries in Orleans. In 1985 the store expanded increasing from 5000 to 9000 square feet and taking it from four shopping aisles to seven.

Other features were added like Noble Roman's Pizza and broasted chicken.

Around 1997 the Orange County retail landscape changed when a Wal-Mart opened in Paoli. To prepare for this new competition Norm revamped the store again making upgrades to the front entrance.

Gallion's felt the impact of Wal-Mart.

""It was hard for about 10 or 15 years"" he said. ""We were struggling.""

A switch to the Association of Wholesale Grocers made the store more competitive and business rebounded.

Now competition is right across the street in the form of a Dollar General Store.

The Gallions kept their focus on customer service and a commitment to quality and value. Gallion's is known for its ground beef produced daily in the meat department run by longtime meat department manager Eugene Burch who has worked there since 1990.

""We did our ground beef the old-fashioned way"" Norm said. ""Nobody does it that way anymore. And we used Black Canyon Angus beef and bought the better brands of pork.""

The sale to new owner Johnny Singh of Muncie was final April 19. Burch continues to run the meat department and Norm's sister Bethel Ball an employee since 1988 still works at Gallion's.

Norm said a part of him wanted to keep the store a few more years but the difficulty in finding good employees their age and an opportunity to sell factored into the decision.

""One reason I wanted to sell to someone was I didn't want to close the store and leave the town without a grocery store"" he said.

During their four-plus decades they saw tremendous change. Norm remembers when they sold a pound of ground beef for 99 cents and a gallon of milk was $1.29.

Toilet paper sold in a four-pack not the mega packs of today. And then there was the COVID run on toilet paper and other basics. Donna said the consumer demand at the start of the pandemic was far worse than any snowstorm prediction.

Adjusting to the quiet has taken some time getting used to. But they both agree the stress of making sure the store was running tip-top they don't miss.

""We miss the people"" Donna said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvanVuLzIwLzItYmlnLXByb2plY3RzLXJldnZpbmctdXAtc291dGgtZmF5ZXR0ZXZpbGxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 big projects revving up south Fayetteville | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"FAYETTEVILLE -- Hundreds of art students and new residents soon will be milling about where not long ago groups of high schoolers grabbed burgers and farmers restocked feed and supplies.

A pair of major projects south of downtown are set to hit milestones within a year.

Specialized Real Estate Group's South Yard project will put a combination of apartments restaurants and retail space and eventually a hotel on the southwest corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and South School Avenue. The firm plans to start accepting residential tenants early next year.

A block to the west the University of Arkansas is building its flagship art studio and design center which should be ready in time for the fall 2022 semester.

The city also should start work late next year on reducing South School Avenue to three car lanes with accommodations for bicycles and pedestrians.

City planners say the projects could spur development on the south part of town.

Before the projects came along the two-block area served as home to Brenda's Bigger Burger a joint across the street from Fayetteville High School with picnic tables outside.

The Art Experience a community art education nonprofit started in 1993 by Hank and Jo Ann Kaminsky sat in a vibrantly colored house near Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Hill Avenue. The nonprofit now is in a house on North College Avenue near Mermaids seafood restaurant.

The Farmers Cooperative had a store at the southwest corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and School Avenue since 1982. It moved to Heritage Parkway in Prairie Grove last year. The old Korean Food Mart and SalaThai Restaurant on South School Avenue were part of the deal with Specialized Real Estate and have since been demolished.

Drivers can see the framework for five apartment buildings along South School Avenue. The northernmost building will have four stories with potential office or commercial space on the ground floor. The other four buildings will be three stories.

The residential part of the project is about 40% complete said Shaun Brock construction superintendent with Huffman & Co. the hired builder.

Developers intend to lease the 128 units said Kaitlyn Fondano real estate development manager with Specialized Real Estate. Pets will be allowed. Tenants should start moving in within the first three months of next year she said.

Most units will be studio and one-bedroom apartments Fondano said. Price ranges have not been set.

""You kind of have smaller-scale market-rate apartments which will typically bring in your young professional-type clientele"" she said. ""I think the location will prove to be interesting for a myriad of consumers because of the proximity to the trail [system] the great connections we're going to have with the commercial and everything around it.""

The Razorback Greenway runs through the site and connects to the Tsa La Gi trail to the west. Tanglewood Branch also runs along the southwest edge with a public park planned along the stream bank.

The city will own the park but Specialized Real Estate agreed to perform basic maintenance such as lawn care for 10 years. Anyone will be allowed to visit the park Fondano said.

Another phase of the project timeline involves repurposing existing structures at the site. Four buildings attach to one another in a curved formation abutting the railway that bifurcated the site decades ago.

Three of the buildings and a separate building in front of them are planned for food and beverage places and retail. The southern-most building is planned to attach to a new building as a hotel.

The hotel will serve as the final phase of the project timeline Fondano said. Specialized Real Estate originally planned to build about 220 apartment units but decided to make one of the new buildings a hotel instead.

Aside from improving the project's financial feasibility having a hotel near the university and downtown was too good of an opportunity to pass up Fondano said. Having visitors from out of town will add to the liveliness of the site she said.

The 350 to 400 students who will occupy the university's Windgate Studio and Design Center in the fall of 2022 will want places to go said Gerry Snyder executive director of the University of Arkansas School of Art. The commercial spaces at South Yard should suit them fine he said.

The Windgate center should wrap up construction in about a year. The four-story 154600-square-foot building will serve as the anchor of the university's Windgate district featuring a courtyard amphitheater and coffee shop. The university's studio art and graphic design programs will come together under one roof near Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Hill Avenue at the site's west side.

The Anthony Timberlands Center for Design and Materials Innovation which will serve architecture students at the district is scheduled to finish construction in late 2023 or early 2024. Conceptual drawings show wooden trusses forming a cascading roof for the structure.

The two new buildings will join four existing ones at the site. An art annex sculpture facility library annex and an architecture fabrication laboratory will make up the rest of the Windgate district.

Several grants including $40 million from the Windgate Charitable Foundation and a $120 million grant from the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation for arts education made the center possible.

Snyder and Fondano agreed that the two projects will complement each other although they weren't designed in tandem.

""Faculty and students without purposely trying to make it the point will be part of the community much more"" Snyder said.

Reconfiguring South School Avenue to the east is part of the next phase of bond projects that voters approved in April 2019. The city has preliminary conceptual designs as part of its 71B Corridor Plan and money and time will determine the project's details Public Works Director Chris Brown said.

Early drawings on the city's website show School Avenue south of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard reduced to one car lane in each direction with a turn lane in the middle. Plans show a 5-foot-wide sidewalk on the east side of School Avenue. On the west side of School Avenue facing the South Yard apartments the plans show a two-way bike lane with rumble strips and pavement markers separating bicycles from cars.

The work likely will happen along School Avenue from Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard south to 15th Street Brown said. Improvements also are in the works for Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and South School Avenue specifically to help cars turn west with their own lane he said.

Work on the South School Avenue changes is tentatively scheduled to start in late 2022 after tenants have moved into the South Yard apartments and the Windgate center is operating.

Industrial activity dominated the area decades ago when the railway ran through the property. Over time the industrial uses faded and the city rezoned the property to allow today's proposed land uses said Jonathan Curth city development services director.

Development varies widely along School Avenue from Dollar General to Farmers Table Cafe to Vaughn Battery Co. and City Lumber Co. Several properties are undeveloped or being redeveloped Curth said. Major projects such as the ones from Specialized Real Estate and the university could serve as catalysts for new and even more varied development he said.

""We use infrastructure as a way of pushing development in certain places"" he said of the city. ""We built a trail running through the South Yard project site and they definitely sought to incorporate that as an amenity to the project. I think that complements a lot of what's going on down there.""

According to a 2021 study by Caring.com 67.1 percent of U.S. adults don’t have a will.

The study does show however that more young people have a will — and interest in estate planning has especially increased among young people during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The number of young adults with a will in the 2021 study increased by 63 percent from those surveyed in 2020. For the first time adults younger than 35 years were more likely to have a will than those ages 35-54. According to the study 18-34 year-olds are now 16% more likely to have a will than those in the 35-54 age group.

In addition to a will it’s also important to update health care power of attorney and directives funeral wishes bank and credit card accounts life insurance pensions and retirement accounts especially 401(k) accounts from previous jobs said Ted Rossman senior industry analyst for Creditcards.com and Bankrate.com.

“It is tremendously important to the surviving spouse and children. It’s hard to unwind all of these accounts” he said including social media.

Places to notify

After a death there are so many places to notify but start with the Social Security Administration. Funeral homes usually report it but call 800-772-1213 to discuss death benefits. Social Security will notify Medicare. You should still contact Medicare however to disenroll the deceased member and stop any premiums that may be associated with the account..

Contact the credit bureaus to ensure your loved one doesn’t become the victim of identity theft such as someone using their name to open new credit. Also notify creditors. If you contact one of the three major credit bureaus they share with the others.

Each has slightly different guidelines but have a copy of the death certificate the person’s legal name Social Security number date of birth and death and name and address for the surviving spouse or executor.

Equifax: Equifax Information Services LLC P.O. Box 105139 Atlanta GA 30348-5139.

Don’t close accounts

Don’t be too quick to close credit accounts as it can hurt your good credit score. Your score can affect auto and home insurance rates.

If you were not on a joint credit card (most issuers make one person primary and the other an authorized user) the account will be closed if you were not the primary account holder.

Check your credit reports. Everyone is entitled to one free credit report a year from each of the credit bureaus. These are different than the “free” reports many of the bureaus themselves offer but those are usually tied to paying for a credit monitor’s service.

Go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 877-322-8228. You must disclose your Social Security number to verify your identity. A credit freeze still allows you to get your report.

Also here is information from the U.S. Postal service on how to stop or forward mail that is sent to the deceased. www.usps.com/manage/mail-for-deceased.htm

Don’t be too quick to close or take your deceased spouse’s name off your joint bank account. There may be checks that still come written out to your deceased love one and you will not be able to deposit or cash them if the name is no longer on the account. After my father passed away the bank advised us to keep his name on the account for a year or until we were sure there would be no other checks coming from various accounts after his death.

Here’s some additional advice from Summit County Probate Judge Elinore Marsh Stormer: She advises closing down accounts within 13 months of the date of someone’s death.

“There's nothing wrong with letting things settle. First of all no one needs to rush down and close things down within weeks of someone dying. You have the difficulty of dealing with the emotional loss. We don’t advise people to make dramatic changes within weeks.”

Utility accounts

Ohio Edison: The electric utility asks the spouse or loved one to notify customer service of the death at 800-686-3421. If the surviving spouse is willing to accept the responsibility the account number will not change and the account will be placed in the surviving spouse’s name. If the deceased spouse had multiple accounts(common for landlords and business owners) the surviving spouse will be required to open new accounts with new account numbers.

Dominion Energy Ohio: The surviving spouse is asked to establish a new account. If the old account was with a marketer or aggregation program contact the supplier. It’s possible the supplier would not extend the same price. If the previous account was on the Standard Choice Offer (SCO) the new account would also be on the SCO unless the customer chooses something else.

Line work is some of the most hazardous in America as workers face electrocution burns and risk of falling from climbing poles under buzzing high voltage lines. It was the nation's 10th most lethal job in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics — but also is lucrative. The average wage for crews in 2020 was $35 an hour according to federal data and is roughly the same in South Carolina per a check of online job sites.

“It’s one of the most dangerous jobs in the world and it’s so important that they are consistently trained in how to operate the system” said Keller Kissam president of electric operations for Cayce-based Dominion South Carolina.

The pandemic cut into the company's ability to hire those front-line workers Kissam said.

""The pandemic impacted our ability to conduct in-person interviews which are essential to assessing aptitude and other skills that are critical to performing the demanding work of a lineman. We’re pleased that we’re now in the process of filling the 25 positions we need to return our lineman staffing level to normal at just over 400"" he said.

The training at Dominion Energy’s 37-acre complex behind Lake Murray includes more than 40 students from the Lexington Two and Lexington Three school districts taking construction and fabrication classes.

Since the beginning of the year students there have already built three structures with materials provided by the utility as part of a model neighborhood that allows workers to train on residential and commercial electrical systems that are crafted to fit Dominion’s specifications.

Dominion serves 1.5 million customers statewide with electricity and gas along 42000 miles of power and gas lines according to its company profile. Its Midlands training center also works with municipal power companies moving about 100 electricians and linemen through the facility annually.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZGF2aWRibGFja21vbi8yMDIxLzA2LzE5L3JlbmV3YWJsZS1uYXR1cmFsLWdhcy1zZXQtZm9yLWRpc3J1cHRpdmUtZ3Jvd3RoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Renewable Natural Gas Set For Disruptive Growth,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2021/06/19/renewable-natural-gas-set-for-disruptive-growth/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZGF2aWRibGFja21vbi8yMDIxLzA2LzE5L3JlbmV3YWJsZS1uYXR1cmFsLWdhcy1zZXQtZm9yLWRpc3J1cHRpdmUtZ3Jvd3RoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbWluaW9ucG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8yMC9lbmVyZ3ktZXhwcmVzcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Energy Express’,"WVU Today

Children and families can tune in this summer to West Virginia Public Broadcasting to engage in interactive programming through West Virginia University Extension Service’s “Energy Express.” The six-week summer television program will be hosted by Joel Brown and broadcast across West Virginia beginning today.

The 30-minute episodes will air at 9 a.m. Monday-Friday and feature activities in literacy STEM art cooking nature and nutrition.

Last year WVU Extension Service and WVPB teamed up to bring educational programming to homes to offset the many in-person events canceled due to the pandemic. The show which features WVU faculty staff and special guests complemented virtual programming with educational activities children could enjoy from their homes.

“WVU Extension Service has strong programming available for youths including 4-H and Energy Express our summer reading and nutrition program” WVU Dean of Extension and Engagement Jorge Atiles said. “This partnership with West Virginia Public Broadcasting allows us to expand that programming to children and families throughout West Virginia in a fun and engaging way. Our faculty and staff also enjoy the opportunity to connect with viewers and share their expertise.”

Viewers can expect to meet interesting animals and insects; learn how to make healthy snacks and meals; engage in physical activity; participate in STEM activities; showcase their artistic side; learn about gardening; and much more as part of the six-week series.

WVPB Executive Director Chuck Roberts said partnering with WVU Extension Service to add Energy Express to WVPB’s lineup is a continuation of public broadcasting’s efforts to give access to exceptional at-home learning resources to the Mountain State’s children.

“Energy Express is an engaging program and our young viewers really responded to it last year” Roberts said. “The pandemic has been such a challenge for students. So many families in West Virginia simply don’t have access to the high-speed internet needed for quality virtual learning but most homes do have televisions. All of us here at WVPB are so pleased to provide free access to unique educational experiences such as Energy Express for all children regardless of where they live and what kind of equipment and connectivity they have.”

WVPB is available on many cable systems throughout the Mountain State as well as over the air. To view Energy Express segments online visit energyexpress.wvu.edu.

Each summer WVU Extension Service’s Energy Express reading program pairs children with caring AmeriCorps members and other volunteers who work with them in person to improve reading and comprehension using books journals art STEM games and other activities. Through the partnership with WVPB Energy Express on-air programming provides greater access to literacy and other learning activities for children and families statewide.

And it would have stood—or rather lain—four feet underground as a 1700-mile steel monument to humanity’s triumph over the forces that at the time seemed to threaten the future of an oil-driven economy. Conventional oil reservoirs might be running out and alarms might be sounding over the damage that carbon dioxide pollution was doing to the atmosphere but the Keystone XL pipeline would show America’s determination to carve out ever new oil corridors.

At least that’s how it looked in 2008 when TransCanada and its partners announced plans to forge a $7 billion link between Alberta’s tar sands and the Texas Gulf Coast. By the time the company now known as TC Energy announced earlier this month that it was giving up the effort to build the pipeline it was clear that oil could not so easily conquer the realities of the 21st century.

The 13-year fight over Keystone XL transformed the U.S. environmental movement and dramatically shifted the political center of the American debate over energy and climate change. Instead of trying to get people to care about the future impact of a gas—carbon dioxide—that they couldn’t smell or see environmentalists began focusing on the connection between climate change and the here-and-now effects of fossil fuel dependence: the takeover of land; the risk to air and water; and the injustice to those in the path of the fossil fuel industry’s plans. President Barack Obama’s presidency was a barometer of this change. Early on his administration seemed poised to approve Keystone XL. Near the end of his second term Obama became the first world leader to block a major U.S. oil infrastructure project over climate change.

But as Keystone XL’s brief revival under President Donald Trump demonstrated the battle over oil’s future is far from over. Climate activists are pushing for President Joe Biden to stop Line 3 another Canadian tar sands pipeline now under construction in Minnesota. But the larger issue for the climate action movement is whether the United States can enact a comprehensive policy that truly reshapes energy use as Biden has pledged to do phasing out dependence on oil and its imprint on the American landscape.

‘Drill Baby Drill’

TransCanada announced its plan to build the Keystone XL in July 2008. In the oil and gas industry’s view it seemed impeccable timing coinciding with a surging oil market. The price of crude soared past $140 a barrel that month; no one knew at the time that the record price was a peak the market would never hit again. It seemed like the world was entering an era of sustained high oil prices that would pump nothing but profit out of the energy-intensive production of thick sticky bitumen from the sandy soil of remote Alberta.

Politically a proposal to double the amount of Canadian oil coming into the United States also seemed well-timed. Even though both candidates for the 2008 presidential election said they favored action on climate change there was no talk of it on the campaign trail or in debates. A bill to cut U.S. carbon emissions died in the Senate that summer with neither Republican John McCain nor Democrat Barack Obama showing up to vote. People were worried about high gasoline prices. The chant that shook the rafters at the Republican convention was “Drill Baby Drill.”

But the timing of TransCanada’s project also made the pipeline a perfect target for a ferocious backlash against both the fossil fuel industry and government inaction on climate change.

After Obama won the election and Democrats gained control of Congress there was at first little sign that Keystone XL was in trouble certainly not over its climate impact. International climate talks in Copenhagen in 2009 failed to yield an agreement. And with Obama’s House-passed climate bill foundering in the Senate the president sought to win support from moderate Democrats by making concessions on oil. In early April 2010 he announced a plan to reverse a long-standing ban on offshore drilling on the Atlantic coast. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s department then released a draft environmental impact statement that seemed to clear the way for Keystone XL concluding that its environmental impact would be “limited.”

Five days later BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded. And over the next 87 days more than 200 million gallons of oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico threatening ecosystems and the fishing and coastal economies in what is regarded as the worst accidental marine oil spill in the history of the oil and gas industry. An orange sheen on the water tar balls washing up on beaches and oiled pelicans provided vivid evidence that despite its claims to safety the oil industry made mistakes and took shortcuts. And its plans for controlling a catastrophe were inadequate.

While the Deepwater Horizon well was still gushing another historic U.S. oil disaster began to unfold that got less attention but had even more relevance to Keystone XL. More than 1 million gallons of diluted Canadian bitumen spilled into a tributary of the Kalamazoo River from a ruptured pipeline in Marshall Michigan. The heavy oil didn’t float as conventional oil would; it sank to the river bottom fouling 36 miles of the river and forcing 150 families permanently from their homes. The pipeline company Enbridge never informed federal officials of the complexity of handling heavy oil. It became the costliest inland oil spill in U.S. history with a clean-up price tag of more than $1 billion.

The Kalamazoo spill was a turning point for ranchers and other landowners in the path of the Keystone XL as Sue Kelso of Oklahoma told Inside Climate News in 2012. “I live in fear that this pipeline will go through and ruin all the water” she said at the time. Kelso took TransCanada to court to fight its effort to obtain a pipeline easement on her family farm using eminent domain. Scores of ranchers and other landowners followed suit.

The fear and anger of landowners on the Keystone XL corridor was mounting at the precise moment that climate activists were confronting the strength of the forces lined up against them in Washington D.C. Obama failed to push the Democratic-controlled Congress to act on climate and the window of opportunity shut when Republicans regained control over the House in the 2010 midterms. “The environmental movement was in a dismal place following years of failed inside-the-beltway strategy” Bob Wilson a Syracuse University geographer who studies the environmental movement recalled several years ago.

Climate activists needed a new game plan and they looked to the indigenous tribes and conservative ranching communities of the Great Plains who were fighting Keystone XL.

Building a Sense of Trust

No one did more to build common cause between local communities and environmental groups than Jane Kleeb a professional organizer who had moved to Nebraska to raise a family. She founded a group Bold Nebraska that did more than lobby litigate and protest. It planned creative events to connect citizens from diverse cultural and political backgrounds—a renewable energy barn-raising a large crop art project and a Harvest of Hope concert held on a family farm and featuring Willie Nelson and Neil Young. Defying the historic tension between ranchers and Native American tribes in northern Nebraska Bold Nebraska helped forge a Cowboy Indian Alliance (CIA) to fight a common foe—Keystone XL.

“We had this responsibility and sense of trust with one another so that the tactics of divide and conquer that they normally would use never worked on this fight” said Kleeb. “We helped change the face of what an environmentalist or climate activist looks like. You had people who were directly impacted by the pain or potential consequences of these projects coming forward being the ones to speak out rather than kind of highly educated you know more coastal environmentalists.”

Environmentalists changed their methods too. This August will mark the 10th anniversary of the first of a series of sit-ins against Keystone XL at the White House organized by environmental author-turned-activist Bill McKibben and the organization he co-founded 350.org. More than 1250 people were arrested including McKibben climate scientist James Hansen and Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune who ended the group’s 120-year prohibition against acts of civil disobedience.

“This particular project—Keystone XL pipeline—is so horrendous it’s so wrong and it’s being proposed at such an important time that we don’t want to leave any tool on the table” Brune said at the time.

Little by little the Obama administration changed course. In 2015 the Environmental Protection Agency calculated that the energy required to process tar sands oil and transport it through Keystone XL would generate 1.3 billion more tons of greenhouse gas emissions over the pipeline’s 50-year lifespan than if it were carrying conventional crude. In November 2015 on the eve of Paris climate talks where Obama hoped to seal his legacy with a landmark global deal to cut carbon emissions he rejected the Keystone XL as counter to the role of the United States as a global climate leader.

“Once the grass-roots movement on the Keystone pipeline mobilized it changed what it meant to the president” presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told The New York Times. “It went from a routine infrastructure project to the symbol of an era.”

Beyond the Keystone XL

The Keystone XL battle spawned other pipeline showdowns altering the U.S. political landscape with results that are still unfolding. Young activists visited the protest site in North Dakota where the Standing Rock Sioux tribe faced off against the Dakota Access pipeline in 2016. Among them was a former Bernie Sanders campaigner Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who was inspired by the experience to run for office herself under the banner of environmental justice and climate action.

Dakota Access was completed one of the few accomplishments of Trump’s drive to accelerate oil and gas infrastructure. But a judge ruled that Trump illegally sidestepped environmental review of the project which is now in the Biden administration’s hands. In the face of unrelenting local opposition and low energy prices Williams Company an energy firm canceled a planned natural gas pipeline in New York State and Dominion Energy withdrew its plan for a pipeline cutting across the Appalachian Trail in Virginia.

As for Keystone XL it was stalled by litigation throughout the Trump administration and the economics also went south. With oil prices half of what they were in 2008 and banks and investors pulling out of Canadian tar sands projects TC Energy was relying on the Alberta government for financing and loan guarantees. The pipeline was only 8 percent built when Biden canceled its border-crossing permit on his first day in office.

But even as pipelines were blocked frackers were tapping new stores of oil in the shale rock beneath West Texas North Dakota and New Mexico. Over the 13-year battle over Keystone XL the United States regained its spot as the leading oil producer in a world that is on track to consume a record 101 million barrels of crude per day by next year.

Beyond the Keystone XL Biden has sought to avoid getting pulled into pipeline battles. Instead he has pursued what one analyst described as a “demand-side” policy: seeking to lay the groundwork for a clean energy future that would dry up demand for oil. To meet Biden’s Paris climate agreement pledge of cutting U.S. carbon emissions in half by 2030 an estimated half of new cars sold would by then have to be electric.

But Biden’s climate plan including the funding of an electric vehicle charging network and other infrastructure essential for a clean energy future is facing roadblocks in an evenly and deeply divided Congress. And while that inside-the-beltway fight continues hundreds of climate activists are chaining themselves to construction equipment in Minnesota seeking to stop Enbridge from replacing an aging Canadian tar sands pipeline. They are calling on Biden to withdraw Enbridge’s permits for Line 3 just as he did for Keystone XL without waiting for policy that one day in theory will eliminate the need for oil pipelines.

“Biden has to make an aggressive step in saying if we’re going to hit these climate change goals that we’ve set out that means we cannot continue to build fossil fuel projects” said Kleeb.

But she said she worries about division. With her voice breaking she recalled a confrontation at a bar in Minnesota between her group of climate and tribal activists and a huddle of local residents. Her group began to leave the bar but Kleeb turned around and went back. “Knowing what I just spent a decade doing in Nebraska I can’t leave with them thinking that we’re these out-of-touch liberal elites and not know why we’re fighting this pipeline” she said. The evening ended with laughter and high-fives she said after some discussion of eminent domain and foreign tar sands oil crossing their state to head for export markets.

Kleeb said she feels that not enough time has been spent building bridges between the activist and rural communities. And she thinks that’s a lesson for Biden and the larger drive for a clean energy transition which would require the build-out of renewable energy in red states.

“A lot of people are very skeptical of corporations pushing wind and solar because they haven’t been treated well and they haven’t really been engaged in the conversations around climate” Kleeb said. “So there’s a lot of work to do.”

Both Dow and Braskem are greening their operations including incorporating rail into their supply chains to reduce their carbon footprint.

Whether we consciously realize it or not plastics are an inextricable part of our daily lives. Stop for a moment to think of some of the common items you use every day that are made of plastic: a water bottle a grocery bag the container you store leftovers in. And then there are the less obvious but still common uses like parts for computers and cars and hospital equipment or your glasses your cell phone and even your clothing. While it’s clear plastics play an important role in our everyday lives what people might not know is that plastics actually play a role in improving sustainability — as do the companies that produce them. To demonstrate how two plastics producers Dow and Braskem share how they’re envisioning — and creating — a more sustainable future for the planet.

The Role of Plastics in Sustainability

How do plastics play a role in creating a greener world? Geoffrey Inch Circular Economy & Sustainability Director North America for Braskem the largest petrochemical company in the Americas and the world's leading biopolymer producer explains it as such: “Innovations in plastics are essential for enabling society to raise living standards and to advance sustainability through products that avoid waste and increase efficiency. For this reason plastics are widely recognized as playing a crucial role in delivering a more sustainable future” he said. “Along with innovation our Circular Economy Strategy will continue to aggressively progress projects in mechanical and advanced molecular recycling and we are working with our recycling partners to address the issue of plastic waste.”

Jacqueline Faseler Global Director Supply Chain Sustainability and Compliance at materials science company Dow one of the three largest materials science companies in the world says there is a careful balance between using plastic to make the world a better place and keeping a close eye on harmful plastic waste.

“We strongly believe that plastic is an indispensable material for the world’s consumers and a vital part of our journey toward a low-carbon future. Lightweight plastic provides growing populations around the world with greater access to fresh foods safe drinking water and medicines. It dramatically reduces food spoilage and waste while also providing hygienic materials for the health care industry. That translates directly into approximately four times lower environmental cost in the supply chain plus a better more affordable and healthier quality of life for billions of people” she said. “At the same time we are facing an unacceptable consequence: Too much plastic is lost to waste and is entering our oceans clogging up our rivers and polluting our natural environment. This cannot continue. At Dow we’re working with our partners to eliminate this plastic waste.”

Setting Sustainability Goals

While Dow and Braskem are creating innovative materials that promote sustainability they have also set some ambitious sustainability goals and are making solid strides toward accomplishing them.

For both companies sustainability goals fall under three overarching categories: reducing emissions and working toward carbon neutrality reducing plastic waste and creating a circular economy.

At Dow setting sustainability goals isn’t new. The company launched its first set of decade-long sustainability-related goals in 1995 and the second followed in 2005. Together these first two generations of goals delivered $6 billion in combined economic savings. In April of 2015 the company launched the third era of sustainability goals which they aim to achieve by 2025. These include:

“At Dow we have long been — and remain — committed to applying science expertise to create sustainable solutions to some of the world’s greatest challenges. We have made significant advancements since launching our first set of decade-long sustainability-related goals in 1995” Faseler said. “Dow’s seven 2025 Sustainability Goals seek to advance the well-being of humanity by helping lead the transition to a sustainable planet and society — maximizing economic environmental and societal value.”

On top of the seven sustainability goals in June 2020 Dow announced new long-term targets that are intended to help the company lead its industry toward carbon neutrality and a world without plastic waste. These include:

Protect the Climate: By 2030 Dow will reduce its net annual carbon emissions by 5 million metric tons or 15% from the 2020 baseline.

By 2030 Dow will reduce its net annual carbon emissions by 5 million metric tons or 15% from the 2020 baseline. Stop the Waste: By 2030 Dow will enable 1 million metric tons of plastic to be collected reused or recycled through direct actions and partnerships.

By 2030 Dow will enable 1 million metric tons of plastic to be collected reused or recycled through direct actions and partnerships. Close the Loop: By 2035 Dow will enable 100% of Dow products sold into packaging applications will be reusable or recyclable.

“Climate change and plastic waste are among the greatest technical social and economic issues the world has ever faced. Dow products and technology are critical to addressing both” Faseler said. “We recognize the goals we’ve laid out are ambitious. Our efforts start and end with our people. Cross-functional cross-geography and cross-business teams are working on our sustainability goals and targets. We leverage our unique technology capabilities and expertise innovation mindset and commitment to building a sustainable planet and society — then apply the passion of our employees — to help promote relevant long-term change for communities and address global challenges.”

Braskem has also set impactful sustainability goals. In 2009 the company launched its long-term sustainability goals for 2020 which emphasized Braskem's commitment to providing solutions that address climate change. The following year Braskem introduced its portfolio of I'm greenTM products which are sourced from renewable sources and recycled content. Because these products are made from renewable resources the production process captures carbon dioxide helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. During that same period the company reduced the intensity of carbon emissions from its operations by 20 percent.

In 2018 Braskem further committed to 100% of plastic packaging being reused recycled or recovered by 2040 and in 2020 Braskem announced additional commitments to mitigate climate change eliminate plastic waste and provide solutions for recycled products in its markets. These goals include:

By 2025 expand the I'm green TM portfolio to include sales of 300000 tons of recycled content products per year.

portfolio to include sales of 300000 tons of recycled content products per year. By 2030 continue to expand the I'm green TM portfolio to include sales of 1 million tons of recycled content products per year

portfolio to include sales of 1 million tons of recycled content products per year By 2030 work to divert 1.5 million tons of plastic waste away from incineration landfill or the environment.

By 2030 deliver a 15 percent reduction in carbon emissions from Braskem operations.

By 2050 achieve carbon neutrality for Braskem's global operations.

“Sustainability has been part of Braskem’s DNA since its inception in 2002” Inch said. “Braskem has always been committed to the betterment of the world around us and we are dedicated to finding industry leading solutions that drive us towards a more sustainable future.”

Taking Action

It’s one thing to set goals but without action those targets don’t mean much. Dow and Braskem aren’t just talking the talk — they are blazing a trail toward being more environmentally responsible companies.

Specific actions Dow is taking to address climate protection include:

Taking a comprehensive approach. “One way we do this is by building on the progress we’ve made to date by optimizing current manufacturing assets” Faseler explained.

“One way we do this is by building on the progress we’ve made to date by optimizing current manufacturing assets” Faseler explained. Increasing renewables in the company’s purchased power mix. Doing so has already contributed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent in the past 15 years. Dow is also the leading purchaser of renewable energy in its industry and is in the top 15 among global companies.

Doing so has already contributed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent in the past 15 years. Dow is also the leading purchaser of renewable energy in its industry and is in the top 15 among global companies. Implementing transitional technologies like the installation of FCDh to produce on-purpose propylene. “This technology is reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20% in a mixed-feed cracker in Louisiana” Faseler said.

Dow is also taking steps to keep plastic out of the environment including:

Investing in key technologies. Faseler said this includes advanced recycling technologies that will help the world recycle far more than we do today and to use more recycled materials. “We are participating in infrastructure projects that enable global plastic recycling such as working with partners to construct polymer-modified asphalt roads with post-consumer recycled plastic” Faseler said. “This includes actions such as our partnership with Mura Technology to scale new advanced recycling technologies in which we expect will add an additional 1 million metric tonnes of recycling capacity by 2025. Additionally we are investing in mechanical recycling and offering recycled plastics as part of our product portfolio globally.”

Additionally we are investing in mechanical recycling and offering recycled plastics as part of our product portfolio globally.” Focusing on creating a circular world. Dow is working with customers and partners to demonstrate that a circular world is not that far out of reach. Using its RecycleReady materials and expertise Dow has helped brands like Kellogg’s Kashi Bear Naked Granola transform the packaging of their products to make them fully recyclable.

Dow is working with customers and partners to demonstrate that a circular world is not that far out of reach. Using its RecycleReady materials and expertise Dow has helped brands like Kellogg’s Kashi Bear Naked Granola transform the packaging of their products to make them fully recyclable. Global collaboration. Dow brings together customers brand owners governments waste management companies and environmental organizations to collaborate on solutions to keep plastic out of the environment. For instance Dow is a founding member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (as is Braskem) a partnership that in only two years has already committed to more than 20 infrastructure innovation and clean-up projects in 13 countries across the regions of Asia Africa and Latin America.

Faseler said continuing to effect change will require a collaborative forward-thinking approach. “To achieve carbon neutrality we’ll also need solutions that haven’t been designed yet. We need not just step-change technology — we need step-change thinking” she said. “It will take all of us coming to the table with an open mind to find the solutions we need to address a complex value chain. However creating solutions to navigate these generational challenges is what Dow does best.”

Braskem’s strategy for achieving carbon neutrality focuses on three pillars:

Reducing emissions. Braskem’s efforts to reduce emissions concentrate on improving energy efficiency in the company’s existing operations as well as the increased use of low-carbon and renewable energy in its current operations. Braskem is also placing a continued focus on exploring and investing in new low-carbon intensity process technologies.

In the area of offsetting emissions Braskem plans to focus on accelerating the company’s investments in renewable chemicals and polymers.

Braskem's efforts to capture emissions are being supported through the research and development of opportunities in using CO2 emissions as feedstock for conversion to value-added chemicals.

Like Dow Braskem is also placing a focus on transitioning to a circular economy. The company's Circular Economy Strategy will continue to aggressively progress projects in mechanical and advanced molecular recycling. Braskem also plans to continue leveraging its market leadership polymer expertise and strong track record of growth in sustainability to develop a robust portfolio of recycled products for its clients.

Inch agrees with Faseler that changing the plastics recycling landscape requires teamwork. “In order to transform the recycling system Braskem is working collaboratively with others to increase recycling access develop innovative technologies and scale the recycling infrastructure needed to increase collection and recovery of post-use plastic” he said. “Together we must educate communities on the value of recycling plastics develop robust end markets to secure demand for recycled materials and promote technologies that allow for higher-quality recycled materials. Braskem’s founding membership in organizations such as The Recycling Partnership’s Polypropylene Recycling Coalition the Alliance to End Plastic Waste and Cyclyx are only a few examples of how we are working together with others to address these challenges.”

Leveraging Environmentally Responsible Transportation

Dow and Braskem’s transportation choices are environmentally minded as well. By shipping plastics via rail they are utilizing the most environmentally responsible way to ship freight by land.

“Rail is a safe reliable and sustainable mode that we take advantage of as much as possible” Faseler said. “Each shipping mode has its function/purpose in the order fulfillment process. Rail has an advantage over other modes where we see larger order volumes and longer distances. It has proven to be a highly reliable mode of transportation to destinations having the capability of receiving rail. Rail is an important part of Dow sustainability efforts due to the low emissions and positive carbon impact.”

On average railroads are three to four times more fuel efficient than trucks on a ton-mile basis. Railroads can move one ton of freight more than 480 miles on a single gallon of fuel generating a carbon footprint up to 75% less than trucks.

This difference adds up. According to Union Pacific Railroad’s Carbon Emission Estimator if a company shipped 50000 truckloads of plastics from Dallas Texas to Los Angeles California by train instead it would reduce that company’s carbon footprint by 79330 metric tonnes.

This reduction in the carbon footprint would be equivalent to:

The carbon removed by 16897 acres of U.S. forests

The carbon removed by 2030848 tree seedlings grown for 10 years

Greenhouse gas emissions avoided by recycling 27607 tons of waste instead of sending it to the landfill.

According to the Association of American Railroads (AAR) Freight Railroads & Climate Change Report:

Railroads account for 40% of U.S. freight but only 2.1% of U.S. transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions

On a gross ton-miles per gallon basis rail fuel efficiency in 2019 was up 82% since 1980 and up 17% since 2000.

If 10% of the freight shipped by the largest trucks were moved by rail instead greenhouse gas emissions would fall by more than 17 million tons annually. That’s the equivalent of removing 3.35 million cars from our highways or planting 260 million trees.

Railroads are doing their part to support sustainability too and are committed to addressing climate change. All seven Class I Railroads in North America are participating in the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) an international collaboration focused on limiting global warming to less than two degrees Celsius and continue to invest in sustainable technology. For instance Union Pacific is improving freight car designs and leveraging fuel-efficient locomotives that reduce energy consumption pollution and greenhouse gas emissions which means they’re green and getting greener.

“Many of our clients receive material by rail. While the current recycled material market is smaller than virgin production the market for recycled materials is growing” Inch said. “Many of our clients have recycled content goals and with Braskem’s growth in recycled materials we intend to scale up volumes over the next few years. Recyclers and producers with access to rail will allow for the efficient delivery of recycled materials as the transition to a circular economy continues.”

As the volume of recycled plastic resin increases it will be important for plastics producers to use an environmentally responsible way to ship it in order to effectively meet their sustainability targets. In order to scale up the recycling process transporting by rail throughout the circular economy — from waste collecting to recycling manufacturing and consumer buying — will be essential to achieve the economies of scale. Currently the global demand for recycled plastic resin is projected to be 77mm tons by 2030. That’s the equivalent of 902900 rail cars or 3.6 million trucks. Because rail magnifies carbon emission savings by up to 4 times shipping these products by rail instead of truck presents a sizeable opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Building a Culture of Sustainability

On top of making progress toward their respective sustainability goals Dow and Braskem also actively work toward building a culture of sustainability both within and outside of their organizations.

“Sustainability is infused throughout our company culture in how we make decisions run our businesses and operations and innovate new products” Faseler said. For example Dow has sustainability leaders embedded within each business and function to proactively identify market- and customer-specific opportunities. Grassroot communities of practice have been formed around the world — groups that connect on Recycling Sustainable Innovation Circular Economy Valuing Nature and more. And Dow’s #PullingOurWeight environmental cleanups which engage employees customers suppliers and communities in addressing plastic pollution are the largest volunteer effort in Dow’s history. “We are doing our part to help keep plastic waste out of the environment and support the transition to a circular economy for a cleaner environment and a better world” Faseler said.

Braskem is also doing its part to build a culture of sustainability. The company engages with the community through the company’s Private Social Investment strategy which is guided by four pillars: STEM Education Circular Economy and Sustainability (CE&S) Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) and Health Environment and Safety (HES).

One such program is the Philadelphia Eagles Sustainability Partnership. This partnership includes the development of a recycling program for bottle caps and other plastic products as well as an online education platform for 30 schools in Philadelphia to teach students about career opportunities in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) that’s inspiring the next generation of STEM leaders.

“Our Private Social Investments seek to maximize the positive social impact resulting from our performance contributing to the sustainable development of the communities where we operate and society as a whole” Inch said. “We understand our role in society and seek to act as agents of transformation. We believe it is our duty to contribute to the development of regions where we operate generating shared value and well-being to all. In this way we seek to strengthen the relationship with the communities around our operations through dialogue and transparency.”

Envisioning a Sustainable Future

Thanks to the work Dow and Braskem have done and will continue to do a more sustainable future is possible even in the face of what may seem like uphill battles.

“Challenges such as climate change environmental waste water scarcity and loss of biodiversity continue to worsen and businesses are realizing that we need to do more to address them. In fact sustainability promises to be the business disrupter of this decade” Faseler said. “We believe a sustainable future is attainable but only if we all come together to drive forward science- and technology-based solutions to address global challenges.”

The blue-chip Dow and the benchmark S&P 500 started the week at record closing levels but ultimately fell by their most in any week since late October and late February respectively.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq index also closed lower despite posting its two highest ever finishes in the last five days.

Investor confidence in their existing positions was initially dinged by the Fed’s policy meeting where it projected interest rate hikes would happen sooner than anticipated and signaled it was reaching the point where it could begin talking about tapering its massive stimulus — as opposed to just thinking about it.

This was compounded by Bullard president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve saying yesterday he was among the seven officials who saw rate increases beginning next year to contain inflation.

Inflation and how the US central bank will tackle it as the country comes out of the pandemic had been front-and-centre of investors’ minds in the run-up to the policy meeting which ended on Wednesday.

“I’m not surprised to see the market sell off a little bit. I’m never surprised given the strong run we’ve had for such a long period of time when you see some periods of profit-taking” said Tim Ghriskey chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.

The CBOE volatility index Wall Street’s fear gauge closed yesterday at a four-week high.

“Next week you will have various Fed governors give speeches and we’ll have the same thing: some governors will be more hawkish and some will be more dovish so you’ll see some back-and-forth” Ghriskey added.

Yesterday the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 533.37 points or 1.58 per cent to 33290.08 the S&P 500 lost 55.41 points or 1.31 per cent to 4166.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 130.97 points or 0.92 per cent to 14030.38.

The US dollar strengthened after Bullard’s comments pushing the index which tracks the greenback against six major currencies to its highest level since mid-April.

While US crude prices — which traditionally suffer from a strong dollar — initially fell yesterday they rebounded after Opec sources said the producer group expected limited US oil output growth this year.

The upward commodity move didn’t translate into positive sentiment for US energy stocks with the sector’s index the worst performer on the day. The utilities and financials indexes also fell by more than 2 per cent.

Friday was also “quadruple witching day” the quarterly simultaneous expiration of US options and futures contracts. It was the largest options expiration in history noted Randy Frederick vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab.

Two new kid-centric parks across Escambia County should do the trick.

A years-in-the-making upgrade at Legion Park on the city's west side recently opened after being closed for construction since August though an official ribbon cutting event will take place June 26.

The park on Gregory and G Streets has new football facilities a new playground solar lighting with a walking track and a splash pad.

Tanyard dog park:New dog park is coming to the Tanyard neighborhood. Some residents plan to fight it

""The splash pad is already open and it's mania out there kids are loving it"" said Brian Cooper director of the city of Pensacola's Parks and Recreation Department. ""There are brand new shaded bleachers for the visiting teams and a fitness court that was installed a couple of years ago that's part of this overhaul.""

The Santa Rosa Island Authority will hold its own ribbon cutting soon for a new playground just north of the boardwalk on Pensacola Beach often referred to as ""mom's beach.""

The playground has tube slides regular slides flower spinners bongos and is completely shaded near the picnic pavilions and restrooms.

""The new amenity is a perfect addition to the island offering a shore-side activity immediately adjacent to bay-side water access"" SRIA Director Leigh Davis said in a statement. ""It's a perfect spot for anyone with young kids.""

The playground is on the sound side of the beach which provides more calm shallow water for young kids to play in and it marks the fourth playground for the beach. Others are located at Harry Gowens Park Crowley Park and Park West.

Another upgraded park — the Hitzman-Optimist Park on Langley Avenue — will open late next month with new soccer facilities a walking park and a dog park according to Cooper. That park is still under construction.

The ribbon cutting for the Pensacola Beach playground will be at 4 p.m. Wednesday and the ribbon cutting event at Legion Field will be held from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. June 26.

Here’s how things will play out after a heated confrontation takes a deadly turn.

DOOL fans know Xander already tried to help Gwen out with her Dr. Snyder problem. Xander used intimidation tactics on the doc but they weren’t very effective.

Dr. Snyder didn’t seem scared of Xander and immediately called Gwen in hopes of forcing her to make Xander back off.

At this point Dr. Snyder seems to view Xander as more of a nuisance than anything. That’s why Dr. Snyder will continue to threaten Gwen and push her to make his drug deliveries.

Xander won’t be pleased when he realizes Dr. Snyder is still stirring up trouble. Days spoilers say Xander will find Dr. Snyder lashing out at Gwen so look for Xander to take matters into his own hands.

After Xander puts Dr. Snyder in a chokehold he’ll lose control of the situation – and the result will be Dr. Snyder’s death!

Xander and Gwen will soon discover they’ve got a dead body on their hands so they’ll have to figure out their next move. Before they can do that Julie will waltz in and wonder what’s up.

Julie will apparently spot Dr. Snyder’s body on the floor and demand to know what the heck is going on.

However Julie hasn’t been happy with Jack’s choice of houseguests lately so that’s something Gwen and Xander can use in their favor. They’ll sell the idea that one of Jack’s drunk friends wound up passing out there so Julie will probably think that’s so typical!

Julie will feel like Jack needs to stop parading his neanderthal friends through the Horton house after their nights of debauchery.

It sounds like Julie will easily buy this drunk friend idea so that’ll be one crisis averted. Another one will follow when Jack returns home.

Days spoilers say Gwen and Xander still won’t be rid of their corpse problem so they’ll cover Dr. Snyder with a blanket and hope Jack doesn’t notice.

Xander and Gwen will prop their feet up on Dr. Snyder’s covered body so that’ll help conceal him. They’ll pretend they’re simply chilling out and watching TV – just trying to get along like Jack wanted!

Jack may be so distracted over Gwen and Xander’s newfound harmony that he doesn’t pay much attention to the lumpy blanket down below.

Days spoilers say Xander and Gwen will once again avoid disaster but they’ll still have to figure out a long-term solution for this dead body.

DOOL’s summer promo featured a corpse being found in the lake so it sounds like that’s where Gwen and Xander will end up ditching the evidence. We’ll offer updates as other news becomes available.

DTE Energy crews may have additional work today as storms are moving across Michigan.

A cluster of outages was north of M-59 along Dixie Highway into the Clarkston area according to the DTE Energy Outage Map.

In total 6007 homes and businesses were in the dark north and south of Williams Lake Road and along Airport Road.

The cause of the outages was not listed but the power shut off at about 10:30 a.m. Saturday. Crews restored power at least a couple of hours before initially expected.

RTE Energy outage map 6.19.2021.jpgScreen shot of the DTE Energy Outage Map at about 11 a.m. Saturday June 19.

The early estimate for restoration was 2 p.m. Saturday as of the late morning but the outages were removed from the DTE Energy Outage Map by around noon.

Our top priority at Fermi 2 is the health and safety of the public.

That’s the guiding principle of every person who works at the plant. Why? In short it is our job as nuclear professionals to ensure the safe operation of the plant. It is instilled in every employee at the plant from the first day we arrive on site.

In a nearby editorial anti-nuclear activists are rehashing mistruths that they’ve pushed for decades; they play with facts and numbers to frighten. It’s disheartening and frankly a dishonest attempt to sway public opinion.

Real science has debunked these mistruths repeatedly over the years.

A report from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for instance cited no fewer than six studies by reputable scientific organizations — such as the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society — that prove living near a nuclear power plant has no adverse impact on cancer rates (If you’re reading this in the print edition of the Monroe News just Google: “Tooth Fairy and NRC” to read the report).

That fact is after more than a half-century of radiological monitoring and medical research there is absolutely no evidence linking U.S. nuclear energy plants to negative effects on the health of the public or workers.

At all U.S. nuclear power plants including Fermi radiation is strictly monitored by radiation experts and the NRC which sets limits on exposure for plant workers and the public based on scientific-based data and research.

Here’s the truth: the average American receives about 620 millirem of radiation exposure per year and at most less than one half of one millirem (0.3 millirem) per year from industrial factors. For perspective a person receives about 2.5 millirem exposure on a U.S. coast-to-coast airline flight. Think about it: You receive more than 5 times the radiation exposure flying across the country than you do by living near a nuclear plant.

The bottom line is that Fermi 2 is safe.

I work every day with hundreds of Fermi 2 employees. I’m proud to be their colleague.

The plant we run generates 1205 megawatts of clean safe electricity to communities in southeast Michigan — powering hospitals running air conditioners and keeping the lights on no matter the season or weather. In fact Fermi 2 is the only source of 24/7/365 carbon-free energy in southeast Michigan.

While creating electricity is important to us it is far more important to operate the plant safely.

Fermi employees live in the cities towns and neighborhoods of Monroe County: they raise their families here host barbecues in their backyards fish for walleye in Lake Erie play softball and baseball in our parks and volunteer at local non-profits.

Fermi 2 employees live play dine and recreate here because they know it is safe.

These employees — these Monroe County residents — put the safety of the public above everything else. It is their top priority and it is sacred to them because it means protecting their loved ones and fulfilling their duty as nuclear professionals.

I’m proud of the safety record of our plant and we are honored to safely provide clean and reliable electricity to Monroe County.

EDEN N.C. -- Three people are dead and two others -- including a 7-year-old boy -- are still missing after a group on inflatable tubes went over a Duke Energy dam along the Dan River in Eden North Carolina authorities said.

The Rockingham County Sheriff's office said nine people went tubing Wednesday evening on the Dan River but at some point several of the tubes came untied and some floated over the Duke Energy dam around 7 p.m.

Authorities said a Duke Energy Plant employee called 9-1-1 on Thursday afternoon to report some people may be in danger on the river

Four of the nine were found by construction workers around 3:30 p.m. on Thursday. They were ""hanging onto various items"" according to the construction workers.

.

The rescued tubers were taken to a hospital for treatment.

On Friday authorities identified the survivors as Rueben Villino 35 of Eden his son 14-year-old Eric Villino his daughter 18-year-old Irene Villino and Karlos Villino 14 of LaPorte Indiana.

Three bodies were found Thursday night according to the Rockingham County Emergency Services Director Rodney Cates. Numerous rescue boats and helicopters from the North Carolina Highway Patrol and AirLife out of Virginia joined the search.

The three people found dead were identified as Bridish Crawford 27 of Eden the mother of some of Rueben Villino's children Antonio Ramon 30 of Eden and 14-year-old Sophie Wilson of LaPorte Indiana.

""We're going to stay positive that we can do a rescue rather than a recovery"" Cates said about the two remaining missing tubers. They are looking for 30-year-old Thressa Villino the sister of Rueben Villino and 7-year-old Isiah Crawford who is the son of Crawford.

Officials resumed the search for the two others Friday morning. The investigation runs from Rockingham County all the way to the Virginia borderline.

""We have done both an air and water search at this time. We've had an aircraft that has flown the river. They flew 6 miles into Virginia they came back widened their perimeter and flew the ground area adjacent to the river"" Cates said.

Officials said all the people were related and were visiting family in the area.

Tubing is a ""regular activity"" in the area but people are discouraged to tube near the dam considering there is a ""pretty steep drop"" over the dam authorities told ABC News.

There are warning signs posted on the river near the dam authorities said

Authorities identified the nine people involved in the accident as family members from Eden North Carolina and Indiana. Officials said Friday they remained hopeful that two family members who were still missing would be found alive.

Four were rescued Thursday afternoon after a Duke Energy employee saw them stranded near the dam by the utility's steam station. The bodies of three other family members were found later that day about 3 miles from the dam.

Those rescued were Eden resident Rueben Villano 35 and his two children 14-year-old Eric and 18-year-old Irene along with their relative Karlos Villano 14 of LaPorte.

Officials said they recovered the bodies of Bridish Crawford 27 and Antonio Ramon 30 both of Eden and Sophie Wilson 14 of LaPorte.

Rueben Villano's twin sister 35-year-old Teresa Villano of Eden and Bridish Crawford's son 7-year-old Isiah Crawford remained missing Friday evening.

Rodney Cates Rockingham County's director of Emergency Services said Friday evening that crews were optimistic about the possibilities of finding the two alive saying the search was still considered a rescue not a recovery effort.

Cates said fresh rescue crews including units from High Point and Forsyth County planned to return to the river early Saturday to continue searching for Teresa Villano and Isiah.

""(We) want somebody to look at the water the debris in the water from a new standpoint'' Cates said during a videotaped news conference Friday afternoon. ""Perhaps a new set of eyes could shed light on something so that's why we're remaining optimistic at this time. At this point we're still optimistic we'll do a rescue.''

The family set out sometime on Wednesday on tubes down the Dan River and went over an 8-foot dam near the Duke Energy Steam Station. The water below the dam where the current is strongest is about 3 feet deep said Jeff Brooks a spokesman for Duke Energy.

Cates said the four survivors were discovered near the dam clinging to the tubes in the water and had been there for nearly a full day. They were tired very fatigued and had been ""subjected to the elements for 19 hours'' he said.

None were wearing life jackets at the time they were rescued and it was unclear if anyone in the group was Cates said. Their conditions were not available Friday but he said previously their injuries were not considered life-threatening.

Friday’s search was headquartered at Draper Landing an access point to the Dan River at N.C. 770’s crossing of the river. Cates said two rescue boats were put in at the site early Friday. A helicopter belonging to the Highway Patrol assisted in the search.

The landing is about 2.6 miles north of the site of Wednesday’s accident a dam belonging to Duke Energy. The Dan River flows north about another 10 miles to the Virginia state line before eventually turning south.

Warning signs

Dan Riverkeeper Steven Pulliam of Stoneville said on Friday that he wonders if recent rains created mud that obscured the area along the river where boaters and tubers can exit and walk around the dam's powerful currents.

""The portage/trail to exit pre-dam is a good ways before the dam on the right'' Pulliam said. ""It's possible that recent rains covered some of the steps with mud making it hard to see especially if you're not looking for it.''

While the dam's drop-off is only about 8 feet it ""causes a strong current at its base'' Pulliam said. ""It would be almost impossible for a tube/raft to go over it without flipping.''

Brooks the Duke Energy spokesman said ""there is a sign that is visible as you approach the dam that also mentions the availability of a portage.''

Asked if Duke plans to fortify or make any changes to the area leading to the dam to enhance safety Brooks said ""Our focus right now is on assisting local emergency management officials with their response.''

Dangers of exposure

Even in warm weather with water temperatures around 70 degrees a person in the water who is not wearing protective clothing can quickly lose body heat and develop life-threatening hypothermia Pulliam said.

After one hour in 70-degree water a person could lose dexterity. After two to seven hours in water exhaustion and loss of consciousness are possible Pulliam said.

Considering the power of water and hazards of rocks along the Dan River Cates encouraged water enthusiasts to take water safety seriously and wear life jackets without fail.

Pulliam agreed. ""The biggest thing to remember is always wear a life jacket. They not only help you float but give you protection against obstacles. If you're new to the river I'd recommend a life jacket and a helmet. As for bad accidents this is the worst in my memory'' Pulliam said.

""The river is wild and beautiful it gives and takes. It’s devastating to hear the news today'' Pulliam said on Friday. ""I hope we can heal and learn.""

Photo: Getty Images

A week ago Wallabies coach Dave Rennie made the not so surprising admission that Australian rugby struggles with depth.

“I think if our Wallabies C team had to play an All Blacks C team there would be a massive margin” he said following his 38-man squad to take on France.

Fortunately the Wallabies will only be missing a handful of players for their three match Test series against France starting July 7.

Unfortunately the same can’t be said about Les Bleus whose French Top 14 competition – the longest in the world – continues its marathon season.

Former French captain Fabien Galthie is now closer to knowing who he will bring Down Under to Australia as Will Skelton’s La Rochelle set up a European Champions Cup final against Rory Arnold’s Toulouse.

Oh what Rennie would do to be able to bring his two long lost giant sons down with Galthie’s touring party or at least at some point throughout the year.

But by having France’s two best sides make the Top 14 final Australian audiences will not see the likes of Antoine Dupont arguably the best player in the world for at least the first Test with Australia’s quarantine regulations meaning players from the two finalists will not be out in time.

The availability of Romain Ntamack his classy French halves partner is not known after the 22-year-old was badly concussed during their 24-21 over Bordeaux.

Others such as starting number eight Gregory Alldritt will also miss the first flight to Sydney.

Fortunately the bulk of France’s back five will be taking their seats to Australia with starting centres Gael Fickou and Virimi Vakatawa in Racing’s backline along with Teddy Thomas the exciting winger.

Yet according to some reports in France even those whose teams were knocked out over the weekend might yet be given their summer off following the challenging season.

It means France is likely to be led around by Toulon’s Louis Carbonel or Bordeaux’s Matthieu Jalibert who almost led a third-XV side to an upset win over England during last year’s Autumn Nations Cup.

As one Wallaby playing in the French Top 14 told foxsports.com.au “That should make it an even contest.”

France has played double the Tests the Wallabies have since the 2019 World Cup.

Already this year they have played five Tests.

The Wallabies meanwhile have not played since back to back draws against Argentina to round out last year’s frustrating season which saw them win once lose twice and draw thrice.

France should not be written off.

They rival New Zealand for depth.

Their under-20s side have won the past two World Cups they made up the prestigious European Champions Cup final and made up five of the eight quarterfinalists.

“All I know is after the semi-final there will be two sides left in it obviously so those players won’t be available for the first Test” Rennie said.

“They’ll arrive here in time for the second and the third.

“But what we know with France is they’ve got phenomenal depth.

“There’s 14 teams in that competition they play with a lot of the best southern hemisphere players who have gone up there plying their trade and with my time in Europe playing the French sides they’re massive and the depth they’ve created is phenomenal.

“They’ve won the last couple of under-20s and a number of those kids are filtering through.

“What we know is whoever they bring over is going to be really strong and we’re really looking forward to that challenge.”

Rennie is not wrong.

As he told foxsports.com.au “They’re also a side that’s played a lot of footy recently they’ve played Six Nations and they played a lot of games in November so they’ll be pretty well oiled.

“They’ll have a lot of structures in place so I’d expect them to hit the ground running.”

But let’s be serious.

This will be a French side that is severely depleted and started on the first weekend of September and is yet to finish.

Australia’s players have played 13 matches at most.

The past five against New Zealand opposition should have got them up to speed.

They will have three-and-a-half weeks before they take the field at the SCG to get prepared for the match while the French sitting in their Sydney hotel rooms are coming to the end of their season and will be mentally exhausted.

The Wallabies have some selection headaches to solve particularly in the second-row and in the midfield but they will likely pick an experienced side for the first Test that is close to the one that took the field during last year’s Bledisloe opener.

Australia is seventh on the World Rugby rankings while France is fifth.

Both nations are two spots lower than they should be.

Yet this will be a second choice French side that Australia meets.

The Wallabies do not have reason to be bullish ahead of the series.

After all they have lost the art of winning.

But this is a series they should win against a severely depleted squad.

Not that Rennie is making any sweeping statements.

“It’s (a 3-0 win) certainly not something I would talk about in the media” he told foxsports.com.au.

“It will still be a pretty good team.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Certain situations certain locations cry out for licensed premises but not necessarily for what we have traditionally viewed as a pub.

Perhaps if some big pub operators could look beyond the end of their noses they might recognise that many a pub they have allowed to close after endless attempts to keep running it in exactly the same way could have succeeded with a different approach.

There remains room for all kinds of pubs from the most traditional to the most sophisticated upmarket bar with plenty in between. At the risk of labouring the point I don’t go to the Smithfield for a sit-down meal and I don’t go to The Apiary in Castle Donington for a session on the ale (though the opportunity is available to do so). But I adore both places. They have picked their market and they work tirelessly to be successful in it.

All these thoughts crossed my mind on a visit this week to the Corner Room in Long Eaton. With government regeneration money incoming the town is potentially rising out of some tough times of late. It’s a while since I spent any time around the town centre and I see more variety in the food and drink offering to visitors.

The Corner Room is part of that. It is the former Twitchel Inn the Wetherpoon’s pub in Howitt Street and it was in the hands of the Birmingham-based group Hawthorn Leisure for a while after that. But it had been closed since 2019 and has now reopened as part of the South Normanton-based Pub People chain.

It’s a chain I have a lot of time for. They are not too big for their directors not to be accessible and hands on they have a good reputation for turning around pubs that have perhaps not had the best of times and crucially they have a good eye for spotting when a pub needs to be a little different to have a chance.

So it is with the Corner Room. Pub People have spent £200000 on it although wisely they have left alone some of the architectural features that Wetherspoon’s had installed and which Wetherspoon’s often do rather well.

(Image: Joseph Raynor/ Nottingham Post)

It is the philosophy of the Corner Room which will set it apart. It is very much a smart cafe in the mornings and by day serving breakfasts but food is available through the day and it has much more of a feel of a pub by night – although not a raucous one. There are no TVs here and if you fancy a night out for a drink that avoids the current football tournament here is one place where you won’t get a sniff of it.

I feel obliged to say “no relation” every time I quote Andy Crawford operations director for Pub People: “The pub has been transformed from a downmarket ‘boozer’ (I really dislike that word Andy) into a contemporary cafe bar style lounge with a great selection of craft beers and cocktails” says Andy.

“There will be a strong presence of local and regional brewers providing the cask and craft beer including Thornbridge Black Iris Neon Raptor Dancing Duck and Liquid Light. We really hope that our refurbishment complements the other independent businesses in Long Eaton that have begun to appear over the past couple of years and gives customers something new to try after such a difficult time with the pandemic.”

In charge at the Corner Room and living on site is a cheery and experienced operator Vicki Manley who has worked in the trade in one way or another since she was 14. She’s worked for big chains and small chains in pubs and in nightclubs and has seen the benefit of working for a smaller company.

(Image: Joseph Raynor/ Nottingham Post)

“I like the fact that Pub People are relatively small” she says. “They’re all so hands-on and if you have a problem you can talk to a director and it’s solved quickly. I can see myself being with the company for a long time.”

She arrived through a friend of a friend who was already working for the company and while Long Eaton is new to her the advantage of that is seeing it for what it is perhaps without the cynicism that has been around the town at times.

“I think we are here at just the right time and we are looking forward to being part of the community” says Vicki. “We’re only 14 days open but we’re getting regulars knowing their names and what they drink.

""During the day we are perhaps getting people like the old chap with his coffee or mums with prams in for a catch-up. It’s generally younger people at night but we’re getting a mix and it will settle down.”

I really like the look of the Corner Room. The staff welcome was spot-on service quick and friendly and it feels comfortable. It is not what some people would call a pub. But it had Thornbridge Jaipur and Dancing Duck Nice Weather on the bar when I called along with a good selection of craft keg beers.

Above anything else it was open. And that’s what we need from our licensed premises more than anything else.

They had accidentally found their way to the online auction site following a mix-up at the storage lock-up where they were kept.

The belongings would have been sold to the highest bidder but luckily some loyal eagle-eyed fans spotted her treasured merchandise and reached out to Mel.

They spotted the eBay description that claimed the goods were from an ""abandoned storage room"" with the information adding that the items were a ""storage room job lot"" based in ""Swindon SN3.""

Mel told the Mirror: “Gosh! I was quite shocked about that situation. I was very shocked to see that on eBay.

“It was fans that spotted it on eBay and thought there was something not quite right so thankfully we were able to intercept it quite quickly.

“This is thing - our fans are absolutely incredible. We absolutely adore them. We’ve grown up with them.

A classification for the Castlevania Advance Collection was filed on Friday (June 18) and rates the game as Moderate Impact for Themes and Violence but gives little more information.

The industry details sections state that it will be multi-platform published by Konami and that it will be in English and Japanese and that it should land at some point in 2021.

Three different games from the series were released for the Game Boy Advance: 2001’s Castlevania: Circle Of The Moon 2002’s Castlevania: Harmony Of Dissonance and finally 2003’s Castlevania: Aria Of Sorrow.

All three games are highly rated as can be seen from their respective Metacritic pages but they have not seen a widespread release since they were re-released for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2015.

Currently the games are only available on eBay for inflated prices going regularly selling for over £70 ($100) per game.

In 2019 Konami released the Castlevania Anniversary Collection which contained eight games from the NES SNES Game Boy and Mega Drive.

Shortly after it released the Contra Anniversary Collection and Anniversary Collection: Arcade Classics which makes the upcoming release more likely.

Konami also released a whole host of its back catalogue for PC last year including Metal Gear Solid and a range of Castlevania and Contra titles.

But unfortunately not everything is exactly as it should be. While at first sight it looks as if we are dealing with a great fourth-generation Ranchero GT find there’s a nasty surprise waiting for the next owner under the hood.The seller used the always interesting 428 Cobra Jet nameplate as a way to attract attention towards this car that has been sitting idle for the past seven years. It’s in a non-running condition ever since it was driven home by the seller from a close friend who owned the Ranchero GT for no less than four decades.But this isn’t the only bad news. The atrocious piece of information comes further down in the description: “original engine has been swapped to what we believe is a 302.” What a heartbreak. On the other hand if somebody manages to get a hold of a replacement 428ci Cobra Jet motor the Ranchero GT could still turn up as a nice restoration/restomod project.After all according to the information provided by the seller just 101 examples of the fourth generation were produced with an automatic transmission and only some 80 units of them were matched to the R Code 428 Cobra Jet (335 to 365 hp with Ram air).Looking at the pictures and available information on the Ranchero GT it seems that most of the work will have to do with getting the exterior up to specification (those chrome wheels from a couple of the pictures look quite appalling).

Dangerous drivers who refuse to wear seat belts are using ""dummy"" clips so they don't set off car warning alarms.

Idiot motorists are risking lives - including their own - by inserting the controversial ""dummy latch plates"" into seat belt receivers.

Killer drivers Jack Pearson and Colin Smith both had the alarm ""silencers"" in place when they caused horrific crashes in Liverpool.

Pearson wasn't wearing a seat belt when he killed 23-year-old Phillip Caine at 100mph on Queen's Drive in Walton.

Neither was Smith when he mowed down cyclists Clare Killey and Anthony Cope at 72mph in a stolen car in Speke.

The ECHO found the clips for sale from third-party sellers on Amazon and eBay before both companies told us they were taking action.

The devices plug in like normal seat belts but without the safety strap.

They allow motorists to disable the warning alarms that sound if a modern car is moving and the driver or passenger is not strapped in.

The clips which sell for as little as £2 and often come with a bottle opener are marketed as both seat belt alarm ""silencers"" and ""stoppers"".

They are legal if used to stop alarms going off when heavy items such as shopping bags on a passenger seat are mistaken by a car system for a human.

But safety campaigners have slammed their illegal use which they say puts drivers and passengers at a greater risk of dying if there is a crash.

Rebecca Needham road safety officer for England at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) condemned their sale.

She said: ""After a strenuous campaign by RoSPA wearing seat belts became a legal requirement in 1983 for one very good reason - they save lives.

""Since then huge strides have been made towards reducing the number of fatal collisions on UK roads.

""Despite this progress RoSPA is very concerned that any retailer would offer these alarm stoppers for sale. It's entirely inappropriate.

""While we know that some people are determined not to wear their seat belt offering dummy seat belts or ""alarm stoppers"" for sale only serves as encouragement.

""The law and message is clear - belt up or risk putting yourself and others in harm's way.""

The ECHO contacted Amazon which is now in the process of removing the seat belt clips from Amazon.co.uk for breaching its selling guidelines.

An Amazon spokesperson said: ""Third party sellers are independent businesses and are required to follow our selling guidelines when selling in our store.

""Those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account.""

The ECHO also contacted eBay about the devices which are understood to be in violation of its 'encouraging illegal activity policy'.

An eBay spokesperson said: ""These items are banned from eBay's platform. The listings were removed and we will take necessary action against the sellers.""

Pearson 28 of East Prescot Road West Derby was driving a ""borrowed"" Audi S3 Quattro when he hit Mr Caine's Ford Fiesta on January 25 2019.

Liverpool Crown Court heard Pearson wasn't wearing a seatbelt and had a ""dummy latch plate"" fitted to deactivate the warning alarm in the Audi.

Robert Dudley prosecuting said Pearson suffered a cut to his own arm in the collision at around 10pm while a rear seat passenger - who also wasn't wearing a seat belt - was injured when he flew forward and hit the back of the front seats and the windscreen.

Pearson who had tried to blame his victim was jailed for six years after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving.

Smith killed mum-of-two Mrs Killey 45 from Childwall and dad-of-two Mr Cope 39 from Halewood on Thursday February 28 2019.

The 23-year-old of Lower Road Halewood also seriously injured Katy Nicholson a passenger in another car on Dunlop Road at around 7pm.

He was high on cannabis and driving a stolen Ford Fiesta ST Turbo but had the gall to blame an innocent driver for causing the fatal collision.

At a trial last month Smith accepted he wasn't wearing a seat belt and said he was using a ""latch plate"" - ""just like the end of the seat belt"".

He claimed this device was in the car when he bought it and he had previously taken it out and put it back in but couldn't remember when.

Ian Whitehurst defending said: ""You accept Mr Smith it was a pretty damn stupid thing to do?"" He answered: ""Yeah.""

(Image: Liverpool Echo)

Under cross-examination Smith accepted taking the latch plate out and putting it back in more than once but when asked why replied ""not sure"" and ""I can't remember"".

He said he couldn't think of any reason why he would use one but agreed that without it or a seat belt a warning would sound.

Martine Snowdon prosecuting said: ""Why do you think cars have seat belts Mr Smith?"" ""For safety"" he answered.

She said: ""For whose safety?"" Smith replied: ""The driver.""

""Anyone else?"" she asked. ""Whoever is driving the car whoever is in the car"" he said.

Ms Snowdon said: ""Not just who is in the car it's for the safety of other road users as well isn't it?""

""Well yeah"" he replied.

Smith who was convicted of two counts of causing death and one count of causing serious injury by dangerous driving will be sentenced on June 24.

Merseyside Police said ""around 20 people"" who weren't wearing seat belts were killed or seriously injured in crashes in the region in 2020 and 2021.

The force said in 2020 alone 1515 people were prosecuted for seat belt offences across Merseyside with anyone found guilty facing a £100 fine.

Matrix roads policing inspector Stuart McIver said: ""Merseyside Police regularly carries out enforcement aimed at drivers not wearing a seat belt while driving and we support the annual national campaign as not wearing a seatbelt is considered one of the 'fatal four' causes of road death in Great Britain.""

He added: ""Whether a driver or a passenger in a vehicle by simply spending two to three seconds putting on a seat belt you greatly reduce the risk of serious injury if involved in a crash.""

Paul Mountford from the force's Safer Roads Unit added: ""Modern car manufacturers invest millions into making their vehicles as safe as possible. Airbags are a 'secondary restraint system' (SRS) and will only be effective if a seat belt is worn.

""It only takes a matter of seconds to 'buckle up' but injuries caused by not wearing a seat belt may be life-changing."""

It’s been confirmed that DICE will be talking about Battlefield 2042’s mysterious undisclosed mode that’s being developed by DICE LA and we can assume that we’ll be hearing more about this year’s instalments in the various EA Sports franchises- but what else?

Well apparently the publishing has something potentially exciting in store for fans. During a recent stream (spotted by VGC) GamesBeat journalist Jeff Grubb said that EA is probably going to announce the revival of an established IP at its EA Play Live event next month. Grubb didn’t divulge many details but he says he has previously discussed the game.

An EA game that he has previously discussed is of course the next game being made by Star Wars: Squadrons studio EA Motive. According to Grubb they’re working on an established IP that’s going to make fans happy and that IP apparently is not Mirror’s Edge. To many that sounds like Dead Space which I sure hope it is.

Either way we’ll probably know soon enough at least if EA does indeed plan on sharing details soon. We’ll keep you updated so stay tuned.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIyNTQxNTQxL2ZpZmEtdWx0aW1hdGUtdGVhbS1wcmV2aWV3LXBhY2stY2hhbmdlcy1sb290LWJveGVzLXJ1bGVzLWVhLXNwb3J0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FIFA Ultimate Team now shows pack contents before you buy,"FIFA 21 Ultimate Team players may now preview the specific contents of every pack of cards sold in EA Sports’ extremely lucrative but heavily criticized mode. The change comes with certain catches but it seems to carefully respond to long-running complaints and discomforts ranging from government regulators in Europe to rank-and-file fans playing a microtransaction-filled game.

“Preview Packs” were introduced on Friday and are the only kind of packs sold in the FUT Shop through this year’s “Festival of FUTball”. It’s not clear if this is how any or all packs will be sold after then though. Festival of FUTball started June 11 and runs until mid-July. FIFA 22 should launch in early fall.

How does a FIFA Ultimate Team Preview Pack work?

All packs for sale in the FUT Shop have an eye icon and a button to trigger the preview. Doing that exposes its contents as if the player actually had bought the pack and opened it.

Once the player has seen the revealed cards they may then buy the pack with either FUT Coins (the free in-game currency) or FUT Points (the premium). If they don’t like what they see they don’t have to buy the pack. But there will now be a 24-hour wait period before they can preview another pack or buy a different one in its class. If they buy the pack that timer immediately expires.

Two points: First previewing a pack does not call out which of the items if any are duplicates already present in the player’s FUT collection (which can be quite vast). Also there’s no way to buy a pack with its contents sight unseen. Players must preview it before making their decision to buy.

In effect they’re getting a complete look at what is available to them for the next 24 hours somewhat like the daily-items menu players see in games like EA’s F1 2020 or Knockout City. They can only speed up the rotation of new items by buying the ones they’ve seen.

Also “Packs not directly obtained from the FUT Store such as rewards from Division Rivals or earned from an Objective or SBC will not be Preview Packs” EA Sports said “and will continue to function as they do now.”

The Preview Pack is applicable to all six standard packs in the FUT Shop as well as the three “Promo Packs” currently available. The only difference with the Promo Packs is their contents were already on a time-limited cycle. So if you preview a pack that was already set to expire in 45 minutes you see the next pack in 45 minutes not a day later.

The changes come after two headline-grabbing incidents renewed criticism of EA’s microtransaction practices in its global best-seller. In March EA Sports confirmed it was investigating allegations that a company employee was selling rare in-game FUT items. EA Sports suspended all discretionary awards of FIFA 21 items pending the results of the investigation. (EA Sports has not since communicated with FUT players about this probe or what it uncovered.)

Then in April Canadian Broadcasting Corporation News published two leaked internal documents showing EA Vancouver’s thoughts and discussion of how FUT fit into the studio and its publisher’s priorities for FIFA 21. A bullet point in the document said “FUT is the cornerstone and we are doing everything we can to drive players there.”

CBC quoted its unnamed internal source as saying “I don’t know why anyone would ever put that in print at the company. It’s getting harder and harder to defend what is very obviously unregulated gambling.”

Electronic Arts issued a lengthy formal reply to the CBC’s reporting in which the publisher said “We do not ‘push’ people to spend in our games” and that the summertime period — which the leaked document concerns — is “a very active time” for FUT players that requires new content which the company supports with “extensive non monetized rewards.”

“Nothing in the leaked document contradicts this in any way” Electronic Arts insisted. “It shows how we are supporting engagement in our game during the summer period not spending.” EA also restated it “firmly disagree[s] that FIFA or any of our games involve gambling.”

Still FIFA is a $59.99 (now $69.99 on PS5 Xbox Series X) annual game and FUT is an open-ended revenue stream drawing on players who have bought that game. It is a tremendous driver of revenue and profit for the publisher. In May analyst Daniel Ahmad noted that Electronic Arts realized more than $1.6 billion in revenue from its Ultimate Team modes (the Madden NFL series has one too) in its most recent fiscal year almost tripling what the company pulled in six years earlier.

How much does EA earn from Ultimate Team across FIFA Madden and NFL?

Since it launched in 2009 Football Ultimate Team’s moneymaking power has spawned black markets and other illicit behavior while drawing criticism of EA’s business practices and threats of regulation from European and American lawmakers.

In 2018 EA Sports began revealing the odds of what type of items players can expect to find within the game’s different types of virtual card packs. In 2020 FIFA developers launched a tool called FIFA Playtime which allowed players (or their parents) to monitor and control the amounts of time and money they spend in the game. Eurogamer also noted in reporting on pack previews on Friday that FIFA 21 Ultimate Team started offering cosmetic items outside of its loot boxes beginning in May.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN2Zy5jb20vMTUzNzEyL2VhLWdhbWVzLXRoYXQtdG90YWxseS1mbG9wcGVkLWhhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EA Games That Totally Flopped Hard,"Alice: Madness Returns was the sequel to American McGee's Alice a game which brought Lewis Carroll's Alice back through the looking glass and into a dark and twisted version of Wonderland. A full 11 years elapsed between the release of the two games but somehow fan demand wasn't enough to ensure success.

American McGee the series creator and head of his namesake studio has blamed the game's poor sales on a misguided marketing campaign from EA feeling that too much focus was put on violence and gore rather than the darkly whimsical elements that make up much of the game. In fact McGee went so far as to say that he felt EA had attempted to ""trick"" gamers into thinking they were getting a vastly different product than what was released. However he eventually walked back these statements saying ""trick"" was a poor choice of word.

It probably wasn't the best way to phrase things but that doesn't change the fact that the game's marketing may very well have resulted in this long-awaited sequel's failure to light up the sales charts. Still American McGee hasn't given up hope taking to his blog in early 2019 to explain that his studio is working on a third installment and is hopeful that fan demand could convince EA to take another chance on Alice and complete the trilogy.

Most of the traffic seems to be coming from the United States’ western region. And while the sharp increase in player count coincides with Battlefield 2042‘s reveal the spike on PC specifically can also be associated to Battlefield 4‘s free giveaway via Prime Gaming. Nevertheless Battlefield 2042‘s E3 trailer turned out to be one of the most popular videos from the event landing among the top ten most watched YouTube game videos for the month of June.

A notice from EA regarding Battlefield 4‘s server capacity reads:

We were absolutely blown away by your excitement and reactions to the recent Battlefield 2042 reveal. Since then many of you have jumped back into Battlefield 4 to already get a taste of the return to all-out-warfare. We’ve been monitoring your experience and noticed queue times in the US West region were far longer than in other regions. Good news we’ve increased server capacity for this region – you can expect less waiting and more playing. We’ll continue monitoring queue times and will make further adjustments as necessary.

Battlefield 2042 will release on October 22 for current-gen and last-gen platforms. It’ll come without a traditional single-player campaign. An official overview is as follows:

Battlefield 2042 is a first-person shooter that marks the return to the iconic all-out warfare of the franchise. In a near-future world transformed by disorder adapt and overcome dynamically-changing battlegrounds with the help of your squad and a cutting-edge arsenal. With support for 128 players Battlefield 2042 brings unprecedented scale on vast battlegrounds across the globe. Players will take on several massive experiences from updated multiplayer modes like Conquest and Breakthrough to the all-new Hazard Zone.

Knowing some of the key steps to take — and making preparations together before a death occurs — can help.

Here is updated guidance.

Have the talk

If possible talk with your spouse and adult children about finances account numbers passwords and where to find things.

According to a 2021 study by Caring.com 67.1 percent of U.S. adults don’t have a will.

The study does show however that more young people have a will — and interest in estate planning has especially increased among young people during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The number of young adults with a will in the 2021 study increased by 63 percent from those surveyed in 2020. For the first time adults younger than 35 years were more likely to have a will than those ages 35-54. According to the study 18-34 year-olds are now 16% more likely to have a will than those in the 35-54 age group.

In addition to a will it’s also important to update health care power of attorney and directives funeral wishes bank and credit card accounts life insurance pensions and retirement accounts especially 401(k) accounts from previous jobs said Ted Rossman senior industry analyst for Creditcards.com and Bankrate.com.

Also check the Unclaimed Funds database at www.com.ohio.gov/unfd or call 877-644-6823.

“It is tremendously important to the surviving spouse and children. It’s hard to unwind all of these accounts” he said including social media.

Places to notify

After a death there are so many places to notify but start with the Social Security Administration. Funeral homes usually report it but call 800-772-1213 to discuss death benefits. Social Security will notify Medicare. You should still contact Medicare however to disenroll the deceased member and stop any premiums that may be associated with the account..

Contact the credit bureaus to ensure your loved one doesn’t become the victim of identity theft such as someone using their name to open new credit. Also notify creditors. If you contact one of the three major credit bureaus they share with the others.

Each has slightly different guidelines but have a copy of the death certificate the person’s legal name Social Security number date of birth and death and name and address for the surviving spouse or executor.

Equifax: Equifax Information Services LLC P.O. Box 105139 Atlanta GA 30348-5139.

Don’t close accounts

Don’t be too quick to close credit accounts as it can hurt your good credit score. Your score can affect auto and home insurance rates.

If you were not on a joint credit card (most issuers make one person primary and the other an authorized user) the account will be closed if you were not the primary account holder.

Check your credit reports. Everyone is entitled to one free credit report a year from each of the credit bureaus. These are different than the “free” reports many of the bureaus themselves offer but those are usually tied to paying for a credit monitor’s service.

Go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 877-322-8228. You must disclose your Social Security number to verify your identity. A credit freeze still allows you to get your report.

To reduce junk mail register with the Deceased Do Not Contact List through the direct marketing industry group www.dmachoice.org. (Online option only).

Also here is information from the U.S. Postal service on how to stop or forward mail that is sent to the deceased. www.usps.com/manage/mail-for-deceased.htm

Don’t be too quick to close or take your deceased spouse’s name off your joint bank account. There may be checks that still come written out to your deceased love one and you will not be able to deposit or cash them if the name is no longer on the account. After my father passed away the bank advised us to keep his name on the account for a year or until we were sure there would be no other checks coming from various accounts after his death.

Here’s some additional advice from Summit County Probate Judge Elinore Marsh Stormer: She advises closing down accounts within 13 months of the date of someone’s death.

“There's nothing wrong with letting things settle. First of all no one needs to rush down and close things down within weeks of someone dying. You have the difficulty of dealing with the emotional loss. We don’t advise people to make dramatic changes within weeks.”

Utility accounts

Ohio Edison: The electric utility asks the spouse or loved one to notify customer service of the death at 800-686-3421. If the surviving spouse is willing to accept the responsibility the account number will not change and the account will be placed in the surviving spouse’s name. If the deceased spouse had multiple accounts(common for landlords and business owners) the surviving spouse will be required to open new accounts with new account numbers.

Dominion Energy Ohio: The surviving spouse is asked to establish a new account. If the old account was with a marketer or aggregation program contact the supplier. It’s possible the supplier would not extend the same price. If the previous account was on the Standard Choice Offer (SCO) the new account would also be on the SCO unless the customer chooses something else.

The company plans to take waste from high-yielding sustainably-grown crops and then process it to produce renewable diesel bio-jet fuel LPG heat (for on-farm glasshouses) food-grade liquified CO2 and a soil nutrient that can be plowed back to grow more crops.

AgBioEn has three key divisions: Agriculture Bioenergy and Environment. The Agriculture division is currently exploring innovative ways to grow better crops that achieve an increased yield in the grain or cobb higher biomass more carbon sequestered in the soil and use less water.

Working with La Trobe University and Microsoft partner LAB3 AgBioEn is running a series of on-farm trials growing different crops under different conditions.

It has used IoT sensors and devices to monitor the health and growth of the crops with telemetry and drone data held in an Azure Cloud Edge Computing Platform. Data analytics tools and dashboards are available for La Trobe researchers and farmers that partner with the company.

Crop trials will continue for the next three to four years while AgBioEn will complete its fuel manufacturing facility design this year with construction scheduled to start early next year with fuel produced from 2023.

Over the next four to five years AgBioEn plans to invest AUD 1.2 billion in its Renewable Energy and Fuels Facility to turn agricultural waste (biomass) into fuel and a further AUD 800 million in 100000 hectares of cropping land. Its plan is for agricultural waste (biomass) sourced from farms within a 200 km radius of the fuels facility to be turned into renewable fuels.

Ultimately it plans to produce 150 million liters of fuel each year.

LAB3 has helped design the crop testing system which sees data from farm-based sensors and drones uploaded via LoRaWan networks into an Azure IoT Hub.

Might the fact that corporate investors snapped up 15 percent of U.S. homes for sale in the first quarter of this year have something to do with it? The Wall Street Journal reported in April that an investment firm won a bidding war to purchase an entire neighborhood worth of single-family homes in Conroe Texas—part of a cycle of stories drumming up panic over Wall Street’s increasing stake in residential real estate. Then came the backlash as cool-headed analysts reassured us that big investors like BlackRock remain insignificant players in the housing market compared with regular old American families.

The truth is between the two: We can panic and acknowledge Wall Street’s small role at the same time. Although the number of houses being purchased by mega-investors is currently not enough to move the market in most parts of the country these firms’ underlying structural advantage is profound and growing.

Let’s focus on Invitation Homes a $21 billion publicly traded company that was spun off from Blackstone the world’s largest private equity company in 2017. Invitation Homes operates in 16 cities with the biggest concentration in Atlanta where it owns 12556 houses. (Though that’s not much compared with the 80000 homes sold in Atlanta each year Invitation Homes bought 90 percent of the homes for sale in some ZIP codes in Atlanta in the early 2010s.) While normal people typically pay a mortgage interest rate between 2 percent and 4 percent these days Invitation Homes can borrow money for far less: It’s getting billion-dollar loans at interest rates around 1.4 percent. In practice this means that Invitation Homes can afford to tack on an extra $5000 to $20000 to the purchase price of every home while getting the house at the same actual cost as a typical homeowner. While Invitation Homes uses a mixture of debt and cash from renters to buy houses its offers are almost always all cash which is a big leg up in a competitive market.

One way to think about Invitation Homes’ business strategy is to consider the value of the properties the firm is buying relative to the rents they charge. According to a recent SEC disclosure Invitation Homes’ portfolio of homes is worth of total of $16 billion (after renovations) and the company collects about $1.9 billion in rent per year. That means it takes only about eight years of rental payments to pay back a typical house that Invitation Homes has bought. The usual rule of thumb for evaluating a fair sale price says Kundan Kishor professor of economics at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee “is that price to rent ratios are around 20 to 1.” When price-to-rent ratios are very high it makes more sense for consumers to rent than to buy and when they are low it makes more sense to buy than to rent. That Invitation Homes is getting deals twice as good as a typical homebuyer shows that it’s not just buying any homes: It’s buying the specific houses with the greatest potential to be wealth-building for the middle class.

It’s not exactly accurate that investors are “buying every single-family house they can find” as some have suggested. If that were true their market share in the United States wouldn’t be a piddling 15 percent. They’re really buying up the stock of relatively inexpensive single-family homes built since the 1970s in growing metro areas. They mostly ignore bigger and more expensive houses especially ones that are move-in ready: Wealthy boomers and the nation’s finance and tech bros nab those properties. And they’re also ignoring cities with stable or shrinking populations like Providence and Pittsburgh.

But investors are depleting the inventory of the precise houses that might otherwise be obtainable for younger working- and middle-class households in the cities where those workers can easily find good-paying jobs like Atlanta (22 percent of home purchases according to Redfin data) Charlotte (22 percent) and Phoenix (20 percent). More importantly they’re able to scour those markets scientifically and systematically to make cash offers on the most attractively priced properties. While normal people buy houses when they actually need to move somewhere (savvy) investors buy houses several years before a bunch of people need to move to an area. Whether they’re tracking where major employers are building new offices or looking at public school enrollment data being ahead of the market gives big firms a big leg up.

And in case you were assuming that converting houses to rentals would flood the market and bring down rents don’t get your hopes up: As Invitation Homes tells its investors “We operate in markets with strong demand drivers high barriers to entry and high rent growth potential.”

While renting might make sense for some people especially people who move a lot it often sucks particularly in the United States where we don’t have especially strong protections for tenants. The business strategy of the country’s biggest landlords Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent does not seem to be “Make renting with us so delightful that if my tenants have to move cities they’ll specifically seek out another property owned by our company.” Based on reports from Reuters the New York Times and the Atlantic it appears to be closer to “Squeeze our tenants for every penny avoid making repairs let black mold and raw sewage accumulate and count on the fact that moving is a huge expensive hassle.”

Our current system of encouraging homeownership is by no means perfect and it places a lot of unnecessary risk onto the “balance sheets” of the middle class but it’s worked out financially for most of the people who have been lucky enough to own a home. The implicit and explicit subsidies the government has given to Americans buying their first homes have been the biggest handout the American middle class has ever received (a handout notably denied to Black Americans for much of the 20th century one explanation for the current size of the racial wealth gap).

Laurie Goodman vice president of housing finance policy at the Urban Institute points out that policymakers could take steps to level the playing field between investors and the rest of us. She told me that buyers who need to borrow money using Federal Housing Administration loans or those who need a rehab loan for a fixer-upper have a particularly tough time competing against Wall Street firms. FHA paperwork often gets delayed slowing down the purchase process so home sellers often don’t want to sell to FHA buyers even if their bids are competitive. That’s a solvable problem. And loans for properties that need renovations Goodman says are both cumbersome and expensive. Rethinking the processes for FHA and rehab loans could “put individuals on a more equal footing” she explained.

If you don’t want all of America’s land and housing to end up in the portfolios of the 1 percent there’s ultimately one very simple solution: Tax the rich. After all the companies buying the houses are ultimately owned by people (or in some cases universities and churches which are their own cans of tax-advantaged rich-people worms). At the same time that the working-class is going hungry rich people are doing so outstandingly well that they are running out of easy places to park their cash which is why they’re buying 2000 square-foot houses in the Phoenix suburbs via their ownership stakes in these funds.

This is all part of a long-standing trend: As inequality in the United States increases the financial elite invests less in the types of things that could create jobs like R&D or new factories and more into directly extracting wealth from the working class. One way to do that? Becoming their landlords.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A new shop owner recently turned his e-commerce enterprise into a brick-and-mortar store in the Empire Outlets offering these — and hundreds of other unique gift apparel and home decor items — in a visual showcase only a Broadway-trained designer could muster.

Vanity House Designs owned by Kurt Alger became a reality thanks to the Empire Outlets’ Pop Up & Grow Program which lends retail space to aspiring shop owners for varying periods of time to help struggling businesses.

The shop opened its doors June 5.

As a professional Broadway theatrical costume and wig designer Alger had been thinking about a physical storefront to showcase grand displays invite shoppers in for immersive experiences and flush out his online product lines.

He founded Vanity House Designs as an online enterprise a pivot endeavor during the pandemic while Broadway was closed to the public.

“I started making wreaths and crafts and floral things and selling them on Etsy’' he said. “That grew really rapidly. I started doing craft fairs and a lot of people kept asking ‘where is your shop?”’

He came across the news story in the Staten Island Advance about the Pop Up & Grow program which sparked an idea.

“I found it late at night” he said. “The next morning I immediately applied. And then it kind of all lined up as a very viable option and I said ‘why not give it a try?’

“So here I am with a year lease and just trying to figure it out as I go. It’s a little crazy.”

Vanity House Designs offers a variety of gifts and home décor items sparked by Alger’s passion for holiday decorating and all things floral and colorful.

The shop owner who is so enthusiastic about Christmas that he decorates seven Christmas trees in his St. George home each year has Christmas — and every other annual holiday — represented in his store year-round.

“As the seasons change all the holidays rotate and the current holiday moves forward in the store” he says. “That’s the fun part for me.”

Bookkeeping and other routine tasks associated with running a business are less of a draw he muses noting that he plans to hire a few employees to help with those tasks in the fall.

In addition to seasonal décor shoppers will find aromatherapy options tasty treats humor cards nostalgia and novelty items as well as social media photo opportunities at the location.

Staten Island-specific gifts and cards are also a popular offering and a hit with customers who visit via the nearby Staten Island Ferry Alger said.

There’s also a sachet-making station and an entire wall dedicated to apothecary items beauty products and candles.

Shop owner Kurt Alger brings his online home decor business to a brick-and-mortar ship in the Empire Outlets.

“There’s truly something for everybody’' Alger says stressing that the shop is geared toward customers of all ages.

Originally from Binghamton N.Y. Alger was drawn to Staten Island as a Wagner College student. Twenty-five years later he still calls Staten Island home and is very active in Staten Island community theater designing costumes for Snug Harbor Cultural Center productions and the Sundog Theater among others.

Today he shares his eye for design with customers as well offering custom wreath and floral design as well as holiday decorating tips.

Empire Outlets is located at 55 Richmond Terr. directly next to the St. George Ferry Terminal. The store is located on Level 2 next to Cotton On and is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday and from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Sundays.

Years in the St. Vrain Valley: 16

What brought you here? What has kept you? I moved here in 2005 from Boulder because my husband and I wanted to buy a home. We stayed because we love it here. It’s a great place to raise kids and we love that it is so close to Rocky Mountain National Park and other spaces to hike and bike and explore.

What was it like jumping into mask making mode last year and are sales still steady? Jumping into mask making last year was truly like jumping into the deep end of a pool. I had no idea what I was doing and had to iterate as I went — testing patterns sourcing fabric and other materials. I had so many orders — both directly from Etsy as well as wholesale for Colorado Crafted — that I was sewing for about 15 hours a day. It was worth it and I was so glad to be able to help people stay safe. Sales of masks definitely dropped off as soon as big companies started using their resources to mass produce masks. It’s wild how you can buy a mask at the gas station along with your gas and road trip snacks. I still make masks but I have also expanded to knitted hats quilted lap blankets and small stuffed toys.

Are there any new items you plan to fill your Etsy shop with? Yes. My tagline is “homemade and reusable items that promote exploring nature” and I am currently working on a new spring/summer release. First up: stylish and classic picnic blankets and upcycled silverware/napkin sets. Living in Colorado has made me so appreciative of the beautiful nature we get to explore and I want my products to help other folks get outside too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1uZXdzMS5jb20vd2kvbWlsd2F1a2VlL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNi8xNS9hcnRpc3QtdGhyaXZlcy1kdXJpbmctcGFuZGVtaWPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oshkosh metal artist Joey Kuhlow thrives during pandemic,"OSHKOSH Wis. — Many parents were forced to start working from home when the pandemic began with the added hurdle of helping their children with schoolwork.

What You Need To Know -Joey Kuhlow and his wife Christiana have five children ages 1-6



In order to spend more time with his family Joey started creating art from home



He makes art and jewelry from used metal



During the pandemic he saw a boost in his Etsy sales

For the Kuhlow’s that’s kind of been their dream all along.

Joey Kuhlow worked in construction and built the family’s Oshkosh home. He now works from home as a metal artist selling most of his work on Etsy.

“I don’t want a lot of money” said Kuhlow. “I just want enough to support my family so that I can invest in eternal things. Things that are more important like my children other people the church.”

The five children ranging from ages 1 to 6 are a focal point for the family.

Christiana homeschools the kids and Joey stays nearby in his home workshop. Kuhlow admits he’s frugal. He takes used metal such as old silverware or worn-out guitar strings and makes figurines and rings. Kuhlow chops wood to heat his home and the family keeps chickens and maintains a large garden.

“Self-sufficiency is important to us” said Kuhlow. “It’s something the Scriptures talk about that everyone should be able to work with their hands live a quiet life and not be dependent on others.

Kuhlow’s parents were missionaries in the Philippines where he lived from age 9 until he graduated high school. His Christian faith drives most of his actions.

“In times like this you never know what’s going to happen tomorrow” said Kuhlow. “Self-sufficiency is a part of our lifestyle but it’s ultimately rooted in doing things together as a family.”

While Joey stays busy with orders Christiana attends to their five young children. She’s grateful that they’ve found a way to spend more time together.

It enables me to be with our children” said Christiana. “It’s more than enough to support our family and I get to spend my days with them. It’s a blessing and I love everything about where we are.”

Selling through Etsy helps the Kuhlows reach their goals especially this past year. During the pandemic Kuhlow made record sales.

“The thing about Etsy is that we don’t have physical shops so I think almost all Etsy people that I know did very well over the pandemic” said Kuhlow. “Everyone was just at home scrolling on their phone with a bunch of extra cash.”

Kuhlow says the day stimulus checks were deposited into accounts last year he saw a spike in sales.

“I think everyone was trying to do their part in stimulating the economy and help small businesses” said Kulow. “It’s not going to happen again this year but it was a nice bump.”

As the world opens up again after the pandemic many families will go through some adjustments. For Joey and the Kuhlow family it will likely just be business as usual.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXRyaW90bGVkZ2VyLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDYvMTkvc2ltcGxpY2l0eS1xdWFsaXR5LW1pbHRvbi1zb3V0aC1zaG9yZS1sZWF0aGVyLWNvbXBhbnktdW5pcXVlbHktbG9jYWwvNzcxNzg1NjAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Simplicity quality Milton South Shore Leather Company Uniquely Local,"MILTON — In the basement of a home in Milton that once bore witness to the dreams of Dropkick Murphy frontman Ken Casey a whole new passion is being fostered.

Nick Mantia who bought the rock star's childhood home with his wife three years ago isn't learning chords on a guitar or writing songs about the plight of Boston's working class. Instead he's stitching hammering and hole punching leather as the owner and craftsman of the South Shore Leather Company.

Mantia has found room for his new hobby in the cellar of his house tucked into a corner surrounded by storage boxes stacked taller than he is. The scent of leather hangs faintly in the air and on a small table he traces cuts hammers punches and sews leather goods like card sleeves money clips key chains wallets cell phone cases and more.

""I really like being able to make something with my own hands and say 'I know exactly how this was made'"" he said. ""I know what leather was used what products what materials.""

The designs of his products are simple and minimalist — there is no room for extra items or bulky shapes. The leathers Mantia uses range in color pattern style and thickness and 90 percent of what he uses is sourced from Italy. He hand stitches every edge hammers every hole and brands each item with his logo: a simple black and white buoy.

""I'd rather make something I really want and would like to carry and then if it's popular that's just a bonus"" he said.

An IT professional at a law firm by day Mantia does not have a history of being crafty or particularly handy he said. His interest in working with leather first peaked when a wallet he bought started to fall apart and he looked to the maker's YouTube to learn about the processes. From there he fell down a ""rabbit hole.""

The coronavirus pandemic presented a perfect opportunity to learn something new he said and he ordered a few cheap pieces of leather and a simple tool kit to get himself started.

""I really made some mistakes"" he said with a laugh. ""Poor choices of leather bad tools. One of the things I learned was to really invest in good tools and material from the get go.""

Most of the products made through the South Shore Leather Company are from patterns Mantia designs himself in Adobe Illustrator and the first thing he ever made was a card wallet with a thumb hole for easy access.

""It came out awful. The stitching was bad it was crooked. So I just tried again.""

Turning to Instagram and Etsy

Encouraged early on to start an Instagram account by his wife Mantia started sharing his pieces and part of his process online. Within three months he'd opened an Etsy store and friends and family who bought pieces started to leave reviews. He's sold pieces to buyers in other states and even overseas and people have reached out for custom pieces like checkbook covers and knife sheaths.

A simple card holder can take an hour to make and more complex money clips can take up to three. It's a slow process that takes patience and precision something Mantia says customers appreciate over similar mass-produced products.

""This is built to last. It's not something cheap that will fall apart"" he said. ""It's meant to be used and it will age and wear but in a way that will still look great and natural.""

South Shore Leather Company company products are available on Etsy. Minimalist card sleeves start at $20 card wallets are between $20 and $45 and money clips are $50.

""I never thought 'Oh I want to make a ton of money on this'"" Mantia said. ""I just loved the hobby and I thought 'If I can somewhat break even I'll be happy.'""

But when he finally got the opportunity the Expedia and Zillow co-founder started with a critique of the program’s name — specifically its pronoun.

“There are no ‘I’s who built anything” Barton explained in an email recounting what he told Raz. “Anything. ‘We’s build stuff. And ‘We’ is way more fun than ‘I’ in my experience. And the group of people I have been lucky enough to work with from college through Microsoft Expedia — and then all of the Expedia diaspora many of whom founded great companies — has been nothing short of miraculous.”

He added “I would start listing companies but I know I would forget some and feel bad. There have been so many. Anyway the tight supportive tech community in Seattle is huge part of that success and I’m grateful and lucky to have landed here.”

Lesson number one: always credit the team and the people around you.

﻿

His critique of the name didn’t make it into the final edit of the show which was recorded a few months ago and released last weekend. However the theme did come up in other ways as Barton credited his success to his good fortune in working with “an insanely smart and hardworking bunch of people” over the years.

The interview traced the course of his career from travel to real estate from his early days at Microsoft where he and his colleagues hatched travel giant Expedia to his current role as CEO of Zillow Group. Barton co-founded the online real estate company in 2005 and was succeeded as CEO by Spencer Rascoff in 2011 before returning to the role in 2019.

A common theme running through Barton’s career is the notion of disrupting established industries through transparency empowering people with information. Examples include Zillow’s closely followed Zestimate home price estimating tool and the company reviews on Glassdoor which Barton co-founded with former Expedia colleague Robert Hohman.

Barton said the key is not disruption but provocation.

“Provocation is a fantastic marketing strategy” Barton explained on the show. “I’ve had many companies now where I’ve used this as a tool.”

Barton’s return as Zillow Group CEO gave the conversation a more timely feel than many other episodes. For example he explained that the tech tools adopted by the real estate industry out of necessity due to COVID safety protocols — virtual home tours digital closings etc. — will remain permanent fixtures even after the pandemic.

However as a longtime listener and fan of the show myself I was surprised that Raz didn’t take advantage of that timeliness to press Barton on more hot-button issues such as the competitive threats facing Zillow from rivals such as Seattle-based Redfin and traditional real estate firms.

Over email I suggested to Barton that Raz may have been taking it easy on him.

“Loads of content landed on the cutting room floor and I honestly don’t remember if there was competitor stuff in there” Barton replied. “You think he took it easy on me eh? You should have seen me the night after the interview. Like Rocky after meeting Apollo Creed.”

He explained “It was a long interview — over three hours — which must be part of his process to make it sound as real and raw as he can. He’s an incredibly talented and smart interviewer. I could hear the wheels spinning as he was figuring out the puzzle — the story. I learned quite a bit from him while I was being questioned. And I learned about myself actually.”

While it was Barton’s first time on “How I Built This” he had spoken with Raz before. Barton interviewed Raz for a Zillow virtual partner event for real estate professionals toward the beginning of the pandemic.

Although his critique of the show’s name didn’t make the final cut Barton did share a few of his best practices for naming companies: Make up a word that you can fill with your own meaning and register cheaply as a domain; seek to incorporate high-point Scrabble letters; and keep it to two syllables if possible.

That last one came in hindsight after Expedia was named — just one of the lessons from Barton’s entrepreneurial journey.

Across the street from the new Glencairn elementary school on Harrison Road is the home of Diana Farmer and Charlie Richardson. From the street the charming brick Cape Cod looks like a single-story house with a one-car garage built into the slope of the rolling landscape.

It is only apparent once you see the back of the house how many levels there actually are and how the builder created a great use of the space inside. In fact the house – built in 1949 – served as the personal home of the builder who also designed several of the other houses nearby.

Gary Caldwell for ELi

Including the basement there are at least five levels to this house and these can be seen in the photo above. The first floor which opens to the upper deck contains the living room dining room and kitchen. Up one story are the two smaller bedrooms which are located above the garage and up one more level is the primary bedroom found behind the large windows overlooking the backyard. Down a few steps from the kitchen are the garage level and the basement at the very bottom of the house where there is a cozy sitting area decorated with several guitars and a large laundry area.

The extension of the upper deck was a recent project completed by Charlie. Previously it had been just a small porch off the dining room that led down to the ground-level deck. This new square footage provides space for a bistro-style table and chairs and serves as an lovely spot to sit with a cup of coffee in the morning as it faces the rising sun in the east.

Gary Caldwell for ELi

The deck has also served as the stage for performances by Charlie’s band Jackalope during the pandemic. The way the lot lines are drawn in this part of the City – as seen above – several houses share space in their backyards. The openness behind the homes provided plenty of space for guests to remain socially distanced while still enjoying the music.

Gary Caldwell for ELi

Diana purchased the house in May 2001 and immediately got to work adding her own special touches. These include the stained-glass panels in the bow window of the dining room and the crystal chandelier over the dining table. The hardwood floors are a homeowner favorite along with the large windows which provide an opportunity for the couple’s many houseplants to thrive.

Gary Caldwell for ELi

An antique buffet painted by Diana displays her collection of dishes. The tone-on-tone color palette is a neutral backdrop for the art and accessories that give the house its soul.

Indeed this home is a perfect reflection of the couple who lives there: fun artistic and welcoming. Interestingly working on homes was how Diana and Charlie first met in 1982. At the time they were working together in a home repair program in Harlan County Kentucky. Diana moved on to Virginia where she lived for twelve years before coming back to Michigan to be close to her family. Charlie went on to become a residential energy efficiency expert living in Colorado. He moved to Michigan in 2012 at which time he and Diana reconnected. They were married in 2013.

Two years ago the couple remodeled the kitchen. The layout stayed the same with the sink under the window that faces the backyard. The updates that Diana and Charlie chose are classic and timeless. A darker color on the lower cabinets anchors the space while white Shaker-paneled upper cabinets create a sense of airiness and space. The original yellow-laminate countertops were replaced by white quartz counters and a white subway tile backsplash. Narrower upper cabinets were added on either side of the window above the sink to accommodate the display shelves that feel period-appropriate. Modern updates include the stainless-steel appliances under-cabinet lighting and an undermount sink.

Gary Caldwell for ELi

The kitchen renovation did not expand the size of the space but instead fit itself into the original smaller footprint of the house. The homeowners did not need to sacrifice storage space though. A few steps down from the kitchen is a small nook that was at one time used as a home office. Charlie and Diana now use it as a pantry for food storage. Another nook is a few steps beyond and on the opposite side of the stairs. It is used as a butler’s pantry for extra dishes and serving pieces.

Gary Caldwell for ELi

Upstairs there are three bedrooms: one is used as a guest bedroom another as Diana’s art studio and the largest as the primary bedroom which has an attached bathroom.

Gary Caldwell for ELi

Despite the fact that this room faces Harrison Road and is not far from busy Saginaw Street the house is so well-built that Charlie and Diana never hear the traffic outside. The couple gives credit to the builder for making it this way.

Gary Caldwell for ELi

Likewise Charlie has followed in the tradition of the original owner using his expertise to give the home smart energy efficient updates like the insulated attic space. Shelves were built for storage and insulation was added between the beams.

Gary Caldwell for ELi

Charlie and Diana are happy to live in a walkable community and to know so many of their neighbors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY29vbGVzdC10ZXNsYS1mZWF0dXJlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,14 coolest Tesla features that put your regular car to shame,"Tesla's reputation often precedes it. But no matter what you think of the electric car company's ""unique"" CEO — with his active Twitter presence and unorthodox methods for selling EVs (no advertising no dealerships all online) — Tesla's vehicles are not like any other.

Sure there are other electric cars out there that feature regenerative braking one-pedal driving instant acceleration and fast charging. But that still doesn't make them anything like Tesla.

And no car brand from the EVs to the gasoline-fueled options comes with as many hidden modes and settings as Tesla.

Here's a rundown of the Tesla-only features that make Tesla well Tesla.

1. Only one touchscreen

The Tesla experience is like no other. Credit: Yuriko Nakao / Getty Images

Tesla's newest cars are the Model 3 and Y; both feature the same sparse interior with a single center screen that controls everything you need to do from running the car and playing the radio to finding driving directions. No other car has such a pared-down layout. Even the button to open the glove compartment is on the one and only screen.

2. Autopilot

Available since around 2015 Autopilot started as an extra feature you could add for a hefty fee to complement your driving. The advanced driving system would auto-steer keep up with other vehicles brake for slower traffic and generally help out with highway driving as long as the driver kept eyes on the road and hands on the wheel.

Now most of those features come included as part of Tesla's basic safety system. But there's also Full Self-Driving mode for a current upgrade price of $10000 which claims to be hands-free driving that can stop at stop signs and traffic lights make automatic lane changes and eventually auto-steer on any road even off the highway. So far only a select group of beta testers are using the full FSD package. It's been a rough start with FSD mode struggling in dense urban areas.

3. Supercharging

Tesla has its own charging network exclusive to Tesla owners. Other EVs (like Rivian and Jeep) are starting to build out their own networks as well but none are as extensive as Tesla's. Supercharging is available across the U.S. and in other countries where Teslas are sold: There are more than 25000 superchargers. The fast charging adds up to 200 miles in 15 minutes. No longer free like it was in the early days of Tesla you either pay by the minute or kilowatt using a credit card loaded into the car computer.

4. Free over-the-air updates

Other car companies are catching up but Tesla was the first to treat its cars like cellphones. Just like you update your iPhone with the latest iOS via a free over-the-air software update Tesla's software connects to WiFi and can update a long list of car functions. When there was a braking problem a few years ago an OTA update even fixed that.

5. Keycard access

It's like a hotel room keycard but for your car. You don't have to take it out for it to work but if you have it out you can touch it to the door side panel to unlock the door. You can also open the car from your smartphone with the Tesla app installed.

That's your car key. Credit: Silas Stein / picture alliance via Getty Images

6. Sentry mode

Other cars have security systems but not like Sentry mode. If someone gets too close to your Tesla for too long the cameras start recording a message appears on the screen that the car is recording and classical music starts playing from the audio system. You can turn on Sentry mode to keep away any would-be intruders or vandals.

7. Dog mode

Just like it sounds like Dog mode is for dogs to chill in the car. Parked cars overheat and are unsafe for dogs but with this mode engaged the car is kept cool with the air system still on even with the car in park. Plus an on-screen message on the center console says ""My owner will be back soon"" to let passersby know your dog is safe.

8. Ludicrous and Plaid mode

Turning this on in a Model S means you need to brace for super-fast acceleration. With Plaid activated the car can go up to 200 mph and accelerates to 60 mph in under two seconds.

9. Bioweapon defense mode

This mode came in handy during the devastating Western U.S. wildfires throughout 2020. It's only available with Model S and X cars that have a HEPA filtration system that automatically turns the car into a safe breathing space.

10. Netflix Hulu YouTube streaming

You can watch all your favorite shows in your Tesla. But don't get too excited; the car has to be parked for streaming to work. You can log onto the various streaming platforms when waiting in the car most likely while charging up.

11. Caraoke

More entertainment in the car! This time it's karaoke with lyrics to popular songs appearing on the touchscreen when parked. But since it's in the car it's been appropriately renamed ""Caraoke.""

12. The frunk

Tesla paved the way with the portmanteau of ""front"" and ""trunk"" to create the concept of a ""frunk."" People put anything from presents pooches (see below) to extra charging cords in the front compartment. While most electric vehicles now feature a cargo space under the hood where an internal combustion engine used to sit Tesla did it first with the Model S.

13. Fart mode

You can make your Tesla fart or at least sound like it's farting. Officially called Emissions testing mode the setting is perfect for pranksters. You can turn on the fart sounds on-demand or when you push the turn signal. You have to be in the car to release the farts.

14. Easter eggs

Beyond all the various modes and games more surprises are sprinkled throughout the car. There's a Christmas jingle hidden within the settings along with an inside joke about cowbells. Wikipedia has a list of all the Tesla Easter eggs discovered so far. Happy egg hunting!

Bonus: Elon Musk as CEO

Elon Musk is one of a kind and eccentric as hell. On top of running Tesla he's sending rockets into space with SpaceX trying to reinvent the subway with his other company The Boring Company and trying to hack the human mind with Neuralink his brain implantation startup.

Federal awards include direct awards from a federal agency and federal funds passed through to an entity from a state or local government or from another nonprofit.

Nonprofits and state and local governments are subject to a federal Single Audit if they expend $750000 or more of federal financial assistance in their fiscal year. This includes COVID-19 assistance either in grants or loans and all their other non-COVID-19 federal financial assistance expended in their fiscal year. Loans obtained under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) are not subject to a Single Audit.

OMB Compliance Supplement

The guidance and requirements that auditors must follow to perform Single Audits are included in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) Compliance Supplement. Although the Supplement is written for auditors it is also a very good resource for organizations that received and expended federal awards. The Supplement has helpful information to assist recipients of federal grants with the regulations and requirements of the federal program.

The Supplement is an annual document and the latest one was issued in August 2020 without coverage of the COVID-19 federal awards. An addendum was issued in December 2020 relating to COVID-19 funding.

Federal awards have a specific Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number. CFDA numbers are the system for identifying and sorting the more than 2000 federal programs. Each CFDA number contains five digits in the following format: ##.### (e.g. 10.001). The first two digits signify the federal agency. Auditors must test compliance with the federal rules and regulations based upon the CFDA number of the federal program. Not all federal programs are included in the Supplement but many of the largest and more common federal programs are. The Supplement includes specific audit programs for numerous federal programs that auditors must use to perform their Single Audit tests. It details the audit objectives and suggested audit procedures.

The Supplement consists of seven parts and nine appendices. The seven parts are as follows:

Background Purpose and Applicability. Part 1 contains general Single Audit information.

Part 1 contains general Single Audit information. Matrix of Compliance Requirements. Part 2 identifies which of the 12 types of compliance requirements are subject to audit for the federal programs included in this supplement.

Part 2 identifies which of the 12 types of compliance requirements are subject to audit for the federal programs included in this supplement. Compliance Requirements. Part 3 includes the generic program objectives and audit procedures pertaining to the 12 types of compliance requirements.

Part 3 includes the generic program objectives and audit procedures pertaining to the 12 types of compliance requirements. Agency Program Requirements. Part 4 contains the specific program objectives and procedures by federal agency and CFDA number. When any of these five types of compliance requirements are applicable to a program (activities allowed or unallowed; eligibility; matching level of effort earmarking; reporting; and special tests and provisions) this part will always provide information specific to the program. The other seven types of requirements are not specific to a program and therefore are not included again in Part 4 as they are in Part 3.

Part 4 contains the specific program objectives and procedures by federal agency and CFDA number. When any of these five types of compliance requirements are applicable to a program (activities allowed or unallowed; eligibility; matching level of effort earmarking; reporting; and special tests and provisions) this part will always provide information specific to the program. The other seven types of requirements are not specific to a program and therefore are not included again in Part 4 as they are in Part 3. Clusters of Programs. Part 5 identifies those programs that are to be considered clusters of federal programs.

Part 5 identifies those programs that are to be considered clusters of federal programs. Internal Control. Part 6 describes characteristics of internal control related to each of the five components of internal control.

Part 6 describes characteristics of internal control related to each of the five components of internal control. Guidance for Auditing Programs Not Included in This Compliance Supplement. Part 7 states that for those programs not covered in the Supplement the auditor must consider the applicability of all 12 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3.

The Single Audit compliance requirements are grouped into the following 12 areas:

Activities Allowed or Unallowed. These are the activities that the federal program has determined the funds can be used for or cannot be used for. Since this is very specific to each federal program it is therefore included in the audit program in Part 4.

Allowable Costs. This describes the types of costs that can be charged to a federal program. Generally only necessary and reasonable costs qualify. There are however certain costs that are not allowed to be charged to a federal program such as fines penalties bad debt tobacco and alcohol. Because this requirement applies to all federal programs it is included once in Part 3. Part 3B of the Supplement has an extensive list of selected items of cost and whether they are unallowable allowable or allowable with restrictions.

Cash Management. Most federal programs are either funded on a reimbursement basis advances or a combination of both. For advances an organization must minimize the time that elapses between the receipt of the funds and the disbursements. For reimbursements an organization must pay for the program costs with their own funds prior to requesting reimbursement. Because this requirement applies to all federal programs it is included once in Part 3. The requirements are detailed in Part 3C.

Eligibility. This relates to beneficiary eligibility not organizational eligibility. The specific requirements for eligibility are unique to each federal program. The eligibility requirements are detailed in Part 4.

Equipment and Real Property Management. This requirement only applies if equipment or real property is purchased with federal grant funds of over $5000 or more or over the organization’s capitalization policy. Because this requirement is for all federal programs it is included once in Part 3. The requirements are detailed in Part 3F.

Matching Level of Effort Ear-marking. The specific requirements for these are unique to each federal program. The specific requirements for each federal program are listed in Part 4.

Period of Performance. Federal grants may specify a time period during which the organization may use the federal funds. If a funding period is specified the organization may charge to the award-only costs resulting from obligations incurred during the funding period and any pre-awards authorized by the federal awarding agency. The requirements can be found in Part 3H.

Procurement Suspension and Debarment. Organizations must use their own documented procurement procedures provided that the procurements conform to applicable federal statutes and the procurement requirements identified in Uniform Guidance as set out in Title 2 CFR sections 200.318–200.326. Organizations are prohibited from contracting with or making subawards under covered transactions to parties that are suspended or debarred. “Covered transactions” includes contracts awarded under a grant or cooperative agreement that are expected to equal or exceed $25000. All non-procurement transactions entered into by a pass-through entity irrespective of award amount are considered covered transactions. Because this requirement is for all federal programs it is included once in Part 3. Part 3I has the full details of the requirements.

Program Income. Program income is the gross income earned by an organization that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of a federal award. It generally represents fees charged to participants in the federal program. It can also be interest earned on loans made with federal award funds. Program income does not include interest earned on advances of federal funds or the proceeds from the sale of equipment or real property acquired with federal funds. Because this requirement is for all federal programs it is included once in Part 3. Part 3J has the full details.

Reporting. This requirement relates to the reporting required to the federal agency or the pass-through agency. It includes financial reporting (requests for advances or reimbursements) performance and special reporting. The specific requirements for reporting are unique to each federal program. The reporting requirements for each federal program are listed in Part 4.

Subrecipient Monitoring. This requirement is applicable if an organization passes the federal funds through to another organization that will be running the federal program on their behalf. The organization that passes through the funds must identify the award and applicable requirements to the other entity evaluate the risk of their noncompliance and monitor their activities. Because this requirement is for all federal programs it is included once in Part 3. Part 3M has the full details.",,,,,,,,,,,,

There were high expectations when the WFT opened the new stadium; however FedEx Field has been an unmitigated disaster for 24 years.

Look no further than Washington’s lack of success on its home field. The Football Team is under .500 at home since the stadium opened in 1997.

Washington’s record at FedEx Field is just one of many issues that have plagued the ill-fated stadium since its inception.

One of the more prevalent issues at the stadium located in suburban Maryland is the playing surface. Cincinnati quarterback Joe Burrow became the latest victim of FedEx Field last November when his season ended prematurely due to a knee injury.

Robert Griffin III’s knee injury in a 2012 playoff game was perhaps the most memorable leg injury until Alex Smith’s gruesome injury against the Houston Texans in 2018.

The oft-criticized playing surface played a hand in several of these injuries.

Fortunately it appears Washington is finally getting a new grass surface just in time for the 2021 NFL season.

Washington’s senior VP of media and content Julie Donaldson recently spoke with Pete Benevento the WFT’s director of grounds and turf at FedEx Field to discuss the new playing surface.

Benevento discussed how this year’s project is much different than previous years when his team would remove two inches of soil and replace the sod.

“Now we’ve taken it a step further” Benevento said. “We’re taking out 14 inches of subsoil back down to the heat lines and we’re going to rebuild it up with the drainage system irrigation system brand new USGA spec sand and we’re going to put on GameOnGrass sod that is grown in Charlotte North Carolina especially for us and install that sometime in mid-July.”

Donaldson asked Benevento what kind of difference this would make and he said it would make a “huge difference” for the players. He noted that head coach Ron Rivera was a big advocate for changing the playing surface.

Unlike past years Washington is completely changing the playing surface in 2021. Owner Daniel Snyder refused to make a massive change to the surface in the past and it’s likely the presence of Rivera helped push this through.

Now it will be up to the team to actually make FedEx Field into a true home-field advantage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vbmV3cy9ldmVyeXRoaW5nLXlvdS1nZXQtZm9yLXdpbm5pbmctMjAyMS11cy1vcGVuLXRvcnJleS1waW5lcy_SAU9odHRwczovL2dvbGYuY29tL25ld3MvZXZlcnl0aGluZy15b3UtZ2V0LWZvci13aW5uaW5nLTIwMjEtdXMtb3Blbi10b3JyZXktcGluZXMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's everything you get for winning the 2021 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines,"Here’s everything you get for winning the 2021 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines

Bryson DeChambeau poses with the U.S. Open trophy after winning at Winged Foot in 2020. Getty Images

Winning any major championship is the ultimate achievement for a professional golfer but the U.S. Open — widely regarded as the year’s toughest test — may be the most prestigious of them all.

In 2020 Bryson DeChambeau took home $2.25 million for his victory at Winged Foot and this year’s winner will receive the same amount. But in addition to a guaranteed place in major championship lore and an infusion of cash the winner of the U.S. Open also receives a litany of other lesser-known benefits all of which are outlined below.

Special hardware

The 2021 U.S. Open champion will enjoy a post-victory photo op on the 18th green with the 18-inch sterling-silver U.S. Open trophy which has been given to the champion since 1895. The historic original was lost in a fire in 1946 but the replacement has been going strong since then. The champion keeps the trophy for a year then can purchase a replica for the trophy cabinet at home.

In addition to the trophy the USGA also bestows a gold medal to the U.S. Open winner which in 2012 was renamed the Jack Nicklaus medal with an image of Nicklaus emblazoned upon it.

Points galore

The points allocation for winning a major championship may be worth more than the winner’s check itself. The U.S. Open champion receives 600 FedEx Cup points and 100 Official World Golf Ranking Points.

Depending on where a player is in the standings at the time of his victory these points can mean the difference between cracking the Top 50 in the world ranking which gets you ultra-exclusive invites to no-cut WGC events (read: guaranteed money) and a higher ranking on the FedEx Cup points list. If a player makes it through the FedEx Cup playoffs into the Tour Championship there’s some serious bonus money to be had.

For Ryder Cup-eligible players points are worth double at the U.S. Open and other major championships so he’ll get a boost in that department too. (The European team qualifies via World Ranking points and money earned in European Tour events which include the major championships.)

A 10-year exemption into the U.S. Open

Winning the U.S. Open grants you entry into the year’s premier major championship for a whole decade. Nice!

Invites to the other majors

The 2021 U.S. Open champion will enjoy exemptions into the year’s other three majors (the Masters PGA Championship and Open Championship) as well as the Players Championship for the next five years.

A trip to Kapalua

What better way to start 2022 than to compete in the tropical paradise that is Maui? Yep the 2021 U.S. Open champion will be eligible to play in the Tournament of Champions — another no-cut event for more guaranteed money!

Guaranteed Tour membership

PGA Tour players are independent contractors so they have to earn everything they get. And when a player wins the U.S. Open he can enjoy some nice job security with guaranteed membership on the PGA Tour for five years and the European Tour for seven years.

So there you have it! Not a bad haul for four days of great golf.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9mbGFwLmNvbS5ici9lbi9mZWQtZXgtcmV0aXJlcy1sYXN0LW1kLTEwLTEwLWluLW9wZXJhdGlvbi13b3JsZHdpZGUv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVyb2ZsYXAuY29tLmJyL2VuL2ZlZC1leC1yZXRpcmVzLWxhc3QtbWQtMTAtMTAtaW4tb3BlcmF0aW9uLXdvcmxkd2lkZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fed Ex retires world's last operational MD-10-10,"Earlier this month Fed Ex retired the last MD-10-10F in its fleet and also the last in operation in the world.

The last aircraft registration N562FE was transferred on June 04th from Memphis the main base of Fed Ex to Victorville a famous aircraft cemetery where it will be stored and soon after dismantled by the airline.

The aircraft's final flight was between Memphis and San Juan Puerto Rico carrying cargo. Soon after the plane was prepared to be quickly sent to retirement fulfilling a last flight of three hours and eight minutes.

The plane has 43 years of operation and before carrying cargo it operated on American and Hawaiian Airlines carrying passengers with registration N126AA. The plane belonged to Fed Ex itself which acquired it already used in 2003.

The aircraft underwent avionics upgrades in 2005. These were offered by Boeing itself to modernize the cockpit of these aircraft and extend their period of use.

Fed Ex continues to use the MD-10 but in the MD-10-30 version.

The MD-10 has served as a freighter for the company since at least the 1980s when it still bore the DC-10 designation. This was only changed to the MD-10 after a series of upgrades by Boeing for the DC-10 including a Glass Cockpit with digital screens in place of the analogue instruments.

FedEx revealed that it would withdraw its five Boeing MD-10 Series 10 planes before the end of 2021 and 13 MD-10 Series 30 planes in 2021 and 2022. at FedEx currently.

The MD-10 and A310 planes that are being retired lately will be directly replaced by the new 767F and 777F which the company should receive by 2023.

The average age of the FedEx MD-10 aircraft fleet is currently 401 years. They are well used.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRtajQuY29tL25ld3MvNC11cy1tZW5zLWdvbGZlcnMtcXVhbGlmeS10b2t5by1vbHltcGljc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 U.S. men's golfers qualify for Tokyo Olympics,"Four U.S. men's golfers are officially qualified for the Tokyo Olympics.

With qualification for the Olympic tournament being based on the World Golf Ranking Justin Thomas Collin Morikawa Xander Schauffele and Bryson DeChambeau are all eligible to head to Tokyo if they so choose. Dustin Johnson the No. 1 ranked U.S. golfer opted not to make the trip to Tokyo in March.

Thomas 28 is the No. 3 ranked golfer in the world. The Louisville native is a two-time PGA Player of the Year a former FedEx Cup Champion and a PGA Championship winner. He also finished in fourth place at the 2020 Masters Tournament.

Morikawa like Thomas also has a PGA Championship under his belt. Just 23 years old at the time of his major victory last August Morikawa became the third-youngest golfer to win the PGA Championship since stroke play was introduced to the PGA in 1958.

DeChambeau often referred to as ""The Scientist"" due to his eccentric personality figures to be one of the most intriguing golfers potentially headed to Tokyo. Known for his monster drives the 27-year-old has become a must-watch competitor on the teeing ground. DeChambeau won the U.S. Open in 2020 and has eight additional PGA Tour wins to his name.

Of the four qualified golfers Schauffele is the only one without a major championship victory though he has come tantalizingly close several times. The 27-year-old finished in second place at both the 2019 Masters Tournament and the 2018 British Open. He also finished third at the U.S. Open in 2019.

Thomas Morikawa Schauffele and DeChambeau each need to accept their invites to Tokyo in order to compete at the men's Olympic golf competition which is set to begin on Thursday July 29. The next golfer in line to compete in Tokyo if any of Thomas Morikawa Schauffele or DeChambeau opt not to participate would be Patrick Cantlay who's currently ranked No. 7 in the world."

Almirola posted his best finish of the season after winning the pole earlier in the day during qualifying. Stewart-Haas teammate Kevin Harvick finished fifth while Joey Logano rounded out the Ford top-10 finishers in 10th.

The race was plagued by 11 cautions for 60 laps with brakes being an issue for a number of teams. Ryan Blaney who was forced to pit road before the race even started after getting some left-rear damage on the pace laps had the first issue that sent him into the wall on lap 56. Chris Buescher ran over some debris on lap 79 after Justin Haley’s brakes failed and Cole Custer was forced to the garage for repairs when a similar issue befell his Mustang.

Kyle Larson won the race leading 264-of-300 laps. The win is his fourth of the season and comes off his triumph in the All-Star Race one week earlier.

The NASCAR Cup Series will have a doubleheader next weekend with races scheduled for Saturday and Sunday at Pocono Raceway.

ARIC ALMIROLA No. 10 Smithfield Ford Mustang

“We had a good car just my goodness we don’t have anything for those Chevrolets right now. They’re making grip and they’re getting up off the corner. It’s so hard to race with them. I can roll the center as good as some of the guys in those cars if not a little better and then it’s tough to keep up. But we have made huge strides to close the gap. Our race team is doing a great job scrounging and scrapping to build better race cars and it’s nice to come here and run up front run in the top five and at least be in the mix so it feels good. We’ll just keep building on it. The All-Star Race was a good race for us. Today again was a good race for us so we’ll just keep grinding.”

HOW WAS TODAY?

“Today was a solid day for us so it was good to bounce back and do it two weeks in a row considering we had a good race at the All-Star and come here and have another good race. It feels good.”

ALL FOUR SHR CARS WERE IN THE TOP 12 AT ONE POINT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY AS FAR AS PROGRESS?

“It means we’re working hard. We’ve had a lot of races where the 4 has been a 10th-place car and the other three of us have run 25th it seems like so we’ve been working so hard. When you run bad it’s 10 times as much work because you’re going down every single different avenue trying to figure out what’s gonna make speed in the race cars and when you have fast race cars it’s easy because you just massage on it and polish it and keep going to the racetrack with what you know is fast. We’ve been working so hard. I’m proud of everybody back at the shop and specifically this 10 team. We’ve been off and it’s been nice to get it back and go on here in the right direction after two weeks in a row of running up front.”

WHAT DOES THIS DO FOR YOUR CONFIDENCE?

“It just feels good. It’s been such a tough year and it’s easy to get down on yourself and not have a lot of confidence. Confidence is something that comes with results. You can’t fake it so it’s been nice to have two good weeks now and it certainly makes everybody have a little pep in their step and things are going in the right direction.”

HOW DO YOU FEEL THE RACE WENT TODAY AFTER 10 YEARS?

“I don’t know it was tough. The racetrack was really low on grip. The tires didn’t seem to have a lot of grip and we were just kind of slipping and sliding around. Nobody ever really felt stuck or looked stuck to the racetrack and it was just a challenge to be honest. But all in all it still put on a race. There was a green flag and there was a checkered flag and there was a winner and that’s racing. We show up to all sorts of different racetracks and we do our best to compete and try and outrun each other.”

WAS IT NICE TO HAVE TONY HERE TODAY. DID IT HELP?

“Yeah. That wasn’t the magic to make our race cars go fast but it was certainly nice to have him here. Tony is a great morale booster. He’s our boss and we all look up to him and appreciate when he’s here at the racetrack so it was certainly nice to have him here and see his smiling face and have him walking around patting everybody on the back. It’s nice.”

KEVIN HARVICK No. 4 Grave Digger Ford Mustang

“Our Monster Jam Grave Digger Ford Mustang was a lot loose at the beginning and really pretty good the second half of the race. We got some damage there when we made a little contact with the 24 and that made it a little bit tighter. I thought we were better than the 24. The 42 had fresh tires and the 10 I thought we were better than those cars. The 5 was kind of in a league of his own but once again the guys did a great job and ground away at it and came away with a top five out of gas.”

WHAT STATEMENT DOES THIS MAKE FOR THE 4 TEAM?

“I don’t know if we made a statement but we ran better.”

IS THIS WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT AS FAR AS A BUILDING BLOCK?

“Yeah I think before our damage we probably had the second-best car at the end and got a little bit of damage on the right side. I got a little bit tight and then ran out of gas off of turn four and last a couple spots but all in all it was a solid day.”

WILL THE CONVERSATION NOW INCLUDE BEING CLOSE TO A WIN?

“I don’t know. I don’t think anybody can beat the 5 right now.”

A LOT OF GUYS SAID THE TRACK WASN’T LIKE IT WAS IN PRACTICE. DO YOU AGREE?

“Yeah I think that was to be expected though with whatever they call it the resin wearing in and out. I think that was to be expected -- move around change so I don’t think that was a surprise to me.”

A LOT OF TEAMS MISSED IT ON BRAKE PACKAGES. DID YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES?

“No we didn’t have any issues.”

JOEY LOGANO No. 22 Shell/Pennzoil Ford Mustang

“We just weren’t very good. We just kept grinding and grinding to get every spot we could and did what we could to try and get the best finish. Tenth was the best we were gonna do. That’s about where we ran all day anyway after the first few laps. Once we lost our track position that’s where we were.”

CHASE BRISCOE No. 14 HighPoint.com/Thorlabs Ford Mustang

“We just lost the brakes getting into turn three. It’s super unfortunate. We had a really really good car. I feel like we were gonna be right there for a top five. We just needed a long run. Even on the short run we made our car so much better so I really hate it because that was gonna be our best run of the year for sure and something like that happens. It’s really wild with all the brake issues we’ve had today. We were able to do the Goodyear test and knew that brakes were gonna be way worse than everybody else thought. We beefed them up and it still wasn’t good enough so it’s unfortunate. We’ll go on to Pocono.”

RYAN BLANEY No. 12 Menards/Duracell Ford Mustang

“It was not a very good start to our day and not a good end either. We had an issue before the race and had to come and fix it. Then we had some brake trouble and we came in and pulled tape and then on the restart I’m not sure if I broke a rotor -- I think that’s what happened because something exploded into one and then no brakes and took a pretty big lick. It’s a shame. Just not a very good day for us and hate that it ended early. I hate it for Menards and everybody in our group and Ford but we’ll come back strong at Pocono next week.”

CHRIS BUESCHER No. 17 Fifth Third Bank Ford Mustang

“My feeling are hurt right now more than anything. The FIfth Third Bank Mustang was pretty good. We were wrapping the bottom and able to do so pretty well. We were just getting going there but right before I left pit road it looks like probably a piece of debris from the 77 cut our tire down on the way into the corner. It’s definitely unfortunate. It’s one of those luck things. It’s not like we did something wrong to cause our own DNF. That’s a bummer. I’m proud of these guys. This was a good weekend. We were strong. We had a good qualifying and practice was good. The race was gonna be a really good one as well so that one is gonna hurt as we look at the next handful of races heading to the playoffs as well so we’ll go out there and go win a race.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Pesquet and Kimbrough switched their spacesuits to battery power at 7:42 a.m. EDT (1142 GMT) Sunday to begin a planned six-and-a-half hour spacewalk.

The astronauts moved from the space station’s Quest airlock to the far port or left side of the lab’s solar power truss. Once in place Pesquet and Kimbrough completed tasks they started during Wednesday’s spacewalk.

The astronauts lost time while ground teams evaluated an issue with the controls and display module on Kimbrough’s suit Wednesday. Then mission control discussed momentary glitch with a sublimator part of the cooling system on Kimbrough’s suit.

The astronauts continued the spacewalk Wednesday and moved a new ISS Roll-Out Solar Array or iROSA unit from a temporary mounting fixture to the far port side of the station’s truss. Once at the P6 solar array work site the astronauts attached the iROSA to a mounting fixture installed on a preparatory spacewalk earlier this year then attempted to unfold the unit like a book.

But the astronauts ran into some interference as they tried to unfold the iROSA unit. With Pesquet and Kimbrough already running behind schedule due to the earlier spacesuit issues mission control called it quits and told the astronauts to head back inside the space station.

The spacewalk Sunday was originally planned to install a second iROSA solar array on the other side of the P6 truss. But after losing time on the previous spacewalk Pesquet and Kimbrough had to catch up with the work left undone Wednesday.

Kimbrough a former U.S. Army helicopter pilot swapped spacesuits for Sunday’s excursion after the troubles with his suit Wednesday.

The International Space Station has eight power channels each fed with electrical power generated from one solar array wing extending from the station’s truss backbone. The original solar panels launched on four space shuttle missions from 2000 to 2009.

As expected the solar panel efficiency has degraded over time. NASA is upgrading the space station’s power system with the new roll-out solar arrays which will partially cover six of the station’s eight original solar panels.

When all six iROSA units are deployed on the station the power system will be capable of generating 215 kilowatts of electricity to support at least another decade of science operations. The enhancement will also accommodate new commercial modules planned to launch to the space station.

The first pair of iROSA wings will go on the oldest solar panel module — named P6 — on the far left or port side of the space station. They launched to the space station on a SpaceX Cargo Dragon capsule earlier this month. The new solar arrays were supplied to NASA by Boeing Redwire and a team of subcontractors.

Fully deployed the roll-out solar arrays stretch 63 feet long and 20 feet wide (19-by-6 meters) about half the length and half the width of the station’s current solar arrays. Despite their smaller size each of the new arrays will generate about the same amount of electricity as each of the station’s existing solar panels.

A mounting bracket plugs the new arrays into the station’s power channels and rotary joints which keep the solar wings pointed at the sun as the spacecraft races around Earth at more than 17000 mph.

Early on in Sunday’s spacewalk Pesquet and Kimbrough separated the two parts of the iROSA fixture on the 2B power channel at the P6 truss segment. The astronauts drove bolts to secure the array in place then mated power cables to connect the new array to the space station’s electrical grid.

The cables were mated when the space station was flying over the night side of the Earth when the old P6 solar array was not generating any power. Then the astronauts released clamps keeping the roll-out solar array spooled in its launch configuration.

Beginning at 11:24 a.m. EDT (1524 GMT) the array gradually unrolled using strain energy in the composite booms supporting the solar blanket. The design of the deployment mechanism eliminates the need for motors to drive the solar array.

The carbon fiber support booms were rolled back against their natural shape for storage during launch.

After about 10 minutes the iROSA blanket reached its full length of 63 feet.

“Good news you two” Canadian astronaut Jenni-Sidey Gibbons radioed the spacewalkers from mission control in Houston. “You can probably can see most of what we can see. We’re tracking a full and good deploy of that solar array so well done both of you.”

Pesquet then adjusted tensioning bolts to secure the iROSA blanket in place.

The astronauts then headed back in-board on the space station’s truss to prep a second iROSA unit which Pesquet and Kimbrough will move to the P6 truss segment during a spacewalk tentatively scheduled for Friday June 25.

The astronauts will connect the second iROSA unit to the 4B power channel on the opposite side of the P6 truss from the blanket they deployed Sunday. If all goes well on Friday’s excursion they will repeat the steps they accomplished Sunday to unroll the second iROSA blanket.

Astronauts deploy first roll-out solar array to boost power for station



June 20 2021 — Two astronauts working outside the International Space Station successfully rolled out a new type of solar array providing the orbiting outpost with its first power boost in decades.



NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough and French astronaut Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency conducted a six-hour and 28-minute extravehicular activity (EVA) on Sunday (June 20) to finish the installation and deployment of the first International Space Station (ISS) Roll-Out Solar Array (iROSA). The two Expedition 65 crewmates resumed work where they had left off on a spacewalk on Wednesday (June 16) by overcoming an interference issue that initially prevented them from unfolding the array fully.



""Yeah! It has been engaged! Woohoo!"" Pesquet exclaimed after the array was aligned with its mounting bracket. At the advice of Mission Control Pesquet and Kimbrough used wire ties and tethers to assist in fully extending the 20-foot-long (6 meter) 750-pound (340-kg) assembly.



The astronauts then secured bolts and ran cables to the new array the latter tying the iROSA into the same power channel (P6/2B) as the 20-year-old legacy array that it was installed to augment on the far left (port) side of the station's backbone truss. For safety concerns the spacewalkers waited until the space station was in a nighttime pass to connect the electrical cables.



The station's eight original arrays have begun showing degraded power output as they have exceed their 15-year design life. The new roll-out solar arrays are being installed in front of and partially overlaying six of the older arrays. When used in tandem the upgraded system will be capable of increasing the station's electricity supply by 20 to 30 percent.



""These new ISS Roll-Out Solar Arrays are pretty fantastic. It is pretty incredible to see the material they are [made] out of for one"" Kimbrough said in a recent NASA interview. ""They are this lightweight flexible composite blanket material that can get stowed very compactly but when it is rolled out and deployed it can bring in a lot of sunlight which in our case will give us a lot of power for the station.""



The first pair of the new arrays were launched in the unpressurized ""trunk"" of the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft that arrived at the space station on June 5. The IROSAs were built by Deployable Space Systems (DSS) and were configured for launch and installation on the station by Boeing.



Unlike the legacy arrays no motor was needed to deploy the iROSA to its 63-foot (19 meter) length. After Pesquet released two final bolts the potential energy held by the array's rolled-up carbon composite booms was enough to unroll the array. The entire process took about six minutes.



""Good news you two. As you can probably see most of what we can see we are tracking a full and good deploy of that solar array"" Jenni Sidey a Canadian Space Agency astronaut serving as the ground intravehicular officer in Mission Control in Houston radioed Pesquet and Kimbrough once the deployment was complete. ""So well done both of you.""



""Congratulations to everyone involved in that project"" replied Pesquet.



In addition to ensuring that the space station has enough power the iROSAs are also serving as a test for NASA's Artemis Gateway to be deployed in orbit around the moon. The Gateway's planned arrays will be longer and be deployed remotely but otherwise will use the same technology from the same company.



Sunday's EVA was originally intended to install and deploy the second iROSA on the P6 truss' 4B power channel array. With the first iROSA now extended Kimbrough and Pesquet were able to work on some ""get-ahead"" tasks for their next spacewalk together now scheduled for Friday (June 25) to install and deploy the second array.



This was the 240th spacewalk in support of space station assembly. The EVA which began at 7:42 a.m. and ended at 2:10 p.m. EDT (1142 to 1810 GMT) was the eighth for Kimbrough and the fourth for Pesquet. The pair arrived at the station as members of SpaceX's Crew-2 aboard Dragon Endeavour in April.



Kimbrough has now spent 52 hours and 43 minutes on spacewalks. Pesquet has logged 26 hours and 15 minutes.

The Extravehicular Activity (EVA) – officially known as US EVA-75 – began at 11:42 UTC / 07:42 EDT when Thomas Pesquet from the European Space Agency (ESA) and Shane Kimbrough from NASA took their spacesuits to battery power before exiting the Quest Airlock to begin their work.

IROSA background

The eight original Solar Array Wings (SAWs) on the ISS which each produce around 30 kilowatts (kW) of power for a total of about 250kW are beginning to show signs of degradation with the oldest array now having been in space since 2000 when the P6 truss and associated arrays was delivered to the station by Shuttle Endeavour’s STS-97 crew.

With over 20 years of use and normal degradation of solar arrays the eight SAWs now only produce around 160kW of power – against a backdrop of rising power demands from the station’s increasing users.

This led the Station program to develop the ISS Power Augmentation (IPA) plan which called for adding six additional solar arrays to the station in order to restore the outpost’s power generation to its original levels.

Under the IPA program six new ISS Roll Out Solar Arrays (IROSAs) will be added. Whilst the station’s original arrays were folded up and deployed in an accordion-like manner the IROSAs are a new type of array technology which roll out in a mat-like manner from inside a cylindrical canister.

The IROSAs will be installed on top of six of the station’s existing solar arrays which will allow the IROSAs to utilize the same sun-tracking motors and be connected into the same electrical system as the current arrays.

With the IROSAs being around 30% efficient compared to the 14% efficiency of the original arrays the IROSAs will generate roughly the same amount of power as the originals despite being only half their size.

Each IROSA will produce 20kW of additional power for a total of 120kW across all six arrays.

However because the IROSAs are smaller they will not completely cover the half of the six SAWs they’ll be installed over. Instead portions of the original arrays will still be power positive.

The unshadowed portions of the original arrays will continue to produce 95kW as a result making for a combined total of 215kW of power available to the ISS — an increase of nearly a third compared with the outpost’s current levels.

👨‍🚀👨‍🚀 @astro_kimbrough and I will be heading out soon to install some solar panels ☀. @NASA has been preparing for these spacewalks for over 1.5 years the instructions span 28 pages it is astounding what humans can do with teamwork. See you later! 👋 https://t.co/47F4dCffAE pic.twitter.com/691s65ZSit — Thomas Pesquet (@Thom_astro) June 16 2021

This first IROSA was launched along with the second aboard the SpaceX CRS-22 cargo Dragon mission that launched from Florida back on 3 June.

The first EVA encounter numerous issues primarily with Shane Kimbrough’s suit and a hardware interference with the solar array deployment that brought an end to the spacewalk well before the main objectives could be accomplished.

EVA-74 issues

US EVA-74 encountered numerous issues primarily with Shane Kimbrough’s suit and a hardware interference with the solar array unfolding that brought an end to the spacewalk well before the main objectives could be accomplished

After exiting the Quest Airlock the first task for the pair was to translate out to the IROSA Flight Support Equipment (FSE). However in a somewhat sign of things to come the hatch covering would not close at first and Shane had to spend more time than planned getting the airlock’s fabric hatch covering configured properly.

The FSE pallet on which the pair of IROSAs are attached was removed from cargo Dragon’s trunk by Canadarm2 also known officially as the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) — part of the overall Mobile Base System on the station. Canadarm2 then installed the FSE onto the Mobile Base System (MBS) Payload ORU Accommodation (POA).

For Pesquet and Kimbrough after translating to the FSE the duo began setup of the worksite and released launch restraint bolts on the IROSA.

However before the EVA could progress further two issues were noted with Shane’s suit. First a sensor in the suit’s sublimator — which provides pressure — registered a spike. Shortly thereafter the Display and Control Module (DCM) in his suit malfunctioned necessitating an immediate return to the Quest Airlock to connect back to Station umbilicals to attempt a restart of the unit.

The “warm restart” of the DCM meant that Shane’s suit momentarily lost its cooling and CO2 scrubbing capabilities; however this is an acceptable condition per EVA procedures when attempting to “warm restart” a DCM. A failure to restart the unit would have meant a premature end to the EVA.

The restart was successful and ground teams sent Shane back out to Thomas while managers and engineers continued to discuss the sublimator issue — which itself could have also stop the EVA early. Fortunately through a series of suit configuration tests ground teams were able to determine that the sublimator was functioning properly and that a faulty sensor likely triggered an erroneous pressure increase reading.

With his suit good to go Kimbrough translated out to the P6 truss installation site — specifically the 2B Integrated Electronics Assembly (IEA) — to begin more setup while Pesquet – mounted to the end of Canadarm2 – held on to the IROSA while he was “flown” out toward the P6 truss.

Inside the ISS in the Robotics Work Station in the Cupola viewing module NASA astronaut Megan McArthur controlled Canadarm2; she was the one to physically drive Pesquet out toward the P6 truss.

Due to the fact that P6 is at the very outboard end of the station Canadarm2 cannot reach all the way to the worksite meaning Pesquet had to hand-off the IROSA to Kimbrough who then in turn held on to it whilst Pesquet dismounted the arm and repositioned.

Once Pesquet was in position Kimbrough handed the IROSA back to him. The duo then aligned the IROSA onto the mounting bracket of the “Mod Kit” — which was installed during a spacewalk earlier this year — at the base of the 2B Mast Canister Assembly (MCA).

The IROSA was first soft-docked onto the mounting bracket before an attempt to unfolded it into its deployment configuration stalled due to interference/blockage from a nearby structure. At this point already at the six hour mark into the spacewalk ground teams decided to have the duo photograph the interference and firmly secure the IROSA as is and end the spacewalk.

Teams will now evaluate a path forward to unfold the array which must happen before it can be unfurled.

Thomas and Shane also did not mount four electrical connections between the IROSA and the 2B MCA in order to connect the IROSA into the electrical system of the current 2B solar array as they ran out of time.

After returning to the Quest Airlock the duo took their suits off battery power at 19:26 UTC / 15:26 EDT concluding the 7 hour 15 minute spacewalk.

EVA-75 success

Sunday’s spacewalk successfully completed the main objectives of US EVA-74 as well as saw “get ahead” tasks performed to reduce the amount of work needed in five days when the next spacewalk to install the second IROSA array is slated to occur.

After leaving the Quest airlock Thomas took the lead moving to the worksite on the P6 truss. The pair worked to unfold the new solar array on the 2B power channel that experienced the interference on the previous EVA.

This time the mitigation strategies developed on the ground worked and Thomas and Shane were able the secure the IROSA properly before running electrical and data connections between the new array and the station’s power system. The crew members then successfully deployed the solar array from its flight support structure — marking the first time since 2009 that a new array was unfurled on the station. Until this spacewalk the newest solar arrays for the station were those on the S6 truss delivered by the STS-119 crew of the Space Shuttle Discovery.

With a success behind them Thomas and Shane then turned their attention to get-ahead work for the second IROSA installation currently scheduled for US EVA-76 on 25 June.

That get ahead work involved releasing the upper support beams that were needed for launch and delivery.

The EVA officially concluded at 18:09 UTC / 14:09 EDT.

Overall US EVA-75 was the 240th EVA in support of station construction and maintenance and the eighth spacewalk so far this year outside the outpost.

French astronaut Thomas Pesquet and NASA's Shane Kimbrough made their second spacewalk in less than a week to install new solar panels on the International Space Station.

The pair were continuing a project they started on Wednesday which ground to a halt after spacesuit and other issues stopped them from unrolling the first in a series of high-tech solar panels.

NASA originally planned two spacewalks for the job; one for each solar panel. But managers have scheduled a third because of the earlier problems.

The new solar wings are designed to roll out like a red carpet unlike the station's old ones which unfolded like an accordion.

Pesquet and Kimbrough managed to bolt down the first solar wing last week but had to delay making the electrical connections or unfurling the panel to its full 19-metre length.

On Sunday pushing and tugging the spacewalkers managed to unfold and align the solar panel so both halves were end to end resembling a roll of paper towels. Their shout of “Woo-hoo!"" was met with applause in Mission Control.

The two had to wait until they were back on the night side of Earth so that the station's old solar panels were no longer soaking up sunlight or they could have been shocked.

While awaiting darkness the camera-and-light assembly on Kimbrough's helmet had come loose and was secured by Pesquet with wire ties as the minutes ticked by. This time the final step — the actual unfurling — went off without a hitch.

The slow but steady extension on Sunday took 10 minutes in total with station cameras providing live TV views. “It is beautiful” Pesquet called out.

The pair will go back out Friday to complete work on the second panel which was delivered by private firm SpaceX earlier this month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3NwYWNlY29hc3RkYWlseS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi9uYXNhLWFzdHJvbmF1dC1zaGFuZS1raW1icm91Z2gtZXNhLWFzdHJvbmF1dC10aG9tYXMtcGVzcXVldC1jb21wbGV0ZS1maXJzdC1yb2xsLW91dC1zb2xhci1hcnJheS1pbnN0YWxsYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASA Astronaut Shane Kimbrough ESA Astronaut Thomas Pesquet Complete First Roll Out Solar Array Installation,"NASA Astronaut Shane Kimbrough ESA Astronaut Thomas Pesquet Complete First Roll Out Solar Array Installation

second solar array upgrade tentatively scheduled for June 25

(NASA) – NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough and ESA (European Space Agency) astronaut Thomas Pesquet concluded their spacewalk at 2:10 p.m. EDT after 6 hours and 28 minutes.

In the eighth spacewalk of the year outside the International Space Station the two astronauts completed the deployment of a new ISS Roll-Out Solar Array (iROSA) on the far end of the left (port) side of the station’s backbone truss structure (P6).

Kimbrough and Pesquet successfully unfolded the solar array bolted it into place and connected cables to the station’s power supply to complete deployment.

Additionally the astronauts removed and stowed hardware in preparation for releasing the second iROSA from the flight support structure for installation.

The pair will work toward the second solar array upgrade – this one on the P6 truss’ 4B power channel – during another spacewalk tentatively scheduled for June 25.

NASA is augmenting six of the eight existing power channels of the space station with new solar arrays to ensure a sufficient power supply is maintained for NASA’s exploration technology demonstrations for Artemis and beyond as well as utilization and commercialization.

This was the eighth spacewalk for Kimbrough the fourth for Pesquet and the fourth they have conducted together. Kimbrough has now spent a total of 52 hours and 43 minutes spacewalking and Pesquet’s total spacewalking time is 26 hours and 15 minutes.

Space station crew members have conducted 240 spacewalks in support of assembly and maintenance of the orbiting laboratory. Spacewalkers have now spent a total of 63 days and 56 minutes working outside the station.

In November 2020 the International Space Station surpassed its 20-year milestone of continuous human presence providing opportunities for unique research and technological demonstrations that help prepare for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars and also improve life on Earth. In that time 244 people from 19 countries have visited the orbiting laboratory that has hosted nearly 3000 research investigations from researchers in 108 countries and areas."

The team is hoping that sentiment is backed up with cash as the future of the minor league baseball team has become a concern recently.

That’s because a new deal between Major League Baseball and minor league teams like the Fightins requires that stadiums must meet a new set of standards. And the city-owned FirstEnergy Stadium falls short.

If nothing is done there is a chance Major League Baseball could eventually take the team away.

Reading Fightin Phils General Manager Scott Hunsicker said Friday during an interview with the Reading Eagle that he has been overwhelmed by the support the team has received from elected officials.

“All of them have passionately pledged their support to us” he said adding that he still has a few more officials to meet so that he can explain the situation. “But most importantly many of them have already signed on to the effort to help us get the state funding needed to meet these new standards.”

That effort comes in the form of sending a letter to Gov. Tom Wolf asking for some state assistance. The letters request matching grant funds to help cover the estimated $15 million it will cost to upgrade the stadium.

Hunsicker said he believes the project is a perfect candidate to receive funds through the Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program. The mission of that program is to provide money for the acquisition and construction of regional economic recreational and historical improvement projects.

The team submitted its request for $7.5 million in matching funds in March and is expected to find out sometime next month if they have secured a grant. And Hunsicker said the letters from local leaders will bolster their case.

“It really helps our chances of getting this grant if we can show that we have the support back home to get this done” he said.

But words are only half the battle. The hard part Hunsicker said will be getting firm commitments from county and city officials to put up the money needed to match the request from the state.

Hunsicker said the team has agreed to contribute $3 million to the project. They are now hoping that the county and city will put in the same amount to get it done.

“We’re really at the point now where we have to figure out the local part of this equation from a funding standpoint” he said. “This is where the rubber hits the road.”

Hunsicker who had previously declined to speak with the Eagle about the situation said he now feels comfortable enough with the scope of the project to have a conversation about what it will take to make it a reality.

“There’s no reason to dance around it” he said. “The economic scenario is if the Fightin Phils the county and the city can each commit to putting up $3 million and if the state can give us the $7.5 million then we can make this work.”

Meeting the requirements

To bring FirstEnergy Stadium up to the new standards a lot of work needs to be done to the 70-year-old facility.

Hunsicker said FirstEnergy Stadium falls short of Major League Baseball’s new standards mostly in health and wellness requirements. That means things like the size of locker rooms and weight rooms and having an adequate health and nutrition area.

“These standards are new and certainly didn’t exist when this stadium was built in the 1950s” he said. “We’ve done a number of renovations over the last few decades to keep up with the requirements but this is just the next round.”

If a large portion of the upgrades aren’t done to the stadium by 2023 Major League Baseball could revoke the team’s license and create a new Double-A affiliate for the Phillies elsewhere.

Hunsicker said the team is fighting hard to make sure that doesn’t happen. But it’s going to require a big project.

Hunsicker said that unfortunately there is no room in the existing stadium to make the needed renovations. So the best option is to build a new facility to fulfill these new mandates.

He said the team is currently designing the building.

It needs to include a locker room for female officials and coaches bigger locker and training rooms for both the home and away teams a new weight room a designated commissary area and indoor batting tunnels.

The plan is to build the facility behind the centerfield wall along Route 61.

Hunsicker said to meet the 2023 deadline the project needs to break ground by next spring. That makes for a tight timeline.

“That’s why the immediacy of this is so important” he said.

While all minor league teams are having the same conversations about how to meet these new standards Hunsicker said the needs appear to be more acute at the Reading stadium compared to the others in Pennsylvania.

Hunsicker said the league measures the standards at stadiums by a penalty score that indicates how many standards the team is deficient in based on the guidelines.

While an official review by Major League Baseball has not yet happened he has been doing his own analysis of where FirstEnergy Stadium stands on meeting these new standards and has estimated that the team will have 114 penalty points.

Hunsicker said he believes most other minor league stadiums have a penalty score of around 50 points.

Major League Baseball has said that by 2023 teams will have to have 30 penalty points or less to keep their license. That number then drops to 20 points in 2024 and to 10 points by 2025.

Hunsicker said building the new facility will immediately bring the team down to that 10 penalty point window.

Making the pitch

To Hunsicker upgrading FirstEnergy Stadium comes down to a cost-benefit analysis.

He said the economic component of the project is not how much money the project will cost but how much money it could cost the region if the team was no longer here. He said it’s estimated that a AA-franchise drives $20 million to $24 million into a host community each year.

“That’s really our compelling argument” he said. “We have a treasure here that people come from all over to visit and our community has already invested a lot of money into making this stadium the historical showpiece that it is. And now we’ve all got to come together to figure out how to keep that momentum going.”

Hunsicker said hopefully all the parties can come to an agreement sometime soon so that they can show the state that they are ready to put the state grant to good use.

“Look we understand that the city and county have very important issues that they are facing” he said. “We completely understand that so there are no leverage games being played behind the scenes. But now is the tough part.”

He said he also realizes that there are some residents who feel that Major League Baseball – a multibillion-dollar business – should be footing some of the bill.

“It’s a fair question to ask” he said noting that the team is committed to giving back to the community through various partnerships with local organizations and with its Baseballtown Charities. “If the community is OK with letting the team go away then I see the point of the argument. But at the same time I think people forget all the goodwill and economic benefit we bring to the community.”

Hunsicker said those people must also remember that there are many other cities waiting for an opportunity to score a minor league team. There have been 43 affiliated teams that had their licenses taken away since 2019 who would jump at the chance to welcome a new team he said.

“This is the reality of the situation” he said. “If we are not willing to make the investment to meet the requirement we run the risk of having this franchise being relocated. And that is the decision that has to be made.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYmFsbHBhcmtkaWdlc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMTkvaGlnaC1hLW1pbGItYmVzdC1vZi10aGUtYmFsbHBhcmtzLW1vdmVzLXRvLXNlY29uZC1yb3VuZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,High-A MiLB Best of the Ballparks moves to second round,"After a first round with plenty of last-minute decisions we’re now on to the second round of the High-A MiLB Best of the Ballparks fan vote as we ask you to pick your faves for 2021.

The results of first round were all over the place with some blowouts and some very close decisions–for instance Dow Diamond (Great Lakes Loons) prevailed by two votes and Frawley Stadium (Wilmington Blue Rocks) won by just six votes. Three of the top nine seeds were eliminated: Fluor Field (Greenville Drive) First National Bank Field (Greensboro Grasshoppers) and Day Air Ballpark (Dayton Dragons). Receiving the most votes in contested brackets: Modern Woodmen Park (Quad Cities River Bandits) Gesa Stadium (Tri-City Dust Devils) FirstEnergy Park (Jersey Shore BlueClaws) Maimonides Park (Brooklyn Cyclones) Jackson Field (Lansing Lugnuts) and Nat Bailey Stadium (Vancouver Canadians). So we move on to the Sweet Sixteen round.

This year’s High-A competition looks drastically different than previous High-A votes; the 2021 reorganization of Minor League Baseball eliminated the California Carolina and Florida State Leagues with many teams in that level of competition lowered to Low-A ball or eliminated completely. This High-A lineup contains most of the former Low-A Midwest League several former Low-A Sally League teams some former Carolina League teams and several former Short Season A Northwest League and NY-Penn League teams. Of this new lineup only the former Carolina League teams competed at the High-A level in prior years. Old name new competition.

We know from marketing stats that a third of our readers work in the baseball industry so we’re tapping into that collective expertise. And we know from our research that a third of our readers sell to the baseball industry so that expertise will be valuable as well. The remaining third–fans media government–will certainly have a different view on things as well. We can’t wait to see what our readers–whom we consider to be the smartest folks in baseball–say about the best of the ballparks.

This was a challenge to seed: ballparks formerly in three levels of play including Short Season A were hard to compare. There is no uniformity at this level yet–there are ballparks here that are the pride of MiLB and other ballparks are college facilities lacking a visitors clubhouse. And while we expect plenty of facility upgrades in coming years they’re not all planned out or implemented. We will be eager to see what our readers think of the new High-A lineup. These seeds are based on previous rankings. Last year’s High-A champion The Diamond (Lake Elsinore Storm) is now competing at the Low-A level.

Crowds have returned for the Bucks' playoff run.,"The Milwaukee Bucks' 2021 playoff run has generated new life — and large crowds — to Deer District outside Fiserv Forum following a difficult year.

And if the crowds for the just-finished semifinals round are any indication this year's Eastern Conference Finals — which open Wednesday night with the Bucks hosting the Atlanta Hawks — will only build on the excitement.

Fans wanting to jump on the bandwagon will find much the same atmosphere in Deer District following Fiserv Forum's opening mid-2018 and the 2019 playoff excitement — with a few notable changes.

And it's all welcome news for the Bucks which like so many other businesses want to forget 2020 look ahead and renew their efforts to recreate a key corner of downtown Milwaukee.

Thousands rediscover Deer District

Thousands of fans rediscovered the plaza during the semifinal round and on Saturday night the joy over the thrilling Game 7 overtime win against Brooklyn was felt throughout downtown.

""It's a great time a great atmosphere. The people of Milwaukee are excited for the Bucks"" said Steve Poulos a Milwaukee resident who was watching Game 5 last week at the plaza.

Dustin Godsey chief marketing officer for the Bucks said the team will add an additional screen to the plaza so more fans can see the action. Crews were raising that screen Tuesday on the site of the old Bradley Center.

The Bucks are also reconfiguring food and beverage locations to try and expedite service he said. The plaza will open two hours before road games; for previous games the plaza opened one hour before road games.

Fans without tickets to the game will only be able to enter the plaza from the south end on North Phillips Avenue.

But fans looking for a glimpse of TNT commentator Charles Barkley — who has been on and off the Bucks bandwagon — will be disappointed. Unlike in 2019 the network is not planning to have an outdoor studio stage for this round.

Normally the crew from ""Inside the NBA"" on TNT would travel to the site of the conference finals but this year the crew led by Wauwatosa's own Ernie Johnson will be staying at their studio in Atlanta.

Turner Sports hired a Ripon company Leading Edge Productions to set up a 30-foot arm camera on the plaza which will deliver aerial shots during the action.

""It's a great camera to fly over things and get these beautiful aerials"" said Jim Soyk Leading Edge owner.

Punch Bowl Social remains closed

There are some differences on the food and drinks front as well.

The parent company for Punch Bowl Social filed for bankruptcy and closed its stores in the spring of 2020. The Milwaukee location — a large space directly across the plaza from the arena — remains dark and the company has announced no reopening plans.

That's a big blow for fans who want to come to the plaza and find food drink and tables. The Bucks-owned Mecca sports bar remains open — reservations recommended — as is Drink Wisconsinbly and Good City Brewing.

Similar to many businesses in the retail and entertainment industry the COVID-19 pandemic decimated business at the bars and restaurants in Deer District.

The Mecca Bar & Grill operated by the Bucks and food service provider Levy barely survived 2020 said Bucks and Fiserv Forum President Peter Feigin.

The sports bar was on the verge of shutting down he said.

""The pandemic started to shut us down completely and until we really had full capacity which is literally two weeks ago we've just seen in a very fast accelerated rate we're seeing revenue and attendance resemble what it did two years ago"" Feigin said.

Saturday night's Game 7 victory over the Brooklyn Nets attracted one of the biggest crowds yet.

Feigin said that on the busiest nights about 7500 people gathered in Deer District to watch the games or enjoy the festivities. The Bucks believe 15000 people gathered for Game 7 on Saturday.

Deer District is a far cry from the neighborhood surrounding the old Bradley Center. There's a plaza with bars and restaurants and much more activity in general on game days.

That's expected to continue during the summer and it's how the Bucks planned things when the area around the new arena was laid out.

""We had this unbelievable opportunity to design a district to really attract and retain customers and fans and community members"" Feigin said.

Plans for the area this summer and beyond

The return of playoff excitement and national attention is welcome news to the Bucks who are anxious for a return to what had — before the pandemic — quickly become a busy new part of downtown. That's also a key to raising the profile of the area and attracting new development to the parcels that the Bucks control — including the vacant site of the former Bradley Center.

Feigin said over 50 to 70 activities are being considered during the offseason for Deer District.

""It's all about activation and content so I think you know everything from community events to farmers markets to outdoor concerts.""

The Bucks are considering holding movie nights on the plaza where people can bring a chair and watch a movie on a large screen. Feigin likes the idea of chalk writing at the plaza as a fun activity for kids.

The Beer Garden attracts crowds by showing Brewers and Packers games.

Feigin also said he hopes to have the Christkindlmarket back for the 2021 holiday season.

New projects to start this fall

Meanwhile construction is to begin this fall on The Trade a nine-story 205-room Marriott Autograph Hotel that will be just north of the Deer District's outdoor plaza.

The Trade is to open at 400 W. Juneau Ave. in early 2023.

It will feature a two-level restaurant and lounge at the corner of West Juneau and North Phillips avenues as well as street-level retail space at the corner of West Juneau Avenue and North 5th Street.

Other future nearby developments north of the Deer District plaza include a possible office building and apartments with apartments or a hotel possible at the former Bradley Center site.

The Antetokounmpo family migrated from Nigeria to settle down in Greece while facing difficult adversities in their hometown.

Charles and Veronica Antetokounmpo raised their four sons to become talented basketball players. His eldest brother Francis was the only person to not be born in Greece. The family is known to speak their native language Igbo at home.

The exciting thing which comes to the forefront is that three brothers play in the NBA. Apart from Francis the other brothers have followed their journey as basketball players. So who do they play for?

38 points on 11-of-16 shooting was what it took from Khris Middleton to finish the Nets off in Game 6 of the second-round series. Rather than placing the ball in the hands of its superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo in hopes of semi-reliable isolations Milwaukee rode the hot hand — a celebrated hot hand might I add that has made two All-Star games of his own Middleton.

“He loves those moments” said Giannis about his co-star Middleton to The Athletic’s Eric Nehm. “He’s never scared of those moments. It’s been an amazing eight years now having him next to me because I know in games like this he’s always ready. He’s always going to give his best everything he has.”

Brooklyn heads home for a pivotal Game 7 in front of the raucous Barclays Center crowd and paramount of its responsibilities will be slowing down Milwaukee’s energizing scorer. Granted Middleton has been a vastly different player on the road versus at home in these playoffs. In his comfy digs the Fiserv Forum he’s nearly averaging 28 points per game on 53 percent shooting; elsewhere that average drops to just under 20 points on 37.1 percent field-goal percentage and 28.9 percent three-point shooting.

Home or away the Nets cannot make it easy for Middleton... which Brooklyn certainly did during Thursday night’s Game 6.

Joe Harris who hasn’t had a particularly terrific series on the offensive side of the ball let his shooting woes bleed into his defensive focus and control. Harris recorded 5 fouls in Game 6 — 3 of which occurred while Middleton was shooting a three-pointer resulting in 9 of Middleton’s 38 points. All in all Harris was Middleton’s most frequent defender on 20.2 partial possessions per NBA matchup stats and the 29-year-old Buck made quick work of Harris by recording 12 total points when the two were matched up.

An example.

This... just isn’t good pick-and-roll defense. Khris Middleton and Giannis Antetokounmpo set up in a high pick-and-roll to begin and when Middleton “rejects” Giannis’ screen by not using the pick and dribbling the opposite direction the move itself fails to create any sort of advantage. In response Middleton dribbles back toward Giannis in hopes of receiving a second screen to create yet another advantage.

Here’s where the play falls apart: As Giannis “slips” to the basket without making any contact on his screen Middleton takes one dribble to his left out of the crossover; and in response Harris wildly closes out to the career 39.5% three-point marksman giving the Bucks an opportunity for a 4-point play.

This isn’t the first time Harris has done a subpar job defending Middleton. Even earlier in the series I expressed some concern with the assignment in a video detailing key takeaways from Game 3.

It appears the coaching staff came away with a similar interpretation of Game 6 at least to a degree. During Friday’s media availability Steve Nash expressed a strong willingness to alter the game plan to extinguish Middleton’s offensive output.

“You know I think the reality is that a bunch of guys are going to get a crack at him” said Nash on Friday. “We will change the matchups we’ll look at different schemes we’ll do various things to try and make it difficult for him.”

Adjusting the scheme could be worth a shot. The Nets have been operating in a “drop” coverage pick-and-roll defense for the majority of the series and getting back to the switching defense which dominated the regular season could certainly be an option. After all Middleton — for as great of a scorer as he is — is not exactly a quick-twitch athlete. A well-timed switch could shut down the All-Star scorer after a pick-and-roll set as the switching defender can focus primarily on taking away his outside pull-up shot without fear of a drive.

But even that strategy has its pitfalls; namely it doesn’t address the ginormous Greek elephant in the room Giannis Antetokounmpo who will happily feast on Middleton’s defender should the Nets elect to switch. Thus the reason the Nets have stuck steadfastly with drop.

So what other options are there?

Bruce Brown is certainly one. Brown played just 5 minutes during Game 6 after averaging 26.5 in his first four games of the series. His defense on Middleton particularly in Game 3 was impressive. It helped neutralize Milwaukee’s pick-and-roll.

When Middleton dribbles toward Giannis’ pick notice how Brown trails behind the play to avoid Giannis’s screening body rather than attempting to barrel right through him. The magic happens after Brown falls behind Middleton intentionally. He uses short choppy steps to speed up his stride and catch up with the 6’7” wing. It’s a simple play but Brown’s hustle takes away the shooting window from Middleton forcing him to give up the rock to Giannis on the half roll and the offense resets.

If Brooklyn wanted to go really left field it could dust off Nicolas Claxton the best switch defender on the roster and a freak of nature center who has already been tasked with guarding Giannis for most of this series. Throwing Claxton out there makes for an obvious adjustment just because of how much Milwaukee likes to run the Giannis Antetokounmpo-Khris Middleton pick-and-roll. When the Bucks go to their pet play of PnR action the Nets will almost automatically have their switch-big Claxton sitting right there waiting to snuff out Milwaukee’s most lethal three-level scorer Middleton. It’s like the perfect mousetrap in a sense.

When I say “dust off”... I unfortunately mean it. Claxton has averaged just 10.7 minutes in the series and his development in the postseason has largely not been a priority for the Nets. (His highest minute total occurred in Game 2 of the Boston series at just 17 minutes). So sure he hasn’t gotten the reps he probably needed to fully feel comfortable out there but if there’s one thing we’ve learned about Nic this season it’s that he’s a massive overachiever. He’s always up for the challenge.

Plus it’s not like the season is on the line or anything.",,,

From becoming the first Black American to own a “Big Three” dealership inventing the fundamental structure of an automatic transmission creating the traffic light designing an iconic Bronco breaking the boundaries of NASCAR or being the first and only Black automaker. These were pioneers whose names will be forever engraved into the history of the automotive industry.

McKinley Thompson Jr.

Thompson was hired as Ford's first Black designer in 1956 after earning his degree in transportation design at the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena Calif. While Thompson was not the designer of record for Ford's game-changing 4x4 Bronco he penned early sketches that are now instantly recognizable as inspiration for the final product. He also contributed to the design of the Ford Mustang and GT40 race car. McKinley's role in the original Bronco's design was relatively unknown until Ford archivists began to dig for materials as part of the nameplate's revival. The discovery of those early Bronco sketches led Ted Ryan Ford's chief archivist and heritage brand manager to make the connection.

Edward Davis

According to the Automotive Hall of Fame Davis is the oldest of 10 and grew up in Louisiana. His love for cars began at a very young age when he would submerge himself into studying every inch of his father's Ford Model T. As he got older his love of cars took a step back as he began to seek employment but due to lack of opportunities for minorities Davis had to seek outside his home town of Shreveport Louisiana. After his mother’s passing Davis convinced his father to move with his aunt in Detroit and in 1929 he ventured off for better opportunities.

After graduating from Cass Technical High School to become an accountant Davis found himself again struggling to find employment. During this time Davis opened and operated his own service garage using his knowledge and love of cars. A Dodge plant supervisor was a regular customer of his and offered Davis a job working at the Dodge Hamtramck assembly facility and in 1936 the Dodge supervisor's son would open a Dodge dealership where Davis ended up being a dealership sales leader.

Davis then ventured off in 1938 and began Davis Motor Sales where his business caught the eye of the Studebaker Corporation and was awarded a Studebaker dealership selling 50 Studebakers a month. But Edward Davis' success was short-lived as Studebaker filed for bankruptcy and Davis began the long journey of acquiring a franchise from the “Big Three” (GM Ford Chrysler) but was denied due to the color of his skin. In 1963 after nearly seven years of trying to acquire a ""Big 3"" franchise Davis was awarded a Chrysler-Plymouth franchise located in Detroit. He was the first Black American to own a new car dealership and in 1996 Davis would be the first Black American to be inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame.

Wendell Oliver Scott

Wendell Oliver Scott was the first Black American full-time competitor in NASCAR history. During the period of the Civil Rights Movement Wendell Scott loved nothing more than to grab the steering wheel and go as fast as he could on the race track. According to ESPN’s film on the driver the Dixie Circuit was financially struggling and couldn’t fill its seats at the track and as a promotional design they began looking for a Black person to compete in their races. Due to Wendell’s history of speeding tickets he was asked to participate in the events where he dazzled the crowd with his stunning maneuvers on the track.

According to the NASCAR Hall of Fame while other participants in the race were sponsored with new parts. Wendell Scott used his engineering background from World War II along with the assistance of his two sons to stay at the top of his game by using hand-me-down parts and junkyard parts to enhance and improve the performance of his vehicles. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and Wendell Scott Foundation also state that in Wendell Scott’s 13-year NASCAR career he finished in the top 10 in 147 races. He has been inducted into the Black Athletes Hall of Fame Jacksonville Florida Hall of Fame Danville Register & Bee Hall of Fame National Sports Hall of Fame International Motorsports Hall of Fame Virginia Sports Hall of Fame National Motorsports Press Association Hall of Fame Danville Museum of Fine Arts and History Hall of Fame and in 2015 Wendell Oliver Scott was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame. His self-built 1962 Chevrolet is currently on display at the NASCAR Hall of Fame in North Carolina.

Richard Spikes

Spikes was a genius inventor who holds eight patents awarded between 1907 and 1946. According to BlackPast his inventive work came from his experience as a mechanic saloon keeper and a barber. These three occupations would inspire Spikes to create and develop patents for the beer tapper that is being used today brake testing machine milk bottle opener and cover and many more. But his most influential invention is the Automatic Gear Shift Device that created the fundamental structure of what is known today as the automatic transmission. He is also known for developing and creating automobile turn signals but there is no patent record on file of his involvement.

Garrett Morgan

The son of former slaves Garrett Morgan was a prolific entrepreneur and inventor. He owned multiple businesses including a sewing machine repair shop tailoring business and a newspaper to name a few. As an inventor he created the gas mask zigzag stitching device and much more. However in 1923 one of his most important patents was awarded: the traffic light. It was a T-shaped warning light that helped direct the flow of traffic. His inspiration to create this system came after he witnessed a fatal car crash. Morgan would later sell his patent to General Electric for $40000. His T-shaped invention created the infrastructure of modern traffic lights that we know and rely on today.

C. R. Patterson and Sons

C.R. Patterson and Sons may not be a familiar name to many but this small automobile manufacturer is the first and only African American-owned car company. Charles Richard Patterson was born as a slave on a Virginia plantation in 1833. Twenty-eight years later in 1861 Charles escaped the plantation and traveled to Greenfield Ohio to begin a new life. In 1873 he partnered with carriage manufacturer J.P. Lowe and began the successful business of manufacturing horse carriages. Charles then bought out Lowe’s shares of the business and re-established the company as C. R. Patterson and Sons in 1893 with his oldest son Frederick taking on more of an ownership role.

In 1910 Charles Richard Patterson died and left the business to Frederick who quickly began converting the company into an automobile manufacturer. The hard work of shifting the scope of the business culminated in the introduction of the Patterson-Greenfield automobile in 1915. It was sold for $685 and featured a four-cylinder Continental engine that competed with Ford’s Model T. Unfortunately like many smaller automobile manufacturers of this time C. R. Patterson and Sons could neither match the speed of Ford's manufacturing nor its economies of scale. In 1939 after the Great Depression C. R. Patterson and Sons was forced to close its doors for the last time.

Although the story of C. R. Patterson and Sons is not widely known it was a multi-generational success story securing Charles’ and Frederick’s place in the automotive history books. The Greenfield Historical Society has a C. R. Patterson buggy which looks to be kept in great condition. You can learn more about the business and these inspiring individuals by checking out the National Museum of African American History and Culture and The Smithsonian or by checking out the book ""The C. R. Patterson and Sons Company: Black Pioneers in the Vehicle Building Industry 1865-1939.""

All of iHeartMedia’s Conservative Talk outlets that had been carrying Limbaugh will take the new Travis and Sexton show being provided by their Premiere subsidiary. That includes stations such as 710 WOR New York 1150 KEIB Los Angeles 1200 WXKS Boston 1530/93.1 KFBK Sacramento and 1100 WTAM Cleveland among others.

Townsquare Media gave its individual markets the opportunity to choose which show to air. Travis and Sexton will air on 1440 WROK Rockford IL 1470 KYYW Abilene TX 790 KFYO Lubbock TX 1290 KWFS Wichita Falls TX

Westwood One’s Dan Bongino Show will be added at 96.5 KPEL-FM Lafayette LA 1310 KLIX Twin Falls ID 710 KEEL Shreveport LA 1290 WNBF Binghamton NY and 970 KFLD Pasco WA.

A few stations went in other directions. 1360 WKMI Kalamazoo and 95.3 WBCK Battle Creek MI went with with Fox News Radio’s “Fox Across America” hosted by Jimmy Failla. 1340 KROC Rochester MN added Salem’s Dennis Prager while 940 KIXZ Amarillo TX went with Salem’s Charlie Kirk.

A few Townsquare stations that were airing Limbaugh have yet to publicly announce their new show for the timeslot on the eve of the launch including WJIM Lansing MI WGBF Evansville IN and KIT Yakima WA.

Other stations making moves to other shows include 600 KTBB/97.5 KTBB-FM Tyler TX adding Fox Across America Flag Family Media’s “1100 The Flag” WZFG Dilworth MN/Fargo ND and 1090 KTGO Tioga ND will replace Limbaugh with Charlie Kirk but also drop Premiere’s Sean Hannity from the 2-5pm slot replacing it with with Fox Across America.

A handful of bigger market stations have yet to announce their plans for Limbaugh’s daypart. We expect Audacy’s 1210 WPHT Philadelphia and Radio One’s 1110 WBT Charlotte/99.3 WBT-FM Chester SC to move to locally originating programs in the 12-3pm slot.

Update: Waterloo Media’s 590 KLBJ Austin TX will carry Travis and Sexton from 11am-2pm.

Despite all the defections Premiere Networks claims that Travis and Sexton will debut on over 400 stations. Outside of iHeart’s owned stations only Dickey Broadcasting’s “Xtra 106.3” 1240 WFOM Marietta/Atlanta which flipped to Conservative Talk and began airing Limbaugh in April after Cox’s 750 WSB/95.5 WSBB dropped the show.

Additionally CESD Talent has announced that Victor Lisle has been tapped to serve as the imaging voice for Travis and Sexton. Lisle writes “I am genuinely humbled beyond belief for this amazing opportunity. Never in a million years did I expect something of this magnitude could happen.

India became an epicentre with a spike in cases in the second wave of the pandemic amidst shortage in medical supplies. There are concerns about the possibility of a third wave hitting the country ICICI Prudential Life said in its annual report for 2020-21.

In FY21 the life insurance industry reported a modest 3 per cent growth in new business premium said the report adding the industry continues to get a higher share of household savings because of the increased attractiveness of life insurance savings products the unique proposition of protection and annuity products among others.

""In the short-term the profitability of the insurance industry is expected to be an area of concern given the increase in mortality and morbidity rates induced by the pandemic. Even more than a year after the pandemic first struck there continues to be significant uncertainty regarding its absolute impact on mortality and morbidity experience"" the insurer said.

The pandemic has posed multiple challenges for the Indian life insurers. The onset of the pandemic saw a sharp fall in equity prices while interest rates also declined.

Insurers have exposure to equities in unit-linked and participating businesses. Thus interest rate movements impact their liabilities and guarantees based based schemes. While a credit risk can impact their investments made incorporates.

The sharp movements in markets coupled with any asset liability mismatches that insurers may have can impact the solvency position.

The report said there are emerging risks related to environmental social and governance (ESG) issues on the insurance industry of which climate change is a bigger challenge.

Apart from climate change there are emerging risks associated with public health trends such as increase in obesity related disorders and demographic changes such as population urbanisation and ageing said the report.

Industry's growth even during the pandemic shows a promising future for the domestic life insurance sector however the pandemic has also exposed the gap the protection gap in the country said the report.

The number of Covid-19 related death claims is fraction of the number of overall lives lost highlighting the vulnerability of the families ICICI Pru Life said.

The insurer said it has become imperative for every working individual to add life insurance as a key ingredient of financial planning.

During the year the pandemic amplified the need for life insurance among people leading to the category slowly moving from being a ""push product"" to a ""nudge product"" ICICI Prudential Life Insurance said.

The company's total premium income during FY21 was Rs 35733 crore of which Rs 13032 crore was new business premium.

""On the back of the risk-averse behaviour of our customers there was considerable interest for traditional long-term savings products which grew by 61.2 per cent for the year. Similarly annuity products registered a robust 120 per cent growth year-on-year.

""With ULIPs (unit linked investment plans) at 48 per cent traditional savings products at 31 per cent protection at 16 per cent and group products at 5 per cent we now have a well-balanced product mix which now insulates us better from market volatility"" said the insurer.

It has become imperative for every working individual to add life insurance as a key ingredient of financial planning.

""We believe the lessons learnt from the pandemic will lead to a paradigm shift in the way businesses operate. We are already observing the pace of digital and technological adoption moving at a frenetic pace compared to the pre-Covid-19 era"" said N S Kannan Managing Director & CEO ICICI Prudential Life in his message to shareholders.

The under-penetration of life insurance in the country offers an excellent opportunity to life insurers with innovative product offerings and simplified processes the insurer said.",,,,,,,,,

Even amid the gleaming fairways and sparkling white-sand bunkers on those sun-kissed days on the course I had been playing golf under a shroud of ignorance and confusion for decades.

That changed recently when I made the single largest golf purchase of my life: the Garmin Approach Z82. At $500 it’s one of the most expensive golf rangefinders on the market and that’s after it went on sale for Father’s Day dropping it from its usual $600 price.

OK so what brought me to this place of such profligate spending? I’ve never been much for golf gadgets. I’m not even that much into equipment. I still play Titleist DCI 962 irons from the early 1990s. My Callaway FT-i driver was old enough to be bar mitzvah’d last year.

So how did this happen? How did I suddenly go from being a cheapskate Luddite to being Al Czervik Rodney Dangerfield’s loutish spendthrift character in “Caddyshack?” Or worse Judge Smails?

The truth is I had an epiphany in May while playing my first round at Stoatin Brae near Battle Creek. The course was terrific and I was playing fairly well. After chipping in for birdie on the 12th hole I striped a drive on the 13th hole leaving me about 140 yards to an uphill green. The course offers an app you can download to help with yardages but I couldn’t get the app to work. I couldn’t sense the wind from the fairway and I had no idea how deep the green was. I flushed an 8-iron — right over the green. I made double bogey.

It was the same thing on the next hole a short par-3 from an elevated tee box. I flushed another short iron — over the green just off the back edge. Bogey.

That’s when I knew I needed help. I needed to stop flying blind and cheating myself out of good performances. It’s hard enough to hit a golf shot accurately so it’s especially deflating when you pull off that shot only to have that effort quashed by complicated environmental calculus.

After that bogey on the par-3 I knew I was buying the best rangefinder I could get. But which one? There are so many rangefinders that making a choice is daunting. I figured I would get the most popular Bushnell model but I had to decide between the Tour V5 Shift that offers slope technology to account for elevation changes and the Hybrid which doesn’t have slope but has GPS that provides information about hazards and green depths. Each is $400.

Then I came across the Garmin. The company famous for its GPS technology offered slope and of course GPS. But what sold me was it has a 2-dimensional overlay map of each hole on 42000 preloaded courses. That means you can preview the entire hole with exact distances for carries and layups before you tee off. And with GPS it automatically loads the course as you pull into the parking lot.

But the Garmin is more than that. Its viewfinder is very different from most rangefinders. Instead of a binocular-style magnified lens the Garmin has a high-definition OLED color screen that makes it look like you’re playing a video game with all the color graphics on the rectangular screen.

I tried it out at a course I’d never played: The Legacy by Arthur Hills in Ottawa Lake. I was blown away by the graphics the information and how quickly it woke up from GPS standby mode.

NEW COURSE:American Dunes Golf Club is expensive but you should be lining up to play it. Here's why

But there was a huge unexpected bonus: The Approach Z82 has Bluetooth which lets you connect it to your phone with the Garmin Golf App. If you do this it will give you a wind reading. The Legacy sits on farmland and there was a steady and challenging 12 mph wind the entire round. I still dunked a gap wedge into the water on the eighth hole’s island green. But that was entirely my fault for under-clubbing. I’m not blaming the caddie on that one.

And that’s what the Approach Z82 feels like: a caddie. And not just the high school kid who carries your bag and cleans your golf ball. A caddie who tells you how the hole plays where the wind is coming from and thanks to a cool feature called “PinPointer” tells you where the flag is on a blind shot.

In fact when I got used to the device after a few holes I remembered something that had happened more than a decade ago. I was playing at a fancy country club in San Diego and my caddie was a California minitour player making a few extra bucks. He was amazing. Not only did he provide information but he also had a sense of my capabilities and weaknesses. He encouraged me at the right times and cautioned me at others. It was the first time I felt like I had a teammate in golf.

The only thing missing was a voice function that allowed the Garmin to give me an “attaboy” after a good shot.

Of course no piece of technology is perfect. So here’s a rundown of the highs and lows of the Approach Z82.

What I loved beyond what I’ve already mentioned

• It’s rechargeable with 15 hours of battery life in GPS mode. After I finished my 4.5-hour round it still had a 68% battery charge.

• It’s not only waterproof but to the exact specification of IPX7 (submersion at 1 meter for 30 minutes).

• There are tons of features like a digital scorecard and statistic tracking but it’s mostly a simple user-friendly device that knows where you are on each hole and even switches to a close-up green view when you’re within approach distance.

• It feels solid in your hand yet light at 8.2 ounces.

Here’s where the Approach Z82 could be better

• The bag-style carrying case is OK but it’s a little cumbersome and should have a more secure closure.

• Grass bunkers weren’t recognized as hazards — at least not at the Legacy.

• It comes with a micro USB charging cable but no power brick or cleaning cloth.

• An integrated magnet like Bushnell and other models are starting to use would be great so you can stick it to the cart bar for quick access.

• Wind information is a huge asset but it doesn’t factor into true playing distance like slope does. If it did it would be a game-changer.

I know the price tag is steep especially for golfers who aren’t too demanding about course knowledge or tend to play the same courses all the time. But on a windy day on an unfamiliar course the Approach Z82 saved me at least four strokes and it felt like something more than just a pricey golf accessory. It felt like a teammate.

That's a 50 per cent increase in field size since the last edition of the road race in 2019 won by EF Education-Nippo rider Alex Howes.

The US Pro road race can be a numbers game with big teams having more cards to play over the course of a five-hour race and early-summer humidity can play a significant role in the tactics of a long day in the saddle and 15 passes over the narrow Sherrod Road climb.

""Nationals is definitely a race that plays out completely different than the normal script in cycling. We definitely aren't the strongest team out there but we probably have one of the more experienced teams that I've come to nationals with"" the defending champion told Cyclingnews on Saturday.

Five WorldTour teams are represented with riders in the road race on Sunday with EF Education-Nippo field the most riders as a group – Howes 2021 time trial champion Lawson Craddock new teammate Will Barta and retiring teammate Tejay van Garderen.

""Four riders is definitely an advantage but at the same time it's not a big enough roster where you can completely take control of the race and decide who gets in the breakaway chase the breakaway and shepherd your leader into the final and he can cap it off. You need just a little bit more manpower to pull off a stunt like that"" said Van Garderen who will make the road race the final competition in his storied 12-year career.

""We're going to have to figure out how we can force the race to get a selection made where we have numbers in the group and it's not on us to control it.""

It's a shadow of force compared to Rally Cycling and Aevolo each with nine riders as well as the top Continental teams with eight or seven riders like Project Echelon and Hagens Berman Axeon. EF-Nippo are not the strongest team overall but Howes said their depth of knowledge is an advantage.

""All four of us know how to race our bikes. I'm happy with how things look on paper"" Howes added. ""It's definitely a challenging course relatively tactical. It's a course where it leaves a lot of doors open for different people. In the past and certainly on Sunday the heat and humidity play a big part on how the race plays out. You see guys crumble towards the end if they haven't done a good job fueling or staying cool.""

Van Garderen told Cyclingnews he agreed that the muggy Southern weather could play a factor but also surprise moves on the backside of Sherrod Road like the one Howes made with two laps to go in 2019.

""A lot of times the moves everyone expects are on the main climb but its on the drags after the climb where people might be tired or might have spent some energy so they are looking to sit in and you can hit them with a surprise attack"" he said. ""So you have to read the race as it comes. The four of us are good at picking up the signals how people are feeling and what people area doing.""

One of the wildcards on EF Education is Will Barta. Placing 11th in the 2017 US Pro Road Race Nationals in Knoxville as a 21-year-old riding for Hagens Berman Axeon he's in his first year with EF Education having a delayed start this season when he suffered a femur fracture in a crash to avoid a dog on a training ride. But he placed fifth on Thursday in the time trial.

""He's incredibly nice a genuine guy. He's an incredible talent. The first time I had this realization that 'this guy is really good' was at the Vuelta last year when he nearly won that TT. When I saw that I was like 'he's better than I thought he's legit'"" Van Garderen said about Barta losing the Vuelta stage by a few seconds to eventual winner Primož Roglič.

And then there's Craddock who's on the Olympic team and using the road race to prep for Tokyo. ""Sunday is also a big target so I didn't just come here to focus on the TT"" he said after winning the time trial title on Thursday.

The EF foursome is locked and loaded. Howes said it's been special to have the stars-and-stripes jersey for two years now and may not be ready to give it up.

""Since I've had the jersey I've raced in 12 countries and ridden in 14 different states so I definitely got it out there and enjoyed my time wearing it"" he said regarding more numbers.

""I was feeling like I got shorted there a little bit with the global pandemic but the second half of 2019 was a great second half of the year. I raced a total of four days in 2020. And in 2021 still a few hiccups with the pandemic but I've managed to get a fair number of races over in Europe"" Howes said.

""I'm coming off the Tour de Suisse definitely a little fatigued from that last week and coming straight in for Nationals so that's been a bit of a challenge.

""I really have to give a round of applause to the City of Knoxville for shutting everything down for us. They put on a great show. Personally I'd like to see the nationals leave the Southeast some day. It's a huge country.""

USA Cycling Mountain Bike National Championships will be in his home state of Colorado so Howes said he may ""take a crack"" at the cross country races in July. He's enjoyed gravel racing and ""keeping it fresh"" keeps him going.

""I love racing on the road it's hard and fast. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't challenging certainly over in Europe it's tough. I really enjoy racing at home and probably more than anything in front of a hometown crowd. If the way to do that is on the dirt then I'm going to do it.

""Anything on two wheels appeals to me. Why not? Unlike road nationals it's actually close to my house.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1hbnVhbC5jb20vZml0bmVzcy9iZXN0LXNwb3J0LXRyYWNrZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Best Sport Trackers for Golf Hiking Swimming and More,"Fitness trackers are pretty spot-on and convenient when you’re running or working out at the gym. You put the device around your wrist sync it to your phone and before you know it you already have access to metrics on heart rate distance calories and other exercise stats. However playing sports is entirely a different story. Each sort of activity highlights its own unique set of motions and metrics to track so a single device won’t be totally comprehensive.

For instance if you’re playing soccer you may want to monitor your position in the field whereas if you’re swimming you may want to track how many laps you’ve logged. And of course other sports like basketball baseball tennis golf and boxing each require a completely different kind of tracking. We took a look at the latest smart technology available for various sports to determine which are the best sport trackers for each activity.

The Best for Soccer: PlayerTek

With its high-tech GPS heat mapping PlayerTek’s innovative tracker monitors movement on the pitch to allow wearers to see exactly how they moved during a game. This lets them analyze how plays were executed chalk up how much time was spent in various positions and compare actual performance to the intended game plan.

The device showcases a built-in accelerometer that shows how fast players run and what their average pace was. It also allows users to create soccer-specific workout programs track overall fitness and compete with their friends. PlayerTek offers teams the ability to purchase packages of devices that integrate with one another to chart and document everyone’s performance statistics.

The Best for Swimming: Fitbit Ionic

From swimming laps at a pool to tackling open water outdoors Fitbit’s Ionic is up to the task. Water-resistant up to 50 meters this smartwatch features a specialized Swim Exercise mode which records laps in real time as wearers move through the water. It also recognizes the different types of strokes used the distance covered and the number of calories burned.

Although water prevents the device from tracking heart rate while submerged in manual mode it does feature automatic swim detection which does log HR. With an extra bright display users can easily see the device underwater — Fitbit even designed it to work in saltwater. In addition to its water-friendly features the Ionic tracks sleep patterns offers workout coaching and sends smartphone alerts and notifications.

The Best for Golf: Garmin Approach S60

Garmin’s Approach S60 accurately pinpoints location on the links via built-in GPS and creates full-color course maps with real-time alerts and statistics including yardages to greens as well as hazards and doglegs. Its AutoShot game tracking technology features a bundle of hyper-accurate sensors that record distances for post-game analysis. Plus it offers access to more than 41000 preloaded courses across the globe.

The easy-read color touchscreen display is user-friendly and users won’t have to worry about it losing juice midway through a game — the device lasts ten straight hours in golf mode or ten full days in normal watch mode. Like other Garmin devices the Approach has a QuickFit band making it easy to swap out for different styles and colors.

The Best for Kayaking: Polar M600

This fully waterproof smartwatch is perfect for kayaking standup paddleboarding or any other watersport that involves splashing around in rivers or lakes. With optical sensors that monitor the blood pumping through a wearer’s veins it estimates heart rate so you can track how hard you work with each stroke. It features integrated GPS functionality so users won’t feel lost even after wandering up a canal or meandering into hidden channels — it lets them see exactly where they went and tracks the distance and pace logged.

Outfitted with a handy voice control function the M600 lets users keep the paddle in their hands at all times and even works well during the event of a tumble in the water. Thankfully it’s also fully submersible up to 50 meters. When not on the water this device is an excellent tool for running as it comes complete with structured programs and motivational feedback.

The Best for Baseball: Blast Motion Baseball

With a high-end motion capture sensor this device attaches to the end of a baseball bat recording swing and ball flight metrics for every ball hit. The technology utilizes Smart Video Capture to record and auto-edit videos offering tips analysis and insights. It also features a 3D Swing Tracer that allows users to see swing stats in real time — or you can save it to watch later with a coach. Over time it identifies trends and better understands the areas where a hitter could use improvement.

The Best for Hiking: Suunto Spartan HR Baro

Suunto’s Spartan HR Baro features 80 different sports modes making it a superb tracker for a variety of activities. However its barometric altimeter makes it an exceptionally awesome choice for hikers. Whether it’s for trekking through lowland wilderness or for mountaineering alpine vistas Suunto’s FusedAlti technology captures barometric pressure measurements eclipsing any elevation data capabilities that barometer-less devices provide.

It’s water-resistant (aka rain safe) and syncs with its companion heatmaps to scout well-known trails and access live navigation while on-the-go. Suunto also equipped the Sparton HR Baro with up-to-date sunrise and sunset times along with inclement weather alerts allowing wearers to avoid getting stuck in a storm or staying out after dark. For serious hikers its Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption (EPOC) is a vital statistic to keep tabs on and the device’s 20 hours of battery life (40 hours with its power-save feature) makes it a viable option for multi-day trips too.

We are in the thick of the growing season for spring grains and oilseeds and weather has already created stress on those crops. But spotty rains and politics are causing significant volatility.

For the week Kansas City was down 31¢ Minneapolis up 8¢ Chicago down 18¢ corn down 29¢ and soybeans down $1.12.

The day-to-day weather forecasts seem to generally get temperatures right but have not been reliable for projecting precip. For the next one to two weeks there is enough rain in the forecast for the western Midwest that traders are willing to exit longs. If those rains do not materialize there will be little to hold prices back.

Soybeans also suffered from some outside issues as well with rumors flying about a potential drop in biodiesel blend requirement for some refineries. However unlikely that is the market did not like the discussion and weakness in world veg-oil markets had bean oil plunging limit down two days in a row pulling soybeans down with it.

The markets are also experiencing huge speculative interest from index and hedge funds buying commodities for inflation hedges. But when prices turn south in a big way like they did this week computer trading tends to create a negative feedback loop with lower prices causing more selling and yet even lower prices until prices either hit limit or exhaust themselves. It looks like both happened on Thursday with corn down its 40¢ limit and soybeans seeing a record one-day decline on Thursday as the front month July settled $1.18/bushel lower. Friday it gained 66¢ of that back. Good luck trading that kind of market.

The broader inflation trade is getting clobbered. With the Fed acknowledging that inflation is stronger and moving faster than they expected and mentioning raising interest rates even two years from now sent a wave of hedge liquidation throughout the commodity space. The U.S. dollar shot higher precious metals got smoked grains saw major long liquidation and even cattle got caught up in the waves of selling. We did see those markets correct somewhat by the end of the week but there was significant damage to the charts.

Winter wheat harvest has been anything but easy. A slow start for hard red winter due to rain is turning into a scorcher as the combines move into Kansas. Early yields there are about as expected (much better than average) and test weights so far are also good. Soft red winter wheat has also had its challenges with too much early rain but those problems haven't gone away and they will get worse as rains are forecast for the next several days in the southern Midwest. Quality concerns are rising which is helping support Chicago over Kansas City.

For spring wheat the Northern Plains and Canadian Prairies have struggled with intense drought and heat. Some rain events have moved across much of that region recently but the drought is still intact and the heat quickly brings the stress back. Rains are forecast next week for the Dakotas which kept Minneapolis in a trading range for much of this week. There too if the rains do not happen there is little to hold spring wheat back.

It is worth noting that spring wheat areas in Russia and Kazakhstan are also experiencing dryness. Russia does not export spring wheat but a decline in production could pull winter wheat away from exportable supplies. Kazakhstan however does export spring wheat so that could offer some support to the broader world spring wheat market.

While all fundamentals ultimately matter it is weather that dominates price action this time of year – and particularly when we have the backdrop of a major demand-led bull market and tightening supplies in the grain and oilseed space worldwide. If the rains come this weekend and next week prices will likely decline further. If not or if the weather returns to its hot and dry pattern prices will take another major leg up.

My guess is both will happen. Near term corn and wheat still have room on the downside to complete some chart formations while soybeans have already completed their formation and have held at a major support level. The longer-range weather forecasts suggest a return to the hot and dry pattern for the northern Plains and western Midwest for July which would be enough to take the markets on the next leg up.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNoZWNrZXJlZGZsYWcuY28udWsvMjAyMS8wNi9wYXVsLW1vcnJpcy10YWtlcy1sZWFkLWxhdGUtd2lucy1zc3QtZGFyd2luLXJhY2UtMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paul Morris takes lead late wins SST Darwin Race 1,"Paul Morris continued his winning ways in the Boost Mobile Super Trucks when he took the lead from Greg Gartner late in Saturday’s opening race of the Darwin Triple Crown to score his third victory in 2021.

Morris was the second-fastest driver in qualifying earlier in the day behind Shae Davies which placed both drivers at the back. His son Nash Morris started on the front row alongside Dave Casey.

The younger Morris making his official Stadium Super Truck début after being sidelined by injury at Tasmania two months prior led the opening lap. Gartner moved up to second shortly after lap two began and Paul Morris joined him on the podium when the competition caution came out on lap three.

A strong run enabled Gartner to take the lead as the race resumed and the older Morris overtook his son on lap six with Davies in tow. Later in the lap Paul Weel—who had lost his hood—flipped multiple times into the grass after getting sideways on a ramp from contact with Casey. Although he was able to keep driving back to the pits the wreck ended his day. Russell Ingall who raced with Weel in the Supercars Championship in the 2000s also retired from the race after stopping to check on Weel. The yellow flag waved shortly after.

“Rolling around Race 1 unexpectedly in my @kmcwheelsau Stadium Super Truck today” Weel wrote on Instagram. “Lucky for me 6 rolls and was able to drive this machine back to the pitts unscathed.“

Gartner continued to lead at the green flag before being passed by the faster Morris on the final lap. He would not catch Morris as the 2017 champion drove off to his sixth career win and third at Darwin. Morris had won two of three races in SST’s first trip to Hidden Valley Raceway in 2017; he and Gartner both participated in that race weekend.

Despite having to settle for second the finish marked Gartner’s first career podium and a two-position improvement over his previous best at Valvoline Raceway in 2015 and Adelaide last year. Davies took third meaning he has finished on each step of the podium in 2021 with a second and win at Tasmania. He is the only other driver besides Morris to win so far this season.

“Neck hurts after that one… but the beers are cold” remarked Davies in an Instagram Story. During the race he entered a jump with just his left-side tyres on the ramp nearly resulting in a flip off course but he was able to safely land on four wheels.

Two more races are scheduled for Sunday at 10:10 AM and 1:25 PM ACST.

1 of 1 2 of 1

One of the kindest and most mentally stable people in media will soon disappear from the airwaves.

After 51 years in broadcasting CBC Radio One weekend news editor Brian Dance has decided to retire.

Why do I use the words ""mentally stable""?

To put it simply it's because Dance is unflappable exceedingly gracious and relentlessly upbeat. I know this because I was lucky to work on the same floor as him many years ago.

Dance might also have the finest pipes in broadcasting with a voice that jumps out of the radio.

He's been the weekend editor of the CBC radio newscast in B.C. since 1997. His friendly on-air banter with North by Northwest host Sheryl MacKay has helped this show attract sky-high ratings without ever resorting to sensationalism.

This year on the program Dance revealed that he was recruited in the 1970s by legendary wrestling announcer Ed Whalen to become one of the voices on Stampede Wrestling.

He also covered several Olympics and many international ski races including Kerrin-Lee Gartner's gold medal win at the 1992 Albertville Games.

Dance began his career as a disc jockey at CHUB Radio in Nanaimo before moving to Calgary two years later to cover news and sports at CFAC Radio in Calgary according to Vancouverbroadcasters.com.

This bio states that he joined CBC Calgary a few years later before moving to Toronto in 1984 as a national sports reporter. In 1987 he won the Doug Gilbert Award as Canada's sportscaster of the year.

Dance transferred to radio sports in Vancouver in 1989.

Back in 2015 Dance wrote about how his vacation property in Christina Lake was threatened by a wildfire. He was working in Vancouver when the evacuation alert came when ""ember showers"" started sprinkling down in the community.

""Support came from communities all over the region"" he wrote. ""Crews attacked properties erecting structural protection dropping off water. I later discovered a 2500-gallon water bladder filled next to my house connected to an elaborate sprinkler system.""

Below you can see a video tribute to Dance that was broadcast on CBC News at 6."

The program is called CFM RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines) and will demonstrate and mature a range of new disruptive technologies for future jet engines that could enter service by the mid-2030s.

The two engine manufacturers have also signed an agreement extending the CFM International 50/50 partnership to the year 2050. They intend to lead the way for more sustainable aviation in line with the industry’s commitment to halve CO2 emissions by 2050.

Through the RISE technology demonstration program the two companies will work together to reinvent the future of flight bringing an advanced suite of revolutionary technologies to market that will take the next generation of single-aisle aircraft to a new level of fuel efficiency and reduced emissions.

“Our industry is in the midst of the most challenging times we have ever faced” said Olivier Andriès CEO of Safran. “We have to act now to accelerate our efforts to reduce our impact on the environment. Since the early 1970s breakthrough engine efficiency and reliability have been the hallmark of our historic partnership and our LEAP engine already reduces emissions by 15% compared to previous generation engines. Through the extension of our CFM partnership to 2050 we are today reaffirming our commitment to work together as technology leaders to help our industry meet the urgent climate challenges.“

The new jet engine technologies also ensure 100% compatibility with alternative energy sources such as Sustainable Aviation Fuels and hydrogen. One of the key features of the new engine is an open fan architecture which allows achieving an improved fuel efficiency while delivering the same travel speed and cabin experience offered by current single-aisle aircraft. The program will also leverage hybrid electric capability to optimize engine efficiency while enabling the electrification of many aircraft systems.

The joint GE/Safran engineering team has laid out a comprehensive technology roadmap including composite fan blades heat resistant metal alloys ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) hybrid electric capability and additive manufacturing. So far the RISE program has more than 300 separate components modules and full engine builds. A demonstrator engine is scheduled to begin testing at GE and Safran facilities around the middle of this decade with a flight test soon thereafter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZXRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdlc3QtYm9laW5nLTczNy1tYXgtbWFrZXMtZmlyc3QtdGVzdC1mbGlnaHQtdXBkYXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Newest Boeing 737 MAX Makes First Test Flight (Update),"The new Boeing 737 MAX made its first test flight over Washington state on Friday just months after the plane returned to service following a worldwide grounding after two fatal crashes.

Boeing said the 737 MAX 10 departed Renton Washington at 1707 GMT into clear skies flew over the central part of the state and landed about two-and-a-half hours later in Seattle.

“The airplane performed beautifully. The profile we flew allowed us to test the airplane’s systems flight controls and handling qualities all of which checked out exactly as we expected” Chief Pilot Jennifer Henderson said in a statement.

The mid-range jet initially was targeted to enter commercial service in 2020 but the timeframe slipped during the MAX’s 20-month grounding and the delay was compounded by the aviation industry downturn caused by COVID-19.

Boeing currently projects commercial deliveries of the MAX 10 will commence in 2023. Between now and that time there will be additional test flights as well as back-and-forth between the company and regulators at the US Federal Aviation Administration.

“The 737-10 is an important part of our customers’ fleet plans giving them more capacity greater fuel efficiency and the best per-seat economics of any single-aisle airplane” said Stan Deal president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.

The jet was first announced at the Paris Air Show in June 2017 when company officials played up its larger size calling it the “industry’s most efficient profitable single-aisle airplane.” The jet was positioned as a rival to Airbus’ A321neo in the single-aisle category.

The 737 MAX 10 can carry as many as 230 passengers according to Boeing. The plane maker has been gradually increasing the seating capacity since the 737 MAX 7 which had between 138 and 153 seats.

The new plane is longer but has less flying range than earlier versions employing a Leap-1B engine which is constructed by a joint venture of GE Aviation and Safran Aircraft.

The MAX was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after two fatal crashes killed 346 people.

US regulators approved the jet to resume service in November 2020 and most other major civil aviation bodies followed suit.

Since that time Boeing has resumed new deliveries of the MAX and announced new contracts with several leading carriers.",,,,,,,,,

Over the course of the past year health leaders organized quick accommodations to keep communications open both to engage patients and to communicate with healthcare staff. Messaging focused on the safety of healthcare workers and safety and continued care for patients during the global health crisis. Health systems and hospitals launched new ways to stay connected with patients offered virtual visits and conducted advanced appointment screenings. Communications now remains a priority and patient outreach continues with targeted information and interactions through social and digital engagement.

Similarly companies that provide services to hospitals and health systems also adapted their strategies and worked to determine how best to respond to physicians’ changing needs. Leading organizations are reorienting their customer experience efforts by ramping up remote accessibility digital deliverables and online and training and education. GE Healthcare in an effort to provide support and partnership with customers during the global pandemic invested in improving accessible online training and education remote system maintenance and monitoring capabilities and maintaining physician relationships during times when in-person meetings were not possible.

Innovation is on the Road

Managing through the pandemic clinicians have the continued support of partners like GE Healthcare which is making sure they have access to the most current technologies and can hear about outcomes they’re able to achieve that can impact patient care in their communities. Now that small group gatherings are permitted in some locations GE Healthcare is getting behind the wheel and driving innovation directly to customers around the globe.

“The COVID-19 outbreak was an opportunity for GE Healthcare to step up and offer our continued partnership and support to our customers and the communities they serve” said Andy DeLao Chief Marketing Officer Women’s Health & X-ray GE Healthcare. “Every image tells a story and that’s what we’re out to achieve with our Medical Imaging Innovation Tours. We want to meet with customers in person as safely as possible which we’ve been unable to do until now listen to their needs and understand the specific challenges they’re facing. We want to share some of the ways our imaging technology is being used to manage COVID-related disease and offer innovative solutions to help them manage efficiently to answer the surge in demand for imaging services and breast cancer screenings.”

A specially designed trailer equipped with GE Healthcare’s leading-edge imaging technologies in Women’s Health X-ray Bone & Metabolic Health and Oncology along with knowledgeable staff and safety personnel is making its way from Madrid Spain and across EU and eventually to the US. GE Healthcare has several other similar activities that are also happening in Germany and China. Against this backdrop customer experience is taking on new meaning. Clinicians can share their own experiences and stay up to date with the latest in imaging technology as the pandemic continues and eventually winds down.

Some of the topics in discussion at various stops along the way include:

Rapid diagnosis breast cancer models

Utilizing contrast-enhanced breast biopsy and improving patient experience results

Patient experience

Automated Breast Ultrasound and General Imaging Ultrasound for supplemental screening

Bone & Metabolic Health

Importance of managing backlog and offering excellent patient experience in mammography and biopsy

The evolving role of X-Ray in the fight against COVID-19

Expediting treatment of pneumothorax in COVID-19 patients

Preparing for ongoing epidemic or post-COVID follow-up with X-Ray

Driving the latest in X-Ray and Women’s Health Imaging

Fear of contracting COVID-19 kept many patients away from their annual breast cancer screenings cancer treatments and other imaging exams even when it was considered safe to return. Now radiology departments are facing a surge that not only includes these patients but also current patients holding new referrals for imaging services.

In the US similar vans are traveling and demonstrating GE Healthcare mammography technology. Screenings and demonstrations are happening in different parts of the country with an emphasis on sharing the latest in innovation and patient experience.

Innovating Safety on the Road

The Every Image Tells a Story medical imaging innovation tour in Europe was planned by GE Healthcare using the most current health and safety requirements and was specially designed to protect the health and safety of GE Healthcare staff as well as anyone who plans to visit during its scheduled stops. The trailer itself that houses GE Healthcare’s technology was designed with COVID-19 defenses built in to improve ventilation and the staff follow a vigorous disinfection regimen throughout each day overnight and between scheduled stops to prevent any potential spread of COVID-19.

GE Healthcare environmental management system (EMS) teams continuously assess the visit environment and have the ability to post-pone cancel or limit the number of attendees at any scheduled stop. Access to the events is managed thoughtfully and attendees who visit the Imaging Innovation trailer are preregistered online with their contact information collected for contact tracing in the event there is a reported case of COVID-19. All local restrictions are followed at each location and attendees are required to wear masks during their visit.

GE Healthcare is taking every opportunity to maintain and provide a safe and healthy environment for visitors to the Medical Imaging Innovation tour in an effort to support its customers with the latest imaging technology to serve their patients.

Breast Academy is a unique opportunity to learn from and engage with experts all focused on a common goal: improving breast cancer detection via precision diagnostics precision therapy and precision monitoring tailored to each patient along the breast care pathway.

They have been charged under 15 sections of the Indian Penal Code and three sections of the Information Technology (IT) Act. The complaint was filed by the brother of the General Secretary of Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust and leader of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) Champat Rai NDTV reported.

Land Belonging To NRI

In his post on June 18 Narain claimed that the land in Bijnor district claimed by Rai's brothers belonged to a Non-Resident Indian Alka Lahoti. The general secretary had been facilitating the land encroachment by his brothers. Narain also attached an application with the details of the landowner (Lahoti) where the cowshed was built.

Intention To Tarnish Reputation

The Complainant Sanjay Bansal accused the journalist Lahoti and Rajneesh of degrading his family's reputation circulating false information cheating trespassing and hurting the religious sentiments of Hindus.

""The posts were false and fabricated. Vineet Narain has hatched a conspiracy with Alka and the other accused against the family. The sentiments of crores of Hindus have been hurt and social order is disturbed"" the media quoted Bansal's FIR.

In his complaint Bansal said he had called Narain and asked him to present the facts of the case. But his phone was answered by Rajneesh who allegedly misbehaved and threatened to kill him he said.

In a video District Police Chief Dharm Vir Singh informed that the inquiry in the matter is underway; however he also claimed that prima facie the allegations against Rai and his relatives seemed 'baseless'.

After being charged Narain took to social media saying he was not harassed by any other party in the last 19 years except the Bharatiya Janata Party.

@RSSorg @friendsofrss @BJP4India @BJP4UP @VHPDigital Some friends in BJP & RSS are upset by my recent outburst against RSS leadership. They are saying that it is damaging the cause of Hinduism. Here is my take on it;; After exposing corruption of all major political parties... — Vineet Narain (@NarainVineet) June 19 2021

The three have been charged under Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion) 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings) 293 (circulating obscene objects) 448 (punishment for house-trespass).

Updated: Jun 19 2021 19:30 IST IST

Milkha Singh - one of India's biggest sporting icons - who died on June 18 wrote about winning the 200m race at an International Athletic competition in Lahore in 1960. It was Pakistan's second president Gen Ayub Khan who gave him the nickname that would stick with him for the rest of his life

The National Games were held for three days during which l set new records-100 metres (10.4); 200 metres (20.8); 400 metres (46.1); 4x100-metre relay (42.1); and 4x400-metre relay (3.12.6).

Soon after the National Games our team had received an invitation from the Pakistani government for the Indo-Pak Sports Meet. What an ironic twist of fate. I was returning to the land where I was born where I had lost my home and most of my family in the inhuman savagery that followed Partition . It was not the religious bigotry that troubled me just the fear that the visit would revive those horrible memories. I did not want to go but Pandit Nehru intervened saying that this visit was for the honour of our country and that I was going as an ambassador for India. The others in our team felt as I did as we reluctantly travelled to the border at Attari via Amritsar . The welcoming committee at the border greeted us warmly and then we were taken by bus to the Faletti's Hotel in Lahore."

Here's What You Need to Remember: Where the YF-22 had the edge however was in agility something that is of the utmost of importance in a fighter aircraft. The YF-22 ""Lightning II"" was simply better in a dogfight and that was enough to convince the Air Force that it would be the better of the two.

For every winner there is also a second best. When it comes to military hardware there are plenty of designs that were very good very innovative and likely would have been more than up to the role required – but there was simply something just a little better.

This is certainly the case of the Northrop/McDonnell Douglas YF-23 a fifth-generation single-seat twin-engine stealth fighter designed for the United States Air Force in the late 1980s as part of the American Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) challenge. The ATF program came about to address the perceived threat from the Soviet Union's Sukhoi Su-27 and Mikoyan MiG-29 and while several companies originally submitted design proposals in the end the USAF opted for designs from Northrop and from Lockheed – which partnered with Boeing and General Dynamics on the YF-22 ""Lightning II"" later adapted into service as the F-22 Raptor.

The YF-23's unique design was quite distinct from the YF-22 and it has been described as having an ""almost pancake-like airframe structure with blended wing elements."" Its diamond-shaped wings were meant to reduce aerodynamic drag at transonic speeds.

Two prototypes of the YF-23 were built each with a different set of engines – as one element of the development phase of the program was to evaluate two experimental turbofan engines. Prototype Air Vehicle 1 (PAV-1) which was painted charcoal gray and unofficially nicknamed ""Spider"" or ""Black Widow II"" – in honor of the Northrop P-61 Black Widow flown during World War II – was equipped with the Pratt & Whitney YF199 engines. Prototype Air Vehicle 2 (PAV-2) which was painted in two shades of gray and nicknamed ""Gray Ghost"" was powered by a pair of General Electric YF120 engines.

The prototype planes were both fast and stealthy. The plane's low profile and classified skin material on the airframe was said to be nearly 100% undetectable by nearly any radar system of the period. The ""supercruise"" function allowed the fighter to achieve sustained supersonic flight without the use of the afterburner.

The designs called for the YF-23 to be armed with a fixed 20mm M61 Vulcan while internal bays could house four AIM-7 Sparrow or AIM-120 AMRAAM medium-range air-to-air missiles as well as a pair of AIM-9 short-range missiles.

The YF-23 was very evenly matched with the YF-22. While the YF-23 had a top speed of 1451mph to the YF-22's 1599mph the Northrop design had a longer range and a higher ceiling – 2796 miles maximum range and a ceiling of 65000 feet. By contrast the YF-22 had a range of 2000 miles and a ceiling of 50000 feet.

Where the YF-22 had the edge however was in agility something that is of the utmost of importance in a fighter aircraft. The YF-22 ""Lightning II"" was simply better in a dogfight and that was enough to convince the Air Force that it would be the better of the two.

In the end it wasn't that the YF-23 was a bad design nor was it really a losing design. It was really just a classic example of where the competition was just that much better.

ATLANTA — Georgia State officially appointed the first Black president in the school's history this week naming Dr. M. Brian Blake to the post.

He had most recently been the provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs at George Washington University in D.C.

Dr. Blake is a Georgia native who holds a master's in science from Mercer University and a bachelor's in electrical engineering from Georgia Tech. In his position at GWU he was the school's highest-ranking academic officer overseeing 28000 students.

He succeeds Mark Becker who was the school's president for the last 12 years.

“I’m deeply honored to have been selected as Georgia State president” Dr. Blake said in a statement. “I’m keenly aware of what President Becker and the faculty staff and students have accomplished and I am anxious to build on the university’s great momentum. Working together I know we can take our university to new heights in the coming years.”

Dr. Blake has also previously held high-ranking positions at Drexel University in Philadelphia and the University of Notre Dame. He began his career in academia as a professor at Georgetown University. He earned his Ph.D. in information and software engineering from George Mason University.

He's also previously worked at companies including General Electric Lockheed Martin General Dynamics and the MITRE Corporation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzIwL3dpbGwtdGhlLXVzLW5hdnktdHVybi1pdHMtZXhwZWRpdGlvbmFyeS1mYXN0LXRyYW5zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will the U.S. Navy Turn Its Expeditionary Fast Transports Into Robots?,"At under $250 million apiece the EPF could evolve into a drone-guided missile cruiser for the Navy.

Dateline: June 7 2021

Austal USA Mobile Alabama is awarded a $44000000 fixed-price [contract] for the detail design procurement production implementation and demonstration of autonomous capability in Expeditionary Fast Transport (EPF) 13.

I admit that when I saw this contract announcement from the Department of Defense last week I had to read it twice.

Then three times.

Unless my eyes had deceived me the Pentagon had just revealed -- alongside rote recitations of the day's contract awards for activities such as ""paving"" work at an air base ""design-bid-build construction services"" and logistics support for a helicopter -- that it is turning one of its most advanced ship-types into a drone.

What the heck is an Expeditionary Fast Transport?

For those not familiar with the term an ""Expeditionary Fast Transport"" (curiously abbreviated ""EPF"") is the Navy's catamaran-like non-combatant transport ship formerly dubbed the Joint High Speed Vessel. Displacing only 1500 tons the renamed EPF -- also known as the ""Spearhead class"" -- comprises an aluminum deck section with 20000 square feet of cargo space elevated above and supported by two long hulls that make contact with the water. That's enough room to carry an entire Marine Corps company along with all its armored vehicles.

Driven by four powerful diesel engines an EPF can reach speeds as great as 43 knots. For comparison your average commercial transport carrying freight containers chugs along at speeds less than half as fast -- so you can see why the EPF's old name included the descriptor ""high speed.""

It's also an extremely economical vessel. Although the contract awarded last week was only a ""modification"" adding funds to a previously awarded contract according to government reports the total program cost for building the first 10 Spearhead-class EPFs was approximately $1.7 billion -- roughly $170 million per ship. (Compare that to the cost of an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer ... at $2 billion each!)

Austal (AUTLY) is the prime contractor on the EPF program and American defense contracting giant General Dynamics (GD 1.10%) is a key subcontractor responsible for integrating the ship's computing infrastructure and mission systems.

Rethinking the EPF

Ordinarily in addition to its passengers an EPF carries a crew of 26 -- but EPF 13 will apparently be different. As confirmed by USNI News a few days ago when Austal builds the USNS Apalachicola (EPF 13) it will be designed to operate either with a crew or without.

According to Austal USNS Apalachicola ""will include installation of a perception and autonomy control suite as well as several automation enhancements ... reducing the amount of personnel required for operations and maintenance at sea"" -- or even permitting the ship to be operated entirely remotely.

What comes next

And here's where the story gets really interesting. According to USNI Austal has ""put forward the EPF platform as an option for the Navy's Large Unmanned Surface Vessel (LUSV) in the past"" offering to add ""vertical launch cells"" so as to convert the basic transport design into essentially a robotic guided-missile cruiser.

On top of all that the flat-topped EPF is designed to support helicopter operations. It wouldn't be too great a stretch to imagine it sailing autonomously carrying missiles autonomously and even being equipped with a Northrop Grumman MQ-8B Fire Scout drone helicopter or three to permit autonomous flight operations.

Even if adding autonomy raises the cost of an EPF to $214 million ($170 million plus $44 million) and even with the additional cost of integrating weapons systems onto the base design that could make for a powerful and economical alternative to many of the Navy's pricier crewed warships.

Granted Austal isn't the only company competing to design an LUSV for the Navy -- Huntington Ingalls (HII 1.64%) Lockheed Martin (LMT 0.48%) Italian defense contractor Fincantieri Marinette engineering firm Gibbs & Cox and even privately owned American shipyard Bollinger are all also interested in this work. But while these other companies all share in a single $42 million contract awarded last year for developing the concept Austal has now won a contract to actually build a ship that could prove its autonomous bona fides and support future bids to win LUSV contracts down the road.

Indeed that may be the most significant part of last week's contract win for Austal -- the chance that it will lead to even more contract wins in the future."

For many of us Chex Mix is an iconic childhood snack that was both brought to grade school in ziplock bags and laid out at holiday parties. It's often savory umami taste from cheddar squares pretzels and other salty crackers combined with the more neutral crunch of Chex cereal has been beloved for decades.

Whether store-bought or from your grandmother's kitchen the seemingly glorified trail mix was something we all enjoyed as tots but few of us know about the surprising origin story of this snack.

It already might be a surprise to find out that before being sold to General Mills in 1996 (via The Wall Street Journal) Chex cereal was the creation of Ralston Purina. If you're a pet parent that name might sound familiar — it's the same name that's on puppy's food and your cat's litter. So how did a pet food company come up with such a robust line of cereal and subsequently one of America's favorite snacks?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1dGNobmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA2LzE5L2thbnNhcy13aGVhdC1jcm9wLWlzLXNldC10by1kZWxpdmVyLWhpZ2gteWllbGRzLWFuZC1oaWdoLXF1YWxpdHkvNzczNzU3MzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kansas wheat crop appears to be in good shape this year,"Triple-digit temperatures did not stop this year's wheat harvest in Kansas. In fact the dry weather helped the harvest along.

This past week farmers in south-central Kansas hit the fields. On Monday according to the Kansas Wheat Commission wheat farmers in Labette and Wilson counties mounted their combines. By Tuesday Allen Montgomery and Neosho counties joined the mix.

Brent Stuckey who farms in Reno County started on Tuesday as well. But he had to take a break on Wednesday waiting for the wheat to be ready. On Thursday he and his son-in-law Jonathan Williams were back in the fields.

""When it's right you gotta go get it quick"" Stuckey said. ""This spring was pretty good for wheat because it was cool and wet.""

This year's crop of Kansas wheat seems to be in good shape according to the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service. As of June 13 the winter wheat condition rated 3% very poor 8% poor 25% fair 53% good and 11% excellent. Its coloring was 79%. This is behind the more than 80% from last year as well as the five-year average. The maturity level was 18%. This is 28% behind last year's maturity.

On Thursday the coops near Garden City started receiving wheat. But in some places in the state the wheat is not yet ready. Kevin Royer the general manager for Midland Marketing Cooperative in Hays said harvest will not start in Hays until the end of this week.

Along with the wheat as of last week according to the USDA both the topsoil and subsoil moisture supplies rated more than 80% adequate.

With 6 1/2 days suitable for fieldwork the Kansas Wheat Commission reported that yields were similar to last year with test weights at either 60 pounds per bushel or higher.

For Stuckey they were higher coming in at 63 pounds per bushel. He also said his yields were well above average. Although Stuckey has utilized grazing and cover crops for the past four years he has recently started a new procedure.

Both Stuckey's father and grandfather tilled and plowed the land right outside of Abbyville that he now farms on. Fifteen years ago he stopped tilling. Four years ago he introduced cover crops and rented out a small chunk of land to ranchers for their cattle to graze on. Then he realized he wanted to do more to regenerate the soil but he wasn't sure what.

Last year when Stuckey heard about the General Mills regenerative agriculture program he signed on. He quickly started instituting the advice of Understanding Ag's agronomists who are helping the farmers with regenerative methods.

Stuckey had used primarily rye and radishes for cover in the past but this year following Understanding Ag's advice he used a more diversified cover crop blend and rented out more of his land for winter cattle grazing. He said because of the new seeds the frost and drought stress did not bother this year's crop.

""We've seen frost not really bother the new varieties of wheat"" he said.

What Stuckey is concerned about is the high cost of diesel equipment and labor.

""It's just a roller coaster"" he said. ""Good (commodity) prices don't mean profit because the high expenses come right along with it.""

But Stuckey enjoys what he does. He said he and his wife Denise are focused on eventually passing on the farm. By using regenerative methods using less chemicals and inputs they want to leave the ground better for their grandchildren's generation.

""We're doing it for the next generation"" Stuckey said. Stuckey's 3-year-old grandson Kase can sit all day in the combine and keep asking questions about farming. This Stuckey said keeps him wanting to do more for the land.

June 20 2021

Raven Industries one of Sioux Falls’ biggest homegrown business success stories is being acquired by a London-based multinational corporation.

CNH Industrial N.V. announced in a news release it has entered into an agreement to acquire 100 percent of Raven’s capital stock valuing it at $2.1 billion or $58 per share which represents a 33.6 percent premium to the four-week volume-weighted average stock price. In the last 52 weeks Raven stock has ranged from a low of $19.84 to a high of $47.43.

Raven stock closed Monday at $57.65 per share.

The transaction will be funded with available cash on hand of CNH Industrial. Closing is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2021 subject to closing conditions including approval of Raven shareholders and receipt of regulatory approvals.

In a statement the companies said the acquisition builds on a long partnership and “will further enhance CNH Industrial’s position in the global agriculture equipment market by adding strong innovation capabilities in autonomous and precision agriculture technology.”

CNH Industrial’s global headquarters in the UK but it is largely owned by the Italian investment company Exor. The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and on Borsa Italiana. It is incorporated in the Netherlands.

Through its various businesses CNH Industrial designs produces and sells agricultural equipment and construction equipment including Case IH and New Holland brand families trucks commercial vehicles buses and special vehicles in addition to powertrains for industrial and marine applications.

Raven has three divisions including its applied technology division which focuses on precision agriculture; engineered films which focuses on high-performance specialty films; and Aerostar which works in the aerospace industry.

This acquisition emphasizes our commitment to enhance our precision farming portfolio and aligns with our digital transformation strategy. The combination of Raven’s technologies and CNH Industrial’s strong current and new product portfolio will provide our customers with novel connected technologies allowing them to be more productive and efficient.”

Raven was founded in 1956 by a group of former General Mills employees who wanted to make high-altitude balloons first selling them as research balloons to the U.S. Navy. It’s headquartered in downtown Sioux Falls. It evolved into the various business lines along the way and recently has identified autonomous agriculture products as key to its future growth.

“Our board and management are excited about this partnership and what it means for our future” said Dan Rykhus Raven’s president and CEO.

“For 65 years our company has been committed to solving great challenges. Part of that commitment includes delivering groundbreaking innovation by developing and investing in our core capabilities and technology. By coming together with CNH Industrial we believe we will further accelerate that path as well as bring tremendous opportunities and value to our customers — once again fulfilling our purpose to solve great challenges. Our relationship with CNH Industrial has expanded over decades and we have a deep respect for one another and a shared commitment to transform agriculture practices across the world. We look forward to CNH Industrial leveraging the Raven talent and culture as well as the Sioux Falls community as part of their vision and future success.”

In the statement CNH said it believes Raven’s engineered films and Aerostar divisions “represent attractive independent businesses with excellent near and long-term potential” it said. “Accordingly CNH Industrial plans to undertake a strategic review of each business to best position them for future success and maximize shareholder value.”

The deal is expected to generate $400 million in run-rate revenue synergies by calendar year 2025 resulting in in $150 million of incremental EBITDA.

June 19 2021 — A General Motors recall has been issued for more than 135000 Buick Encore GX and Chevrolet Trailblazer vehicles even though there are no defective parts or components.

GM says customers aren't following the directions for positioning the emergency jacks a problem that has caused 21 jacks to break.

The 2020-2022 Buick Encore GX and 2021-2022 Chevrolet Trailblazer vehicles have directions in the owner's manuals about how to position the jacks on the vehicle frames. But not reading the instructions can cause the jack to be mispositioned which can cause the jack to fracture under load.

A GM 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer test driver reported a jack broke in March which caused the automaker to open an investigation. Engineers determined the jack broke because the test driver didn't follow the directions and the jack was mispositioned.

During the investigation GM learned about 21 field reports which claimed the jacks failed.

""Although the jack is sufficiently robust when used appropriately and per the included instructions failures can still occur due to customer usage.""

GM says there aren't enough replacement emergency jacks available for all the recalled vehicles. The automaker says if an owner needs to use the jack the customer should forget the jack and instead call Chevrolet roadside assistance at 800-243-8872 or Buick roadside assistance at 800-252-1112.

General Motors dealers will replace the recalled jacks with newly designed jacks and undelivered vehicles will have the jacks removed prior to deliveries. GM will eventually announce a customer service action to equip those vehicles with new jacks.

Buick Encore GX and Chevrolet Trailblazer owners should watch for recall notices which will be mailed July 26 2021.

Owners may contact Buick at 800-521-7300 or Chevrolet at 800-222-1020. GM's recall number is A212335470."

This may be the first time in Pakistani history that this has happened.

As of the end of calendar year 2020 the largest pharmaceutical company in Pakistan is GlaxoSmithKline Pakistan the local subsidiary of the UK-based global giant with Rs34.4 billion in local revenues. The second largest is Getz Pharma owned and operated by CEO Khalid Mahmood is a local company that manufactures mostly generic drugs with Rs32.2 billion in local revenue according to data from IQVIA the global pharmaceutical data provider.

While GSK is currently bigger than Getz the latter is growing significantly faster with 2020 revenue growth numbers clocking in at 6.4% for GSK and 14.0% for Getz. In other words the local company is rapidly gaining on the global giant and may soon overtake it in aggregate local market share. (The global parent of GSK will likely remain the largest player overall in Pakistan owing to the fact that it operates a second subsidiary in the country called GSK Consumer Health.)

This story however is not about Getz versus GSK. It is about the broader trend that is taking place in Pakistan where the local pharmaceutical industry is growing faster than their foreign counterparts operating in the Pakistani market. This is despite the fact that the foreign pharmaceutical giants that have Pakistani subsidiaries have – at least in theory – access to far more innovative and new products than the largely generic products sold by the local companies.

But the data tells an unmistakable story: if you bifurcate the Pakistani pharmaceutical industry into local versus foreign players (as IQVIA does in its data sets) one gets a very clear picture: between 2016 and 2020 the aggregate industry grew its revenues by an average of 11.5% per year to reach Rs501 billion for the financial year ending December 31 2020. But during that period the local industry averaged 12.4% growth per year whereas the foreign companies averaged 9.6% per year.

How have the local companies done this? What are they able to navigate better than the foreign companies? And how stable is the advantage of the local companies? But first a brief introduction to the industry in Pakistan.

Industry structure

There are 775 pharmaceutical manufacturers in the country. However of those the top 15 have an approximately 59% combined market share and the top 100 command close to a 97% share of the total revenue of the industry.

In terms of market share the local companies have about 68.8% of the industry’s revenues whereas the foreign companies have approximately 31.2%. That is down slightly from the 33.3% that they used to command in 2016.

While the largest pharmaceutical company in Pakistan is GlaxoSmithKline the country also has a local presence of some of the biggest names in pharmaceuticals: Abbott Sanofi-Aventis Pfizer Novartis etc. all have a presence in Pakistan and often quite substantial ones at that.

The local companies include names like Getz Pharma The Searle Company Martin Dow Hilton Pharma etc. The overwhelming majority of these even the largest ones are generic drug manufacturers with very little by way of local research and development capabilities though some of these companies do participate in global drug trials for products developed by global pharmaceutical giants.

The drug pricing problem

The single most important thing to understand about the pharmaceutical industry is the fact that the government sets its prices and decides how much they can increase their prices by each year. The entire pharmaceutical industry in Pakistan is regulated by the government under a legislative framework first created by the 1966 Drug Act which also created the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP).

DRAP has introduced pricing policies first in 2015 and then in 2018 that were designed to ensure that pharmaceutical companies are able to continue to make profits on their products while also not increasing the prices too much for the public. Coming as it did after a 15-year effective moratorium on drug price increases that change was considered welcome by the industry.

But the structural problem is this: the government sets both the retail price as well as the retailers’ margins which effectively means that gross profit margins for the entire industry are set by regulatory fiat. The manufacturer is able to receive a price between 20% and 25% below the retail price which means that the entire supply chain operates on margins contained in that 25% margin.

This gets us into an age-old debate when it comes to drug prices. Pharmaceutical companies argue that they need both patent protection for the newly researched drugs that they have produced as well as the ability to charge whatever prices they deem fit in order to be able to cover the cost of the research and development that goes into producing new and innovative therapies.

Critics of the pharmaceutical industry – at least the ones that know what they are talking about – that pharmaceutical products are not like other products where a consumer has many other choices including the ability to choose not to buy the product. A life-saving product is something that the person who needs it values very highly and would be willing to pay even extortionate levels of prices to secure access to something that will keep them alive. But it is in society’s interest that as many people as possible have access to the healthcare products they need and hence they advocate for price controls.

The approach advocated by the pharmaceutical companies is one adopted pretty much only by the United States. Virtually every other country in the world has some form of price controls over and above any public health insurance program they may have. That means that most countries not only offer free or highly subsidized healthcare to their citizens they also force the pharmaceutical companies to charge prices determined by government bureaucrats and not the market.

In effect this means that the large multinational pharmaceutical companies – whether they be American or European – make their money in the United States to help pay for the research and development activities they conduct for breakthrough therapies. The United States is subsidizing the development of advanced treatment for the whole world.

(That by the way is why the US government did not even blink before making sure that the US had adequate vaccine supplies first before then allowing them to be shipped to other parts of the world. If they pay for the development they feel like they deserve access before anyone else.)

Why is all of this relevant to the Pakistani pharmaceutical sector? Because it illustrates the kind of market environment the multinational companies face globally and it affects the choices they make locally.

Pakistan is like almost every other country in the world in that it has government-mandated price controls for pharmaceutical products. And the government not only mandates the initial price it mandates just how much they can go up each year and how much each participant in the supply chain is allowed to keep as their profit margin.

All of that means that even though healthcare spending in Pakistan is going up substantially – and Pakistan is undergoing a revolution with respect to increased public financing of healthcare – the market is not one where the global pharmaceutical companies see big profits for themselves. It does not help that Pakistan is right next to India which is both a much larger market and also a much more important component of the global pharmaceutical supply chain.

Price versus volume

If you are in a business where you cannot increase your prices by as much as you would like the best way to improve profits would then be to increase volumes and hope that scale allows your business to squeeze out higher margins in addition to higher overall cash flow.

It appears that the local pharmaceutical companies have understood this whereas the foreign ones appear to still be reliant largely on price increases.

Break out the growth rates of both the local and foreign pharmaceutical companies into their components and you can see a fascinating pattern. That 12.4% revenue growth rate for local pharmaceutical companies is split almost exactly evenly between price increases (6.2% per year on average between 2016 and 2020) and volume growth (5.8% per year). For the foreign pharmaceutical companies the numbers are very lopsided: that 9.6% per year average growth rate is 8.5% price increases and only 1.1% volume increases.

Simply put the local companies are growing their topline by selling more products and accepting the fact that they will not be able to substantially increase prices. The foreign companies are reliant almost entirely on price increases even though they theoretically have far more new products that they could be offering in the market that could increase their volume growth.

How did we arrive at this breakdown? We used IQVIA data on both total revenue and total volume divided the former with the latter and arrived at the weighted averaged ‘price’ per product that both categories of pharmaceutical companies are selling. The actual level itself is less relevant than how the two different categories of pharmaceutical companies fare relative to each other and relative to their own past data.

The weighted average prices of local products have grown at a significantly slower rate than those of the foreign products. Given the fact that both sets of companies face the exact same drug pricing regulatory regime the reason why the local companies have seen the weighted average prices of their products go up slower than their foreign counterparts is most likely due to their introduction of lower priced products into their mix.

We specify this because it is easy to spin conspiracy theories about foreign companies being able to engage in price gouging when the reality is that their prices are just as much determined by the government as that of local companies. Nobody is particularly happy with the prices the government gives them.

The local-foreign partnerships

So how have the local companies managed to increase their volumes if the new products are mostly controlled by foreign companies? After all if you are a generic drug manufacturer you have to rely on the patent expiring before you can start manufacturing new products.

There is certainly at least some of that. As patents expire in the United States Pakistani generic drug manufacturers are free to begin producing those and offering them to local consumers are relatively affordable prices.

But at least a significant part of the new products being offered by local drug manufacturers are in partnership with innovative pharmaceutical companies in the United States that have no wholly owned subsidiary in Pakistan.

For instance in 2014 Gilead Sciences – the US-based pharmaceutical giant – announced a partnership with Ferozsons Laboratories for the manufacturing of Sovaldi and Harvoni two drugs that can cure hepatitis C a disease that was previously thought of as a chronic condition that could only be managed but not cured.

In 2020 at least three Pakistani companies – Horizon Pharma Bio Labs and Ferozsons – were able to begin manufacturing remdesivir a broad-spectrum antiviral medication developed by Gilead Sciences and found to be somewhat effective in the treatment of Covid-19. And Pakistan was part of the global drug trial network for the Covid-19 vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies based in other parts of the world.

Indeed of the top 10 new products introduced into the Pakistani market last year only one was introduced by a foreign pharmaceutical company. The rest were all introduced by Pakistani companies and most were either in partnership with companies based abroad or were generic versions of drugs whose patents have expired.

How sustainable is the local advantage?

While the local companies have done well in terms of being able to grow their toplines particularly relative to their foreign counterparts you will have noticed something: they are reliant entirely on research and development of drugs done elsewhere usually in the United States and Europe and occasionally in other parts of the world.

Either they are introducing generic versions of drugs that have lost their patents or they are entering into partnerships with companies like Gilead which are based in the United States and conduct most of their research there and occasionally share it with manufacturers in countries like Pakistan. At no point are Pakistani drug companies developing innovative new products that they conducted the research to develop themselves.

This obviously is not entirely their fault. The pricing policies introduced by DRAP – the original 1966 law as well as the 2015 and 2018 regulations – effectively assume that the vast majority of research and development will not be done inside Pakistan and hence barely even address the possibility of how to price an innovative product.

What that means is that if the foreign manufacturers decided one day to start importing or manufacturing more of their innovative products in Pakistan the growth spurt that the local generic manufacturers have been able to experience over the past five years is likely to be replaced by an increase in the market share of the foreign players.

So why does that not happen? The reasons for this are complex and have to do with the production supply chain in Pakistan and the fact that a significant proportion of the world’s most complex precursor ingredients for pharmaceutical products are manufactured in India and are difficult if not impossible to import into Pakistan.

Why would any global pharmaceutical company invest in manufacturing complex ingredients in Pakistan? It does not have a large enough market to justify the high investments needed to make those ingredients for domestic consumption alone and why would you set up export capacity in Pakistan when India is right next door and it is will cost just as much (and perhaps slightly more) to ship goods from Pakistan than it would from India?

Well could the government decide to allow multinationals to import more from India but that would run into two problems. First the local companies would complain since it would diminish their cost advantages. After all if the Indian generic manufacturers can export their products to Pakistan the Pakistani generic manufacturers would likely face difficulty in maintaining their market share of their own market.

And the second biggest factor of course is the fact that this is something that directly pits the welfare of Pakistani citizens against our misplaced sense of ‘national pride’ against India. When exactly in our history have we ever chosen the former over the latter?

Is pharma’s dominance of healthcare itself under threat?

Pharmaceutical drugs account for approximately 62% of total healthcare spending in Pakistan based on Profit’s analysis of data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. Needless to say that makes it the single most important component of Pakistan’s healthcare sector. But with the advent of the Sehat Insaf card which provides government-subsidised health insurance to the poorest Pakistanis that may change.

See the reason why pharmaceuticals are such a large part of the healthcare spending in Pakistan has to do with the fact that most Pakistanis cannot afford much else. Drugs are cheap and readily available. And while laws exist to not allow the use of prescription drugs without a valid medical prescription those laws are too often flouted by pharmacists.

Going to see a doctor or more expensive still getting a surgery are far more expensive propositions. Of course a pill is not a substitute for a surgery in most cases but when you cannot afford the surgery you have to make do with the pill.

That however is about to change. The government’s health insurance scheme means that the poorest of Pakistanis will be able to walk into the most expensive of hospitals and get medical treatment that they need paid for by a government insurance program up to quite generous limits.

The Sehat Insaf program will cover up Rs600000 per year per family (Rs300000 defined as ‘initial coverage’ and another Rs300000 as ‘additional coverage’) for high-cost hospital procedures and up to Rs120000 per family per year for other types of hospital-based healthcare coverage.

These amounts may not be sufficient for the most expensive hospitals or the most expensive diseases but they are a lot more money than what most low-income people currently have access to. And instead of begging their employers for help they now have access to a government program that gives them similar access to healthcare services.

Given the fact that the prices of inpatient and outpatient hospital services have been reduced by government subsidy demand for such services will increase markedly meaning the growth segment in Pakistani healthcare will become hospitals not pharmaceuticals.

Of course this does not mean that drugs will not continue to grow and indeed some of the biggest users of drugs are hospitals themselves. But it does mean that the nature and composition of care availed by the average Pakistani is about to change in a material way and the drug companies should expect that they will not be on the winning end of that shift.

It is likely however that the drug companies themselves would welcome such a shift. They have been the crutch used by the Pakistani public for a long time and as a result their pricing policies get extra scrutiny from the government. As other areas of healthcare get more prominence perhaps the regulatory pressures on pharmaceutical companies will diminish allowing them indirect growth opportunities that are currently closed off.

Losing the top position in the end may not be such a bad thing after all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hhcnAuY29tL3NjaWVuY2Uvc3dvbGxlbi1mZWV0LWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmUv0gE-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGVjaGFycC5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9zd29sbGVuLWZlZXQtY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fact Check : Swollen Feet From COVID-19 Vaccine?,"Spread the love

Did a man get swollen feet after getting the COVID-19 vaccine?

Take a look at the viral post and find out what the FACTS really are!

Claim : Man Gets Swollen Feet From COVID-19 Vaccine!

A picture is being circulated on WhatsApp together with a voice message in Cantonese claiming that this man developed swollen feet after getting the COVID-19 vaccine!

My Cantonese is rusty but here is my English translation of the voice message which you can listen for yourself below :

My friend’s brother’s friend had his (COVID-19 vaccine) injection and drank alcohol. His legs became swollen. He can die from it. He doesn’t listen he drank alcohol after getting his (vaccine) injection.

Truth : Swollen Feet Were Not From COVID-19 Vaccine!

The truth is this is yet another fake viral message about the COVID-19 vaccine on WhatsApp.

The man’s swollen feet had nothing to do with his recent COVID-19 vaccination. He has long suffered from diabetes and hypertension.

The Dayak Daily reported that his wife lodged a police report with the police in their hometown of Kanowit Sarawak on 18 June 2021.

According to Kanowit district police chief Superintendent Tega Bilong his wife was informed about this viral message by her cousin on 17 June 2021 :

“The cousin informed her that a member of a church WhatsApp group in Kuala Lumpur had posted a message with a photo of her husband’s legs. The person claimed that the legs of the complainant’s husband were swollen due to the second dose of vaccine that he had received recently.”

The 61 year-old woman denied that the COVID-19 vaccine caused her husband’s swollen feet and said that she would not hesitate to take action against those who continue to spread the fake news.

She filed the police report as she feared for her family’s safety as the public might believe the fake news. She also feared that the government might accuse her of creating the fake news.

So now that you know this is fake news please share this fact check with your friends so they won’t get fooled too!

Note : Watch Out For Swollen Feet After Receiving AstraZeneca Vaccine

While this viral message is fake news swollen feet or legs is one of the potential symptoms for the rare blood clots associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine.

If you receive the AstraZeneca vaccine just keep an eye out for these symptoms :

Severe headache that

– does not improve with simple painkillers (like paracetamol / acetaminophen)

– gets worse when lying down

– does not improve with simple painkillers (like paracetamol / acetaminophen) – gets worse when lying down Neurological changes

– drowsiness

– seizures

– blurred vision – speech difficulties – drowsiness – seizures Nausea and vomiting

Persistent abdominal pain

Back pain

Shortness of breath

Leg pain or swelling

Petechiae (tiny blood spots under the skin)

Easy bruising or bleeding

If you notice any of these symptoms after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine DO NOT WAIT. Seek medical attention right away!

Steel scaffolding from the DASH highway under construction collapsed today injuring two workers!

Here is what we know so far…

DASH Highway Scaffolding Collapsed Injuring Two Workers!

At around 7 PM today (19 June 2021) steel scaffolding from the DASH highway under construction near the Kota Damansara toll of the NKVE highway collapsed.

Two Bangladeshi workers (between 20 and 40 years old) were under the steel scaffolding when it fell from a height of about 12 metres.

Both workers suffered injuries from the flying debris and have been taken to the Sungai Buloh Hospital for treatment.

PROLINTAS Statement On DASH Scaffolding Collapse

PROLINTAS the developer of the DASH highway issued a stop work order and their ERT (Emergency Response Team) had already started to remove the debris.

Here is our English translation of the PROLINTAS statement on the incident :

STEEL SCAFFOLDING COLLAPSE INCIDENT AT HIGHWAY UNDER CONSTRUCTION Kuala Lumpur 19 June 2021 – Project Lintasan Damansara-Shah Alam Sdn. Bhd. the developer for the DASH (Damansara-Shah Alam Elevated Highway) construction project confirms that there was an incident where steel scaffolding fell inside the DASH construction area near Kota Damansara late this afternoon. In that incident two Bangladeshi workers suffered injuries and were brought to the Sungai Buloh Hospital for treatment. The incident did not involve highway users or the public because it happened within a closed construction area. The DASG Emergency Response Team (ERT) was on site to control traffic and remove the steel scaffolding. A stop work order was issued immediately. The developer and main contractor will give their full cooperation to the relevant authorities investigating this incident. We will issue follow-up statements regarding this incident from time to time.

Ask the public and they may jump to dystopian scenarios where robots have taken over the world.

While this makes for a good sci-fi blockbuster plot the reality is different and more benign. Those products that Amazon suggested you buy? AI. That TV series you were recommended to watch on Netflix? AI. That self-driving Tesla car you crave to take for a spin? You guessed it: AI.

There is no single industry that is not being re-shaped by technology. Until recently however there was one noteworthy exception: global trade. Fortunately that is slowly changing.

The mechanism that underpins global trade – trade finance – is an industry that remains largely paper-based and reliant on manual processes. This US$18tn a year industry is now being influenced by a new wave of technological innovation including AI.

Exploring the potential of AI in Trade Finance

AI refers to the use of computer-aided systems to help people make decisions or make decisions for them. It relies on large volumes of data and models to make sense of information and draw intelligence.

In trade finance AI is helpful in analysing quantitative data and the repetitive nature of trade finance means that there is a lot of non-traditional data at our disposal.

This means that when trade finance providers need to assess the risks of funding a transaction AI models can be a very efficient tool for data analysis and reveal intelligence and risks relating to small companies.

AI helps the industry move beyond traditional credit scoring processes which are often outdated and remain reliant on historical accounting entries – a barrier that prevents small companies from accessing trade finance and has resulted in a $1.5tn global shortfall.

Overcoming the barriers

AI can tackle this shortfall by creating accurate credit scoring models. This can include a company’s payment history measure the risks of funding a transaction identify supply chain risks and benchmark them against their peer group.

Trade finance providers can use this information to communicate effectively with their SME clients ultimately helping establish better business relationships.

Towards a technological utopia?

The adoption of AI has the potential to do a lot of good in the industry and the industry is in the early stages of radical transformation.

Advances are driven by fintechs as well as a willingness to change. The industry is working together to create new infrastructure for distributing trade finance assets to other investors in a transparent standardised format.

The creation of infrastructure is possible due to improvements in technology and integrated across the trade ecosystem in cooperation with banks insurers and other industry participants.

It’s collaboration at its best: together the industry is using technology to re-shape global trade as we know it.

It may have impacts across Canada,"A Quebec class-action lawsuit against providers of group registered educations savings plans (group RESPs) could have ripple effects across Canada.

The lawsuit which was authorized by the Superior Court of Quebec on March 31 targets six group RESP providers alleging that the sales charges or enrolment fees they have been charging in Quebec are unlawful and in some cases abusive. Authorization of a class-action lawsuit in Quebec is similar to a certification of a class-action lawsuit in other provinces.

Specifically the lawsuit is targeting Canadians C.S.T. Consultants Inc. and Canadian Scholarship Trust Foundation; Kaleido Growth (previously Universitas Management) and Kaleido Foundation (Previously Universitas Foundation Of Canada); Knowledge First Financial (previously Heritage Education Funds Inc.) and Knowledge First Foundation; Heritage Education Funds and Heritage Educational Foundation; Children’s Education Funds Inc. and Children’s Educational Foundation Of Canada; and Global RESP Corporation along with Global Educational Trust Foundation.

Group RESP providers typically manage the scholarship plans through non-profit foundations or trusts but market and administer the plan through a so-called “distributor” a for-profit corporation with close ties to the foundation.

4:07 Servus Credit Union debunks myths behind RESPs

Group RESPs are a type of group investment that pools funds from a number of individual accounts. Parents typically buy shares — called units — of the plan which is usually based on the child’s birth date. Families make contributions on a set schedule and receive the funds — coming from contributions government grants and investment returns — at maturity usually when the children turn 18 if they attend a qualifying higher education institution.

All Quebec residents who at any point since July 19 2013 signed a contract with any of the group RESP providers named in the lawsuit and were charged fees above $200 per plan are included in the class according to court documents. Of those Quebec residents those who have cancelled their RESP plan after that date and claim they lost more than 20 per cent of their contributions due to enrolment sales or membership fees are also included in a sub-class focused on the question of whether the charges were abusive.

While the scope of the lawsuit is limited to Quebec it could invite similar lawsuits in other provinces especially if successful says Gail Henderson a law professor at Queen’s University.

There is no trial date yet for the Quebec lawsuit and class-action lawsuits can take years to work their way through the courts.

But Joey Zukran of Montreal-based LPC Avocat who represents the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit says he’s already at work with counsel in Ontario to bring a similar case forward that would cover the rest of Canada.

The lawsuit could also prompt provincial securities regulators across the country to revisit some of the rules around group RESP products particularly those on enrolment fees Henderson adds.

Speaking to Global News via email all the defendants denied the allegations.

2:33 What to know before withdrawing from RESP savings

Lead plaintiff reportedly lost nearly $12K to fees

The lead plaintiff in the lawsuit Montreal resident Qing Wang lost $11720 to enrolment fees charged by C.S.T. for two RESP plans he’d opened for his two children the lawsuit alleges. The sum is equal to nearly 60 per cent of the roughly $20000 Wang contributed to both plans over a period of about two years according to the lawsuit.

Story continues below advertisement

Wang’s case is emblematic of how fees charged by the defendant group RESP providers violate Quebec laws and regulations in two respects the lawsuit alleges. First it is alleged that the fee schemes contravene a regulation of Quebec’s Securities Act that caps the fees at $200 per scholarship plan. Instead the group RESP providers have been charging $200 per unit according to the lawsuit.

Financial news and insights delivered to your email every Saturday.

Charging per plan vs. per unit can make a big difference. Usually generating enough payments at maturity to fund a child’s higher education requires purchasing multiple units of a plan Henderson says. With group RESP subscribers charged $200 per unit “those are the fees (that) do add up” she says.

Wang for example claims he had subscribed to 58.6 units for his two children which resulted in a total of $11720 in fees.

The Quebec regulation that says scholarship plan dealers should charge no more than $200 per plan is based on guidance that applies to all other provinces as well according to Henderson. But that guidance “isn’t necessarily binding” she adds.

The second issue the lawsuit raises is whether the way the fees are charged makes them abusive in some cases under Quebec’s civil code. Enrolment fees for group RESPs are front-loaded with 100 per cent of subscribers’ contributions going to fees until half of the fees are paid off. After that 50 per cent of contributions go to fees until the fees are completely paid off.

This structure means that subscribers who cease to participate in the plan in the first few months of years may have to forfeit all or a significant part of their contributions because of the fees which are non-refundable. The lawsuit argues in this case the fees should be considered abusive under article 1437 of the Quebec Civil Code.

Henderson notes that subscribers may lose a majority of their contributions to fees not only if they withdraw early from the plan but also if the group RESP provider terminates their plan because of missing or late contributions.

Families especially those on a limited income may fall behind on payments because of financial hardship she notes.

Wang the lead plaintiff lost 60 per cent of his contributions to fees when he decided to move both his children’s RESPs to individual RESPs at CIBC according to the lawsuit.

RESPs help parents save for their children’s education after high school. Investments held inside an RESP grow tax-free and the government pitches in extra money by topping up contributions (up to a certain limit). There is also additional funding for low-income families that doesn’t require contributions. But group RESPs are significantly different from individual or family RESPs that Canadians can open at financial institutions like banks credit unions and mutual fund companies.

Group RESPs can only be offered by scholarship plan dealers. The amount of money each child stands to receive for their post-secondary studies depends on how many units the family purchased how much money is in the pooled account and how many children attend post-secondary school that year. If families withdraw early have their plans terminated because they can’t keep up with payments or if their children don’t end up attending an eligible secondary institution the money earned on their contributions is often redistributed among the other participants who remain in the plan until maturity and whose children continue their studies as expected.

“A group RESP is for people who are fairly certain that the child will attend post-secondary school and who can make regular payments for many years” according to group RESP education materials provided by the non-profit SEED Winnipeg. “For people who may not be able to make regular payments or whose children may not attend post-secondary school there are other types of RESPs which may be more suitable.”

And group RESPs generally come with high fees and strict rules about maintaining eligibility although consumers are entitled to receiving their money back if they withdraw from the plan within 60 days.

The defendants maintain the fees they charge are fully compliant with applicable national and provincial regulations.

“Our organization adheres to the highest regulatory and ethical standards supported by strong corporate governance and financial oversight. In compliance with regulatory requirements we undergo rigorous approvals both at the provincial and federal level with every investment product we introduce” Peter Lewis chief revenue officer at C.S.T. Consultants told Global News via email.

“For a typical investor our total fees combined would represent the equivalent of about a 1 – 1.5 per cent annual management fee when averaged over 18 years. Our upfront fee model results in lower fees over time compared to other structures where fees are taken as a percentage of the total assets under management” he wrote.

“Most importantly” he also said “our company refunds 50 per cent of the sales fees when a student attends post-secondary school boosting the overall amount available for their education.”

The lawsuit he noted “disputes an industry-wide accepted fee structure that has been in place — at least — since 1979 and approved by regulators.”

Several of the defendants noted their fee amounts and structures are clearly disclosed including in prospectuses that subscribers receive upon or before signing in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

“As with all others in our sector fees are collected in order to cover the costs of the management of accounts associated investments and administration costs for what is normally an 18-25 year commitment” Global Education Trust Foundation said in a statement via email. “Moreover some plans may qualify for a full reimbursement of fees on maturity” it said.

Global RESP Corporation surrendered its registration as a scholarship plan dealer in March 2020 as part of a settlement agreement with the Ontario Securities Commission after what regulators called “continued non-compliance with Ontario securities law” by both the corporation and its related investment fund manager Global Growth Assets Inc. (GGAI).

“By their very nature RESPs are a long-term savings vehicle that are designed to deliver the best outcomes for subscribers and beneficiaries over their 18+ year lifetime” Knowledge First Financial’s chief compliance officer Darrell Bartlett wrote via email.

He also said that since 2012 the group RESP provider has “gradually transitioned” from group scholarship plans and ceased to sell those types of plans entirely in 2020.

“In 2022 all remaining group RESP plans managed by the company and its subsidiaries will be transferred to individual RESP plans which were specifically created to better meet the evolving needs of the market providing greater flexibility ownership and ease of use to subscribers and beneficiaries” Bartlett wrote via email.

Knowledge First Financial acquired Heritage Education in 2018.

Is disclosing the fees enough?

While regulators across Canada tightened rules around disclosure requirements for group RESP providers in 2013 the lawsuit may prompt provincial securities commissions “to go back and take a look at the rules relating to the enrollment fees specifically” Henderson says.

Among the information scholarship plan providers have to provide subscribers is a so-called “plan summary” a document of a few pages that is supposed to describe in plain language how the group plans work what fees are involved and the risks involved Henderson says.

Story continues below advertisement

Mandatory disclosures also include setting out how the fees will be charged.

But group plans are “often aggressively sold including to vulnerable investors who have little investing experience or who may not be fluent in English or French the languages in which they are generally sold here in Canada” the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has previously told Global News.

Wang signed up for the group RESPs for his two children just days after immigrating from China according to the lawsuit. Upon his arrival Wang and his family stayed in a property owned by a C.S.T. agent “who immediately introduced and sold the RESP plans to Mr. Wang” the documents read.

Wang does not speak English well according to Zukran.

Another issue is that families often learn about group plans from a salesperson working for the group plan provider.

“That person is paid probably solely based on sales commissions which is what the enrollment fees are there to cover. So they have an incentive to sell you as many units as possible in this particular plan” Henderson says. Nor do group plan salespeople have to make subscribers aware of the option of opening an individual or family RESP at a financial institution she adds.

As well a 2018 research report on group RESPs co-authored by Henderson for SEED Winnipeg found that compliance reviews of group RESPs revealed “breaches of securities regulations related to selling plans to low-income investors for whom they were not suitable.”

Low-income subscribers may be more likely to exit the plans before maturity the report noted.

“The question is whether disclosure really does sufficiently protect these investors” Henderson says.",,,

Here are highlights of the conversation edited for clarity:

What happens with “Mr. Hat” the Rangers victory trophy on road trips and after games is the person who won in charge of it?

Advertisement

Kyle Gibson: “When you get the hat especially when we’re at home like right now we’re at home for 10 days ... Jonah [Heim] has the hat right now and I think it’ll be in his locker. Then if he gives it away tonight then that person will have it in his locker until he gives it away.

“When we go on the road our head clubhouse manager Brandon will put it in a box. They’ve got a nice fancy hard-case box for it and it travels with the team under lock and key.”

So you’re not responsible for “Mr. Hat” if you have it?

Advertisement

Gibson: “Oh no that would be a nightmare. The hat would be ruined and probably wouldn’t make it to half the places we go.”

What do you think of the idea of robot umpires and do you think umpires are terrible?

Gibson: “No I do not think all umpires are terrible. I think every umpire is like every other human being and every now and then they have bad days and every now and then they have really good days. I think most of the time they’re pretty good. I would guess most of the time and I don’t have the numbers on this maybe half and half of the pitches go for the hitter and the other half go for the pitcher.

“That might lean to the pitcher a little bit from time to time but it’s probably pretty close to half and half.

Advertisement

“It’s hard when you’re watching one game. I don’t know what you look at but you probably get more frustrated when it’s your team hitting because it seems like it impacts hitters more than the pitchers in that scenario.

“I think there’s other things that we can do to still give umpires a chance to make the call and not have the automated strike zone. I think the automated strike zone is going to change how hitters have to hit.

“I think hitters will have to move up in the box to catch the pitch at the front of the strike zone because that’s where it hits the box on the TV. Normally their front foot is close to half-way of the back of the plate. They’re going to have to move up and take away the edges because that’s why the ball seems so far away from them on sliders and pitches that are moving side to side.

Advertisement

“I personally think I would like to see the umpire know what is coming and be able to make the call that way. I don’t know if there’s a way we could do that. But I think if the umpire knows a breaking pitch or a fastball is coming I think they’re going to make more consistent calls on the edges.”

What did the offseason look like for you to go from having one of your worst seasons to your best season?

Gibson: “Last year in general obviously it was a crazy year but after the start in Houston when I made an adjustment to my delivery and stop being so wide and spread out I turned to Julio [Rangel] and Doug [Mathis] and [Chris Woodward] and I was like ‘wow I wish I had 20 more starts right now because this feels awesome.’

“My offseason started right there with those last three starts. I felt so much more comfortable on the mound and actually I’d argue [opening day] was not the worst start to a season I’ve ever had.

Advertisement

“I know that might be amazing but in 2017 I had eight starts to start the year and I had an eight ERA but I ended the year with a low-five. So not spectacular but once I got called back up I had to make an adjustment and stuff like that.

“Last year was just weird with how short it was. A few starts can dictate what the year looked like for just about every player. But the offseason started with those adjustments in those last three starts.

“Everything I did throughout the offseason kept those adjustments in mind and then figured out how I could make them more consistent and get my best delivery out every single time.

“One thing that our pitching coaches talk about is trying to get the pitchers to throw their best version of every pitch they throw. That might sound a little technical but for instance my best sinker is horizontal and vertical movement is right around five to six vertical movement it averages eight to nine [inches] but my best is right around six to seven [inches] with 15 or 16 horizontal [inches]. So I want to have a delivery that allows me to throw my best sinker as much as possible.

Advertisement

“Last season that number was way worse. I think I averaged like 12 [inches] of vertical on my sinker which means this year it’s sinking double as much as last year. So that’s a big difference for this year.

“And a lot of that is just delivery. Getting my hand and getting my body in a better position to deliver and a better-executed pitch that has better movement on it.

“I’ve talked with the guys at the Florida Baseball armory that I originally got my shoulder program from in 2017 and he just took me through a lot of workouts that made my delivery more consistent made me stronger in my delivery so that the changes that I made were going to be long-lasting because the muscle I was building was specifically developed for my delivery.

“So those two things I could go into a plethora of things that could take up probably the rest of your radio show but maybe that’s not what we want to do. But those two things right there were what I really keyed on in my offseason.”

The club plans to sign this operation next August with one or more stable operators in the financial market through the company Goldman Sachs in order to meet the club's financial needs.



The club's economic vice president Eduard Romeu explained that the club's provisional adjusted debt has risen to 1044 million euros which will probably be even higher and has stressed that ""Covid is not to blame for everythingthings were going badly before.""

Romeu highlighted that this operation will allow repayment of the bridge loan of 80 million euros advanced this June by Goldman Sachs to cover the treasury obligations for a period of 90 days renegotiate the Senior Notes signed for an amount of 200 million euros at a much higher financial cost and will provide the necessary liquidity over the next 24 months to be able to implement the Strategic Plan without treasury tensions.

The club is proposing an operation with a maximum term of 15 years with the aim to obtain an interest of 3%. This will require the Fitch rating agency to grant the club's debt an investment grade rating.

When answering questions from members President Joan Laporta stressed that ""the loan is necessary to give the club breathing space and not to take anything from the members' pockets.""

The refinancing proposal was approved by a large majority of 588 votes for (89%) 28 against (4%) and 43 abstentions (7%).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2dyYW5kcmFwaWRzLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmcvcHVibGljLWZpbGluZ3Mtc2hpbmUtdW5zdWFsLXNwb3RsaWdodC1vbi0xLThiLWhlcm1hbi1taWxsZXIta25vbGwtZGVhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Public filings shine unusual spotlight on $1.8B Herman Miller-Knoll deal,"As a transformational merger between two office furniture giants heads for final approval the details of their seven-month courtship offer insight into a deal that could change the industry’s landscape.

Zeeland-based Herman Miller Inc. in April shocked the industry when it announced it would purchase long-time competitor Knoll Inc. in a $1.8 billion cash-and-stock deal.

The pending deal which is up for shareholder votes at both companies on July 13 was the result of back-and-forth proposals that began in December 2020 and nearly fell apart because of eleventh-hour renegotiations just four days before news of the merger became public.

A prospectus filed in late May with federal securities regulators included a thorough record of the deal-making process outlining both major — and seemingly minor — meetings negotiations and discussions.

One West Michigan-based securities attorney who regularly reviews filings of this nature told MiBiz the uncharacteristically robust S-4 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission contained the longest background section he had ever read.

Meanwhile the blockbuster deal developed several months into a global pandemic that threatened to shake the foundation of the office furniture industry as employees worked remotely en masse. As shareholders at both companies prepare to vote on the deal Herman Miller now seeks to address any new dynamics that may emerge.

“This shows a lot of confidence by Herman Miller in the future of the furniture industry which is an industry that was hit significantly by COVID in general” said Elisa Berger vice president of Grand Rapids-based M&A and investment banking firm Charter Capital Partners which specializes in working with clients in the contract furniture space.

“Ask someone in March or April of 2020 what the office furniture industry was going to look like in the next five years and I don’t think anyone would be confident in their answer” Berger said. “For me this is a signal that Herman Miller sees a future in this industry.”

Knoll receives a lifeline

The prospectus detailed efforts by Knoll executives and its board of directors to deal with the economic hardships brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic even before Herman Miller entered the picture. In April 2020 just a month into the pandemic Knoll’s board determined that the company could potentially be in an uncomfortable liquidity position by the end of the year possibly in violation of its financial covenants.

Despite cost-cutting measures East Greenville Pa.-based Knoll saw that its worst-case scenario emerged as the most likely trajectory. At a May 5 board meeting the company’s internal auditors resolved to include a going concern warning in Knoll’s next quarterly report indicating the grave uncertainty over the company’s future.

But the office furniture maker would find a lifeline in European investment firm Investindustrial Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: IIAC) which owns a portfolio of businesses in the health care technology and manufacturing sectors. In fact Knoll rebuffed a previous attempt by Investindustrial and a sponsoring company to purchase Knoll through an all-cash offer in January 2019. Knoll declined at the time claiming the price didn’t match the company’s intrinsic value.

The investment group which would factor into the eventual Herman Miller deal later purchased 4 percent of the outstanding shares of Knoll’s common stock and provided a standing offer to serve as a source of financing for Knoll if needed.

In time Knoll took Investindustrial up on that offer for financing closing in July 2020 on a $164 million investment agreement in which Investindustrial acquired 164000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock. The Knoll board believed the investment would fortify the company’s balance sheet enhance its ability to execute on its strategic plan in the uncertain economic environment and explore other opportunities that might arise according to the prospectus.

Herman Miller pursues deal

Herman Miller laid the groundwork for the blockbuster deal during a regularly scheduled meeting with members of the company’s management team and representatives from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. its long-time financial adviser.

At an Oct. 12 board meeting Herman Miller management and Goldman Sachs personnel presented a financial analysis of Herman Miller’s potential acquisition of Knoll. The board asked executives to reach out to Knoll and explore a potential deal.

Eight days later Herman Miller formed a board subcommittee to consider the potential acquisition of Knoll and met to discuss the strategic rationale for the potential deal and to review deal terms.

Herman Miller President and CEO Andi Owen also called Knoll CEO Andrew Cogan to discuss a potential business combination. During the call Owen shared her great respect for Knoll and that she believed there was a “compelling strategic logic” to bring the two companies together given their complementary product portfolios similar digital initiatives and shared commitment to design according to the filing.

This ushered in a volley of proposals that started in December of last year beginning with an all-stock offer that failed to ignite negotiations.

After Owen and Cogan spoke by phone on Dec. 18 Owen delivered a non-binding proposal to Cogan that called for the exchange of 0.5 shares of Herman Miller common stock for each share of Knoll common stock. The offer implied an enterprise value for Knoll of $1.42 billion and Knoll shareholders would own approximately 30 percent of the combined company. Herman Miller’s proposal also indicated the company’s belief that the proposed business combination would yield $80 million to $100 million in annual synergies.

Knoll turned down the offer calling it “sufficiently distant” on price and saying the company would not engage in further discussions according to the filing.

However a determined Herman Miller was able to spark discussions on Feb. 1 of this year with a second proposal: A cash-and-stock offer that called for the exchange of $11 in cash and 0.32 shares of Herman Miller common stock for each share of Knoll common stock implying a $1.65 billion enterprise value for Knoll. In that deal Knoll’s shareholders would then own 22 percent of the combined company.

While Knoll’s board found the second offer to be insufficient it opted to pursue discussions on the rationale for the proposed transaction. That led to a Feb. 25 teleconference meeting involving representatives from both sides including Cogan and Owen. Both parties resolved to go back to their boards to continue considering a potential transaction.

Knoll issued a counterproposal in early March that placed a $1.91 billion enterprise value on the company before a third proposal by Herman Miller pushed negotiations to the due diligence phase. This March 12 proposal included $11.50 in cash and 0.33 shares of Herman Miller stock per share of Knoll common stock in a deal valued at $1.82 billion.

Knoll also communicated with its previous suitor Investindustrial to see if the investment group still had any interest in acquiring Knoll. Representatives from Investindustrial conceded that they would not be able to submit an offer that would prove competitive with a strategic buyer’s bid that would offer significant synergies. However Investindustrial did say it would support such a deal as long as it was consistent with its view of Knoll’s fair value.

A deal in peril

The deal nearly died roughly one month into the due diligence process when concerns arose during a special meeting with the Herman Miller board and its advisers. Herman Miller had discovered that Knoll’s internal projections and other findings throughout the due diligence process “would increase integration costs above what the Herman Miller team had expected or otherwise limit the achievable synergies in unanticipated ways.”

On April 14 Owen contacted Cogan to inform him certain value assumptions made by Herman Miller had not been supported by due diligence and instructed representatives from Goldman Sachs to reach out to Jeffrey Harris lead director of Knoll’s board with those same concerns.

Goldman Sachs representatives told Harris that Herman Miller’s estimates on short-term cash flows the timing of synergies resulting from combining the businesses and other matters differed from the actual findings meriting a downward adjustment of $3.20 per share even though Herman Miller wasn’t necessarily proposing that exact price reduction.

The late-game renegotiation proved to be a deal breaker: The Knoll board voted unanimously on April 14 to shut off Herman Miller’s access to a virtual information room and cease negotiations while instructing Herman Miller to return or destroy all information provided by Knoll.

In an email to Goldman Sachs representatives Harris wrote: “Knoll was not looking for a buyer and would only consider a potential transaction if the process would be expedited with minimal distraction for the Knoll Board and Knoll management and if the value to Knoll’s stockholders was sufficiently compelling.”

After seeing its concerns rebuffed Herman Miller submitted a revised proposal on April 15 which Knoll rejected leading to another call between Cogan and Owen. Cogan expressed that the “back and forth had not been received well by the Knoll board.”

Owen contacted Cogan later that day with a “best and final offer” of $11 in cash and 0.32 shares of Herman Miller common stock for each share of Knoll common stock to push the deal’s value back up to $1.82 billion.

On April 15 Knoll’s board of directors unanimously voted to accept the proposal.

With the deal Herman Miller also will buy outstanding shares of Knoll’s preferred stock from Investindustrial for $253 million in cash or $25.06 per share. Investindustrial which aggressively lobbied directly with Herman Miller throughout the proceedings for preferred stock as opposed to cash agreed to vote its shares in favor of the deal.

Effects at home

Herman Miller clearly didn’t land a COVID discount on the purchase of Knoll whose stock bottomed out at just less than $9 per share in April 2020 in the early stages of the pandemic. The stock eventually recovered to $19 per share in March 2021 and jumped 35 percent upon the merger announcement. Herman Miller’s stock dropped around 8 percent upon the announcement but has since rebounded.

While it remains unclear how the combined business would address redundancies in function the local region is positioned well to benefit from the merger according to Jennifer Owens president of economic development firm Lakeshore Advantage.

“It’s always great to be the home for the company that is acquiring versus one being acquired” said Owens whose organization focuses on helping companies grow in both Allegan and Ottawa counties.

“That I think puts our community in a better position and the leadership and headquarters will still remain here with Andi Owen as the head of the new consolidated business” Owens said.

Lakeshore Advantage’s two-county jurisdiction has seen additional blockbuster deals in the past. In 1996 Johnson Controls Inc. acquired Holland-based Prince Automotive a manufacturer of products for auto interiors from the Prince Holding Corp. for $1.35 billion. In 2019 Tokyo-based Hitachi Ltd. purchased custom automation systems provider JR Automation for $1.42 billion.

“In those cases we’re really working to build relationships with the out-of-state and out-of-country headquarters and making sure we’re more than just a dot on the map and they understand the value proposition of West Michigan and that we want to be that company’s partner in growth” Owens said.

Owens also said that the community at large would benefit from serving as the home base for the newly crowned leader in office furniture.

“I think it definitely increases the awareness of our community as a place to grow design and make products” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtaGlyZXMtZXhpdHMtZ3JlZy13ZWluYmVyZ2VyLWxpei1ld2luZy1yYW5kYWxsLWNoYWZldHotMjAyMS020gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street Hires and Exits: Greg Weinberger Liz Ewing Michael Carter,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='businessinsider.mx', port=443): Read timed out.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc which has opened its US offices to staff this week has told its UK staff in a memo that working at its London office is voluntary for now. Those who opt to attend office will observe strict social distancing and mask-wearing. The bank says plans of allowing a full workforce are postponed until July.

JPMorgan Chase & Co too sent a memo postponing openings its offices until July. A majority of its US office workers will be rejoining next month.

The investment banks were planning to bring back staff on rotational basis capped at 50 percent occupancy. Both the banks already had 20-30 percent staff working out of offices with proper protocol in place. Hence they are well equipped by now to entertain more numbers with proper distancing and other norms in place.

The banks believe that delaying the reopening till July 19 in the UK will give a chance to all personnel to get fully vaccinated. Currently about 41 million people have received their first shot and nearly 30 million have had both doses – about 57% of the adult population in the country.

The majority of Goldman Sachs employees have “either had their first dose (of the vaccine) or expect to receive it before Monday 21 June” Richard Gnodde head of Goldman Sachs International wrote in his memo to staff.

Bank bosses are split over whether staff should come back to the office full-time or work from home for some or all days of the week. Goldman Sachs’ group chief executive David Solomon has described working from home as “an aberration”.

NatWest chief executive Alison Rose said the bank would hold conversations with staff over the summer about what options they want. “I would say that we’ve busted the myth that jobs need to be done in a certain way” she previously told staff. “We have learnt new ways of working and it’s important we carry those learnings forward.”

Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman speaking at a conference earlier this week said that it’s time for the bank’s New York workers to head back to the office now that more people are getting vaccinated. “If you can go to a restaurant in New York City you can come into the office. And we want you in the office” Gorman said. He added that “well over 90%” of employees already had received Covid-19 shots and that he expected that number to eventually reach 98% to 99%.

Barclays Bank said that it expected to “invite” more staff back to the office over the summer but said it was “moving towards a hybrid way of working”.

Barclays chief Jes Staley had previously said home working was “not sustainable” for large financial institutions.

Studies reveal that two doses of vaccines made by Pfizer and AstraZeneca are effective against the more virulent form of the Delta variant and offer over 90% protection against hospitalization."

Hunter Lowe a 27-year-old electrician from Tennessee was working for around $10 an hour in his home state and supporting a family of three when he decided to move to North Dakota and look for a new job.

He never expected to end up working in the bitcoin business.

But Lowe is now an electrician at Crusoe Energy a company that captures the flare gas from oil patches and uses the energy to ""mine"" for bitcoin. It says its systems slash CO2-equivalent emissions from gas flaring by up to 63% and that each one has the equivalent effect of taking around 1700 cars off the road.

Lowe describes it as ""the best job I've ever had"" which pays ""way more than fair."" And he says business has been good during 2021's crypto boom. ""We're getting busier and busier every time another company finds out about us"" he told Insider.

Crusoe isn't the only company in the business with others including EZ Blockchain doing similar things. Yet it's one of the biggest and has attracted investment from the listed crypto exchange Coinbase and the Winklevii twins' Winklevoss Capital.

Crusoe mines bitcoin directly on site

So how does it work? When oil companies drill for the black stuff they often hit natural gas too. Yet most drillers lack the infrastructure to sell the gas and so burn it off in a process called flaring creating the distinctive flames above oil sites.

This is where Crusoe comes in. It installs a piping system to divert the natural gas away from the flares and into generators. They produce electricity which is then used to power computers directly at the oil site.

The computers ""mine"" bitcoin — that is they solve complex puzzles which help to secure the bitcoin network and create new coins. One bitcoin was worth around $39000 on Thursday.

""We pay the operator for the gas that we use in our generators providing them with an incremental revenue stream where they were previously flaring the gas for zero"" Crusoe's president Cully Cavness told Insider.

He said Crusoe which has deployed units in North Dakota Colorado and Montana among other states is now one of the biggest bitcoin miners in North America.

The focus on bitcoin's energy use has intensified

Yet for some people paying oil companies for their byproducts is simply propping up the fossil fuels industry. Others argue that bitcoin is socially useless and there are much better uses for energy.

New York University economist Nouriel Roubini has slammed cryptocurrencies as pointless and inefficient for instance saying that ""the Flintstones had a better monetary system.""

Elon Musk once the most prominent bitcoin evangelist has halted payments for Tesla cars in the token and attacked its ""insane"" energy use. Bank of America analysts have estimated that each $1 billion of inflows into bitcoin uses the same amount of energy as 1.2 million cars.

Yet Cavness says Crusoe ""maintains an internal [environmental] standard to select projects only if they're net reducers of greenhouse gasses.""

He also said Crusoe's prices are such that ""we don't create an economic incentive to opt out of traditional midstream gas capture systems.""

And he says the company's generators aren't only focused on bitcoin but are increasingly powering other energy-intensive processes such as cloud computing.

Investors are keen on the technology

Musk's attacks on bitcoin's energy consumption have shone a light on the issue and crypto companies are paying more attention to the climate than ever.

The green focus appears to be helping Crusoe which recently raised $128 million to help expand its flare capture technology to more than 100 units from around 40 currently. Investors included Valor Equity Partners Bain Capital and the Agnelli family's Exor.

As someone who's worked for Halliburton and natural gas companies Lowe admits he was skeptical about ""the whole green thing"" in the past. Being at Crusoe has changed his mind however and he argues its work is ""definitely for the better.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdkbm9ubGluZS5jb20vRGV0YWlscy85NDgzNzQvSGFsbGlidXJ0b24td2lucy1rZXktS3V3YWl0LU9pbC1Db21wYW55LWNvbnRyYWN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Middle East Business: Halliburton wins key Kuwait Oil Company contract,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.gdnonline.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /Details/948374/Halliburton-wins-key-Kuwait-Oil-Company-contract (Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1006)'))) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdkbm9ubGluZS5jb20vRGV0YWlscy85NDgzNzQvSGFsbGlidXJ0b24td2lucy1rZXktS3V3YWl0LU9pbC1Db21wYW55LWNvbnRyYWN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

Tammy Exum and Dr. Roszena Haskins introduced West Hartford’s new mural to a crowd of about 100 people gathered in the courtyard below the library stairway.

By Sophie Christensen

After months of planning and community input nationally-recognized artist Corey Pane’s striking mural design now spans the entire side wall of the Noah Webster Library in Blue Back Square and even wraps around the corner to the front of the building making a strong statement about the town’s commitment to civil rights.

Six civil rights leaders appear in the mural along with quotes from Vice President Kamala Harris and National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman. The mural also features a silhouette of a Black woman’s head whose hair contains the names of those killed unjustly by police brutality and of those formerly enslaved in West Hartford. Under the silhouette seven mason jars spell out “freedom.” Lastly towards the Blue Back Square side two hands release a white dove while breaking the chains that bind the hands together.

The dove is “a messenger for peace and love” Pane explained.

On the other side of the main wall portraits of Ella Baker Martin Luther King Jr. and Bernard LaFayette appear in front of a rainbow. All three were important activists during the civil rights movement. A quote from Gorman is below them close to the stairs.

Facing South Main Street Judy Casperson Tammy Exum and Gertrude Blanks appear above the words of Vice President Harris: “I may be the first woman … But I won’t be the last.”

“I believe that Judy Gertrude and I were featured together because we represent ‘firsts’ in our community” said State Rep. Tammy Exum after the dedication of the mural. “It’s hard to believe but in 2013 I was the first Black person on the Board of Education.” Exum who currently holds the 19th district seat in the General Assembly was also West Hartford’s first Black state representative.

In 2008 Casperson was the first African American elected to West Hartford’s Town Council on which she served four terms.“I just set out to make a difference and in doing so I made history … you can do it too” said Casperson during the dedication.

Blanks was the first African American who graduated from Hall High School. She was also an activist with Hartford Stage and the Artist Collective a part of the Grandparent Program and “one of the greatest storytellers of Hartford Public Schools” said Jedda Williams at the dedication ceremony. Though Blanks is no longer alive today her legacy lives on through the mural.

“What’s important is that we’re not the last” Exum said. That’s why it’s particularly poignant to have our faces above the quote by Vice President Harris.

Mayor Shari Cantor offered words of praise for those who organized the mural and the whole West Hartford community for supporting the goals of the project. “We have a bright future because we care and because we’re all in this together” said the mayor.

To conclude the ceremony Adrienne Billings-Smith one of the main minds behind the mural and West Hartford’s Juneteenth observance also commended the town’s eagerness to make the mural a reality. “From the signs on our lawns to protests … to celebrating Juneteenth” the community of West Hartford came together to support the cause.

“When you see [the images] on that mural today I want you to remember that there was some wonderful history made right here in West Hartford” Williams said.

Pane a West Hartford resident is well-known for painting the cleats of professional athletes. He also painted a mural inside West Hartford’s BIRDCODE restaurant and a tributary mural for rapper Nipsey Hussle in Hartford. He has worked with CT Murals one of the project’s partners several times in the past.

This mural a part of the MLK39 initiative continues an effort to recognize and honor the 39 years of MLK’s life. West Hartford’s installation of this project was completed through partnerships with CT Murals the Town of West Hartford the CT Center for Nonviolence Concerned Parents of Color Unity Green Committee and West Hartford African American Social and Cultural Organization (WHAASCO) as well as other members of the community and organizations including the town’s youth.

It’s the same at the Apple Cinemas Luxury Dine-In formerly the Spotlight Theatres on Front Street in Hartford where management is hoping for similar crowds when it opens June 25 with the screening of “Fast and Furious.”

Both theaters are due to open the same day assuming final city permits are in hand.

Apple Cinemas have added new luxury reclining seating to try to entice back customers after the pandemic.

Owner Siva Shan discounts the popularity of — and competition from — streaming services that entertained home-bound viewers during the coronavirus pandemic. Netflix which added nearly 16 million subscribers in the first three months of last year reported growth of 4 million subscribers in the same period this year as other forms of entertainment such as movies regain audiences.

Netflix has projected an increase of 1 million worldwide subscribers in the current April-June period down from 10 million more subscribers in the same three months of 2020.

“At the end of the day you can’t stay in the house forever” Shan said. “You have to come out.”

Theaters bars most retail stores and a range of other businesses were hit hard when public health officials in Connecticut ordered them shut as the coronavirus pandemic swept Connecticut in March 2020.

Nationally annual movie theater box office revenue dropped 81% last year to $2.1 billion according to IMDbPro. Already this year movie theaters posted $818.8 million in revenue.

Apple Cinemas in downtown Hartford and on New Park Avenue are planning to reopen on June 25.

Shan has revamped his two theaters reducing capacity to make room for large popular and comfortable reclining seats with serving trays and cupholders. The Front Street theater now accommodates 300 moviegoers half as many as before the pandemic.

He expects to make more money even with fewer seats as attendance rises in response to the improved seating.

The Front Street theater also will have a sports bar seating 50 and will offer seating along the sidewalk that wraps around to Columbus Boulevard from Front Street.

At the New Park Avenue 12-screen cinema formerly Bow Tie Cinemas the IMAX has 110 seats down from 300. The 12 screens were reduced from 17 during a renovation.

Apple Cinemas Luxury Dine-In will soon feature a sports bar here near the cinema lobby.

Tom Nunan one of the producers of “Crash” the 2006 Oscar-winning film and a lecturer at the UCLA School of Theater Film and Television said audiences and theater owners can expect a booming production of movies to satisfy pent-up demand among movie-goers.

“There are going to be big summer releases especially as the cinemas open up to full capacity” he said Friday. “I predict that audiences will go rushing back in.”

He said there’s no evidence to support worries about audience members seated too closely together. “Quite the contrary theaters are selling at capacity” he said.

Nunan compared audiences flocking to cinemas with other venues such as sporting events and Broadway.

Apple Cinemas Luxury Dine-In in downtown Hartford is preparing to open soon.

Gov. Ned Lamont on May 19 ordered an end to restrictions imposed 14 months earlier. Movie theaters were among the beneficiaries. Also bars were allowed to open indoors the removal of event venue and stadium capacity limits and dropping of social distancing requirements.

Shan said theaters generally opened that day with others delaying their return to business a week later just before the Memorial Day weekend.

He said he’s not planning a marketing campaign preferring to keep a low profile “to make sure nothing goes wrong” in the first few weeks such as not finding enough cooks bartenders and servers in a labor force marred by worker shortages

Shan who has had no income during the pandemic relied on some grants programs and borrowed money he said. It will be a year and a half to two years before his businesses return to normal he said.

By Ronni Newton

West Hartford’s second annual Juneteenth celebration held over the weekend of June 19-20 2021 was full of joy juxtaposed by serious messages and actions with the observation culminating late Sunday morning as a crowd gathered for the rededication of the town’s green as Unity Green.

West Hartford’s town green – that narrow triangle of land that splits the northbound and southbound lanes of South Main Street just south of Farmington Avenue and is the longtime site of banners and public gatherings – had previously been named Goodman Green in honor of Timothy Goodman who deeded it to First Church which in turn has leased the land to the town since 1924. Recent research into the town’s history conducted as part of the Witness Stones project brought to light the fact that along with some of West Hartford’s other prominent families for whom roadways and buildings have been named Goodman was indeed a slaveholder.

The town’s inaugural Juneteenth celebration on June 19 2020 was held on what was still called Goodman Green but resident Adrienne Billings-Smith founder and president of Concerned Parents of Color realized the irony of celebrating Juneteenth in that particular spot.

She approached First Church and worked with the church community over the course of several months as they underwent a discovery and reflection. The congregation strongly supported the change approving it by a vote on Nov 29 2020.

The dedication of Unity Green was celebrated Sunday during the church service as Rev. Erica Wember Avena’s sermon (see PDF below) touched on the long history of the church injustice and the chance to create a legacy of change rather than just accepting that something is part of history.

“Adrienne Billings-Smith pointed out that there are people in this community who are stricken to know that the name of a slaveholder is reflected in our public space” Avena said. “And I have heard her say that she is not asking us to move mountains. But if everyone could pick up and move one rock … the mountain of injustice will change shape entirely …”

At the dedication ceremony Avena led a prayer. “We are mindful of the generations of people who have walked here before us we honor their lives we know something of their struggles. We are inheritors of their legacy …” she said. “As we rename this space today we do so both with appreciation of what has come to us from the past positive and good and what we know of the past that has institutionalized oppression even unto our very day.

“Let this be a turning point. Let us work together to welcome all to respect each person’s humanity to listen to the outsider to honor the meek” Avena said.

Barbara Lewis First Church’s former historian and a member of the Unity Green renaming committee said the church began a period of discovery and reflection when asked by Billings-Smith about renaming the town green.

“We hope to better understand this history as more research provides a clearer picture” she said noting the research undertaken by Tracey Wilson Liz Devine and Denise deMello through the Witness Stones project. “We are so very grateful to Adrienne for engaging the congregation in this difficult conversation about acknowledging our past involvement with slavery.”

Unity Green will be a place to foster and embrace unity for a much more just and inclusive future Lewis said. “This is not the culmination of a one-and-done project but the beginning of a collaborative effort.”

Billings-Smith said she worked with Geeno Gordon vice president of Concerned Parents of Color to brainstorm about the new name for the green. She said she’s so happy with the name chosen and approved by the congregation – a name that signifies “faith activism history and leadership mean something. We partner together we are all one in this work together.”

Carol Anderson Blanks a member of West Hartford’s Town Council thanked all who made Juneteenth possible.

“I’m standing here today on behalf of the mayor and Town Council … as we prepare to dedicate this green to the people of this town we also memorialize the enslaved men women and children – men women and children treated as property and listed as assets … by others who claim to be owners human beings” said Blanks.

“We gather here on this green to right a wrong of our town’s history.”

The Town Council’s job is to create policy and although the community has come a long way “we have a long road ahead of us” Blanks said. “Each of us here today has the power to be a change agent” she said urging all to pledge to be an active participant in the fight against hate racism discrimination and social injustice.

The ceremony ended with a singing of the first verse of Amazing Grace a hymn Blanks said was written by a slave trader who later became an abolitionist. “Hypocrite or prophet? … The power to change is real and we can do this together.”

Be sure to give today’s article a read and if you’d like to give your input let us know via the Ghostbusters News Facebook page.





#5 – Fright Features

Following the central four Ghostbusters figures Ray Stantz Peter Venkman Egon Spengler and Winston Zeddemore the boys were brought back with a pretty big twist! Gone were the colored flight suits fans had come to know and love from the popular animated series. Instead these new figures received new uniforms all unique and a new action feature that would reveal each Busters “Fright Feature.”

Wait. A Fright Feature? I mean I know “I ain’t afraid of no ghosts” is a double negative but showcasing a Ghostbuster being frightened seems a bit backward no?

Another interesting design choice was ditching the well-known blue proton packs that the first wave included. Instead each figure came complete with a unique weapon that would strap onto their arm interacting perfectly with a pack-in ghost.





The wave is also noteworthy as it brings us our very first Janine Melnitz figure. An odd tidbit to that figure is while the Fright Features figures were part of the third wave Fright Features Janine came out a little later making her part of the fourth wave.

The unique design paired with the over-the-top fun action features proved to be a hit for Kenner making these some of the most easily recognizable figures you’d find in any toy box during the 1980s.

#4 – Ecto-Plazm

Real Ghostbusters Ecto-Plazm was released as part of the second wave to go along with the Gooper Ghosts. The Gooper Ghosts were a line of figures that play features centered around the slime either oozing or bubbling out of them.





Originally released in just purple the third wave of Real Ghostbusters would see the Ecto-Plazm line grow adding red and yellow color variants.

Each 5 oz can of Ecto-Plazm also included a small mystery ghost that perfectly fit in with the line with the majority of these sky rocketing in price over the years on the second-hand market.

Now for us the most memorable aspect of Real Ghostbusters Ecto-Plazm was the smell! There’s never been another container of slime that has been able to replicate that unique pleasant odor that has seemed to have burned deep within my nostrils.

With Ghostbusters: Afterlife set to his theaters this November it’s already been confirmed that officially licensed slime is on the way but I’d like to ask Hasbro to add Ecto-Plazm to their Kenner Classics collection!





#3 – Proton Pack

After watching the original Ghostbusters film there’s one thing children of the 1980s wanted more than anything and that was their very own Proton Pack! As part of Kenner’s Real Ghostbusters third wave fans finally got their hands on their very own (un)licensed nuclear accelerator!

Cast in blue plastic this hollow rendition of the Proton Pack was not at all screen accurate to what we saw in the film or even the animated series instead of appearing more like what fans would later see in the Real Ghostbusters promo pilot.

Kenner’s Proton Pack included not only the pack itself but also a Neutrona Blaster that featured loud garbled noises that gave parents headaches for days on end. Also included inside the box was a PKE Meter no-ghost logo armband ID card and a long piece of foam that would act as the proton stream.





While I’m sure we all have fond memories of this toy this is likely the one item on the list that is least likely to see a rerelease. Why? Well initially revealed a few years back Hasbro is preparing some VERY SIMILAR-looking items as part of their upcoming Ghostbusters: Afterlife line. Still Hasbro if you release both fans will buy both. You have our word on it!

#2 – Ecto-Glow Heroes

Released as part of Kenner’s Real Ghostbusters tenth wave this would turn out to be the final line for the original toyline.

The figures featured the same body molds from the first wave of figures that were also reused in earlier series; Screaming Heroes and Powerpack Heroes. Louis Tully was also included in this wave who was first seen as part of Powerpack Heroes. To help give these figures a refresher each Ghostbuster was cast in a glow-in-the-dark plastic body. They also came packed in with glow-in-the-dark proton packs with unique proton streams ghosts and masks.





Given that the Ecto-Glow Heroes turned out to be Kenner’s final wave of Real Ghostbusters figures they received a limited release that has made the toys a holy grail piece to many collectors.

Last year I finally took the plunge on these figures. Be sure to check out that video below:

Considering carded figures are selling on eBay at prices many collectors can’t just justify we feel that Hasbro adding these into their Kenner Classics line would make a lot of sense. There would undoubtedly be demand within the fan community and for us that already have the figures mint on card it would give us an easy option to finally unbox these figures and not feel guilty about it.

#1 – Fire House Headquarters

When you stop and think about Kenner’s Real Ghostbusters toyline outside of the main four Ghostbusters and the Ecto-1 there’s likely nothing more iconic than the Fire House Headquarters!

The three-floored rendition of the Real Ghostbusters Firehouse gave fans plenty of room to play with their figures. It included a “Ghost Pursuit Fire Pole” “Goop Grates” on the roof that you can poor Ecto-Plazm into (5 oz can included) and even a “Containment Unit” complete with a trap.





Was it perfect? No. The Ecto-1 barely fit inside the Firehouse especially if you connected the roof swivel chair. There was also no basement so the Containment Unit either had to rest on the first floor roof or outside. There was also a lack of stairs of ladders making an adult Ghostbusters fan question exactly how Ray Peter Winston Egon and Janine made their way to the higher floors.

Despite its faults for us this is THE item that Hasbro should bring back as part of their Real Ghostbusters Kenner Classics line! The fact their rendition of the Ecto-1 is about to hit store shelves without a Firehouse to call home is almost criminal.

Knowing that Mattel recently released a Castle Greyskull that is very similar to what fans remember from the 1980s and with Hasbro already giving us the Ghost Popper and the upcoming Ecto-1 it gives us hope that we may eventually see the Real Ghostbusters Fire House Headquarters return to store shelves!

Being such an iconic piece of the franchise it’s no wonder it was one of the first items to be released as part of the role play items in Hasbro’s Lightning Collection.

THE ORIGINAL RELEASE

In 2020 the original version of the Power Morpher was released as a Walmart Exclusive. With it being 7 years at the time since the release of the popular Bandai America Legacy version of the Power Morpher there were new features included to make it stand out. A stand was included show accurate colors die-cast Power Coins and individual voice phrases/colored LEDs corresponding to each Ranger with use of their coins.

Now that this release was out there Hasbro had the mold ready to go and luckily for them the Power Morpher checks off a number of boxes that make it a good collector’s item. Not only was the Power Morpher iconic but it had a number of variations over the years that could allow Hasbro to make slight alterations to the now existing mold for the toy and release it again.

THE POWER OF PINK

Only a year later Hasbro got the mold out once again for the upcoming GameStop Exclusive Pink Ranger Morpher. This version is inspired by the one seen in 1995’s Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie and features an all Pink belt buckle Pink Lightning bolt accents and a subdued Power Rangers logo on the center ring. Despite having a clear connection to the movie version in both appearance and passing mention in the product description this release is not being promoted directly as a piece of movie merchandise for reasons unknown. Which leads to speculation on Hasbro’s status of the rights to toys from the three movies released thus far.

Even though the Pink Morpher release is not promoted as a 1995 movie version it does open the door to what Hasbro can make going forward .

THE REST OF THE MOVIE MORPHERS

Since not directly mentioning the 1995 movie by name appears to allow Hasbro to make the other versions of the Power Morphers seen in the film there are a still plenty more they can make. Bandai America had the same idea back during their Legacy line but didn’t end up finishing the set. Red Black Yellow Blue and of course White would give Hasbro plenty of opportunities to release a Power Morpher every once and a while and really spread out the potential the mold gives them.

While Pink’s did not include this feature a good selling point could be to pack these releases with the Ninja Coins seen both in the movie and in Season 3 of the series. The original Power Morpher only had phrases for the original five Rangers as well so Movie releases could give the chance for Rocky Adam and Aisha to be added to the toy.

BROKEN VERSION

A few years after Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the Power Rangers In Space episode “Always a Chance” featured the return of Adam Park as the Black Ranger. With the original Mighty Morphin Powers being destroyed during the Alien Rangers mini-series his Power Morpher was left in a damaged state. Adam takes the risk and temporarely morphs with this dangerous item to help out Carlos.





Hasbro making a release like this would be an interesting spin on the 2020 version of the Power Morpher already released. Voice phrases could be included from Adam and Carlos as well as the warning from Alpha 6 about using the powers. Alpha 5 was previously included as a secret sound in the original release so it would a good use.

This type of release could be perfect for a convention exclusive item and with In Space being a huge fan favorite as well it’s something that could be in the pipeline already.

VIDEO GAME POWER COINS

The original Power Morpher is not just limited to in show Rangers either. Recently the Power Rangers: Battle For The Grid video game from nWay has added Street Fighter’s Ryu and Chun-Li to the game as additional DLC. Each of them use a regular Power Morpher with new Power Coins the Crimson Hawk and Blue Phoenix.







Hasbro is no stranger to releasing items seen in video games their Star Wars: The Black Series line has it’s own series known as “Gaming Greats” released exclusively at GameStop. With them already being the retailer to get the Pink Ranger Morpher it’s not out of the question they could get a release like this.

RELATED: POWER RANGERS BATTLE FOR THE GRID ADDING STREET FIGHTER RANGERS

Having a version like this could also allow for the release to appeal beyond Power Rangers fans and bring in the Street Fighter fanbase as well. Additionally it would be great promotion for the video game. Though this release would either have to include both silver and gold plates to have it be accurate to both of them or the more likely route one could be released for each character.

TOMMY OLIVER & LORD DRAKKON

Of course no list of additional Power Morpher releases could be complete without Tommy Oliver himself. It’s shocking at this point that his version of the Morpher hasn’t already been released numerous times so Hasbro must be planning something big with the most popular Ranger of all time.

Tommy’s Morpher is different from the others having gold plates instead of the original silver. There are a number of routes they could take with releasing his Morpher. If they wanted to include five coins in a Tommy release one way to do it could see the Dragonzord and Tigerzord of course being paired with his Falcon coin and the two coins used by Lord Drakkon in the Boom Studios comics.







Lord Drakkon uses the same gold plated Morpher as the main universe Tommy OIiver but with a fusion Green/White Ranger coin of his own. In the Shattered Grid storyline Drakkon unlocks his most powerful Evolution III form which turns his coin all red. By including these two coins in with TV Tommy’s three a gold plated release would not feel lesser than the original five Ranger version.

RELATED: THE DRAKKON STORYLINE WAS SO POPULAR IT ALMOST BECAME A POWER RANGERS TV SERIES

That’s not it for Tommy Oliver Morphers possibilities though. In 2018 for the franchise’s 25th Anniversary the character returned in the “Dimensions in Danger” episode of Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel brining with him a brand new Master Morpher. The Master Morpher was Tommy’s ultimate Morpher giving him access to all five of his Ranger forms seen throughout the show: Mighty Morphin Green Mighty Morphin White Zeo Red Turbo Red and Dino Thunder Black. The base of this Morpher was the original Power Morpher with reflective gold plates a Zeo like tech pattern on the red ring and five Power Coins based on each of the powers.







In the episode Tommy uses 4/5 of the coins with the Red Turbo one left unused until Boom Studios’ “Soul of the Dragon” graphic novel in which the Master Morpher makes it only other appearance. Perhaps with the series’ 30th Anniversary right around the corner both this special Morpher and/or Tommy will appear again and make a release from Hasbro a reality.

To stay up to date with all the news for the line Power Rangers fans can check out The Illuminerdi’s Josh Perry on his weekly Lightning Storm YouTube series every Saturday at 9:00 am Pacific or on Twitter at @LightningFigPR.

When the first Transformers movie premiered back in 1986 it captured the hearts of the children who spent their Saturday mornings watching the battle of the heroic Autobots versus the evil Decepticons showing the child in us that a simple American toy line that was heavily inspired by a variety of Japanese toys was so much More Than Meets The Eye.

[embed]https://youtu.be/Yw-NxV9c0GM[/embed]

Fast forward to 2007 and the first of many live-action Transformers movies hit the big screens and while the live-action franchise generated billions at the box-office and turned an 80s toy line into a household name there was no denying that despite spending millions in special effects to show how ordinary every items and vehicles can transform in gigantic alien robots none could recapture the magic of the original1986 classic – that iconic theme song the introduction of more Transformers including the biggest meanest planet-eating robot as well as a soundtrack that many still hold dear.

While the animated television series was in fact an amalgamation of different Japanese toys that started it all The Transformers: The Movie elevated the series by becoming one of the first children-centered properties to bring in notable actors to voice the new characters including Judd Nelson as Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime Star Trek’s Leonard Nimoy as Galvatron and famed director Orson Welles as Unicron alongside series veteran Peter Cullen who will forever be the leader of the Autobots Optimus Prime.

Set in the late ‘80s when rock ballads and heavy metal ruled the airwaves the movie hailed iconic acts from Stan Bush and “Weird Al” Yankovic that hammered down on the young audience’s love for the giant robots establishing that the series had the touch to connect with its core audience.

But for all The Transformers: The Movie set out to be providing the heart and soul that no other kid’s cartoon could there was one thing that it did not anticipate and now 35 years later Hasbro is finally putting right to a great.

In an attempt to refresh a toy line the decision was made then for the movie to introduce new characters to the series which is fine but the movie ended up killing a bunch of OG Autobots and Decepticons.

When Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus laid down their lives to defend against the Decepticons fans were crushed and it left a hole in our hearts and a trauma no modern cinematic film or experience could ever recreate but they underestimated our love for their characters.

So while toys of new characters were released from Hot Rod to Ultra Magnus and Galvatron to Cyclonus the kids never got updated figurines of the classic roster of characters until now.

It was only recently that Hasbro decided to produce a toy line that was a throwback to the original animated classics with the Studio Series 86 line that gave us a modern Galvatron with Blurr Hot Rod and Jazz and those must have been a success as Hasbro is releasing a whole other bunch of figurines that pay tribute to the movie.

Now we’re not saying that the toys are meant as a recreation of the characters from the animated movie but they are close. In celebration of the 35th anniversary of the film Hasbro has embarked on an incredible journey to release a handful of new figurines that were directly inspired or featured for the first time in the original movie – finally giving us the love collection and toys we truly deserve.

Let us journey back in time and take a look at all these figurines that were first featured in the first – and best – Transformers movie ever made.

Unicron

“For a time… I considered sparing your wretched little planet Cybertron but now… you shall witness… ITS DISMEMBERMENT!!!”

The Lord of Chaos the Planet Eater and the Chaos Bringers Unicron is the most ultimate Transformers supervillain that due to its sheer size Hasbro would inevitably find trouble to duplicate into a transformable toy.

Now there have been rumours and even photos of prototypes that one was planned for back then but it was never released. Still this challenge was eventually accepted by Hasbro in 2019 as a crowdfunding campaign.

When put in comparison to Megatron in the movie Unicron made him fun-sized. The Lord of Chaos is arguably one of the most terrifying villains in the Transformers universe and was first introduced in the original movie.

The toy is essentially Hasbro’s most ambitious toy ever made due to its size and of course difficulty in articulating the mechanics needed to transform this 27-inch robot into a 30-inch planet.

The quality of the figurine is also a sight to behold with almost 50 points of articulation in robot mode and15 points of articulation just on its hands itself. It also includes several miniature figurines of Galvatron Rodimus Prime (or Hot Rod) and the Ark.

[embed]https://youtu.be/JYkC8R-BH4c[/embed]

Well of course its size can’t be made to scale because Unicron is a planet however this venture by Hasbro was considered a dream come true for many collectors as it was the first and probably the only time we will ever get such a massive recreation of Unicron in his full original form as seen from the movie.

Unfortunately The Transformers: War for Cybertron Unicron is completely sold out on most retail spots so you might have to hit your local distributors or check the second-hand market for a shot at the toy.

The Ark

The original spaceship that made everything happen – the ship that brought the Autobots back to Earth – The Ark is also apparently an iconic Autobot that Hasbro has made for the first time in its full transformable form (which we never knew about). But who cares? We get it and Teletraan-1.

Hasbro’s most recent massive masterpiece after Unicron screams nothing but nostalgia as the timeless spaceship served as the Earth base and protected Optimus Prime and the Autobots for many years. It also made a special appearance in Beast Wars: Transformers after its crash-landing.

The Ark features a removable module that doubles as the bridge of the ship can convert into the Autobot computer Teletraan-1 in 20 steps which can then be further transformed into the Autobot Mainframe in another 21 steps.

The spaceship itself transforms into his 19-inch robot mode in 26 steps and is the ultimate collectable figure for the OG fans.

The War for Cybertron: Kingdom Time Autobot Ark is available at The Falcon’s Hangar RoboRobo Lazada and Shopee for $299.90. It is slated for release on July 1 2021.

Rodimus Prime

Rodimus Prime aka Hot Rod was the protagonist and headstrong Autobot in the original movie that some would argue caused the death of Optimus Prime.

He was essentially the chosen one by the Matrix to light the Autobot’s darkest hour and prevented the destruction of Cybertron from the devastation of Unicron.

Rodimus Prime measures 7.5-inch tall and can turn into racecar mode in 34 steps and into his truck mode in another 8 which can transport other Deluxe Class Transformer figurines.

This is the first time Rodimus Prime gets a Commander Class treatment so Hasbro has now given fans a chance to finally pick up the figurine that does the character justice.

Transformers Generations War for Cybertron: Kingdom Commander WFC-K29 Rodimus Prime is out now at The Falcon’s Hangar RoboRobo Lazada and Shopee for $119.90.

Galvatron

“I’ll rip open Ultra Magnus and every other Autobot until the Matrix has been destroyed!”

And Galvatron did as he surrounded Ultra Magnus with the Heralds of Unicron on the planet of Junk tore him apart and took the Matrix of Leadership for himself.

Once Megatron Galvatron was born from the depths of Unicron’s powers in the film and is the epitome of a mad and power-driven villain blind to his lust for power.

Galvatron transforms into his Galactic cannon mode in 33 steps and comes with several accessories including the Matrix of Leadership and the Particle Beam cannon that turned Starscream into dust. Despite being Unicron’s pet Galvatron’s ambitions would eventually lead him to betray the Lord of Chaos himself and fail and suffer yet another utter defeat at the hands of Rodimus Prime.

Transformers Generations War for Cybertron: Kingdom Leader WFC-K28 Galvatron is out now at The Falcon’s Hangar and RoboRobo.

Wreck-Gar

“Bah-wheep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong!”

This is the only way to greet Wreck-Gar the leader of the Junkions or you might end up well… junk.

Made for the first time as an authentic recreation of the original characters the Studio Series toy line by Hasbro finally bring fans back to celebrate and reminiscence iconic moments inspired by the movie – and in Wreck-Gar’s case it was when the Autobots first met the Junkions on The Planet of Junk.

Wreck-Gar transforms from his robot mode into motorcycle mode in 22 steps and would be the perfect add-on for you to reenact the iconic Junkion Dance Party scene with the rest of your G1 collections.

Transformers Studios Series 86-09 Voyager The Transformers: The Movie Wreck-Gar is out now at The Falcon’s Hangar and RoboRobo.

Slag & Daniel

Another Studio Series recreation Hasbro adds Daniel Witwicky and the Dinobot Slag into the fray of their screen-inspired figurines.

Known for his violence and mean spirit Slag is one of the iconic Dinobots that intensively questioned and hated Optimus Primes and as he puts it himself “me Slag no like anything”.

Slag transforms from robot mode to triceratops mode in 32 steps and includes a non-converting Daniel Witwicky figure that can sit on top of him in triceratops mode.

However none of his hostility toward the Autobots was explored in the original film in fact we would recall how polite Slag was when he said “excuse me” toward the crushed Sharkticon as he busted into the Quintesson Courtroom with the rest of the Dinobots to save Hot Rod and Kup.

With the movie-inspired Dinobot Slag Hasbro has done us another favour to let us replicate the iconic scene known as the Mockery of Justice where Hot Rod and Kup was about to be thrown into a pool of Sharkticons.

Transformers Studios Series 86-07 Leader The Transformers: The Movie Dinobot Slag and Daniel Witwicky is slated for release on 1 August 2021 at The Falcon’s Hangar and RoboRobo.

Gnaw

To build on the Mockery of Justice scene Hasbro has let loose the army of Sharkticons themselves known as Gnaw to accompany Slag.

Gnaw was part of the bunch of Sharkticons that rounded up Hot Rod and Kup and eventually joined the Autobots thanks to the fearsomeness of Grimlock against the Quintesson Judges.

Gnaw can transform from his robot mode to Sharkticon mode in 17 steps and includes two weapon accessories alongside translucent eyes and articulated jaw and arms. Having a few Sharkticons in your collection will truly bring that epic moment from the movie to life.

Transformers Studio Series 86-08 Deluxe Class The Transformers: The Movie Gnaw is slated for release on 1 August 2021 at The Falcon’s Hangar and RoboRobo.

Arcee

Who said deadly Autobots don’t come in pink?

An expert in hand-to-hand combat Arcee is a merciless yet compassionate warrior that puts her Autobot friends before her and will do all it takes to protect them and her humanoid compatriots.

Arcee can transform from robot mode into sportscar mode in 15 steps and comes with a blaster accessory. As a close friend of Hot Rod and considered Rodimus Prime’s primary warrior Arcee is the perfect companion to put beside the Kingdom Commander Rodimus Prime figure.

Transformers Generations War for Cybertron: Kingdom Deluxe WFC-K17 Arcee is out now at The Falcon’s Hangar RoboRobo and Lazada for $34.90.

Jazz

We’d be lying if we said the movie didn’t get us when Jazz failed his escape from the Moonbase One during Unicron’s ruthless attack because it felt like another gut-wrenching moment besides the loss of Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus.

The only Autobot with style Jazz can transform from his robot mode into his racecar mode in 20 steps and includes a blaster accessory. The backdrop that comes along with the figure will recreate the Moonbase One destruction scene when he and Cliffjumper were swallowed up by Unicron although they were saved by Daniel Witwicky in the end.

Transformers Studio Series 86-01 Deluxe The Transformers: The Movie Autobot Jazz is available at The Falcon’s Hangar RoboRobo and Lazada for $36.90.

Blurr

Undeniably the fastest Autobot in the entire Transformers franchise Blurr is a reliable messenger of the Autobots that had quite a few notable moments in the original movie.

Thanks to his quirkiness the Autobot left quite an impression compared to the other Autobots during moments when he was talking to Ultra Magnus and getting Grimlock aboard the Ark.

Hasbro’s Blurr can transform from robot mode into his hovercar mode in 18 steps and includes a blaster gun accessory. With Jazz Arcee and Rodimus Prime in hand the addition of Blurr will make for the ultimate 1986 movie Autobot collection.

Transformers Studio Series 86-03 Deluxe The Transformers: The Movie Autobot Blurr is out now at The Falcon’s Hangar RoboRobo and Lazada for $36.90.

Scourge

Last but not least the ultimate figurine to complete your Transformers: The Movie villains collectables introducing the Herald of Unicron Scourge.

Converted from Thundercracker into Scourge by Unicron he was tasked as his Herald to aid Galvatron in the movie to destroy Ultra Magus and the Matrix of Leadership.

Scourge can transform from robot mode to his Cybertronian hovercraft in 19 steps and features a blaster and a blast effect accessory that we would recall killed Ultra Magnus.

Hershey says its Halloween candy sales were up slightly this year despite lower enthusiasm for trick-or-treating amid the pandemic.

Parents should only feed their children breast milk for the first six months of their life without any sugar added the U.S. government said in new guidelines released this week.

The guidelines suggest parents limit sugar-filled foods to less than 10% of calories per day after age 2. That means less desserts snacks candy and sweetened drinks to infants according to The Associated Press.

“It is really important to make healthier choices every meal every day to develop a pattern of healthy eating” said Pam Miller of the Agriculture Department’s food and nutrition service.

More details

Babies should only have breast milk at least until they reach 6 months old the guidelines said according to The Associated Press.

If there’s no breast milk available babies should take iron-fortified infant formula and supplemental vitamin D.

These guidelines are issued every five years from the Agriculture Department and the Department of Health and Human Services according to NBC News.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpY2hlc3QuY29tL3JpY2gtcG93ZXJmdWwvcmljaGVzdC1jaG9jb2xhdGUtYnJhbmRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kings of Candyland: The Ten Richest Chocolate Brands In The World,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpY2hlc3QuY29tL3JpY2gtcG93ZXJmdWwvcmljaGVzdC1jaG9jb2xhdGUtYnJhbmRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbm5saXZlLmNvbS9mb29kLzIwMjEvMDYvdGhlc2UtMjMtcmVzdGF1cmFudHMtY2FuLWN1cmUteW91ci1oZXJzaGV5cGFyay1odW5nZXItbWltaXMtcGlja3MuaHRtbNIBe2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbm5saXZlLmNvbS9mb29kLzIwMjEvMDYvdGhlc2UtMjMtcmVzdGF1cmFudHMtY2FuLWN1cmUteW91ci1oZXJzaGV5cGFyay1odW5nZXItbWltaXMtcGlja3MuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 23 restaurants can cure your Hersheypark hunger: Mimi’s picks,"Anyone driving through downtown Hershey lately will notice the change.

In his 2015-16 freshman season Gersich’s nine goals ranked third among freshman at North Dakota. Gersich scored the opening goal in the 2016 National Championship which led to an eventual 5-1 win.

The film was made by DoorDash  one of a number of film screenings in recent weeks that was made or sponsored by a brand.

""Brand films"" aren't a new concept but they are gaining cachet as marketers increasingly seek ways of reaching consumers who are trying to avoid advertising and consumers increasingly seek out brands that appear to share their values. A recent Advertiser Perceptions study found more than half of advertisers surveyed view and treat branded or sponsored content as more important now than it was before the pandemic.

This type of content is not necessarily a glorified commercial full of product placements. Notable examples include Patagonia's documentary-style films about issues like land use or Dove's sponsorship of the Oscar-winning animated short ""Hair Love"" without any stipulations around product placement.

The recent examples are many: Last week NBCUniversal said it was working with sponsor Target and producer Will Packer on short films from emerging Black filmmakers to run on NBCU's channels and digital platforms. Companies like Indeed 3M and HP showed off films this week around the Tribeca Film Festival. On Friday top executives from brands like Google and Walmart gathered for Tribeca X a one-day conference about the combination of advertising and entertainment including formats like brand films. Roku  the conference's sponsor also just launched its own brand studio to produce creative ad formats and programming tailored for marketers.

""I think this is a huge trend"" said Tim Calkins a marketing professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. ""The core challenge for brands now is that it's very difficult to reach people. The decline in television advertising has taken away one of the main ways that brands would tell their story and help people learn about their business. And as a result brands are looking for ways to help people understand what their brand is really all about.""

DoorDash's film ""Soul of the City"" features New York City restaurant owners. The company had identified restaurants around the city that had been closed or were struggling due to the pandemic then worked to help them to open. The company worked with partners including Interpublic Group 's The Martin Agency on the film.

Before long DoorDash VP of marketing Kofi Amoo-Gottfried said the marketing team was doing all sorts of new functions.

""There's people on my team that were figuring out how to buy a smoker"" he said. ""Things that are not marketing's job but it became our job.""

Though DoorDash is running paid advertising behind its film on channels like YouTube the video contains little branding and focuses far more on the restaurateurs than itself.

""Brands for all intents and purposes are relatively self-serving organisms right?"" Amoo-Gottfried said. ""I think the thing that's been super clarifying for us at DoorDash… is we've always said we're in business to support local economies.""

And yes if restaurants and communities are thriving that's good business for DoorDash.

""If you look at the DoorDash spot that's not going to encourage anybody to rush out at that moment and order delivery or takeout"" Calkins said. ""So they don't drive short-term action. It's all about the long-term brand … it's a different sort of investment.""

But it's an investment brands seem to be increasingly making.

""As audiences continue to change as there continues to be a proliferation of streaming options and choice in what people watch and how people watch brands are looking to find breakthrough ways of reaching audiences that feels authentic because they know that that authentic connection with the brand is more powerful than than just one single tactic"" said Steven Rummer SVP of strategy and creative partnerships advertising & partnerships at NBCUniversal.

He said NBCUniversal's research studies have found 81% of people are more likely to buy or use brands who help others when it's needed most and that 79% of consumers are more loyal to brands who prioritize communities' well-being over business as usual.

""We have all this great research that shows the power and impact of doing these longer form brand films or branded content and the connection that it has with actual results on the advertiser side"" he said.

Of course this content actually has to be good Marcus Peterzell CEO of entertainment marketing agency Passion Point Collective said during a panel at Tribeca X.

""It's gotta be a great film. And if any consumers..."" (he paused to twist his face into a grimace) ""...because there's a Samsung phone stuck in their face you lose. A good film is a good film. It doesn't matter if Sony funded it or HP funded it. It's still a great film.""

Peterzell used the example of 3M's new film ""Not The Science Type"" which discusses stereotypes and how they can hurt STEM diversity equity and inclusion. He said that there are plenty of great film ideas out there and if a brand is the catalyzing force for making an important film happen ""that alone is a win for a brand.""

With so many options a brand film has to be something someone will press play on despite infinite options.

""When you think about creating content with a brand or for a brand how do we make sure it's entertaining first and actually content first"" said Chris Bruss head of the Roku Brand Studio said in a panel during Tribeca X. ""If it's not entertaining then it can't appropriately live on a Roku Channel or a Hulu.""

We have now confirmed with Hilton the exact location of this hotel that was excluded from the airport beyond that it is only a 15-minute boat ride from the airport.

Location

It is indeed rather close to the Male and airport. I am sure that most employees don’t live on the island but commute daily from Male.

Satellite Image

There is Kuda Vattaru that from the satellite images appear to be well developed

Amingiri doesn’t appear to be as well developed at the time these images were taken but you can see the “fingers” of overwater villas taking place

Here are images posted on Google tagged as Amingiri:

Here’s what we covered last week the announcement from Hilton:

Maldives and Singapore – Hilton (NYSE: HLT) one of the world’s fastest-growing hospitality companies has announced the signing of a management agreement with Amingiri Holdings Pvt Ltd a hospitality focused subsidiary of Maldivian construction and real estate development company Amin Construction Pvt Ltd to launch the 109 all-villa Hilton Maldives Amingiri. Scheduled to open at the end of this year Hilton Maldives Amingiri will mark the entry of Hilton’s flagship Hilton Hotels & Resorts brand into the Maldives. It will be the fourth resort under the company’s portfolio of brands in the Maldives joining Waldorf Astoria Maldives Ithaafushi Conrad Maldives Rangali Island and SAii Lagoon Maldives Curio Collection by Hilton. Guy Phillips senior vice president development Asia Australasia Hilton said “The Maldives remains one of the world’s most highly sought-after destinations and the signing of Hilton Maldives Amingiri reflects the excellent growth potential we see in the market. We are delighted to be embarking on this partnership with Amingiri Holdings Pvt Ltd to launch our Hilton Hotels & Resorts brand in the country. We are confident their experience in developing world-class resorts in the Maldives combined with Hilton’s strong commercial engine will place us at the top of mind for leisure travelers when it is safe to travel again.” Hilton Maldives Amingiri is strategically located on Amingiri Island in the Male Atoll directly accessible from the Maldives’ Velana International Airport via a 15-minute speedboat ride. The resort will feature 109 well-spaced beach and water villas each with a private pool including an exclusive six-bedroom villa ideal for travellers looking to reunite and create new travel memories with loved ones around the world in an iconic destination after more than a year of connecting remotely. A pool spa fitness centre and salon will also be available for guests to clock in time to work out or to refresh themselves. Guests can enjoy an array of dining options from the resort’s six restaurants and bars to suit their mood and palate throughout the day including: Habitat: the resort’s all-day dining restaurant which celebrates international cuisines inspired by cultures ranging from the Mediterranean to South East Asia through its live kitchens presenting a delectable breakfast spread in the morning before evolving into an a la carte dining venue for lunch and dinner where guests can enjoy themed nights offering indulgent flavours from around the world. Re-Fuel: A teens-only zone where junior guests can gain access through a secret speakeasy-style entrance in the kids’ club. The rooftop deck is a tranquil oasis where teens can relax and unwind. A dedicated bar will serve a curated menu specifically catering to the needs and wants of the teenage traveller. EDEN: An adults-only resort’s destination bar specializing in champagne and gin-based drinks in a highly bespoke and intimate setting where guests can celebrate special occasions with unparalleled views of the Maldivian sunset. Alexandra Jaritz senior vice president brand management Asia Pacific Hilton said “As the most recognized name in hospitality Hilton Hotels & Resorts has one of the largest footprints across the globe. Even more importantly the brand is known the world over for the positive impact it brings to each new destination we enter through the employment opportunities we create and renowned levels of hospitality we bring to the location. We are thrilled to be seeing our flagship brand represented in the Maldives and look forward to providing the perfect setting for families and friends to reconnect and make new travel memories when the resort debuts in the coming months.” Daniel Welk asset manager Amingiri Holdings Pvt Ltd said “For over a century Hilton has built a stellar reputation with its ability to deliver performance and growth through their strong teams and commercial capabilities. We are confident our partnership with Hilton will be a successful one and are excited to work with them to bring to life our shared vision of delivering the most exceptional levels of service and hospitality to international travelers to the Maldives when Hilton Maldives Amingiri opens.”

Here’s a video I took at the Waldorf-Astoria:

And Curio Collection:

Conclusion

I have stayed at all three current Hilton properties in the Maldives and was not impressed with the Waldorf-Astoria when it opened. The situation can be better now when the employees are more familiar with Hilton’s luxury brand’s service.

However the Curio Collection property was quite fun and you had several dining options on and off the property. You could also catch a boat to the Male if you so wish",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy10cmF2ZWwvMjAyMS8wNi8xOS9oaWx0b24taGVhdGhyb3ctYWlycG9ydC11bnZlaWxzLXJlZnVyYmlzaG1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton Heathrow airport unveils refurbishment – Business Traveller,"Hilton Heathrow airport has reopened following a re-design of its public spaces by firm Hirsch Bedner Associates (HBA).

The refurbishment centred around the narrative ‘A view from above’ and drew inspiration from the British landscape and in particular the views captured flying in and out of Heathrow airport.

The re-design features a full refurbishment of the ground floor entrance lobby café bar and restaurant with a muted colour palette and nods to nature.

Within the lobby area an oversized sculptured chandelier hangs above the check-in desk while a statement wooden feature wall aims to echo “the undulating British landscapes”. The space also includes oversized rugs which are designed to mimic the nation’s cloudy skies and several living plant installations bring nature indoors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vY2FwaXRhbC1vbmUtc3ByaW5nLXByaWNlbGluZS1zYXZlLWhvdGVscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No Joke: Capital One Spring & Priceline Really Can Save You 50%+ On Hotels (No Capital One Card Needed),"Bonkers simply bonkers.

Capital One Spring is a program offering savings to businesses with a range of partners. It’s completely free to join (you can register here) and you don’t even have to be a Capital One cardholder to get access to the deals.

Nick first covered the program here where he highlighted some of the savings available with Dell and on Happy gift cards. I subsequently looked into the savings they claimed to offer for Choice and there were some legit discounts available by booking with their code.

For some time Capital One Spring has listed savings of up to 50% off hotel rates when booking with Priceline.

I took that claim of up to 50% savings with a pinch of salt as a lot of sites claim savings of that nature but which seem to be exaggerated in reality. The pinch of salt I took was so large in fact that I ignored this part of the Capital One Spring program entirely until recently as I assumed it was simply a link to the regular Priceline site.

That was dumb of me.

You see the site you click through to isn’t the regular Priceline site. And when Capital One Spring/Priceline claim to offer up to 50% off hotels that’s not true. Some of the hotel savings are even bigger than 50%. Those aren’t artificially inflated prices they’re comparing the savings against either. These are very real savings when compared to booking on the regular Priceline site and even when booking directly with the hotel chain.

For example I did a search for a two night stay in New York City from August 3-5. The Capital One Spring/Priceline site (which actually shows up at rezserver.com) sorts the results by largest percentage savings but you can sort by price hotel name ratings etc.

Here are the top three results by percentage savings:

66% savings at the Conrad New York Midtown 59% savings for the Westgate New York Grand Central and 57% off at the Holiday Inn Express New York City Chelsea.

Lest you think these are made up savings they’re not. Capital One Spring/Priceline are basing the Conrad savings off a room rate of $532 per night. That’s not far off the $513 per night Hilton is charging directly for the same property on the same nights:

That’s savings of $664 before tax over the course of that two night stay. Like I said bonkers.

Seeing as you wouldn’t be booking directly you wouldn’t earn elite night credits or points or receive status benefits. However when you’re saving $664 does it really matter that you won’t be getting the $25 per person for breakfast that Hilton now offers elite members at Conrad properties in the US?!

The savings for that Holiday Inn Express are equally legit. You can pay $117 per night via this Priceline partnership or $242.77 per night when booking directly with IHG. Even better the fact that it’s a Holiday Inn Express means you’d get free breakfast even when not booking directly as it’s a brand that offers free breakfast to all guests regardless of their status level or how they booked.

Those three hotels listed above aren’t the only good deals either. Want to stay at a decent hotel in Times Square? How does $100 per night sound for the Holiday Inn New York City Times Square?

The funny thing is that the savings for this property are in theory even higher than the 49% discount they’re claiming. That’s because IHG is charging $215.70 per night which is a 54% discount.

It’s not like these savings are isolated to New York City. When doing a search for the same dates (August 3-5) in Chicago here’s the top result.

The Palmer House Hilton is available for only $106. Compare that to the $212 that Hilton wants to charge you for booking those same nights directly.

Great savings can be had at many other Hilton properties in Chicago too. Here’s what’s being charged via Capital One Spring/Priceline…

…and here’s how much Hilton is charging for those three properties when booking directly with them – some pretty significant savings are available here.

I’m not sure if this is the case for all cities but it seems like the largest discounts are available at Hilton and IHG properties. Although Marriott and Hyatt properties do appear in the search results on the Capital One Spring/Priceline site I didn’t notice any of those being discounted. Hotels in some other chains are available though such as the Radisson Blu Aqua.

The $240 rate they’re basing the savings on exactly matches the rate that Radisson is charging when booking directly on their website.

A Downside With These Rates

Other than the fact that you won’t receive elite status benefits or earn points and elite night credits for not booking directly there’s a very annoying quirk with these prices.

In order to access these discounted hotel prices you have to log in to Capital One Spring and then click through to the Priceline site. That causes greatly discounted prices like these to show up:

If you copy and paste the URL from that search results page (this is it) the standard higher pricing is what gets displayed – not the lower prices.

The reason that’s incredibly annoying is because it means you can’t use the lower rates for Best Rate Guarantee (BRG) claims. When making a BRG claim it has to be a publicly available rate; the fact that the hotel chain’s BRG team would have to log in to Capital One Spring click through to Priceline and then do the search themselves means it’d be an invalid rate.

If it was possible to have them access these rates you could get the best of both worlds. You could get the hotel chain to match the much cheaper rate (and get a further discount depending on the hotel chain’s BRG policy) while also being eligible for elite status benefits and earning points and elite night credits because you’d have booked the stay with the chain directly.

Cancellation Policies

I’d thought that another downside would be that the low rates would be non-refundable but that’s not necessarily the case. For example the Holiday Inn New York City Times Square has what they’re listing as a flexible cancellation policy for most of the room types.

When looking at the terms it said that the rate was fully refundable provided you cancel before July 31. That’s three days before the stay which while not as good as being able to cancel the day before does provide a good degree of flexibility.

Summary

Capital One Spring and Priceline allow you to book some hotels – particularly Hilton and IHG properties – at discounts of more than 50%. You won’t receive benefits or points as you’re not booking directly but with potential savings of hundreds or thousands of dollars depending on the length of your stay the money you save could well be worth it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L25hdGlvbi8yMDI0LzA1LzExM18zMTA3NTMuaHRtbNIBP2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYW1wLmFzcD9uZXdzSWR4PTMxMDc1Mw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hotels airlines offer perks to encourage vaccination,"gettyimagesbank

It happened in the Home Depot and Costco parking lot in the area of 79th Avenue and West Flagler Street.

A female sergeant from the Miami-Dade Police Department was patrolling the area when a Home Depot employee told her someone had been stealing items. She saw the man allegedly pushing a cart full of merchandise from the store and tried approaching him.

The man ran and jumped into the passenger seat of a black two-door Honda police say. A woman driving that car is accused of driving it in the direction of the sergeant who fired her weapon.

The sergeant wasn’t hit by the car and is OK. The man and woman drove away and have not yet been found.

When Ryan Crouser broke it “it felt like it was a huge weight lifted.”

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

The 28-year-old who built a training ring at his home in Arkansas to stay on point during the coronavirus pandemic shattered a shot put world record Friday night that was set 2 1/2 years before he was born.

On Day 1 of the U.S. Olympic Trials he heaved the massive medal sphere 76 feet 8 1/4 inches (23.37 meters) to put his name in the record book and punch his ticket for Tokyo where he’ll have a chance to defend his Olympic title next month.

Just like he always imagined.

“There were so many times that I was throwing a six-pound shot out behind the middle school throwing by myself and let it go and put my hands over my head and be like ‘Oh new world record!’” Crouser said. “I knew it’s been a possibility or potential to do it since 2017.""

Virtually everyone in this tightly knit group of throwers knew the record of 75-10 1/4 (23.12) held by Randy Barnes since May 20 1990 was in jeopardy. Earlier this year Crouser topped Barnes’ indoor record. Earlier on Friday during qualifying Crouser heaved 75-2 1/2 (22.92) to set the American Olympic trials record.

Crouser was feeling so good in the preliminary round that he thought a world record was possible right then and there. What kept him from going for it was his shoes. Though he had brought a pair of new Nikes to Eugene for the trials he opted for a more broken-in pair because the shot put ring at newly remodeled Hayward Field was “fast.”

“But they take your shoes if you break the world record” Crouser said of World Athletics which tests all shoes involved in a record. “I thought ‘I don’t know if I throw a world record in prelims I won't have shoes for the final. I'll have to throw in the (new) Nikes.'”

So the record held — but only for a few more hours.

Even before the fourth of his six tries on a mild sunshiny evening had plunked into the dirt Crouser was lifting his arms to celebrate. When the shot landed far beyond where any other mark had been made a collective gasp came from the quarter-filled stands.

About a half-minute passed while officials checked the distance. When the mark came up on the board confirming that he had broken one of the longest-standing records in the books he was mobbed by his competitors near the ring.

“Finally timed that one up” said Crouser who grew up in Oregon went to college at Texas and now serves as a volunteer coach at Arkansas. “I think I was celebrating on that one almost before it left my hand.”

Among those congratulating him were world champion Joe Kovacs who finished second and Payton Otterdahl who earned the third spot.

“There are three or four guys capable of doing that” Kovacs said. “In Tokyo there are going to be some fireworks. Every year we’re talking about the records being broken and I think there’s more to come.”

Several minutes after his record Crouser was proudly posing on the field. The picture: Him standing next to the scoreboard with both thumbs raised and the words “World Record” highlighted in green on the board next to his new record.

Shot putters fashion themselves as part-time physics gurus. They spend hours analyzing their throws from multiple angles all in the hopes of eking out a few more centimeters.

About the dynamics of his best-ever throw Crouser said: “I stayed big with my chest and relaxed and let the entry happen. I didn't force it. And once I did that well I knew the throw was going to be good so I didn’t do anything to mess it up from there.”

Crouser who finished second to Kovacs at world championships in Doha in 2019 didn't miss a day of training in 2020 even with the coronavirus pandemic shutting things down across the globe. He built a homemade shot-put ring that he constructed out of two sheets of plywood and screws from Home Depot.

The opening day of trials also featured strong first-round performances from world 800-meter champion Donavan Brazier and sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson who chose orange as the hair color of the day and turned in the fastest 100-meter time (10.84 seconds). High jumper Vashti Cunningham — the daughter of former NFL quarterback Randall Cunningham — easily qualified for the final and discus thrower Valarie Allman set a meet record with her throw of 229- 8 (70.01) in qualifying.

In the night's other final Woody Kincaid sprinted the final stretch to hold off Grant Fisher and win the 10000 meters. Both run for the Bowerman Track Club. Kincaid finished in 27:53.62. Joe Klecker was third.

All received second billing to Crouser.

He's hard to miss at a track meet. The 320-pounder takes down about 5000 calories a day to keep weight on his 6-7 frame. His diet consists of two big breakfast burritos in the morning a pound of ground beef for lunch and three of the four portions from a meal delivery service at night.

So what does a newly minted world record holder do for dinner? Well options figured to be limited at the late hour he would get out of the track.

“I’ll probably go for a big old double-double hamburger somewhere"" he said.

ASHRAE Standard 34 assigns reference numbers safety classifications and refrigerant concentration limits on all new refrigerants. The Honeywell and Chemours refrigerants have already received designations and now await public review and final action.

The list includes Daikin’s new development gas D1V140 and its blend component HFO1132(E) (revealed by the Cooling Post last week (Daikin develops more efficient refrigerant for electric vehicles)) three new hydrocarbon blends what appears to be a further ultra low GWP refrigerant and two new Koura gases based on R1132a.

Possible R1234yf alternative

Koura has revealed that one of its new refrigerants is like the Daikin gas targeted for use in electric vehicle HVAC systems.

While R1234yf has become the global industry standard low GWP refrigerant for vehicle air conditioning systems its efficiency is of concern in new and future electric vehicles. Unlike conventional internal combustion engined vehicles electric vehicles cannot use the engine waste heat for interior heating. Instead a heat pump system is used increasing the load on the battery and severely reducing an electric vehicle’s range in cold climates.

The new Koura refrigerant blends 6% R1132a and 13% R32 with R1234yf to produce a refrigerant with a GWP of around 91. While this is higher than Daikin’s proposed new gas it is still well within the 150 GWP maximum under the European MAC directive.

R1132a is an A2 gas commercially produced at kilotonne scale as the starting material for fluoropolymers. It has also been incorporated in R473A Koura’s recently announced low GWP alternative to R23 in ultra low temperature applications (Koura’s R473A brings lower GWP for ultra-low temps).

The R1132a molecule also features in another new Koura refrigerant submitted for ASHRAE 34 classification. Thought to be designed for HVAC applications this refrigerant blends 6% R1132a with 42% 32 and 52% 1234yf. This would give it a GWP of around 286.

Low temperature

Italian company Angelantoni Test Technologies has also submitted a new refrigerant which tweaks the blend proportions of its recently announced ultra low temperature gas R472A. The new refrigerant R472B decreases the proportion of CO2 and R32 increasing the amount of R134a (58% CO2 10% R32 32% R134a). It creates a refrigerant with a GWP of 526.

Honeywell R448 blend

Recently receiving an ASHRAE designation is Honeywell’s R448B a tweak on the blend proportions of its now well established R404A refrigeration retrofit R448A. The new gas is still going through public review and awaits final ASHRAE approval.

The existing gas R448A which is said to have been used in over 30000 installations since its release in 2015 is a complex blend of R32 R125 R1234yf R134a and R1234ze(E) (26%/26%/20%/21%/7%). The proposed R448B blend reduces the proportions of both R32 and R125 to 21% while increasing R134a to 31%. The GWP is slightly less – 1321 compared to R448A’s 1387.

Not to be left out Chemours has received a designation of R427C and an A1 classification for its blend of R32 R125 R143a R134a. It’s intended application is unclear but it is a variation on Arkema’s R427A an R22 retrofit gas for air conditioning heat pumps and refrigeration.

New participants

The three new hydrocarbon blends have all been submitted by new entrants to the ASHRAE approval process. The Huazhong University of Science and Technology a public research university based in Wuhan has submitted two blends comprising R1270 (propylene) and R600a (isobutane) in vastly different proportions.

The other a blend of propane butane and isobutane comes from Brazilian LPG gas distribution company Cia Ultragaz S/A.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydW1zLmFwcGxlaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZGlzY3Vzc2lvbi8yMjI0MDgvdGV4YXMtaG9tZXMtaGVhdC11cC1hcy1wb3dlci1jb21wYW5pZXMtYWx0ZXItc21hcnQtdGhlcm1vc3RhdHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas homes heat up as power companies alter smart thermostats - General Discussion Discussions on AppleInsider ...,"



Texas homeowners have discovered their homes are getting warmer despite the use of air conditioning with the discovery that energy companies are remotely adjusting the thermostat to higher temperatures with minimal warning.Residents in Houston and surrounding areas have complained that their thermostats have been increasing in temperature seemingly on their own. Rather than keeping the house cool the thermostats have been remotely tampered with to operate at a warmer temperature.In one example aired by WFAA the English family of Deer Park discovered such a situation on Wednesday. Brandon English returned home that day to discover his wife and daughters had lowered the temperature at 2:30pm but it had been changed while they had a nap.The house had risen in temperature to 78 degrees English said and that his wife and kids ""woke up sweating."" He was concerned about his three-month-old daughter potentially dehydrating from the heat in the unbearably hot home.Later his wife received an alert advising their thermostat was changed remotely as part of a three-hour ""energy-saving event.""It was determined that the family's thermostat was enrolled into a program called ""Smart Savers Texas"" operated by EnergyHub . As part of an agreement EnergyHub could remotely control the thermostat during a period of high energy demand in exchange for entry into sweepstakes.The changes occur during a period in the summer where homeowners are putting a strain on the power grid to keep their homes cool with air conditioning. On Wednesday  the Electric Reliability Council of Texas urged residents to raise their thermostats to reduce the strain on the power grid.In a statement received by Gizmodo EnergyHub said ""During a demand response event Smart Savers Texas increases the temperature on participating thermostats by up to four degrees to reduce energy consumption and relieve stress on the grid. Every participant actively agrees to the terms of the program and can opt-out of a demand response event at any time.""EnergyHub says it works with a number of smart thermostat vendors including some that offer thermostats with HomeKit support. The list includes Ecobee  Honeywell and Lux as well as Google's Nest which pledged support for the Apple-backed smart home protocol Matter in May meaning HomeKit support for Nest thermostats is in development.Keep up with everything Apple in the weekly AppleInsider Podcast -- and get a fast news update from AppleInsider Daily.

Workers and our unions need to join together to fight for cost-of-living clauses in every contract and in key government programs like Social Security so our wages go up every time prices rise and we can defend our standard of living.

The annual consumer price index surged to 5% in May. Food and other groceries furniture clothing and used cars all jumped in price. Getting to and from work is more expensive as gas prices have jumped nearly 50% in the past year. They’ve gone up even more for the last seven weeks.

More price rises are on the horizon as manufacturers and other bosses report their costs of production hit a record high in May. This includes hikes in raw materials and transportation. Steel glass plastic paper and leather all went up. Sea shipping rates from Asia have quadrupled for many goods.

Food is going up. Hormel Foods announced price hikes on ground turkey peanut butter and Spam. Retired workers are hit especially hard. Blind to these conditions President Joseph Biden and the Federal Reserve both claim there is nothing to worry about saying the rise in inflation is just a blip.

For some capitalists the price increases are a bonanza. Inflation at the high end of the housing market is providing a boon for property speculators. Two condos on New York City’s Billionaires’ Row were bundled and sold together for $157.5 million this month one of the most expensive residential transactions of all time in the city.

Like the owners of other food delivery companies bosses at DoorDash call their workers “independent contractors” shutting them out of benefits the minimum wage overtime pay and paid sick leave at a time the bosses’ profits are soaring. CEO Tony Xu was compensated $414 million for the last year.

Workers fight for escalator clauses

Workers need to organize and use our unions to fight against the ravages of inflation including for a sliding scale of hours and wages. There are valuable lessons from past labor struggles when our class fought for and won automatic cost-of-living-adjustments also known as escalator clauses in contracts to protect our wages from being stripped of their buying power.

The first escalator clauses were won by workers in major industries in the 1940s building on the explosive wave of labor battles that built the CIO before the second imperialist world war. During the 1945-46 postwar strike wave workers sought to claw back some of what bosses had taken from them during the war. The Franklin D. Roosevelt government had imposed a wartime wage freeze which was supported by most labor officials who backed Washington’s war aims. This freeze supposedly included a freeze on prices but the bosses forced price increases through and workers’ living costs jumped 30%!

Workers at General Motors demanded an escalator clause in their contract in 1948. The bosses gave in just 72 hours before workers were due to strike. Two years earlier some 225000 United Auto Workers members at GM had struck for 113 days to win substantial pay hikes paid vacation and other gains. “During the 12-year inflationary period from 1948 to 1960 the GM escalator clause brought regular automatic wage increases” writes Art Preis in Labor’s Giant Step The First Twenty Years of the CIO: 1936-55 an invaluable book on working-class history.

As profit rates began falling in the 1970s the employers launched an offensive against working people. Escalator clauses were a special target of their assaults.

In 1976 some 6 million workers had cost-of-living adjustment clauses in their contracts but by 1995 that figure had been driven down to 1.2 million. Not only did real wages decline from the early ’70s onwards but bosses sought outright hourly wage cuts. All too often our union officials refused to organize workers to use our union power to fight these assaults and mobilize widespread solidarity. Today COLA clauses are largely limited to workers in some public sector jobs.

We need to put escalator clauses with teeth back on labor’s banner!

Price committees

Bosses and their media peddle the myth that when workers fight and win higher wages it means higher prices. But that isn’t true. It’s part of the fight of our class to wrench more of the fruit of what our labor produces away from the boss class which produces nothing. If they try and respond by jacking up prices this can be fought.

In the 1970s skyrocketing inflation led to public protests many led by housewives. These protests won widespread working-class support and helped push back some price increases. “Workers can defend ourselves from the twin scourges of unemployment and inflation by coming together and using our unions to fight against the bosses” Joanne Kuniansky Socialist Workers Party candidate for New Jersey governor told the Militant.

“We need to fight for a sliding scale of hours — 30 hours work for 40 hours pay — to share the available work around and get millions back to work with no cut in pay. And fight for a sliding scale of pay escalator clauses that guarantee when prices go up our wages automatically match the increase.”

One of the anti-working-class moves by the administration of Democratic President Bill Clinton was to grant a profit bonanza to the bosses by rejiggering the Consumer Price Index in a way that substantially reduced official price figures. That’s one of the key reasons that when prices go up our pensions and Social Security don’t go up the same amount!

“Every administration — Democratic and Republican alike — acts to defend the bosses’ interests and tries to divide and weaken the workers’ movement” Kuniansky said. “Workers need to fight for committees on prices made up of our trade unions farmers housewives and other consumers. Price committees would force open the bosses’ books expose their price gouging reveal the true extent of inflation and demand control over the fixing of prices.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

The film was made by DoorDash  one of a number of film screenings in recent weeks that was made or sponsored by a brand.

""Brand films"" aren't a new concept but they are gaining cachet as marketers increasingly seek ways of reaching consumers who are trying to avoid advertising and consumers increasingly seek out brands that appear to share their values. A recent Advertiser Perceptions study found more than half of advertisers surveyed view and treat branded or sponsored content as more important now than it was before the pandemic.

This type of content is not necessarily a glorified commercial full of product placements. Notable examples include Patagonia's documentary-style films about issues like land use or Dove's sponsorship of the Oscar-winning animated short ""Hair Love"" without any stipulations around product placement.

The recent examples are many: Last week NBCUniversal said it was working with sponsor Target and producer Will Packer on short films from emerging Black filmmakers to run on NBCU's channels and digital platforms. Companies like Indeed 3M and HP showed off films this week around the Tribeca Film Festival. On Friday top executives from brands like Google and Walmart gathered for Tribeca X a one-day conference about the combination of advertising and entertainment including formats like brand films. Roku  the conference's sponsor also just launched its own brand studio to produce creative ad formats and programming tailored for marketers.

""I think this is a huge trend"" said Tim Calkins a marketing professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. ""The core challenge for brands now is that it's very difficult to reach people. The decline in television advertising has taken away one of the main ways that brands would tell their story and help people learn about their business. And as a result brands are looking for ways to help people understand what their brand is really all about.""

DoorDash's film ""Soul of the City"" features New York City restaurant owners. The company had identified restaurants around the city that had been closed or were struggling due to the pandemic then worked to help them to open. The company worked with partners including Interpublic Group 's The Martin Agency on the film.

Before long DoorDash VP of marketing Kofi Amoo-Gottfried said the marketing team was doing all sorts of new functions.

""There's people on my team that were figuring out how to buy a smoker"" he said. ""Things that are not marketing's job but it became our job.""

Though DoorDash is running paid advertising behind its film on channels like YouTube the video contains little branding and focuses far more on the restaurateurs than itself.

""Brands for all intents and purposes are relatively self-serving organisms right?"" Amoo-Gottfried said. ""I think the thing that's been super clarifying for us at DoorDash… is we've always said we're in business to support local economies.""

And yes if restaurants and communities are thriving that's good business for DoorDash.

""If you look at the DoorDash spot that's not going to encourage anybody to rush out at that moment and order delivery or takeout"" Calkins said. ""So they don't drive short-term action. It's all about the long-term brand … it's a different sort of investment.""

But it's an investment brands seem to be increasingly making.

""As audiences continue to change as there continues to be a proliferation of streaming options and choice in what people watch and how people watch brands are looking to find breakthrough ways of reaching audiences that feels authentic because they know that that authentic connection with the brand is more powerful than than just one single tactic"" said Steven Rummer SVP of strategy and creative partnerships advertising & partnerships at NBCUniversal.

He said NBCUniversal's research studies have found 81% of people are more likely to buy or use brands who help others when it's needed most and that 79% of consumers are more loyal to brands who prioritize communities' well-being over business as usual.

""We have all this great research that shows the power and impact of doing these longer form brand films or branded content and the connection that it has with actual results on the advertiser side"" he said.

Of course this content actually has to be good Marcus Peterzell CEO of entertainment marketing agency Passion Point Collective said during a panel at Tribeca X.

""It's gotta be a great film. And if any consumers..."" (he paused to twist his face into a grimace) ""...because there's a Samsung phone stuck in their face you lose. A good film is a good film. It doesn't matter if Sony funded it or HP funded it. It's still a great film.""

Peterzell used the example of 3M's new film ""Not The Science Type"" which discusses stereotypes and how they can hurt STEM diversity equity and inclusion. He said that there are plenty of great film ideas out there and if a brand is the catalyzing force for making an important film happen ""that alone is a win for a brand.""

With so many options a brand film has to be something someone will press play on despite infinite options.

June 19 2021

Story By Mike McGlothlin

When the decision makers behind the Outlaw Diesel Super Series decided to introduce the 5.90 Index class they did their organization a huge favor. The category has grown in leaps and bounds since its debut just a few short years ago and the competition is second-to-none. It might be index racing but it’s very close and extremely fast. And unlike many other diesel racing classes it isn’t primarily dominated by Cummins power plants. Within the ranks of 5.90 there are a host of Duramax-powered GM’s and even Power Stroke-propelled Fords. It’s a class without weight restrictions turbo limits or any one-size-fits-all approach—and with 19 racers following the ODSS race schedule in 2021 it’s downright entertaining to watch.

Below you’ll get a glimpse of what you’re in for when you take in a 5.90 race: two top-tier GM’s—both of which already have a win under their belt so far this season—and a consistent third-gen Cummins that’s currently Second Place in points. Each build is different but on race day their goals are the same: running the number.

Buddy Callaway’s Battle-Hardened GMC

Like something out of a Mad Max film Buddy Callaway’s ’03 GMC Sierra 2500 shortbed looks beat up and thrown together—but it’s one of the most consistent trucks in the class. The 4500-pound GMC is nothing like some of the full tube chassis builds in 5.90 but the setup works extremely well. Buddy regularly cuts 1.31 to 1.33-second 60-foots thanks in part to a four-link rear suspension with coil over shocks and a Twisted Diesel 4L80E transmission he tunes himself using a Powertrain Control Solutions TCM-2800. And in addition to its lack of an Allison the front IFS is gone too. Instead a King Pin Dana 60 with leaf springs is present while a 14-bolt AAM 10.5-inch rear axle resides out back.

The Duramax That Defies All Logic

Unbelievably Buddy campaigns a bone-stock 300000-mile LB7 Duramax. And being that his truck has been as quick as 5.73 in the past he lays claim to the fastest stock engine LB7 Duramax in the world. No hard-part changes have been made. Even the factory head bolts are still intact! But that doesn’t stop Buddy from making the Duramax turn 4500 rpm or belt out 1200 hp. The common-rail V-8’s fuel system has been upgraded in the form of a 12mm stroker CP3 and 200-percent over injectors with Danville Performance fine-tuning the ECM.

Stock Turbo 1200 HP!

Along with the engine the factory 60mm IHI turbocharger is still aboard Buddy’s LB7. This is a turbo that’s not exactly known for being indestructible and if you ask Buddy he’ll tell you he has no idea how it’s still alive. In conjunction with the engine the OEM turbo has 300000 miles on it and has survived more than 200 passes in the 5’s. Near the firewall you can catch a glimpse of the four-stage nitrous system that’s employed to send the GMC into orbit. While his combination may seem a bit ragged-edge (300000-mile engine stock turbo etc.) Buddy’s Sierra is ultra-consistent and has brought him several big wins including the W at Rudy’s Spring Truck Jam back in April.

Chad Keeter’s Consistent Cummins

Consistency does it and Chad Keeter is well on his way to a solid run at the points chase in 2021. Chad and his third-gen Dodge finished runner-up (to Buddy Callaway) at Rudy’s Spring Truck Jam back in April going 5.91 at 122 mph right off the trailer no less! At the Outlaw Diesel Revenge event in May he went out in the second round of eliminations due to a double breakout but still secured enough points to remain tied for Second Place as we went to press. Also while in Indy (and just to show you how close the racing is in 5.90 Index) Chad qualified 12th with his 5.957-second pass (which was right behind a 5.956 a 5.950 and another 5.950). His ’06 Ram rides on 16x10-inch Raceline wheels and 30x14 M&H cheater slicks.

Single Turbo Highly-Fueled 5.9L Cummins

Chad Keeter’s strong parts combination begins with a 5.9L Cummins that was built at Miller’s Machine Shop. The fuel system components were supplied by Exergy Performance and consist of 250-percent over injectors as well as a stroker CP3 over a Sportsman pump. An 85mm S400 from Forced Inductions handles boost production an automatic built by Chris Gelbaugh at CG Diesel Performance Transmissions handles the shifts and Hardway tuning ties everything together.

Dustin Sterling’s Big Boost Duramax

Dustin Sterling missed the first race of the 2021 ODSS race year but thanks to the performance he turned in at Outlaw Diesel Revenge in Indy it didn’t much matter. Despite working with a truck that was a bit too fast that weekend (his trap speeds were over 120 mph) Dustin decided to leave well enough alone and let it ride. In hindsight we’re sure he’s glad he did as his ’07 Duramax proceeded to edge out everyone he came up against in eliminations. In the final Dustin grabbed the quicker reaction time over seasoned racer Rick Fletes and pulled out the win despite running the slower elapsed time (a 5.95 to Fletes’ 5.92).

SoCal Engine TSD Compounds

Under the removable front clip on Dustin’s classic body Chevy you’ll find a SoCal Diesel-built Duramax. Its fueling needs are met thanks to injectors and a pair of CP3’s from S&S Diesel Motorsport. The flawlessly fabricated compound turbo arrangement was executed by Truck Source Diesel and combines a big Garrett atmosphere charger with an S400 in the valley. Sun Coast supports Dustin on the transmission side of his race truck’s equation. Dustin has been quoted as saying he won’t be able to make every race on the circuit this year. But if he finds a way to make it happen the chances of seeing a Duramax bring home the 5.90 championship will definitely increase.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvMzQwMC1ocC1kcmFnLXJhY2UtYmV0d2Vlbi1hdWRpLXR0LXJzLXI4LWFuZC05MTEtdHVyYm8tcy1pcy1hbi1hYnNvbHV0ZS1tZXNzLTE2MzU0OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3400 HP Drag Race Between Audi TT RS R8 and 911 Turbo S Is an Absolute Mess,"The thought of a 1100 hp Audi TT RS is pretty ridiculous but not as ridiculous as the absolutely colossal sum of money that went into giving the tiny two-seater this kind of power.

According to the owner we're looking at around 80000 Sterling Pounds which translates to about $110000. That's more than the car itself cost as new and quite frankly a lot more than anyone should ever spend on an Audi TT RS  but that's what happens when you try to make this kind of power out of a 2.5-liter five-cylinder single-turbo engine. Had it been a big V8 all you would need was a larger turbo or supercharger and you would have been golden. $10000 max.By comparison the work done on the Audi R8 V10 now seems cheap since it's only half of that. However considering the car's initial price it all probably evens out. The R8 though gets the wonderful 5.2-liter V10 engine and since stock it was naturally aspirated you get a huge boost just by adding some sort of forced induction. How about two turbochargers then? As a result the original 540 hp output more than doubled as the R8 now makes the most power in the shootout: 1200 hp.Finally we get to the 911 Turbo S. This one tops the charts in terms of money invested with roughly $125000 but the list of modifications is also massive. Its 3.8-liter twin-turbo flat-six now has a 4.2-liter displacement and even though the turbo layout remains the same the power output jumps to 1100 hp just like the TT RS.In fact this whole race is weirdly balanced in almost every metric except for the cost of these vehicles. However money doesn't play a direct role on the track so it'll all come down to which one can make the most of the 1000+ horsepower 730+ lb-ft (1000 Nm) of torque and all-wheel-drive systems. And of course the driver.Speaking of drivers since this is carwow we know from the start who at least one of them is going to be: Mat Watson. Yanni is another partner in crime that features quite often but it's actually the driver of the Porsche that steals the show on this occasion though not for the right reasons. He's a bit of a cheat.For the rolling race he always sits back while Mat is counting timing his run so that he'll be in full acceleration when the ""go"" is given. He does that not once but twice. Braking test? Oh he cheats that too by lagging behind and dropping speed before the marker on the track.Finally he also jumps the start in one of the standing races but since Yanni's R8 was having trouble getting off the line it ends up not counting. Well that's what you get when the driver isn't neutral (he works for the company that did the work on the 911  and Mat even jokes at the start that he'll get fired if he doesn't win. He might have been joking but it looks like his boss told him the same thing before letting him go on the show).Between the 911 driver's shenanigans Yanni's R8 refusing to launch properly and Mat missing shifts and generally being terrified by the power his car makes it's safe to say this isn't your regular carwow drag race video. Then again they don't race three cars that make well over 1000 hp each day so it's understandable.We won't give you the times or the standings but we will tell you this: all three cars dropped under the 10-second mark over the standing quarter some quite comfortably. Watch the thoroughly enjoyable three-way battle and tell us who you're rooting for. We would have gone for the 911 but the driver really makes it hard."

IBM’s Mayflower Autonomous Ship (MAS400) has set sail across the Atlantic ocean without a crew or human control. The autonomous trimaran left Plymouth England on June 15 and hopes to reach Plymouth Massachusetts in about three weeks.

The voyage of the robotic Mayflower follows the path of the original Mayflower which brought the Pilgrim settlers to New England in 1620. The 50-foot long 20-foot wide craft is made of aluminum and carbon composites displaces five tonnes and is propelled by a solar-powered hybrid motor with a diesel backup giving it a top speed of 10 knots.

Supervised by a command center in Plymouth UK the Mayflower navigates using over 50 sensors including six IBM AI Vision cameras and an IBM deep learning system to identify and avoid obstacles hostile currents and bad weather while adhering to international navigation rules. Data processing is by onboard computers backed up by an IBM Power Systems AC922 onshore.

Onboard is a scientific payload of 1500 pounds that includes acoustic nutrient and temperature sensors as well as water and air samplers. These are gathering scientific data to help with future studies of ocean chemistry acidification sea level height and wave patterns; microplastics; and marine mammal conservation among other topics. In addition the autonomous technology could find applications in shipping oil and gas industries telecommunications security defense fishing and aquaculture.

The cinematography award was for his corporate film ‘Your Next Step…..’ shot for Granta Park-based Illumina. The film developed by his company RAPT TV was praised for “great production values [being] beautifully storyboarded and slickly edited” by Terry Hope editor of Professional Photo magazine.

The qualities on show for the Illumina video which showcases the benefits of working for the life sciences sector are the same as those applied to the rest of David’s output. He has previously won World Press Photo award and a Gold Lens from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The former was presented by the prime minister in the Netherlands and the latter – “for a picture of Peter Schmeichel saving a shot on goal at Spurs” – was presented by the president of the IOC in Lausanne.

“I am really pleased to add international award-winning filmmaker to the list of achievements” says David. “I have been a professional photographer for 30-plus years – eight years as chief sports photographer on the Sunday Express – and shot for various other nationals. I have been a Getty commercial photographer and videographer for many years shot ad campaigns for many international clients and travelled from the North Pole to Tasmania on assignments.”

David puts dedication and perseverance into his work.

“I lived in the Alps for 10 years photographing extreme sports and have lived in Cambridge for the last 16 years – I grew up in Suffolk.”

Over the years there’s not much David has not done in the film industry.

He says: “I’ve got a great deal of stories from around the world from hanging out of a warbird over the Alps to photograph the Honda jet.

“They include spending six weeks 800 miles north of the Arctic Circle to flying to Tasmania from Australia in a single-engine plane in a storm losing a kneecap racing a British snowboard team member through a forest in the Alps to a big paragliding crash in the Alps where we were nearly run over by a bus.”

Up to just a couple years ago small-core Intel devices with Braswell or Apollo Lake chips were really hard to recommend to just about anyone. With cheap build quality cheap components and painfully slow performance I even disliked the fact that my young kids had to cope with these Chromebooks while at elementary school. Even worse since they were always the cheapest options many people used these Chromebooks and thought “THIS is what it feels like to use Chrome OS.” It was a bad look all around.

Fortunately that isn’t the case any longer. Affordable Chromebooks are getting better and better as time goes by and what you can get in the sub-$350 range these days completely demolishes what was standard fare just a couple years ago. With better quality in the builds better screens and – most importantly – better small-core processors from Intel the affordable Chromebook market is finally a place that is fun to hang out in.

As a reference device for this video CTL was kind enough to send over the Chromebook NL81T for us to check out and it is a pretty standard affordable Chromebook. It is all plastic but the build feels substantial and well designed. The touchscreen is anti-glare and 280 nits so it looks great in nearly all lighting conditions. The keyboard is nice to type on and the trackpad – while plastic – is smooth with a satisfying click. At 14-inches the 1080p screen is comfortable to work on and the I/O is all you need with a USB Type A on either side a single USB Type C port microSD card slot headphone/mic jack and a full-sized HDMI port.

All in all I spent a solid week working every day from this Chromebook and you know what? I didn’t hate it. If I’m being honest there were times I totally forgot I was operating from an affordable Chromebook at all. Even when hooked up to my QHD ultra-wide monitor this device kept up with my daily workload the screen was bright enough to handle my proximity to the windows and the keyboard/trackpad was delightful to use. There’s no reality where I would have said this about an entry-level Chromebook just a few years ago yet here we are.

Buy the CTL Chromebook NL81T

Now I don’t want to mislead anyone. This CTL Chromebook we’re talking about has the last-gen Gemini Lake Pentium Silver processor inside (N5030) 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage and retails at $389 when not on sale. Similarly-built and spec’d devices from other manufacturers hit somewhere in the same price range. That’s not exactly low-end or affordable in the Chromebook world but it holds true that I’ve been equally impressed by the standard Gemini Lake Celeron N4020 processor that powers affordable Chromebooks we’ve done videos about that are far more inexpensive than the CTL I was just talking about. Simply put affordable Chromebooks are getting good.

And as we roll into the middle part of 2021 we can’t help but be even more excited by the promise of Jasper Lake processors from Intel. We’ve had some hands-on already with these processors and the performance gains are impressive versus the Gemini Lake processors from just a year ago. When they start arriving – and they WILL be arriving soon in large numbers – we’d expect to see a wave of affordable Chromebooks that will have performance that won’t hamper the experience at all. This means manufacturers are free to spend their device budget in other ways like better screens better build components and more RAM and storage for the same generally low prices.

With all of that in play the low-end Chromebook space is becoming more exciting than ever. Where I once despised affordable Chromebooks for their poor build quality and painfully slow performance we’re starting to see much better attention to detail and performance that doesn’t degrade the Chrome OS experience. And the best part is the price. There’s no reason not to expect these devices to stay in the $300-$400 range and simply be better overall Chromebooks than anything we’ve had in this price range prior.

advertisement

And all of this puts pressure on the higher-end Chromebooks to be better and better to substantiate their higher asking prices. It’s a win-win and an evolution of the Chromebook ecosystem that I’m more excited about than nearly anything else right now. The thought of an army of sub-$400 Chromebooks that feel great look great and perform great is awesome to think about and I think we’re right around the corner from that reality playing itself out as we come into the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2021. It’s going to be a very very interesting time in the life of the humble Chromebook and we’ll be here to cover it all.

This week was all about leaked Windows 11 ISO. This build was clearly far from the final version but it gave us a lot of information on the upcoming operating system from Microsoft.

The leaked Windows 11 has a lot more in common with Windows 10 than expected. The developer preview ISO that leaked is clearly a few months old which is best illustrated by numerous references to Windows 10 in the system files. Not to mention missing widgets apps or functionality that was expected to arrive with the new system. Windows 11 also supports WDDM 3.0 which was first introduced Win10 Insider Preview “Cobalt”.

Windows 11 WDDM 3.0 Source: Laptopvidoeo2go

While WDDM upgrade and Microsoft Store updates were to be expected with the newer Windows enthusiasts have been eagerly awaiting news whether the new installment in the Microsoft Windows family will also introduce changes and improvements for heterogenous CPU architectures such as the upcoming 12th Gen Core Alder Lake series from Intel.

As it turns out the leaked operating system already provides a small improvement to so far the only hybrid-based Intel CPU series: Lakefield. These are low-power CPU series featuring only 1 big core and 4 ‘small’ cores. Intel is to increase the number of these CPU cores with Alder Lake significantly which raised the question of whether it will favor such designs in the future.

Based on HotHardware testing Lakefield Core i7-L16G7 CPU indeed does appear to have higher performance in early Windows 11 build. The site claims a 5.8% boost in multi-threaded Geekbench 5 score and a 2% higher single-thread.

A modern synthetic benchmark such as Cinbench R23 sees a big improvement in single-core threaded tests with nearly 8.2% performance uplift:

PC Mark 10 is probably closer to real-world testing as it tests various workloads simultaneously. While Windows 10 was clearly better in the Digital Content Creation test mostly due to the fact that Win11 does not have a dedicated driver yet the Win11 has shown performance improvement in all other tests:

With those performance improvements in mind one would expect to see similar gains with Alder Lake which is now set to launch later this year. Alder Lake will also feature Intel’s Hybrid Technology based on high-performance and high-efficiency cores. Its successor codenamed Raptor Lake as well as rumored AMD Strix Point APU is also believed to feature such design.

Results for the Core i7-11390H (via Geekbench)

Intel's Tiger Lake-H family of notebook processors has been divided into two two groups: some very exciting eight-core parts with 45-watt TDPs and some slightly less exciting but still very fast 35-watt CPUs. Both of these product groups have shown best in class single-threaded performance for high-performance and gaming notebooks. It looks like a refresh might already be on the way however as unannounced CPUs pop-up in online benchmark databases.Fresh from the Geekbench score database is an unannounced Core i7-11390H processor. The CPU showed up in a notebook marked NV4XMJMKMH which maps to a whitebook made by Clevo and used by a whole host of boutique notebook builders. Oddly enough however that model was previously host to the Core i7-1195G7 and its 28-watt TDP rather than an H-family CPU. Being a quad-core we believe this to be a 35-watt processor rather.The performance turned in by the Core i7-11390H was quite good for a notebook CPU. It nearly hit 1700 -- 1695 to be exact -- in the single-threaded Geekbench 5 test and mounted a cool 6062 in the multi-threaded test. Tiger Lake originally launched with the Core i7-1185G7 in a 28-watt TDP. When we reviewed the MSI Prestige 14 EVO with that CPU we only saw around 1550 in the single-threaded test and just under 5900 multi-threaded performance. From a single-threaded perspective this presumably 35-watt CPU was around 10% faster.This performance is more in line with the Core i7-1195G7 which made its way into Geekbench shortly before its announcement. That processor also scored right at 1700 in single-threaded performance and around 6000 multi-threaded. Geekbench is a synthetic benchmark so the exact performance may not be terribly relevant but hitting those high speeds is important in the public relations war. Intel seems to have finally caught up to the 2020 Mac mini with Apple's M1 processor a comparison that becomes more and more fitting as Apple continues to stuff this SoC into bigger computers like the iMac.We don't think that these refreshed H-family Tiger Lake CPUs are all that far out. The previous benchmark leak happened just a few days before the announcement of the Core i7-1195G7  so we expect Intel's announcement of upgraded H processors to not be very far off.

According to benchmarks by HotHardware (via Videocardz) the improvement will be roughly 5.8% on multi-threaded results and up to 2% on single-threaded results.

Intel Alder Lake CPU to get up to 5.8% boost from new hardware scheduler in Windows 11

HotHardware stumbled on quite the scoop. They used the leaked Windows 11 ISO to test Lakefield Core i7-L16G7 CPU and found out that the new scheduler improves performance when there is a big and LITTLE core architecture. This of course means that Intel's upcoming Alder Lake CPUs will get a similar performance uplift compared to Windows 10. In other words Microsoft Windows 11 is made for Intel Alder Lake (and other big SMALL designs). Without any further ado here are some of the benchmarks we encourage you to go and read the full review on their website.

While the inner machinations of Windows are an enigma for most people we have a theory as to what's going on here in our test results. Our working theory is that Microsoft has put in a lot of work for Lakefield perhaps in anticipation of Intel's Alder Lake with respect to the Windows scheduler. Remember that the Core i5-L16G7 represents Intel's first crack at focused cores for performance and power efficiency. Up until then such things only existed on Arm64. With Alder Lake set to launch later this year we think that the Galaxy Book S is perhaps an early benefactor of efforts to ensure that Intel's new hybrid architecture lives up to its full potential. - Ben Funk HotHardware

Windows 11 is being planned as a free upgrade over Windows 10 which should make it a no-brainer for most people. With Alder Lake set to be the first to market with DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 it seems that Intel might get a second shot at being very competitive with AMD again. One thing is for sure though it will be significantly more competitive with the Apple M1 - since power per watt (power efficiency) should go through the roof thanks to the inclusion of SMALL cores. This could allow Intel to take the power efficiency crown again - something it hasn't had in a very long time. AMD has no plans to shift to big SMALL architecture in the near future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdzbWFyZW5hLmNvbS9ob25vcl9tYWdpY2Jvb2tfMTRfd2l0aF9pbnRlbF9jb3JlX2k3MTE2NWc3X3Jldmlldy1uZXdzLTQ5NjE3LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Honor MagicBook 14 with Intel Core i7-1165G7 review,"Introduction

Honor is getting a lot of mileage out of the MagicBook 14 chassis – we reviewed it once with a Ryzen 3500U APU then we looked at the upgraded 4500U model. With the AMD chips covered time to have a look at the Intel-powered version of this laptop that was announced last month.



The Honor MagicBook 14 is back this time with an 11th generation Intel Core processor

There are two options – an Intel i7-1165G7 or an i5-1135G7. Both are 11th generation mobile chips (Tiger Lake) built on a 10nm SuperFin litography. Both have four hyper-threaded cores (i.e. eight threads total) and both have a TDP of 28W. The i7 version has a higher base frequency (2.8 GHz vs. 2.4 GHz) higher max turbo frequency (4.7 GHz vs. 4.2 GHz) and more L3 cache (12 MB vs. 8 MB).

We have the more powerful i7 version in front of us but as you can see the two options aren’t that different. The Intel Xe graphics on the i7 model boast 96 execution units up from 80 on the i5 but neither would do for anything beyond casual play. But before we examine what’s on the inside let us look at what’s on the outside.

Design display keyboard

There’s not much more to say about the design that we didn’t cover in our previous encounters with the laptop. The aluminum exterior is sleek though the screen bezel is plastic.

The keyboard shows minimal flexing when pressed down the screen is a bit more wobbly but overall we’re pleased with the build quality. The laptop weighs 1.38 kg (don’t forget the 200g USB-C charger) and measures 15.9 mm thick. It’s not the lightest in its category but we’re not complaining.



The 14"" display delivers over 300 nits brightness • The keyboard is a bit cramped the touchpad is great

The Intel version has the same dimensions weight and port selection as the AMD ones. That last part is a bit of a disappointment as a Thunderbolt port would have been a nice reason to go blue instead of red. That said the sole USB-C port do support charging – in fact there’s no barrel plug to be seen. But we’ll get to the battery and charging.

Before that we have to air two complaints. First that there’s only a single USB-C (and no barrel jack) so plugging into the power leaves you with only a single USB-A 3.2 Gen1 and a USB-A 2.0 (which will most likely be occupied by a keyboard/mouse dongle and they better be able to share).

The second complaint of course is that if you want to plug in an external monitor you can’t use a single cable to do it – you’ll also need to use the full-size HDMI port.



USB-C (charging is supported DisplayPort is not) USB-A 3.2 Gen1 HDMI • USB-A 2.0 3.5 mm jack

Moving on the MagicBook 14 is equipped with a 14” LCD panel with 1920 x 1080px resolution. The official numbers are 300 nits typical brightness and 1000:1 contrast ratio both values being superior to the numbers for the Ryzen 4500U version (250 nits and 800:1 respectively). But again those are the claimed numbers.

We tested the display on the Intel model and it maxed out at 370 nits - pretty solid. The Ryzen model also overshot its target and posted 277 nits. Even so the nearly 100 nit difference in brightness is quite tangible. Our one complaint is that at 50% the brightness drops to 173 nits which is relatively dim. We would have preferred a more linear scaling.

Viewing angles are quite good and while there is a shift in contrast at extreme angles it is not an issue at normal viewing angles. For color rendering the display aims for 100% sRGB and 72% NTSC coverage.

The keyboard is as before with nice large keys with good travel and feedback. There are also three levels of backlighting. As is typical for a 14” laptop this one features only a curated selection of keys – beyond QWERTY basically only Backspace and Delete get their own keys. The F-row doubles up as shortcut keys (screen brightness volume Wi-Fi etc.) and one of those (between F6 and F7) is not a key but the webcam instead.



The power button doubles as a fingerprint reader

The plastic touchpad is about as large as would fit in this form factor. It is smooth and accurate multi-touch gestures worked perfectly. To the right of the keyboard is the Power button which has an embedded fingerprint reader you can use as an alternative to password login.

Upgradability

This will be unfortunately a short section. The laptop comes with 16GB of dual-channel DDR4 RAM which is an ample amount for the class. That is good news as it is soldered to the motherboard so you can’t add more capacity later on.

For storage there is a 512GB NVMe SSD a Western Digital SN730 specifically. It is attached on the PCIe Gen 3 x4 port. You can swap it out but there’s only the one bay so you’ll have to copy your data over to the new drive first.



An app that keeps drivers up to date • Huawei Magic Link is supported

Finally there’s also a PCIe Gen 3 x1 port which is where the network card goes. It’s an Intel AX201 which supports Wi-Fi 6 (2x2) and Bluetooth 5.1 so you probably won’t need to replace this one anytime soon.

Performance

The 11th Gen Intel Core i5 and i7 processors are fabbed on the second iteration of Intel’s 10nm SuperFin process. They have a configurable TDP of between 12W and 28W. We’ve set the laptop to high performance mode (using the Fn+P shortcut alternatively you can quickly jump into Honor’s PC Manager app using the alternative function of F10).

The CPU contains four Willow Cove cores each running two threads. For comparison the Ryzen 4500U version of the MagicBook 14 we tested previously is home to 6 cores running 12 threads.

So the Intel chip should be at a disadvantage in the multi-threaded tests but with turbo clocks going up to 4.7GHz on our i7-powered review sample it has a chance to edge out the AMD chip which tops out at 4.0GHz in single-core tests. The i7 has more cache too (12MB vs. 8MB).

The single-core performance test (based on Geekbench 5) goes heavily in favor of the Core i7 version with an over 40% advantage.

The strength of individual cores really whittles down the core count advantage of the AMD APU. So the i7-based laptop also takes the win in the multi-core performance test – the advantage isn’t as stunning but it’s a good 20% lead over the 4500U.

Moving on to Cinebench R20 it concurs that the i7 is faster though with a narrower gap of around 10%.



Honor MagicBook 14 (Core i7-1165G7): Cinebench R20 • Geekbench 5

The i5 and i7 support PCIe Gen 4 which goes unused on this laptop. However that doesn’t harm the performance as the WD SN730 SSD hits its performance targets perfectly. And it is closed to maxing out what a Gen 3 x4 connection can achieve so there’s not much financial sense in investing in a faster drive.

Notably the Intel version of the MagicBook 14 received a superior SSD which did nail the 3400 MB/s sequential read speeds advertised by WD. That is 75% faster than the SSSTC SSD in the Ryzen 4500U version managed. Sequential write speeds are twice as high too.

As for random access two the drives are comparable at high queue depth but the Western Digital drive in is clearly superior at random writes speeds in the Q1T1 test (queue depth = 1 # of threads = 1).

To test out the Iris Xe graphics we ran GFXBench 5.0 in DirectX 12 and Vulkan modes. The Aztec Ruins test showed better performance under Vulkan where it came close to hitting 60fps in the High Tier mode at 1080p resolution. Under DirectX 12 it ran at under 54fps but got close to 80fps in the Normal Tier.

This clearly isn’t a gaming laptop but it will handle casual games easily enough as long as you don’t expect stellar graphics. The numbers are comparable with the Ryzen 7 4700U and its Vega 7 GPU.



Intel Iris Xe graphics test: GFXBench (DirectX 12) • GFXBench (Vulkan)

Honor attached two heat pipes to the Intel processor that lead to a single fan. For short bursts of activity the fan is whisper quiet (especially when it’s not in Performance mode) However prolonged stress tests crank up the decibels – it’s not very loud but its high pitch isn’t exactly pleasant. Still this is only a concern if you hammer the CPU and GPU for long periods of time.

Battery life and charging

The Intel version of the Honor MagicBook 14 (2021) comes with a 56Wh capacity to work with the same as the Ryzen model we tested. However the Intel chip is more power hungry.

We played YouTube (over Wi-Fi 1080p/30 fps video) at 100% screen brightness and in about 6 hours the battery was down to 20% which is when the power saver mode kicked in. We continued until the battery died which took an hour and 20 minutes. That is significantly less than the Ryzen version which lasted over 11 hours.

Then we tried web browsing (using Microsoft Edge and a Wi-Fi connection) which proved easier on the battery and the laptop lasted nearly 7 hours before the battery fell to 20% and about a total of 8 and a half hours before it was fully depleted. This is again nowhere near what the Ryzen model achieved (12:30h).

Test Screen brightness Time to 20% Time to 0% YouTube 1080p 30fps 100.00% 5:58 7:19 YouTube 1080p 30fps 50.00% 7:01 8:34 Browsing 100.00% 6:50 8:25 Browsing 50.00% 8:22 10:24

That brighter screen sure eats into the endurance. So we dropped the brightness to 50% and that made a big difference – the laptop lasted 10 and a half hours of web browsing. YouTube playback once again proved more demanding and the laptop lasted only about 8 and a half hours. Still that should be more than enough to get you through the day.

Like its sibling this laptop comes with a 65W charger that outputs over USB-C. Official numbers claim 44% charge in half an hour and our tests confirm that as it took around 36 minutes to reach 50% charge. A full charge took 1 hour and 38 minutes.

Charging Time 0-50% 0:36 0-100% 1:35

We also tried plugging in a tiny 18W USB-C Power Delivery charger and the laptop started filling up its battery. It’s not fast of course but in a pinch you can use a compatible phone charger (great news if you’re not keen on carrying the laptop’s own 200g charger).

Verdict

The Honor MagicBook 14 (2021 Intel) is already available in several European markets. The i5 version starts at €850 with 8GB of RAM and 512GB SSD. For comparison the 8/512GB version with a Ryzen 4500U costs €750.

We tested the top model with an i7 and 16GB of RAM which can be found for €1000 at the time of writing but note that its MSRP is €1200. Is this laptop worth €1200? In isolation we'd say yes. But the real question is whether you’d rather have this one at €1000 over the Ryzen one at €750.

The Intel version showed superior CPU performance and also had a clear edge in storage speed (if not capacity). Also it comes with a better screen. However it runs its battery dry noticeably faster. So if performance is the priority the Intel model looks more appealing. If you want endurance and to spare your wallet the AMD version is better.

As alternatives there is the Acer Swift 3 at €1100 MSRP with the same i7-1165G7 processor 16GB of RAM (soldered) and 1 TB storage. You can save €200 if you go for an 8/512 GB configuration. This laptop is lighter at 1.2 kg and has the same battery capacity 56Wh (the included charger is a 45W brick). The screen is a 14” 1080p IPS LCD and the USB-C port does support Thunderbolt 4.



Acer Swift 3 • Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 2 • Asus ZenBook 14 (UX425EA)

If you are a ThinkPad fan you can also have a look at the ThinkPad E14 Gen 2 – configured with the same 11th Gen i7 16GB of RAM (soldered single channel) and 512GB storage (a second M.2-2280 is available) it sells for €1070. The 14” IPS LCD is dimmer though (250 nits) and the battery smaller (45Wh. At least it comes with a 65W USB-C charger and the port supports Thunderbolt 4. The whole thing is heavier too 1.6 kg.

An Asus ZenBook 14 (UX425EA) has a high MSRP of €1500 but Amazon DE has it in stock at €1185. This is with the same processor 16GB of RAM (soldered) and 512GB SSD. That price gets you a 14” IPS LCD with 2560 x 1440 px resolution that promises 300 nits. The whole thing weighs 1.17kg despite the larger 67Wh battery which charges using a 65W USB-C adapter. And get this it has two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4 (but no 3.5mm jack without an adapter).

The Honor MagicBook 14 strikes a fine balance between performance price and portability. The port selection is limiting and the battery life is not as good as on its Ryzen-powered sibling (which is cheaper to boot). A solid laptop overall but you need to be sure that the extra performance is worth the price premium as €1000 or so can buy you one of a selection of fine ultra-portables."

We ASX investors love our Australian shares. And fair enough too. The S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) has been a great place historically to find great companies to invest your money into for long-term gains. However like any index the ASX 200 isn't perfect. It's heavy on ASX banks and miners and light on tech companies. At least where it counts: market-capitalisation weighting.

That's where the US markets can come in handy. Not only is America home to some of the best companies in the world such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). it also offers ASX investors some exposure to trends and sectors that the ASX 200 just can't.

So here are 3 ASX exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have the potential to easily expose any ASX investor's portfolio to the US markets.

3 ASX ETFs that can offer ASX investors easy US markets exposure

iShares S&P 500 ETF (ASX: IVV)

Here we have a simple cheap US-based index fund. The S&P 500 Index (INDEXSP: .INX) is one of the largest and most-tracked index in the world. It holds 500 of the largest companies in the US. That's everything from Apple and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) to Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE). This is the index that IVV tracks. This ETF has been an objectively solid performer over the past 10 years returning an average of 17.93% per annum. it also has one of the lowest management fees of any ETF on the ASX at 0.04% per annum.

BetaShares Nasdaq 100 ETF (ASX: NDQ)

Another US-based index fund here. But instead of the S&P 500 NDQ tracks the Nasdaq-100 (INDEXNASDAQ: NDX). This index is a little different holding only the companies that list on the Nasdaq exchange. The Nasdaq is one of the major stock exchanges in the US but it's a lot newer than its main rival the New York Stock Exchange. As such it tends to house mostly tech companies. It's largest holdings are Apple Microsoft and other tech giants like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX).

NDQ charges a management fee of 0.48% per annum and has retuned an average of 20.94% per annum since its inception in 2015.

VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (ASX: MOAT)

This ETF is a little different from the above examples as it is not an index fund. Rather it can be described as an 'active ETF'. That's because it invests in companies that meet certain criteria – that of a wide economic moat. VanEck works with Morningstar to identify a concentrated portfolio of at least 40 US shares that show signs of a 'wide moat'.

'Moat' is a Warren Buffett term that describes a company's intrinsic competitive advantage. This can be in a powerful brand cost advantage or other factors that enable a company to stay on top of its competition. Some of MOAT's top holdings include Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) and Buffett's own Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). MOAT charges a management fee of 0.49% per annum. It has returned an average of 20.38% per annum since its inception in 2015.",,,,,,

With today’s launch of the online Environmental Self-check WWF provides an improved service to pulp and paper manufacturers globally for company internal usage. The five online steps to check the environmental footprint of pulp and paper brands can be filled out confidentially. The Environmental Self-check is a new feature of WWF´s Check Your Paper a public database of brands with high environmental standards.

Notes to editors

Check Your Paper has been designed as a user-friendly tool to help paper purchasers and manufacturers to evaluate their environmental footprint. With the help of the Check Your Paper scheme also responsible merchants and other distributors can verify and demonstrate the quality of the products they sell. This scheme aims to channel paper consumption and production towards alternatives with the least harmful environmental impacts. It focuses on a limited number of major impacts related to the health and vitality of humans and ecosystems including:

· forest impacts through wood harvesting

· greenhouse gas emissions

· water pollutants

· wastes

CYP is based on parameters and the rating system of the WWF Paper Scorecard that was initially launched 2007. The parameters and criteria were updated early 2010 with substantial input from more than 30 key paper sector players including number of globally largest paper manufacturers paper merchants paper buyers and non-governmental organisations from Europe North America Latin America and Africa.

“WWF wants to offer an additional service to producers to support continual improvement efforts. With the Environmental Self-check we encourage companies to test their products with our method and verify their environmental performance. Companies can download their scores for company internal usage and discussions without any cost or obligations” said Emmanuelle Neyroumande Pulp and Paper Global Manager WWF International “Of course we encourage them to also publish their scores subsequently to show leadership in transparency.”The Environmental Self-check is based on a method which reduces the complexity of assessing the forest and manufacturing footprint of pulp and paper products. Previously called “Scorecard” it was developed upon request by and with support of large buyers and in consultation with scientists NGOs and producers. The Check Your Paper method is already being used across regions and for different products. WWF now also encourages the use of the method in supplier screening tools for example those of retailers and other large buyers of pulp and paper.The public Check Your Paper database has further a new focus on featuring pulp and paper products with high environmental standards and a low forest water and climate footprint. As part of the improved Check Your Paper WWF will offer more opportunities for transparent leaders in the sector to get public recognition for published brands. All third party audited brands will automatically participate in the Environmental Paper Awards 2016 which will be issued for Best Environmental Performance paper brands and the most transparent producers.Rod Taylor Director Forests for Life Programme WWF International said “At a time of increasing interest in supply chain risks worldwide the Check Your Paper Method offers an opportunity for suppliers and buyers to work together to reduce their environmental footprint.”Helma Brandlmaier Senior Advisor Strategic Communications and Knowledge ManagementWWF International Tel: +43676842728219 hbrandlmaier@wwf.panda.org",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRydWVob29wLmNvbS9wL25hemlzLWF0LXRoZS13YWxkb3JmLWFzdG9yaWHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nazis at the Waldorf Astoria - by Henry Abbott,"This is part 13 of an ongoing series.

How We Sipped Danced and Stumbled Our Way to Civilization

By Edward Slingerland

Frederick the Great of Prussia had a problem: His soldiers were drinking coffee instead of beer. “This must be prevented” he wrote in a 1777 tirade on the “disgusting” new fad sweeping the kingdom. Why would any commander want a bunch of guys with guns quaffing liquid neurotoxins instead of wholesome brews rarely associated with brawling karaoke and regrettable tattoos (to say nothing of liver damage and hangovers)? Caffeinated armies might sound more dependable than their tipsy counterparts — but the king recognized that beer was a uniquely powerful bonding agent and key to morale.

He was not the first to intuit its practical applications. For thousands of years cultures around the world have “implicitly understood that the sober rational calculating individual mind is a barrier to social trust” Edward Slingerland writes in “Drunk: How We Sipped Danced and Stumbled Our Way to Civilization” an effervescent new study that’s equal parts anthropology psychology and evolutionary biology. Drawing on recent experiments Neolithic burials eclectic myths and global literature Slingerland teases out the evolutionary advantages and enduring benefits of getting blitzed. It’s a rowdy banquet of a book in which the ancient Roman historian Tacitus Lord Byron Timothy Leary George Washington the Chinese poet Tao Yuanming and many others toast the merits of drowning Apollonian reason in Dionysian abandon.

Might the fact that corporate investors snapped up 15 percent of U.S. homes for sale in the first quarter of this year have something to do with it? The Wall Street Journal reported in April that an investment firm won a bidding war to purchase an entire neighborhood worth of single-family homes in Conroe Texas—part of a cycle of stories drumming up panic over Wall Street’s increasing stake in residential real estate. Then came the backlash as cool-headed analysts reassured us that big investors like BlackRock remain insignificant players in the housing market compared with regular old American families.

The truth is between the two: We can panic and acknowledge Wall Street’s small role at the same time. Although the number of houses being purchased by mega-investors is currently not enough to move the market in most parts of the country these firms’ underlying structural advantage is profound and growing.

Let’s focus on Invitation Homes a $21 billion publicly traded company that was spun off from Blackstone the world’s largest private equity company in 2017. Invitation Homes operates in 16 cities with the biggest concentration in Atlanta where it owns 12556 houses. (Though that’s not much compared with the 80000 homes sold in Atlanta each year Invitation Homes bought 90 percent of the homes for sale in some ZIP codes in Atlanta in the early 2010s.) While normal people typically pay a mortgage interest rate between 2 percent and 4 percent these days Invitation Homes can borrow money for far less: It’s getting billion-dollar loans at interest rates around 1.4 percent. In practice this means that Invitation Homes can afford to tack on an extra $5000 to $20000 to the purchase price of every home while getting the house at the same actual cost as a typical homeowner. While Invitation Homes uses a mixture of debt and cash from renters to buy houses its offers are almost always all cash which is a big leg up in a competitive market.

One way to think about Invitation Homes’ business strategy is to consider the value of the properties the firm is buying relative to the rents they charge. According to a recent SEC disclosure Invitation Homes’ portfolio of homes is worth of total of $16 billion (after renovations) and the company collects about $1.9 billion in rent per year. That means it takes only about eight years of rental payments to pay back a typical house that Invitation Homes has bought. The usual rule of thumb for evaluating a fair sale price says Kundan Kishor professor of economics at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee “is that price to rent ratios are around 20 to 1.” When price-to-rent ratios are very high it makes more sense for consumers to rent than to buy and when they are low it makes more sense to buy than to rent. That Invitation Homes is getting deals twice as good as a typical homebuyer shows that it’s not just buying any homes: It’s buying the specific houses with the greatest potential to be wealth-building for the middle class.

It’s not exactly accurate that investors are “buying every single-family house they can find” as some have suggested. If that were true their market share in the United States wouldn’t be a piddling 15 percent. They’re really buying up the stock of relatively inexpensive single-family homes built since the 1970s in growing metro areas. They mostly ignore bigger and more expensive houses especially ones that are move-in ready: Wealthy boomers and the nation’s finance and tech bros nab those properties. And they’re also ignoring cities with stable or shrinking populations like Providence and Pittsburgh.

Advertisement

But investors are depleting the inventory of the precise houses that might otherwise be obtainable for younger working- and middle-class households in the cities where those workers can easily find good-paying jobs like Atlanta (22 percent of home purchases according to Redfin data) Charlotte (22 percent) and Phoenix (20 percent). More importantly they’re able to scour those markets scientifically and systematically to make cash offers on the most attractively priced properties. While normal people buy houses when they actually need to move somewhere (savvy) investors buy houses several years before a bunch of people need to move to an area. Whether they’re tracking where major employers are building new offices or looking at public school enrollment data being ahead of the market gives big firms a big leg up.

And in case you were assuming that converting houses to rentals would flood the market and bring down rents don’t get your hopes up: As Invitation Homes tells its investors “We operate in markets with strong demand drivers high barriers to entry and high rent growth potential.”

While renting might make sense for some people especially people who move a lot it often sucks particularly in the United States where we don’t have especially strong protections for tenants. The business strategy of the country’s biggest landlords Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent does not seem to be “Make renting with us so delightful that if my tenants have to move cities they’ll specifically seek out another property owned by our company.” Based on reports from Reuters the New York Times and the Atlantic it appears to be closer to “Squeeze our tenants for every penny avoid making repairs let black mold and raw sewage accumulate and count on the fact that moving is a huge expensive hassle.”

Our current system of encouraging homeownership is by no means perfect and it places a lot of unnecessary risk onto the “balance sheets” of the middle class but it’s worked out financially for most of the people who have been lucky enough to own a home. The implicit and explicit subsidies the government has given to Americans buying their first homes have been the biggest handout the American middle class has ever received (a handout notably denied to Black Americans for much of the 20th century one explanation for the current size of the racial wealth gap).

Laurie Goodman vice president of housing finance policy at the Urban Institute points out that policymakers could take steps to level the playing field between investors and the rest of us. She told me that buyers who need to borrow money using Federal Housing Administration loans or those who need a rehab loan for a fixer-upper have a particularly tough time competing against Wall Street firms. FHA paperwork often gets delayed slowing down the purchase process so home sellers often don’t want to sell to FHA buyers even if their bids are competitive. That’s a solvable problem. And loans for properties that need renovations Goodman says are both cumbersome and expensive. Rethinking the processes for FHA and rehab loans could “put individuals on a more equal footing” she explained.

If you don’t want all of America’s land and housing to end up in the portfolios of the 1 percent there’s ultimately one very simple solution: Tax the rich. After all the companies buying the houses are ultimately owned by people (or in some cases universities and churches which are their own cans of tax-advantaged rich-people worms). At the same time that the working-class is going hungry rich people are doing so outstandingly well that they are running out of easy places to park their cash which is why they’re buying 2000 square-foot houses in the Phoenix suburbs via their ownership stakes in these funds.

This is all part of a long-standing trend: As inequality in the United States increases the financial elite invests less in the types of things that could create jobs like R&D or new factories and more into directly extracting wealth from the working class. One way to do that? Becoming their landlords.",,,,,,,,,,,,

St. Paul Ore. – A bucking horse who helped break a St. Paul Rodeo record in 2019 is back for this year’s rodeo.

Kool Toddy a 22-year-old brown mare owned by Flying Five Rodeo and Big Bend Rodeo Companies of Ritzville Wash. carried saddle bronc rider Cort Scheer to an 89 point ride a first place finish and a new arena record at the 2019 rodeo.

The mare who has paint markings on each side of her belly is an exceptional horse said Chad Hutsell one of her owners and caretakers along with Sonny Riley.

She’s bucked at the biggest rodeos across the nation he said. “She’s been to about every big rodeo there is on this side of the Mississippi River” including Rodeo Houston the Calgary Stampede Cloverdale British Columbia San Juan Capistrano Calif. and even pro rodeo’s biggest stage the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo where she’s been selected to work fifteen times.

For Scheer a six-time Wrangler NFR qualifier it wasn’t his first time aboard the horse.

“That horse has been amazing for years” he told the Pro Rodeo Sports News after his ride in 2019. “I’ve been on that horse four or five times now and she has been unbelievable every time.”

Hutsell said if saddle bronc riders don’t make a mistake she’ll carry them to a win. “But if they stub their toe they won’t do well.” He hasn’t kept track of how much money has been won riding Kool Toddy but it’s a lot. “I don’t know how many hundreds of thousands of dollars they’ve won on that mare but if you think of all the big rodeos she’s been to it’s a lot.”

Kool Toddy has been bucking since she was five years old and because of the excellent care given to her continues into her second decade. Hutsell will watch for signs from her before he retires her. “I let the horses tell me when they’re done (bucking)” he said. “And she’s not done. She still loves going and getting on the truck.”

Last year with rodeos canceled due to the pandemic bucking horses stayed home. But they missed being on the road Hutsell said and he could tell. One day a semi and trailer drove by the Hutsell ranch with the trailer rattling and getting their attention. “Half of the herd their heads popped up like do we get to go somewhere?”

Inside the rodeo arena she’s a great ride for cowboys. Outside she’s standoffish Hutsell said.

“She is not a people-person horse at all. She’ll wrinkle her nose when people come around.”

His and wife Lindsay’s fifteen-year-old son Bronc can attest to that. Last winter Kool Toddy and another bucking horse Spring Planting were stalled in the barn together. Every day Bronc took treats out to the horses; Spring Planting would eat her treat out of his hand; Kool Toddy would not. He persisted but she never changed her mind. “He’d set it down on the ground or on a fence post and she’d walk over and get it” Hutsell said.

Kool Toddy’s dam was Hot Toddy; her sire was Iron Mountain. When she retires she will become a brood mare.

The mare along with about 100 other head of bucking horses and bulls will compete at the St. Paul Rodeo held June 30-July 4. Performances begin nightly at 7:30 pm with a 1:30 pm matinee on July 4.

Tickets can be purchased online at StPaulRodeo.com; they range in price from $20-$26.

Marie Wood Ducks in a Gregg Johnson-Al Erickson Memorial Legion baseball Tournament game in Escanaba.

It was win number two of the day for the Wood Ducks as they also beat Hancock 9-5 in Gladstone.

“First of all you have to give credit to Dalton Graham” said Sault Ste. Marie manager Kris Bontrager. “He pitched a gem. He was dealing out there and everyone made the plays behind them.”

Graham pitched all seven innings for Sault Ste. Marie and had eight strikeouts and gave up just two hits for one earned run.

The game went scoreless through three innings before the Wood Ducks cracked things open with four runs in the fourth and a single from Michael Bontrager ushered Vinny Febles across the plate for the first Wood Ducks run of the game.

Michael Bontrager then scored when Matt Lumsden hit a sacrifice fly ball to centerfield.

Graham reached second on a throwing error to drive in Ethan Chambers and Avery Wilson.

Kris Bontrager noted Michael Bontrager’s performance as well.

“(He) had a couple of timely timely hits to start breaking some things open and get it going” he said. “Timely hitting defense and pitching is going to win you a lot of baseball games.”

Noah Lancour started atop the mound for the Cubs and pitched into the fourth before being replaced by Trent Lawson. Lawson was then relieved by Adam Willette and Willette by closer Drew Rodman.

Pitching-wise the Cubs allowed a total of four hits for seven runs. Defensively they tallied three errors.

“It’s not matching intensity” said Cubs manager Jon Bintner. “I don’t think we matched their intensity. The pitcher for the Sault pitched at Bay a little bit and he just wanted it more.

“I’m not saying that Noah pitched bad. He pitched a good game too and he gave us a chance to win and he hasn’t pitched much either. So for his first start I was happy with the way that went.”

Noah Lancour was also the sole run scored by Escanaba.

After leading off the bottom of the fifth with a double to left field he scooted to third on a passed ball and made it home when Willette reached first on a dropped third strike when the throw ricocheted off of first base.

Bintner added that base on balls and errors did not help the Cubs’ cause.

“The hit by pitches and walks; every time we put a guy on base they scored it seemed” he said. “And that’s baseball. You can’t walk a lead-off hitter. You’ve got to make them put the ball in play and it just seemed like the Sault made plays when they needed to.”

Escanaba is in action today hosting two games at Al Ness against Hancock at 4:30 p.m and Green Bay at 7:00 p.m.

Sault Ste. Marie sees Iron Mountain in Wells at 10:30 a.m. and Bark River in Escanaba at 1:30 p.m.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9rZW5vc2hhbmV3cy9uYW1lL3BhbWVsYS1kdXB1aXMtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MTEwNjQ1MTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pamela Dupuis Obituary (1967 - 2021) - Kenosha WI - Kenosha News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/kenoshanews/name/pamela-dupuis-obituary?id=11064517 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9rZW5vc2hhbmV3cy9uYW1lL3BhbWVsYS1kdXB1aXMtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MTEwNjQ1MTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkdnJpZGVyLmNvbS93b3JsZC1jbGFzcy1hZHYtcmlkaW5nLWFuZC13aHkteW91LXNob3VsZC1leHBsb3JlLWl0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,South Dakota / South Dakota: World Class ADV Riding // ADV,"This post was kindly sponsered by Get On! ADV Festival which ADVrider is participating in. The festival runs July 15-18 2021.

Headed for the Get On! ADV Rally? Held near legendary Sturgis South Dakota the Revzilla Get On! ADV Rally promises bike training demo rides farkles and just about everything in between. It’s a brand new event scheduled for mid-July and the rally will take place on the sacred Sturgis Rally grounds in Buffalo Chip Campground. RawHyde Adventures and ADV Woman will be offering adventure bike skill sessions and the organizers share there will be plenty of off-road riding wrenching new bike tests (including the Harley-Davidson Pan American) campfires and music.

To top it all off the Black Hills area in South Dakota is famous for its scenic rides so if you’re there for some jaw-dropping backcountry roads and off-road trails you’re in the right place. From hitting the local must-see spots like Mount Rushmore and Hood Tunnel to exploring the dirt trails in the Black Hills South Dakota has got it all. If you’re looking for some scenic ADV rides before during or after the Get On! ADV Rally here’s what’s not to miss along the way:

South Dakota Highlights

1. Keystone Mount Rushmore and Hood Tunnel Loop

If you’re riding South Dakota for the first time the Keystone – Mount Rushmore loop is the perfect intro into what the Black Hills have to offer. This 200-mile ride packs a serious punch in terms of twists and curves and there are several points of interest to hit along the way.

Starting in Keystone top up your gas and have some hearty lunch – the Red Garter Saloon in Keystone is one of the favorite motorcycle stops or you can grab some food in any of the Western style restaurants along the main street. Chances are there’ll be dozens of bikes parked in front so you’re guaranteed to chat to some like-minded souls before heading off.

Jumping on Route 244 (aha the Iron Mountain Road) you’ll begin seeing some curves and twists and soon enough you’ll see Mount Rushmore the iconic giant sculpture of the four American presidents carved into the living rock. If you’re up for stretching your legs a little there’s a large parking lot at Mount Rushmore where you can leave your bike and explore the Memorial on foot. If you forgot your caffeine in Keystone there’s a café at Mount Rushmore to get your fill.

Next up is Needles Highway: before turning North on Route 385 take a quick detour on Route 87 to enjoy some narrow mountain twisties and see Hood Tunnel where the road cuts into a massive granite rock. This road is insanely scenic but beware of other traffic – Needles Highway is very popular among other travelers so it’s best ridden earlier in the day to avoid crowds.

After Hood Tunnel you can continue on route 87 and loop towards Custer and back; this section of route 87 offers up rugged mountain scenery and a serious amount of curves. If you don’t have the time to explore double back North and continue on Route 385 towards Hill City then Deerfield Road and Mystic Road toward Rochford crossing the Black Hills National Forest. Out here the road twists and turns through ponderosa pine forests and granite rock formations and you may even spot wild bison ifd you’re lucky. Past Englewood head to Cheyenne Crossing and ride route 14 for some more curves then turn to Deadwood and take route 385 back to Keystone.

Along the way there’ll be plenty of scenic lookout points local eateries and generous Back Hills scenery to enjoy; if you have the time explore the network of smaller backcountry routes crisscrossing the Black Hills National Forest just be sure to get gas whenever you can – some of these roads are pretty remote.

2. Bighorn Pass

If you’re up for a longer ride the Bighorn Pass in nearby Wyoming is a must-see. Located some 250 miles West of Sturgis Bighorn Mountains offer some spectacular scenery and a road that feels like it’s been built with motorcycle riders in mind.

Starting in Sturgis ride West to Dayton in Wyoming. Be sure to stop for some gas and food. Then jump on Route 14 aka the Bighorn Scenic Byway. This road cuts across the Bighorn Mountains wilderness in a tumble of switchbacks sharp corners and steep climbs. Out here it may be tempting to really lean into the corners but go easy on the throttle – wildlife in the Bighorns is abundant and you’ll probably spot moose elk or deer wandering into the road.

If you’re planning to stay in the area Sibley Lake has a campground on the lakeside. Bear in mind that the Bighorns see cooler temperatures even during the summer months – Granite Pass is at an elevation of over 9000 feet so layer up as the weather will be chillier at high altitude.

To make the most of the jaw-dropping Bighorn National Forest scenery and roads loop back to South Dakota via the Southern Route 16 another stunning mountain road skirting the edge of the Forest. This is a bigger road leading towards Buffalo but its wide fast bends might be an excellent choice if you want to ride back to Sturgis and make the distance while enjoying those generous curves.

3. Sturgis – Savoy Loop

Doing long distances during the Get On! ADV Rally may not be an option for everyone so if you’re just looking for short scenic rides in the area the Sturgis – Savoy loop is a great route to check out in half a day. Route 14 between Savoy and Spearfish is among the most scenic stretches of road in the area and there are plenty of lookout points to stop along the way. Spruce forests granite walls waterfalls and wildlife abound here and the road twists and knots in some big sweeping curves along every mile.

Spearfish is also a great place to stay to avoid crowds – there are motorcycle-friendly lodges available and the quiet mountain scenery is perfect for exploring on two wheels. If you have the time and the energy there are plenty of hiking trails around; alternatively you can ride some dirt on Route 222 cutting through the Black Hills into Wyoming and returning on Highway 90 back to Spearfish to save time. Spearfish makes for a great basecamp if you’re staying in the area before of after the ADV rally.

4. Black Hills Off-Road

Speaking of dirt: there is no shortage of off-road trails in the Black Hills so if you’re looking to leave tarmac head for Hill City and take your pick: from graded dirt roads to rocky trails the entire Black Hills National Forest offers plenty of dirt riding. You can follow old logging roads across the woods find some steep climbs and enjoy the breathtaking mountain scenery around every mile; it’s perfect if you’re aboard a dirt bike or a smaller dual sport but might be trickier on large adventure bikes as some trails get muddy. To find the best off-road trails in the Black Hills it’s best to ask around the Park Ranger stations – the locals will be able to point you in the right direction. Some trails may require a permit depending on the area.

Black Hills has some of the best off-road riding in entire South Dakota so even if you can only spare a day make sure to test your tires on local dirt; if you’re unsure about riding the trails alone there’ll be plenty of riders to buddy up with at the get On! ADV Rally. To spruce up your skills beforehand sign up to the off-road training classes at the event – we hear RawHyde is preparing some amazing courses and drills for all skill levels and bikes.

Rapid City – Sturgis via Nemo

Another quick loop for a day’s ride the Nemo route offers some more rugged South Dakota scenery and plenty of curves. From Rapid City jump on Nemo Road heading North and enjoy the twisties – there will be plenty of fast bends and from Nemo onwards the Vanocker Canyon Road is where you can really open up that throttle enjoying a stunning mountain road with big generous curves. The Vanocker Canyon Road will deposit you back in Sturgis and from here you can add the Spearfish – Savoy loop or head back South through Rochford and into the Black Hills National Forest adding Mount Rushmore and Hood Tunnel before returning back.

This route is very popular among motorcyclists so you won’t have the place to yourself but the area is so scenic it’s more than worth sharing the road.

6. Yellowstone National Park

If you’re coming to Get On! ADV Rally from the West or if you have several more days to spare consider adding Yellowstone National Park to your itinerary. One of the oldest and most iconic National parks in the country Yellowstone offers scenery that’s simply out of this world – from crazy-colored landscapes and geysers to herds of free-roaming bison and stunning mountain landscapes Yellowstone is a must-see if you’re new in the area. Yellowstone s also easily accessible by motorcycle: the entire figure-of-eight loop across the Park can be ridden in a day. Along the way you’ll see the Old Faithful geyser the thermal springs the otherworldly rock formations and the lava fields. Yellowstone is so vast you can easily spend several days riding around and there are lodging options if you’re planning to stay.

Alternatively you can pair the South Dakota – Yellowstone adventure with the nearby Beartooth Pass. Beartooth Pass located between Wyoming and Montana is an adrenaline-inducing road climbing to over 10900 feet of elevation and offering some seriously steep grades and lots of switchbacks along the way. Starting in Cooke City – Silver Gate follow the Beartooth Highway climbing higher and higher until you reach the Beartooth Pass Vista Point revealing the rugged sometimes snow-capped (even in the summer) peaks of the mountains. Then continue East toward Red Lodge enjoying the road knotting itself up in hairpins and twists; Red Lodge an old bootlegging town offers several lunch options a good stop before resuming your journey East towards South Dakota.

On the other hand Beartooth Highway is probably a lot more fun riding East to West as this way you will be climbing rather than descending. Then again depending on where you’re going – to or from South Dakota – Beartooth is worth is either way as the scenery here is so wild and rugged it’s a must-see.

7. Badlands National Park

If Yellowstone is too far the South Dakota Badlands may be the next best thing. Located just 86 miles East of Sturgis Badlands is an incredibly stunning area boasting otherworldly rock formations and a landscape that resembles the surface of the Moon. Easily accessible via scenic local roads – Route 240 cuts straight across the heart of the Badlands National Park – and just a day’s ride from Sturgis the Badlands is the perfect getaway for a day or two exploring the colorful rock formations.

Whether you’re looking for short rides around Sturgis for the Get On! ADV Rally or hoping to explore South Dakota over longer distances be sure to pack both sunscreen and a warmer layer. In July the temperatures will be hot and the sun intense but at higher elevations an extra layer won’t hurt. As the entire area is extremely popular among motorcycle riders it’s best to book lodging in advance and research campgrounds if you plan to camp out – it can get busy during the summer months. Finally beware of animals on the roads especially following the smaller narrower mountain routes: Black Hills is brimming with wildlife so keep your eyes peeled especially at dusk.

Special to The Stockton Record

This Father’s Day in my imagination I see my Dad bellied-up to a white linen-covered table at The Tadich Grill in San Francisco a repast of jumbo shrimp before him a golden highball in one hand and a cigarette in the other. To complete this happy vision I see his two best Five and Dime buddies beside him Clem Whalley the retired manager of downtown Stockton’s Woolworth Department Store and Darrel Foote the original proprietor of Foote’s Variety on the Miracle Mile.

During his working life my father Fred Jacobs owned and operated three variety stores in town. He first opened Country Club Variety on County Club Boulevard in 1947. Next came Jakes Variety in Lincoln Center in 1966 and then Foote’s Variety purchased in 1968. In February and August of each year Dad and his friends would travel to the San Francisco Gift Show to purchase merchandise for their stores.

Each trip always included a cab ride to The Tadich Grill on California Street for supper.

Once home at our own dinner table Dad’s talk was about his meals at “Tadich’s” never much about the gift show itself although he did complain vociferously about Market Street being “all torn up” because of something being built underground called BART.

Eventually Dad did get to see why there had been so much construction on Market Street. Once after he retired he asked me what I wanted for my birthday. I told him I wanted to go to San Francisco with him on BART to see an exhibit at the DeYoung Museum. On the train ride he seemed a little disconcerted especially through the tunnel under the Bay. I don’t think he ever fully regained his composure until we emerged into the sunlight above the Van Ness station where he reflexively raised his arm to signal for a cab. He even arranged with the cabbie to pick us up from the DeYoung to take us to Tadich’s for dinner. I’m not sure I had ever seen him more in his element.

Dinner that afternoon was something of a dream father and son feasting together in one of San Francisco’s most fabled eating establishments not a care in the world only anticipation for the stories we could tell Mom and sis once we arrived home.

That was our last trip together. He died of heart failure in January of 1992. Years would pass before I’d get back to Tadich’s for old-time’s sake. After paying the bill I stopped at the maître-d’s “ambo” and told the fellow stationed there how The Tadich Grill was my father’s favorite restaurant how he had dined there twice a year while attending the Gift Show and how he had talked up “Tadich’s” to his friends and relatives.

“Oh yes” said the maître d. “I remember him!”

“Oh no you don’t!” I thought after a split-second of happy belief. “You are feeding me a line.”

But oh what a line! With one throw-away sentence this restauranteur conjured for me my father at the white linen-covered table the jumbo shrimp the highball glass the cigarette and with him his two best five and dime buddies.

This Father’s Day a son missing his Dad can’t ask for much more than that.

Is there a situation in which he wouldn't pitch that day?

“If I feel terrible (Sunday) which I don’t anticipate that"" he said on the field at Nationals Park before Saturday's doubleheader against Washington. ""I think we’ll just see how tomorrow feels and go from there.""

DeGrom said he believes he injured his right shoulder on a swing and miss he had — at the plate — in the second inning against Cubs starter Robert Stock in Wednesday's game. He took a hefty cut at a fastball up and away in that inning then felt right shoulder soreness on the mound in the top of the third.

""I guess I'll have to take"" deGrom said of future at-bats.

This might not be so easy for a guy who not only loves hitting but is batting .423 this season. He has driven in more runs (six) than he has allowed (four).

Priorities though.

“I think the main thing is to be healthy and be out there on the mound so it’s probably not smart to go out there and swing like I have been swinging"" deGrom said.

DeGrom on Saturday threw around 20 pitches in an in-between-starts bullpen session. He threw a light 10-pitch bullpen on Friday. He's going about his routine like he would before any start.

This time though there's no guarantee he will pitch — even if it seems likely he will.

DeGrom has dealt with multiple injuries this season including right lat tightness right side tightness and right flexor tendinitis.

Then came the right shoulder soreness which he felt in the back of his shoulder.

""I normally get sore back there when I pitch but not during the game"" deGrom said. ""I think I aggravated it and then was feeling it when I was on the mound so felt like that was the right move to say something. Feeling it and throwing is not ideal because you don’t want to change your mechanics and end up injuring something else.""

Mets' starting pitchers dominating:These 3 numbers prove it

Last night:NY Mets lose to Nationals 1-0 as walk-off hit spoils Joey Lucchesi's good start

The Mets are saying deGrom's injuries are all isolated incidents. The ace said he and the team discussed going on the injured list again — he's already been on it once this season — to rest up and make sure everything is healthy.

However that no longer is a possibility because deGrom's shoulder has progressed well. He's not feeling any abnormal soreness. His routine has gone well.

The Mets feel fortunate none of deGrom's injuries has been too serious.

“It’s definitely pleasant to hear that there’s not (anything serious)"" manager Luis Rojas said. ""As soon as you hear of each (injury) in that very instant you get concerned. But once you talk to the trainers and the trainers do their tests the level of concern has gone down in all three cases immediately.""

Jeff McNeil back on Monday

Jeff McNeil (hamstring strain) is expected to be activated before one of the games in Monday's doubleheader Rojas said.

Initially the Mets felt he might return Sunday. He will not join the team until a day later though.

He's the team's starting second baseman but he could see time in left field too.

Reinforcements:Is Jacob deGrom going to stay healthy? If not Mets must target these 3 pitchers

Mets trade Barnes

The Mets designated right-handed reliever Jacob Barnes for assignment on Monday. Before he cleared waivers they traded him to acquire minor-league righty Troy Miller from Toronto.

The 24-year-old Miller has made six starts (but has appeared in seven games between Double A and High A this season. He has a 4.93 ERA with 15 walks and 33 strikeouts.

Barnes had a 6.27 ERA over 18 2/3 innings before the Mets designated him for assignment. In his final game he allowed back-to-back home runs to Fernando Tatis Jr. and Manny Machado in a loss to the Padres.

The seven-inning doubleheaders

The Mets are becoming familiar with the seven-inning doubleheaders thanks to the COVID-19 season in 2020 and this year's weather.

On Friday Rojas said he likes them. He hopes they stay because they help teams keep players healthy and having short games promotes pace of play.

On Saturday Francisco Lindor also praised them.

""They’re better than those nine-inning doubleheaders for sure"" Lindor said. ""They are better. It was a long journey when those two nine-inning games were in play. ...For people at home that might not like it come play shortstop play 18 innings and if you go extra innings. Come play and you let me know. I know I get paid a lot of money but it still wears out.

Rojas said he hasn't recently talked to players about how they feel about them. He did reference a conversation he had with deGrom about them last season though.

“He thought that a seven-inning complete game wasn’t a complete game"" Rojas said. ""He just didn’t like it.""

Rojas though doesn't know if deGrom has changed his mind this season.

Luis Rojas on father's lessons

Ahead of Father's Day Rojas was asked what his father Felipe Alou has taught him. Alou of course is a former manager and beloved baseball man.

“My father has been my university of life — not only of baseball"" Rojas said. ""But he’s taught me a lot of things about baseball and life. He taught me how to be a good son he taught me how to be a good father he taught me how to be a good baseball man.

""More than anything he always raised us with the word of God. He wanted all of us to be humble he wanted us to be good men even before baseball men. That’s probably the biggest advice that he’s always given me is to be the same person on and off the uniform.""

The former prime minister was initially told by polling station staff he would not be allowed to vote in the police and crime commissioner election in South Oxfordshire without proving his identity.

The misstep was embarrassing for Johnson because the requirement to bring photo ID is a stipulation of the Elections Act he introduced in 2022 while in Downing Street.

The Electoral Commission has warned that hundreds of thousands of people could be excluded from voting because of the law which it said could have a disproportionate effect on some groups.

A source close to Johnson confirmed he had forgotten the photo ID but did later vote. “Mr Johnson voted Conservative” a spokesperson added. Earlier on Thursday he had posted on X: “The polls are now open. Vote Conservative!”

It came after the veterans minister apologised to former military personnel who were prevented from using their veterans ID to vote in the local elections in England.

Downing Street said it would “look into” changing the controversial rules which require photo ID in order to vote to allow veterans’ ID cards on to the list of valid identification.

The minister Johnny Mercer was responding to a complaint from a veteran who said he had been turned away at a polling station. “I am sorry about this. The legislation on acceptable forms of ID came out before the veterans ID cards started coming out in January this year. I will do all I can to change it before the next one” Mercer tweeted.

A government spokesperson said it was the intention to add the veterans’ card to the list of accepted ID and that defence identity cards for serving armed forces members were already accepted. “We are already consulting on this” they said.

Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson said earlier that Downing Street had no concerns about voter ID more generally adding: “We don’t want to see anyone turned away from polling stations we want everyone to be able to vote. Experience from the last local elections was that 99.75% of people were able to cast their vote successfully.”

Ministers have faced significant criticism over the limited number of acceptable forms of ID particularly the decision to allow documents such as the older person’s bus pass but almost none issued to younger ones such as other travel passes and student documents.

The Electoral Commission warned last year that it was difficult to assess the consequences of requiring photo ID before voting.

It said the laws could have a disproportionate effect on poorer people those with disabilities and people from minority ethnic backgrounds and that the disfranchising effect of the law was very likely to be proportionately greater in a general election.

Among people who did not vote in May last year 4% said this was because of voter ID. If this figure went up to 5% it could mean about 800000 people staying away from the polls at a general election.

A Tory MP was among those caught out by the voter ID requirement as polls opened for the local elections in England and Wales. The Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said his dyspraxia was the reason he had lost his documents.

Hunt sent a message to his local Conservative WhatsApp group stating: “Bit of drama. Turns out I have no appropriate ID to vote tomorrow. There is an emergency proxy option if you lose your ID … who would like the honours?”

But Hunt said it was inappropriate for Labour and social media users to mock him for misplacing his documents given his developmental coordination disorder.

“I don’t want to blame everything on my dyspraxia but it’s a factor in my life I have to deal with” he told the Evening Standard. “It’s all well and good people saying we need to have more neurodiverse members of parliament but having a massive pile-on on them I don’t think it’s going to encourage more people.”

The Electoral Commission said “most voters” were able to cast their ballots despite the ID requirements.

“Our initial assessment of the elections is that they were well run and millions of voters were able to exercise their democratic rights” a spokesperson said. “This is a testament to the efforts of electoral administrators who work tirelessly to ensure the smooth delivery and integrity of polls.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL2R3YXluZS1qb2huc29uLXJlZC1vbmUtbGF0ZS1idWRnZXQtcHJvYmxlbXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Dwayne Johnson's $250 Million Red One Went Off Track,"For more than two decades Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has nurtured a reputation as a hard-working musclebound action-comedy movie star with considerable box-office drawing power.

Zeeland-based Herman Miller Inc. in April shocked the industry when it announced it would purchase long-time competitor Knoll Inc. in a $1.8 billion cash-and-stock deal.

The pending deal which is up for shareholder votes at both companies on July 13 was the result of back-and-forth proposals that began in December 2020 and nearly fell apart because of eleventh-hour renegotiations just four days before news of the merger became public.

A prospectus filed in late May with federal securities regulators included a thorough record of the deal-making process outlining both major — and seemingly minor — meetings negotiations and discussions.

One West Michigan-based securities attorney who regularly reviews filings of this nature told MiBiz the uncharacteristically robust S-4 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission contained the longest background section he had ever read.

Meanwhile the blockbuster deal developed several months into a global pandemic that threatened to shake the foundation of the office furniture industry as employees worked remotely en masse. As shareholders at both companies prepare to vote on the deal Herman Miller now seeks to address any new dynamics that may emerge.

“This shows a lot of confidence by Herman Miller in the future of the furniture industry which is an industry that was hit significantly by COVID in general” said Elisa Berger vice president of Grand Rapids-based M&A and investment banking firm Charter Capital Partners which specializes in working with clients in the contract furniture space.

“Ask someone in March or April of 2020 what the office furniture industry was going to look like in the next five years and I don’t think anyone would be confident in their answer” Berger said. “For me this is a signal that Herman Miller sees a future in this industry.”

Knoll receives a lifeline

The prospectus detailed efforts by Knoll executives and its board of directors to deal with the economic hardships brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic even before Herman Miller entered the picture. In April 2020 just a month into the pandemic Knoll’s board determined that the company could potentially be in an uncomfortable liquidity position by the end of the year possibly in violation of its financial covenants.

Despite cost-cutting measures East Greenville Pa.-based Knoll saw that its worst-case scenario emerged as the most likely trajectory. At a May 5 board meeting the company’s internal auditors resolved to include a going concern warning in Knoll’s next quarterly report indicating the grave uncertainty over the company’s future.

But the office furniture maker would find a lifeline in European investment firm Investindustrial Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: IIAC) which owns a portfolio of businesses in the health care technology and manufacturing sectors. In fact Knoll rebuffed a previous attempt by Investindustrial and a sponsoring company to purchase Knoll through an all-cash offer in January 2019. Knoll declined at the time claiming the price didn’t match the company’s intrinsic value.

The investment group which would factor into the eventual Herman Miller deal later purchased 4 percent of the outstanding shares of Knoll’s common stock and provided a standing offer to serve as a source of financing for Knoll if needed.

In time Knoll took Investindustrial up on that offer for financing closing in July 2020 on a $164 million investment agreement in which Investindustrial acquired 164000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock. The Knoll board believed the investment would fortify the company’s balance sheet enhance its ability to execute on its strategic plan in the uncertain economic environment and explore other opportunities that might arise according to the prospectus.

Herman Miller pursues deal

Herman Miller laid the groundwork for the blockbuster deal during a regularly scheduled meeting with members of the company’s management team and representatives from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. its long-time financial adviser.

At an Oct. 12 board meeting Herman Miller management and Goldman Sachs personnel presented a financial analysis of Herman Miller’s potential acquisition of Knoll. The board asked executives to reach out to Knoll and explore a potential deal.

Eight days later Herman Miller formed a board subcommittee to consider the potential acquisition of Knoll and met to discuss the strategic rationale for the potential deal and to review deal terms.

Herman Miller President and CEO Andi Owen also called Knoll CEO Andrew Cogan to discuss a potential business combination. During the call Owen shared her great respect for Knoll and that she believed there was a “compelling strategic logic” to bring the two companies together given their complementary product portfolios similar digital initiatives and shared commitment to design according to the filing.

This ushered in a volley of proposals that started in December of last year beginning with an all-stock offer that failed to ignite negotiations.

After Owen and Cogan spoke by phone on Dec. 18 Owen delivered a non-binding proposal to Cogan that called for the exchange of 0.5 shares of Herman Miller common stock for each share of Knoll common stock. The offer implied an enterprise value for Knoll of $1.42 billion and Knoll shareholders would own approximately 30 percent of the combined company. Herman Miller’s proposal also indicated the company’s belief that the proposed business combination would yield $80 million to $100 million in annual synergies.

Knoll turned down the offer calling it “sufficiently distant” on price and saying the company would not engage in further discussions according to the filing.

However a determined Herman Miller was able to spark discussions on Feb. 1 of this year with a second proposal: A cash-and-stock offer that called for the exchange of $11 in cash and 0.32 shares of Herman Miller common stock for each share of Knoll common stock implying a $1.65 billion enterprise value for Knoll. In that deal Knoll’s shareholders would then own 22 percent of the combined company.

While Knoll’s board found the second offer to be insufficient it opted to pursue discussions on the rationale for the proposed transaction. That led to a Feb. 25 teleconference meeting involving representatives from both sides including Cogan and Owen. Both parties resolved to go back to their boards to continue considering a potential transaction.

Knoll issued a counterproposal in early March that placed a $1.91 billion enterprise value on the company before a third proposal by Herman Miller pushed negotiations to the due diligence phase. This March 12 proposal included $11.50 in cash and 0.33 shares of Herman Miller stock per share of Knoll common stock in a deal valued at $1.82 billion.

Knoll also communicated with its previous suitor Investindustrial to see if the investment group still had any interest in acquiring Knoll. Representatives from Investindustrial conceded that they would not be able to submit an offer that would prove competitive with a strategic buyer’s bid that would offer significant synergies. However Investindustrial did say it would support such a deal as long as it was consistent with its view of Knoll’s fair value.

A deal in peril

The deal nearly died roughly one month into the due diligence process when concerns arose during a special meeting with the Herman Miller board and its advisers. Herman Miller had discovered that Knoll’s internal projections and other findings throughout the due diligence process “would increase integration costs above what the Herman Miller team had expected or otherwise limit the achievable synergies in unanticipated ways.”

On April 14 Owen contacted Cogan to inform him certain value assumptions made by Herman Miller had not been supported by due diligence and instructed representatives from Goldman Sachs to reach out to Jeffrey Harris lead director of Knoll’s board with those same concerns.

Goldman Sachs representatives told Harris that Herman Miller’s estimates on short-term cash flows the timing of synergies resulting from combining the businesses and other matters differed from the actual findings meriting a downward adjustment of $3.20 per share even though Herman Miller wasn’t necessarily proposing that exact price reduction.

The late-game renegotiation proved to be a deal breaker: The Knoll board voted unanimously on April 14 to shut off Herman Miller’s access to a virtual information room and cease negotiations while instructing Herman Miller to return or destroy all information provided by Knoll.

In an email to Goldman Sachs representatives Harris wrote: “Knoll was not looking for a buyer and would only consider a potential transaction if the process would be expedited with minimal distraction for the Knoll Board and Knoll management and if the value to Knoll’s stockholders was sufficiently compelling.”

After seeing its concerns rebuffed Herman Miller submitted a revised proposal on April 15 which Knoll rejected leading to another call between Cogan and Owen. Cogan expressed that the “back and forth had not been received well by the Knoll board.”

Owen contacted Cogan later that day with a “best and final offer” of $11 in cash and 0.32 shares of Herman Miller common stock for each share of Knoll common stock to push the deal’s value back up to $1.82 billion.

On April 15 Knoll’s board of directors unanimously voted to accept the proposal.

With the deal Herman Miller also will buy outstanding shares of Knoll’s preferred stock from Investindustrial for $253 million in cash or $25.06 per share. Investindustrial which aggressively lobbied directly with Herman Miller throughout the proceedings for preferred stock as opposed to cash agreed to vote its shares in favor of the deal.

Effects at home

Herman Miller clearly didn’t land a COVID discount on the purchase of Knoll whose stock bottomed out at just less than $9 per share in April 2020 in the early stages of the pandemic. The stock eventually recovered to $19 per share in March 2021 and jumped 35 percent upon the merger announcement. Herman Miller’s stock dropped around 8 percent upon the announcement but has since rebounded.

While it remains unclear how the combined business would address redundancies in function the local region is positioned well to benefit from the merger according to Jennifer Owens president of economic development firm Lakeshore Advantage.

“It’s always great to be the home for the company that is acquiring versus one being acquired” said Owens whose organization focuses on helping companies grow in both Allegan and Ottawa counties.

“That I think puts our community in a better position and the leadership and headquarters will still remain here with Andi Owen as the head of the new consolidated business” Owens said.

Lakeshore Advantage’s two-county jurisdiction has seen additional blockbuster deals in the past. In 1996 Johnson Controls Inc. acquired Holland-based Prince Automotive a manufacturer of products for auto interiors from the Prince Holding Corp. for $1.35 billion. In 2019 Tokyo-based Hitachi Ltd. purchased custom automation systems provider JR Automation for $1.42 billion.

“In those cases we’re really working to build relationships with the out-of-state and out-of-country headquarters and making sure we’re more than just a dot on the map and they understand the value proposition of West Michigan and that we want to be that company’s partner in growth” Owens said.

Owens also said that the community at large would benefit from serving as the home base for the newly crowned leader in office furniture.

“I think it definitely increases the awareness of our community as a place to grow design and make products” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Goldman Sachs Group Inc which has opened its US offices to staff this week has told its UK staff in a memo that working at its London office is voluntary for now. Those who opt to attend office will observe strict social distancing and mask-wearing. The bank says plans of allowing a full workforce are postponed until July.

JPMorgan Chase & Co too sent a memo postponing openings its offices until July. A majority of its US office workers will be rejoining next month.

The investment banks were planning to bring back staff on rotational basis capped at 50 percent occupancy. Both the banks already had 20-30 percent staff working out of offices with proper protocol in place. Hence they are well equipped by now to entertain more numbers with proper distancing and other norms in place.

The banks believe that delaying the reopening till July 19 in the UK will give a chance to all personnel to get fully vaccinated. Currently about 41 million people have received their first shot and nearly 30 million have had both doses – about 57% of the adult population in the country.

The majority of Goldman Sachs employees have “either had their first dose (of the vaccine) or expect to receive it before Monday 21 June” Richard Gnodde head of Goldman Sachs International wrote in his memo to staff.

Bank bosses are split over whether staff should come back to the office full-time or work from home for some or all days of the week. Goldman Sachs’ group chief executive David Solomon has described working from home as “an aberration”.

NatWest chief executive Alison Rose said the bank would hold conversations with staff over the summer about what options they want. “I would say that we’ve busted the myth that jobs need to be done in a certain way” she previously told staff. “We have learnt new ways of working and it’s important we carry those learnings forward.”

Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman speaking at a conference earlier this week said that it’s time for the bank’s New York workers to head back to the office now that more people are getting vaccinated. “If you can go to a restaurant in New York City you can come into the office. And we want you in the office” Gorman said. He added that “well over 90%” of employees already had received Covid-19 shots and that he expected that number to eventually reach 98% to 99%.

Barclays Bank said that it expected to “invite” more staff back to the office over the summer but said it was “moving towards a hybrid way of working”.

Barclays chief Jes Staley had previously said home working was “not sustainable” for large financial institutions.

The nonprofit announced on Friday its successful entrance into phase four of extensive renovations to Milwaukee's beloved movie palace.

What You Need To Know With help from more than 900 contributors the multi-million dollar restoration project is one step closer to its 2021 debut



The Oriental Theater opens in time for the Cultures and Communities Festival in early September

With help from more than 900 contributors the multi-million-dollar restoration project is one step closer to its 2021 debut.

Cinema manager Ryan Putskey showed off some of those changes which include the addition of glass donor signage in the main lobby balcony restoration and plaster repair to the ceilings..

""I'm looking forward to getting people in here so that they can see it and experience it and you know not only see this theater in all this 1927 glory with these new modern amenities that are going to make it so much better"" he says.

​Putskey says they plan to have the oriental theater open in time for the Cultures and Communities Festival in early September.

While in the current midst of phase four of five total updates include the addition of glass donor signage in the main lobby and balcony restoration including plaster damage repair which has been textured to match the historic surface restoration of the ceiling while preserving the historic color and decorative elements and cove light replacement.

Once the scaffolding is removed from the balcony seating handrails lighting a hearing loop and much more will be incorporated into the area.

To date since the summer of 2020 other phases of restoration have included replacing seats and carpeting improving sightlines and sound quality restoring plaster on the ceiling and walls and beginning the process for installation of a 1925 Wurlitzer theater organ.

The energy industry is going through a major transition as the global economy switches fuel sources. However this pivot toward cleaner power will take decades and trillions of dollars in investment. Given the size and duration of this megatrend both traditional energy stocks and those focused on cleaner alternatives could generate strong returns for years to come.

Three energy companies in an excellent position to produce market-beating total returns over the coming years are Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.84%) Enbridge (ENB 0.35%) and Brookfield Renewable (BEP 2.49%) (BEPC 2.53%). Here's why our energy contributors like this trio's potential to outperform.

Big strong and diversified in this vital energy niche

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Enterprise Products Partners): The midstream sector is deeply out of favor today because of its position helping move energy from where it is drilled to where it eventually is used. But don't count this industry niche out. Sure energy majors are selling assets but someone is buying them and the acquirer will continue to operate them. That means the need for midstream companies is still there.

Master limited partnership Enterprise Products Partners sets itself apart from the pack because of its size and financial strength. Its $55 billion market cap makes it one of the biggest midstream names in North America with a portfolio of assets that is both diversified and likely irreplaceable. Meanwhile its 4.1 ratio of financial debt to EBITDA is toward the low end of the industry (right where it has historically lived) and signifies a strong balance sheet. And it covered its distribution by a hefty 1.7 times in the first quarter.

These are important facts because they suggest that Enterprise can muddle through whatever headwinds exist today while still paying investors well for sticking around. But it also means that Enterprise can be a consolidator in the midstream space should ground-up growth opportunities permanently stall. So even if things stay tough in the industry Enterprise will still have ample opportunity to outperform.

This Dividend Aristocrat is built to last

Neha Chamaria (Enbridge): Three factors can broadly dictate whether an oil and gas company can outperform the market in the long run: cash-flow generating capability dividend track record and growth plans. Enbridge passes the test on each count.

To begin midstream oil and gas companies are best poised to ride out the volatility in oil prices as they primarily store process and transport hydrocarbons like crude natural gas and natural gas liquids. And therefore they can generate steady cash flows unlike oil producing companies even when oil prices are low. Enbridge which operates the world's longest transportation network accounts for nearly 40% of the total crude oil imports in the U.S. and is Canada's largest natural-gas utility.

Thanks to predictable cash flows not only has Enbridge increased its dividend for 26 straight years but it has also grown that payout at a solid annual compound rate of 10% over the period. You only have to see one chart to understand how Enbridge's dividend growth is behind the stock's massive total returns that have beaten the market handsomely in the past couple of decades.

There's little chance Enbridge's streak of annual dividend increases will be broken anytime soon given the potential rise in global demand for energy. Enbridge is also investing in renewable energy and projects that its distributable cash flow (DCF) per share will grow at a compound annual rate of 5% to 7% through 2023 driven largely by its multibillion-dollar capital spending plans. As DCF grows so should dividends which should be reflected in the stock price of this 6.8%-yielding energy Dividend Aristocrat.

This wealth creator has plenty of power to continue enriching investors

Matt DiLallo (Brookfield Renewable): Brookfield Renewable has a long history of outperforming the market. The leading global renewable energy producer has generated 20% compound annual returns since its inception. That has significantly outpaced the S&P 500's 7% annualized total return during that time frame.

Powering that strong performance has been Brookfield's ability to grow shareholder value. The company has expanded its funds from operations (FFO) at a more than 10% compound annual rate on a per-share basis over the past decade by steadily growing its renewable energy portfolio. That's given it the power to increase its dividend at a 6% yearly pace since 2012.

Brookfield's future is even brighter. The company estimates it can organically grow its FFO per share by 6% to 11% per year through at least 2025. Powering that forecast is rising power rates and its vast pipeline of high-return renewable energy projects. On top of that Brookfield believes future acquisitions could add as much as 9% of additional incremental FFO per share each year. That should give it plenty of power to grow its 3%-yielding dividend at a 5% to 9% yearly rate.

Brookfield could continue growing FFO and its dividend at strong rates for decades to come given what's ahead for the renewable energy megatrend. This powerful combination of growth and yield could help fuel exceptional total returns for Brookfield's investors in the coming years.",,,,,,,,,

(KR) earnings digest and more.

Why should the food industry pay more attention to PPI than CPI?

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the most well-known indicator of inflation and “changes in CPI” and “changes in inflation” are usually synonymous. However in the current economic environment the Producer Price Index (PPI) is a far more important indicator of inflation than CPI. Let’s take a look at the underlying reasoning and some key areas that the food industry should watch closely.

How does PPI differ from CPI?

PPI differs from CPI in two critical areas: 1) composition of the basket and 2) price differences

Composition of the basket: PPI encompasses the entire domestic output including purchases by producers retailers consumers and everything in between. Imports are excluded. CPI only considers consumption of U.S. urban households. It does include imports.

Price differences: Price of an item in PPI reflects revenue received by its producer net of taxes. It is more correlated with cost of production. Price of an item in CPI reflects consumer expenditure which includes taxes and implicitly margins of all the intermediaries.



Research shows that PPI is a better indicator of inflationary cycles in the new millennium

Historically CPI and PPI were highly correlated but since 2000 the correlation has fallen substantially. In a recent NBER paper economists from Columbia University provided a structural explanation of the divergence. Over the past two decades offshoring international trades and technology became more important in the global supply chain. Research suggests that the decline in correlation of the two measures is likely to be permanent in this new world economic regime and PPI rather than CPI is a better indicator of inflationary cycles. As such PPI should be the targeting variable in monetary policies.

Key areas of inflation that the food industry should pay close attention to

The tables below show the latest PPI datapoints and food price outlook by USDA-WASDE and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Several commodities are expected to experience significant inflation in 2021: soybeans wheat and pork.

Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics PPI (not seasonally adjusted) and forecasts by USDA.. A negative sign indicates an adjustment downward and a plus sign indicates an adjustment upward.

Domestic and international demand for soybeans remains high as the global economy recovers. China the world’s biggest buyer of soybeans more than tripled its import of U.S. soybeans this year. The rise of plant-based foods increased domestic consumption. USDA predicts farm-level soybean prices to increase 48.5% to 51.5% in 2021. The rising price of soybeans should also lead to price increases for wholesale fats and oils which are expected to rise 16.5% to 19.5%.

Pork exports are expected to increase ~20% relative to pre-pandemic levels. USDA data showed strong shipments to Mexico Canada as well as to Central and South America. Wholesale pork prices are predicted to increase 8.5% to 11.5%.

Tight stocks and lower-than-expected production levels are expected to boost wheat prices throughout 2021. Farm-level wheat prices are now predicted to rise 8.5% to 11.5% and wholesale wheat flour prices are projected 4.5% to 7.5% higher.

New York Times journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones — her Pulitzer Prize-winning “1619 Project” centralized slavery in America’s origin story a heresy that inspired laws banning her work from classrooms — now lives there. And she’s about to have company.

In her new book “The Second” Emory University history professor Carol Anderson takes on an even more sacred cow: guns. She argues that the Second Amendment — which supposedly came about solely as a hedge against tyranny — had at its heart a much less noble concern: Southern states demanded the right to bear arms because they feared rebellions by enslaved Africans.

All that talk about “a well-regulated militia”? Anderson told me in a telephone interview that that was just the cover story. State militias had not performed well either in fighting off the British or in defending against a domestic uprising: Shays’ Rebellion. “What the militia was really good at however was putting down slave revolts.”

So the South held America hostage. It refused to join the new nation unless it was guaranteed the right to keep its guns. Not that this was the region’s only demand. Ultimately the Constitution contained several clauses protecting slavery and slave owners.

It was to be a recurring theme. From the Founders in 1787 to today’s refusal to enact needed voting-rights reform because of so-called bipartisanship protecting Black people’s humanity has always come in second to other concerns deemed more vital. But as Anderson noted “When you’re willing to sacrifice Black folks for what you consider to be the larger issue you end up sacrificing the larger issue as well.”

Meaning that America cannot credibly practice racial discrimination then tout itself as a beacon of freedom. That’s a hypocrisy with which geopolitical foes have taunted presidents from Kennedy to Biden.

But as Anderson observes the Second Amendment betrays Black folk not only in its origin but also in its application. Put simply: The right to keep and bear arms does not extend to Black people. If it did would the NRA — that vigilant defender of gun rights — have kept silent when a John Crawford III or a Tamir Rice the one a man legally carrying a firearm the other a boy legally playing with a toy gun were executed by police?

By its loud silence the group gave tacit approval of what Anderson calls the “fractured citizenship” of African Americans. “When they were enslaved or free blacks when they were Jim Crow blacks or when they were post Civil Rights Movement black folks that did not alter how the right to bear arms the right to a well-regulated militia and the right to self-defense did not apply to them.”

Yet the same people who keep silent when Black people are deprived of those rights — and their lives — are only too happy to tell us how we all need guns for self-defense. As Anderson noted when “Black” is perceived as America’s “default threat” that argument “puts Black folks in the crosshairs.” Indeed all of us end up enduring daily mass shootings so that some of us can be ready when the hypothetical Black man comes through the hypothetical window.

In “The Second” Anderson highlights the manifest hypocrisy of the Constitution’s most troublesome amendment. She makes a compelling case that for all the noble rhetoric it was created mainly to oppress.

And that it is still working as designed.

Priced at $3.99 the beverage contains 11.1% alcohol which is the equivalent of four light beers TMZ notes. The drink launched Sunday (June 20) in 2000 liquor grocery and convenience stores including chains like Circle K and Kroger. It will also be made available online later this month.

As you already know Apodaca became an online phenomenon last year after posting a TikTok of himself skateboarding down an Idaho highway while drinking Ocean Spray cranberry juice set to Fleetwood Mac’s hit song “Dreams.”

Not long after the clip went viral Ocean Spray thankful for the spontaneous publicity gifted Apodaca a brand new truck full of his beloved cran-raspberry flavored juice. He later put together a selection of songs for a “Songs To Skate To” Tidal playlist featuring “Dreams” and countless other great tracks.

“It’s just insane. I’m blessed and I’m happy that I’m being able to bless those around me” Apodaca told People back in November of his newfound fame and the thousands he received in donations. “I didn’t ever think any of this would happen from the video. I’m just blessed that it is happening.”"

""The difficulty is we have to tell our students now what the fall term looks like because they're making decisions"" said Dan Smith vice president of academic and research at the University College of the North.

""Registration starts in a couple of weeks but when students start to register we have to be very clear with them: where what how they make their plans where they're going to be"" Smith said.

Five universities and two colleges in Manitoba say they will be operating under a blended plan with remote and in-class learning when September arrives.

'We have to tell our students now what the fall term looks like because they're making decisions' says Dan Smith University College of the North's vice-president of academic and research. (Peggy Lam/CBC)

UCN and the University of Winnipeg say 42 per cent of its courses will be offered face-to-face and priority will be given to courses that require hands-on instruction or are best delivered in person.

Université de Saint-Boniface is planning for 35 per cent of its students to be back on campus next term.

""It's a very complex ecosystem to bring people back to our campus. It's a lot more difficult than closing the campus"" said Sophie Bouffard president of Université de Saint-Boniface.

Elsewhere the University of Manitoba is allowing classes of 20 students or fewer and labs of 25 students or fewer to return in person. Brandon University also says it's only allowing classes of 25 or less to be face-to-face.

Red River College and Assiniboine Community College did not specify how many of their fall classes will be taught in person.

Social distancing remains a challenge

On Wednesday Manitoba reached a milestone in its vaccination roll out as 70 per cent of people aged 12 and older have received a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. The province has set a goal of having at least 25 per cent of Manitobans vaccinated with two doses by July 1.

Yet despite a promising vaccination rollout universities say it's too risky to plan for a near-normal scenario in September.

Smith says public health officials have advised that vaccine uptake could be lower closer to fall or a new variant of the virus could emerge in which vaccines can't manage — both are worst-case scenarios that schools must plan for.

David Docherty Brandon University's president and vice chancellor says social distancing could still be required even if most Manitobans are vaccinated posing challenges for universities to reintegrate everyone.

""Even though we have small classes and we pride ourselves on that some of our first year classes are 100 or more. We couldn't comfortably do that social distancing"" he said.

Bouffard agrees with Docherty. She says Université de Saint-Boniface can only fit a third of its students if social distancing is required on campus.

Plans bring mixed student reaction

Raymond Lyttle fourth-year student studying education and developmental studies at the University of Winnipeg says he believes September is too soon to resume in-person classes.

Lyttle's partner has a connective tissue disorder and his grandfather has leukemia so catching COVID-19 is not a risk he's willing to take he said.

""My initial response just from deep in my gut was 'Oh no this is going to go poorly'"" he said.

""I'm worried that many young people which is the bulk of the university population are likely to be a little bit flippant with COVID restrictions — we've seen that trend"" Lyttle said.

Lyttle says he will not be registering for in-person classes come September but he's not keen about online classes either.

""I've applied for some full-time positions and if I can get work where I can work remotely I might take a term off and wait for things to settle down before I return especially since online learning sucks"" he said.

Tekla Cunningham first-year masters student studying geological sciences at the University of Manitoba says she's excited to return to school.

""I have really really missed being in person for classes. I'm a little nervous just because I haven't been around a lot of people for a very long time so it's a big adjustment"" she said.

Cunningham says she supports blended learning for fall and is happy her graduate classes will have no more than ten students.

""On a normal day on campus there's thousands of people walking around … so I don't think I'd feel comfortable if we're back to a hundred per cent even with vaccines [and] people still wearing masks"" Cunningham said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Each county has things it is famous for producing - whether it is food textiles or any kind of product.

Everywhere across the country is rightly proud of their own creations and celebrate those involved in them.

However one thing that has consistently been produced across the UK across the last couple of centuries is beer.

Each county has its own history of locally-produced beers and tales of local and regional breweries to go with them.

Somerset is no different with the county having seen numerous breweries rise and fall over the decades and currently boasts the likes of Exmoor Ales and the Wild Beer Company.

However many have not made it through to the modern day but will inspire some fond memories in those who were able to partake of their produce.

Here's a reminder of some of the old breweries to have graced the thirsty mouths of Somerset.

Lamb Brewery Frome

(Image: Frome Standard)

Founded in around 1850 in Frome the business of Lamb Brewery was officially registered in 1893.

In 1955 the company merged with Frome United Breweries to form Frome & Lamb Ltd but was then acquired jointly by the Stroud Brewery Co. and Usher's Wiltshire Brewery in 1957 along with 300 public houses.

Beer fans with long memories in Somerset may remember some of their wide range of ales including the Invalid Double Stout Starbright Pale Ale or Dinner Ale.

It was closed not long after the traansition to Stroud and Usher's and the brewery buildings that housed Lamb Brewery were demolished some time ago although the maltings sites it used remain and have been converted for other uses.

Oakhill Brewery

(Image: Wells Journal)

Oakhill Brewery was first founded in 1761 and was at a time under the control of agricultural pioneer John Billingsley.

The brewery went through phases where beer was delivered by cart then by drays using heavy horses and then via the emerging Somerset rail system.

However the Oakhill Brewery met its first end in the 1920s when a fire destroyed the main brewery building. The business was taken over by other brewers shortly afterward and the brewing process moved to Shepton Mallet.

The original brewery was revived in 1984 under the name New Oakhill Brewery and beer was then brewed in the original buildings until 1997 when operations were moved to expand the business.

The New Oakhill Brewery eventually closed itself when the owner retired in 2004.

RCH Brewery

This brewery originally began to provide beer for the Royal Clarence Hotel in Burnham-on-Sea in 1982 and traded under the hotel's name.

A couple of years later the brewery was taken over and its produce became available for free trade.

The business moved to an old cider mill in West Hewish in 1993 after the brewing began to take up so much water that guests sometimes could not wash at the hotel.

The RCH Brewery went into liquidation in 2017 but was swiftly reborn as Pitchfork Brewery which is still operational to this day.

Miner's Arms Brewery

Founded in the village of Priddy in the Mendip Hills this brewery first started producing beer in 1973.

Known for Miner's Arms Brewery Own Ale and Guv'nor's Special Brew among others the brewery was relocated to Westbury-sub-Mendip in the 1980s.

The brewery stopped producing beer in 1990 and the pub from which it took its name the Miner's Arms in Priddy has also since shut down.

Juwards Brewery

This producer was founded inside an old woollen mill on the Tonedale Business Park in Wellington in 1994.

Following an expansion in 1999 the brewery stopped brewing initially in early 2002 however it reopened in September of that year for a period using the name Bishop's Brewery.

It was relocated in 2003 and shared facilities with the Moor Brewery and proceeded to brew beers until 2004 when it was again closed.

It was briefly revived in its original location in Wellington in 2005 by then closed for good in 2007.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Posted on: June 19 2021 12:03h.

Last updated on: June 18 2021 12:20h.

The Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (DICJ) will have considerably more casino inspectors to regulate the world’s richest gaming hub in the coming months and years.

This week the Macau Executive Council which supports Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat Seng passed an amendment that allocates DICJ funding and its operational structure. The change GGRAsia reports will take effect within the next several weeks.

The revision more than doubles the number of DICJ gaming inspectors the agency is to have rising from 192 currently to 459 positions. There is no official word as to when the positions for 459 inspectors will be fulfilled only that the hiring will be conducted in a gradual manner.

The DICJ has the tall task of regulating Macau’s six licensed commercial casino operators. While there are only six operators they operate more than 40 casinos and/or VIP rooms.

The responsibilities of the DICJ include to examine supervise and monitor the activities of the concessionaires especially on their compliance with the legal statutory and contractual obligations” the agency’s website reads.

Macau is the richest casino market on the planet. The Chinese Special Administrative Region hit its all-time high gross gaming revenue mark in 2013 when enclave casinos won more than $45 billion from gamblers.

Annual win has since declined due to stricter regulations regarding mainland high rollers moving money to Macau which is a tax haven free of China’s substantial taxes. In 2019 Macau casinos won $36.5 billion.

Macau Seeks Tighter Controls

The gaming licenses for Las Vegas Sands MGM Resorts Wynn Resorts Melco Resorts Galaxy Entertainment and SJM Holdings are all set to expire next year in this month.

For the past several years Macau officials have pledged to review all aspects of its gaming industry and issue new tenders to the gaming giants but under new regulatory terms.

Macau unlike Hong Kong — the other SAR in China — remains in the good graces of the People’s Republic. Macau and Hong Kong both have a great deal of government autonomy under China’s “one country two systems” arrangement.

China provides defense and foreign affairs for Macau and Hong Kong. But the regions are otherwise free of Beijing rule. China President Xi Jinping has been greatly concerned with the cross-border flow of money for gaming purposes since that $45 billion number was realized eight years ago.

Xi’s administration and subsequent law enforcement have since greatly scrutinized VIP junket groups. Macau says its DICJ expansion is to enhance “the strength of regulation.”

Deputy Director Added

The DICJ has been headed by Adriano Marques Ho since June of 2020. His tenure was recently extended by 24 months to at least June of 2023.

Ho holds a law degree from Macau’s University of Science and Technology and was an advisor to the Macau Secretary for Security before taking the helm of the DICJ. Ho’s resume also includes a stint at the Macau Judiciary Police where he led the force’s gaming-related crimes unit.

Ho’s DICJ right-hand man is Deputy Director Lio Chi Chong a former criminal investigator. Under the DICJ expansion Chong is set to receive a partner by way of a second deputy director — a position sometimes referred to as the DICJ “subdirector.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s been 30 years since Brian May released his debut solo album Back to the Light. The 73-year-old is gearing up to re-release the hard-to-find re-mastered record this year and has been reflecting on the man he was at the time. Sharing a picture of himself now standing with himself at the time the Queen guitarist also posted some fan art on his Instagram.

Brian May captioned the post: “Heading into the 30th Anniversary of my first solo album - BACK TO THE LIGHT. “I’ve been pondering these images - and I’m sorry I don’t have ALL of them to hand. “Delving into my history preparing for the imminent re-release of this epic I have been a kind of father-figure looking back kindly on a young man who was fighting his way out of a kind of emotional black hole.” The 73-year-old then reflected on how he’s still looking for answers.

On June 19 1956 Elvis strolled into a local diner full of confidence. He was just starting to become a major recording star with his first movie Love Me Tender also on the horizon but he was still (just about) able to walk around without being mobbed everywhere he went. In the photographs from that day he is handsome and smiling a golden young idol reveling in his new fortune. But he was about to learn a harsh lesson that his charms did not work on everyone – and that his life had not always changed for the better.

Elvis had just done a local radio show and wandered into the Gridiron restaurant on Memphis' Main Street. He was with his girlfriend Barbara Hearn and a group of friends including photographer Robert Williams and columnist Robert Johnson. The young star was in high playful spirits and spotted a local girl 20-year-old Robbie Moore at the counter and sat down next to her. Pictures published in fan magazine Elvis Presley Speaks show the star laying his head on Robbie's shoulder and eating a burger next to her while Barbara looks on.

Johnson later recalled: ""Elvis spoke to her pleasantly as he entered and said something like ‘How are you? I haven’t seen you in a long time.’ The girl didn’t say anything. Elvis seemed to be trying to be friendly. He was just teasing and having fun. ""He opened her purse looking at her teasingly out of the corner of his eye but snapped it back shut and put it on the counter. He took a nibble of her sandwich and a sip of her milk. That was all. ""She still did not respond and Elvis laid his head on her shoulder as if to say ‘Come on let’s be friends.’ He was just acting in a boyish kind of way.” DON'T MISS

READ MORE Elvis ex Linda Thompson returns to Graceland and shares new pictures It all sounded like harmless fun until two months later when Elvis received notification that he was going to be sued for $42500 ($415000 in today's money) for invasion of privacy and assault and battery. Robbie Moore had remembered the whole event very differently. She certainly did not look very happy in the pictures about what was happening. It seems she was not asked permission to be photographed – and she was even annoyed about the sandwich. At that time millions of girls would have been ecstatic to be so close to the pop idol and pictured with him but it seems Robbie was not one of them and her wishes had not been considered. When the story went public Elvis said that they had known each other for some years and he had ""no idea she would object to the picture.""

Elvis was usually adored by fans

The case was settled out of court for $5500 and widely covered in the press. According to the account of that day Robbie gave to the Press-Scimitar she had never met Elvis before their encounter in the Gridiron. The article said: ""She and a friend had ordered cheese sandwiches and when hers came Presley ate it all and drank all her milk. He also went through her purse and then laid his head on her shoulder all of these poses being photographed… To worsen matters when Presley left he made no offer to pay for her sandwich and milk. She had to pay for it itself."" Not unexpectedly Robbie found herself facing an even greater invasion of privacy once furious Elvis fans heard about the court case.

Lockheed mismanaged the F-35 program to an extent but the Pentagon’s requirements for a all-in-one wonder plane is what caused the program's problems.

On October 26 2001 the U.S. Department of Defense announced that Lockheed Martin’s X-35 had won the Joint Strike Fighter contest over Boeing’s X-32.

The win secured Lockheed’s future as the manufacturer for all of America’s fifth-generation fighter platforms. But Lockheed’s resultant F-35 has suffered myriad delay technical glitches unrecoverable technical shortfalls and massive cost overruns. Already the largest-ever defense program with an estimated price tag of $233 billion in 2001 for a total of 2866 aircraft the F-35 program is now estimated to cost more than $391 billion for 2457 jets according to the Government Accountability Office .

Moreover while the short-takeoff vertical landing F-35B was originally projected to achieve initial operational capability with the U.S. Marines in 2010 it only reached that milestone in 2015—five years late. Meanwhile the conventional F-35A and the F-35C carrier variant were both slated to achieve initial operational capability with Block 3 software in 2012—but that software block is now scheduled to be delivered for operational testing in 2017 at the earliest.

Would Boeing have done any better? Hard to say—the Joint Strike Fighter was always a technically challenging and extraordinarily ambitious program. It is likely that Boeing would have run into similar but different technical and budgetary problems. The fundamental issue with the Joint Strike Fighter was that is was always an overambitious program to replace multiple specialized types with one aircraft in the hope that it could perform every role equally well. The result is predictably a jack-of-all-trades but master of none.

One of the main reasons why Lockheed Martin’s design was selected over Boeing’s was because the X-32’s direct lift system—which uses engine thrust to lift the aircraft—is prone to pop stalls. That’s a phenomenon where hot exhaust gases are reingested into the engine causing a power loss. There were also questions as to whether the engine would be powerful enough to lift a fully operational F-32—the prototype had to have parts removed to ensure it would fly. It probably didn’t help Boeing’s case that it had to redesign the X-32 to meet the modified JSF requirements. An operational F-32 had a very different configuration from the X-32.

Even if Boeing managed to solve the airframe issue they would have had to deal with the extremely complex sensor fusion software. The software was always going to be a challenge under the best of circumstances. The only edge Boeing had was that it had developed the Lockheed Martin F-22’s avionics package—but the JSF is much more complex.

Overall it is very likely the Boeing would have run into the same sort of technical hiccups cost overruns and delays as Lockheed did on the X-32. Lockheed mismanaged the F-35 program to an extent but the Pentagon’s requirements for a all-in-one wonder plane is what caused the program's problems. With either company the JSF program was almost certainly going to be late and over budget—it just a question of by what margin.

These new radars will enable the Royal Canadian Air Force to detect identify and direct fighter interceptors to potential threats in Canadian and North American aerospace. These radars can also be transported and deployed world-wide to support operations and training exercises for the Royal Canadian Air Force.

The radars which will be delivered by Thales Canada but manufactured by Lockheed Martin will be replacing the Northrop Grumman TPS-70 solution currently in service.

Two of these will replace the existing ones located at 4 Wing Cold Lake in Alberta and 3 Wing Bagotville in Quebec and the third one will be used as needed based on Canadian Armed Forces operational requirements.

First deliveries of the new radars are expected to begin in 2023.

The order is actually divided in two with the first contract covering the acquisition of three new tactical control radar systems sub-systems and associated equipment and second contract for in-service support for an initial work period of five years.

According to the defense ministry the new radars will be ready to accommodate changing technology and improve the systems throughout their life-cycle leading to an overall reduction of life-cycle costs.

Ukraine needs new fighters as it currently operates old MiG-29 (35) Su-24 (18) Su-25 (13) and Su-27 (33). All but the Su-27 fighter jets are too old out of date and the deteriorating relationship between Kyiv and Moscow in recent decades means that the Su-27 will most likely be the last Russian fighter to be purchased.

The price that Lockheed Martin offered Ukraine is not clear as is the amount that Ukraine wants to buy. But in addition to the new F-16 Block 70/72 the company has also offered to sell second-hand F-16 fighters. At this stage a press release from Lockheed Martin for a proposal to Ukraine is not available on the company’s website. However the information is spread among various media related to the defense industry.

Most recently (April 2021 – ed.) the French portal opex360.com wrote that Paris is ready to join the competition for the renewal of Ukrainian aviation with modern fighter jets and will most likely offer Kyiv the same two options – new fighters Rafale or second hand.

Analyzing the events of recent years Israel and Sweden will be the next countries to offer Ukraine old F-16s (Israel) and new Gripen (Sweden) respectively. However Israel may face a serious problem as the United States once denied a license to Tel Aviv to resell the old Israeli F-16 and it is uncertain whether it will do the same now.

Ukraine will buy F-16s and that’s why

The chances of Ukraine buying the F-16 fighters from Lockheed Martin are high. I would assume in the range of 80-85% this to happen. Kyiv’s decision will be political and has nothing to do with the technical characteristics of the fighters.

Ukraine is a great opportunity for the United States to get even closer to Russia in Europe. The problem of “Crimea” as well as the proclaimed republics of the Donbas and Luhansk region is the problem of Ukraine with Russia. Ukraine does not have the technical physical and quantitative capabilities to wage war on the Russian Federation. In principle and with co-supply of weapons from the United States Ukraine still can not wage such a war.

It is the supply of American weapons and the granting of hundreds of millions of dollars in aid by the White House to Kyiv that are the “burden” that will tip the scales in favor of the F-16. Sooner or later and this is a political move by Washington Ukraine will have to return the favor to the United States. The most appropriate way and the first step is to order new fighters. Just like it happened in Bulgaria.

But the F-16 will be just the beginning. Ukraine will have to modernize its airports under Lockheed Martin conditions for the proper operation of the fighters. Donations from the United States on several boats possibly armored vehicles will follow at a later stage which will open the door to a new US base in Ukraine. It will also be built with US money but when that happens Russia will have lost the opportunity to offer any weapon to the Ukrainian authorities in the future even if we hypothetically assume that relations are improving.

Whoever enters a specific market is the first to dictate military policy in the coming years unless it worsens relations with the host country. There are two examples of this in the world at the moment: India whose military industry is based on Russian standards and continues to produce according to them and Ukraine whose relations with Russia have already been broken and are ready to change its way of production.

A lot of military training was put off last year due to the pandemic said Terry Hart the airport's chief executive.

Through May there are 4000 more arrivals and take-offs at the airport compared to the same period last year and much of that is military related he said.

""There's a lot of training that goes on with the military"" Hart said.

One the larger and more noticeable aircraft is the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules which is a four-engine turboprop transport plane.

Stephanie Sonnenfeld Stinn a Lockheed Martin Aeronautics spokeswoman said the company flies the so-called Super Hercs out of its production plant in Marietta Georgia about two hours from Chattanooga to conduct test flights before delivery to the customer.

""Many of our test flights go up into North Georgia Alabama Tennessee"" she said. ""Our team performs a number of test flights prior to delivery.""

Hart said that military activity was common before the pandemic. As a public airport that receives federal funding it's ""open to anybody and everybody including the military"" he said.

""There's all kinds of different aircraft that come here"" Hart said though the Super Hercs are one of the largest aircraft.

He recalled that when a president visits Chattanooga and flies into the airport the nation's chief executive has planes which transport vehicles used in the motorcade.

Some of the military aircraft simply do ""touch and goes"" on the runway in which they never stop at the airport Hart said. Other aircraft will stay over and fill up on fuel which helps the airport's bottom line he said.

""That's a plus for us"" the airport CEO said.

On the commercial airline side at the airport Hart said passenger boardings are sharply improving but he expects it will take until well into 2022 for traffic to come back to pre-pandemic levels.

Airlines are offering more seats on aircraft into the summer he said. Also more businesses are relaxing travel restrictions which had been put on employees amid the pandemic.

(WFIE) - An Evansville woman is facing a neglect charge after police say her son was found approximately 2.5 blocks from where she was.

Authorities say dispatch received a call about a three-year-old at the intersection of Fulton Ave. and W Delaware St. wearing a T-shirt and diaper at 12:19 p.m.

Officers started searching the area for the child’s house. That’s when police say they found the mother 26-year-old Brook Lowe on W. Iowa St.

Authorities say when they arrived at the house Lowe immediately scolded the child causing the child to cry because he thought he was in trouble.

According to court documents Lowe went to sit on the front steps of her house so officers followed her to get information.

While trying to get information police say Lowe became upset and tried to go back into the house but officers told her she couldn’t until their investigation was complete. That’s when authorities say she started yelling and kept ignoring commands.

Police tell 14 News while they were placing her into custody she grabbed the step railing and door handle to try and prevent officers from placing her under arrest.

Lowe is facing a neglect and resisting law enforcement charge

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph Lowe said he always “looks forward” to his chats with West because they inspire him to do better with his own work as he learns more about himself which he thinks is key to West’s greatness.

“At various times in our journey in life he will decide there’s a conversation for us to have and whenever he does not only do I look forward to immensely I also learn about my process” Lowe said.

He continued: “I always walk away from every conversation with Ye feeling inspired to work on what I’m working on in a deeper way. That’s why so many people respond to his creative process and the way the he creates.

“He’s one of the greatest creatives of all time because he really does continually open the door of what’s possible for others.”

Elsewhere in the interview Lowe teased that Billie Eilish‘s new music will be “absolutely stunning” but refused to comment at length about Lorde’s upcoming comeback album because he wants her music to speak for itself.

“The Billie Eilish music is sounding absolutely stunning” he said. “And I’ll leave it at that.

“I don’t want you thinking: ‘He doesn’t like the Lorde music!’ But I don’t want to say something about someone’s music who I really like – I really like Ella and it’s taken a long time for her music to come back and she’s taken her time.”

He added: “So I just want to give her time to introduce her narrative the way she wants. But I have zero doubt in my mind that her new music is going to be spectacular.”

Matt Harris the coach of the Twins addressed his team of 8 9 10 and 11-year-olds in the dugout after a rousing win over the Pirates.

“That was a good win!” Harris told them. “You see what happens when we swing the bat? We were swinging at the right pitches and had excellent baserunning today. I’m really proud of that. We did a much better job this week. Now you know you can beat those guys. We’ll do it again next week!”

Harris gave the game ball — a Little League tradition — to Brayden Lowe in his fifth year of baseball at Warren Little League for his pitching defense at first base and hitting. Watching behind the fence was his father William Lowe who played on the same fields for years during his childhood.

“This was my pastime growing up” Lowe said. “Saturday baseball games. We’d hang out at the ballgames all today go the concession stands hanging with friends. I loved it. Absolutely loved it. I’m sad to see it go. I’m going to miss it when it’s gone.”

The Lowes like generations of other families in Warren Township have called the baseball fields on East Brookville Road home for almost seven decades dating to 1954. That time is coming to an end however. The league announced in April this would be the final season at the location along Brookville Road as it will merge with Irvington Little League and play its games there.

The future of the Warren Little League location is still in doubt. But there will not be games here anymore. And while there has been a dwindling number of participants in the league to necessitate a change there is still a sense of something lost when these fields are not hosting baseball games on a spring evening or a Saturday afternoon.

“The biggest loss is that loss of community” Harris said. “It’s not a big community anymore. But a lot of us have been coaching the same group of kids for years. We might have a chance to do that when we merge with Irvington. But a lot of these kids will stop playing or they will go elsewhere. You’re not in the same place anymore so you won’t have that sense of community. For those of us who have been out here as players and coaches for 30-plus years it’s really sad.”

Travel ball takes bite out of community-based little leagues

Chris Chaffin met his wife Jennifer Limbach at the Warren Little League fields in the 1980s. A photo of Jennifer’s uncle Chris Limbach used to hang at the facility. Chris a lefty pitched at the fields as a kid before going on to star at Warren Central and pitch eight seasons in the minor leagues in the Philadelphia Phillies’ and Kansas City Royals’ organizations.

Chaffin 45 played baseball. His wife Jennifer played softball. They started dating when they were 15 and have been together ever since. And it all started right there with the hours they spent at the baseball fields.

“Warren Little League used to be a place where you went to hang out with your friends” Chaffin said. “If you weren’t playing you went to watch your friends your cousins play baseball and softball. It was a place you never wanted to leave.”

The participation numbers have declined. Steve Magnuson whose sons played in the league and who has been involved with the program as a board member and in other roles for 20 years said there were more than 500 players registered in 2003. Over a 15-year period the numbers dropped to about 250. In 2019 there were just 170 participants. After the pandemic canceled last year’s season only about 110 returned this spring to the Warren Little League program.

“I don’t know if some of that is just not getting the message out or if kids just aren’t playing” Magnuson said. “Or if they are playing travel ball.”

The community-based youth sports environment that Chaffin references in the 1980s and ‘90s has largely disappeared even at a time when baseball is enjoying a resurgence in popularity at the youth level. A Wall Street Journal report in 2019 noted a 21% increase in baseball participation from 2014 to 2018. But that boom is in lockstep with the travel sports culture — a multi-million dollar business — that has emerged over the past decade.

Jon Solomon the editorial director of the Aspen Institute’s Sports & Society Program said in a 2019 article at frontofficesports.com on youth baseball: “What happens a lot in baseball — and it happens pretty quickly — is as you get into the travel ball culture some families just can’t afford to keep up with it. Unfortunately these days there aren’t as many local community neighborhood leagues providing quality coaching or a quality experience for kids that’s also affordable.”

That is at least in part what was happened to the Warren Little League program and other community-based little leagues.

“When our kids got to be 9 or 10 a lot of times we would have fathers coaching the team with some talented players” Magnuson said. “He would then take three or four kids with him and start a travel team. We had that happen several times here. Normally dads are coaching those travel teams and pulling kids out that they know. Then the overall caliber of competition (in our league) is weakened. And some of our kids who can’t afford travel ball go to Oaklandon or another little league.”

William Lowe allowed Brayden to play on a travel baseball team two years ago after the Warren Little League season ended in early June. But because Brayden also plays football and practices start in the summer it makes it difficult to do both.

“Now it seems like everybody is on a travel team putting a team together” Lowe said. “I don’t mind travel ball. But I would rather have it how we had it when I was playing.”

Harris had a similar experience to Lowe and Chaffin. He started playing in the Warren Little League program at age 7 in 1988 and played through his freshman year at Warren Central in 1996. “I was a mediocre baseball player” Harris said “but I loved Little League.”

Harris’ dad was on the baseball board at Warren. On Saturdays he would play his game sandwiched around watching his friends and siblings play.

“It’s not the same as travel ball where you go out and play multiple games” Harris said. “You’d play your one game and then hang out with your friends. That concept really doesn’t exist anymore. I think it’s travel ball (that is causing a decline in numbers) — and I don’t want to imply that there’s anything wrong with travel ball. If that’s something people want to do and can make the investment by all means do it. But I think people see the numbers here dwindle and say ‘I can’t play competitive baseball unless I do travel.’ That just perpetuates the problem. I don’t see any recovery for it.”

That is not to imply there is nothing to be gained Harris included for those still involved.

End of an era

Eight days after the win over the Pirates the Twins are back out to practice on Field 4 at Warren Little League. They played the Pirates again a day earlier losing by … a lot.

The Pirates and Twins are familiar foes because they are the only teams in the league. A partnership with the Irvington Little League allows them to play more games against outside opponents. That partnership will become an official merger next spring.

Harris has two sons on the team Kyrie and Casey. But several of the players have been with him for multiple years. This Twins’ team is more like an extended family to Harris who knows how to walk the line between reasonable expectations and fun.

“What I want you to remember” Harris tells the team at practice “is that if we are playing the Pirates or Irvington — I don’t care if we are up by 10 runs — if we’re not paying attention in the field or making the effort we’re going to move you around. It doesn’t mean you’re in trouble so no pouting in the dugout. Just do better next time. No big deal.”

What happens next remains unclear. The league leases the property from the city but maintains the fields. The lease will run out at the end of the year though it is possible the Warren/Irvington teams could still practice on them next year. There has also been talk Warren Township Schools could purchase the property and renovate it into a youth football facility.

“It will come down to money” Magnuson said. “There’s some extensive work to do to turn this into football fields. We’ve kind of told the Indy Parks Department that we won’t be back. So we’ll see. I don’t think anyone knows for sure.”

Barring unforeseen circumstances there will not be baseball at the Warren Little League next year for the first time since 1954. The league is planning for an “End of an Era Start of a New” event on July 10 at the fields as a fundraiser for the merger at Irvington and a celebration for previous players coaches parents sponsors and board members.

The heyday of the league is long gone. There were 12 teams in the 11-12 year-old division when Harris played. All of the best baseball players in the township played there then. But even now with much fewer numbers it is difficult for Harris to believe there is not a place for community baseball.

“I don’t blame anybody” Harris said. “But it doesn’t take away from how sad it makes me feel that this won’t be here. The first time I come by here and I see they have started to take down the baseball fields it’s going to be really emotional. Kids will still have a chance to play if they want to in the new league. But the numbers keep going down and I worry there are fewer and fewer kids playing for fun. I understand it. But I’m still sad about it.”

State-controlled shipyard Fincantieri will pay €300 million plus an additional sum of up to €115 million based on the unit’s performance in 2024 the companies said.

Fincantieri which already builds submarines for the Italian Navy will undertake a capital increase of €400 million to cover the purchase.

Originally known as WASS the torpedo unit saw €160 million in revenue last year and holds a 50% stake in GEIE EuroTorp a joint venture with French firms Naval Group and Thales to market the MU90 light torpedo.

WASS which stands for Whitehead Alenia Sistemi Subacquei traces its origins to Englishman John Whitehead who developed the world’s first effective self-propelled torpedo in 1875 in Fiume — then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire and now in Croatia.

Leonardo which the Italian government also controls has for several years sought a buyer for WASS. The parent firm is increasingly focused on planes helicopters and electronics.

WASS neatly fits with Fincantieri’s drive to become an integrator in the undersea business a sector it believes will be worth €100 billion between 2024 and 2028.

“The underwater domain is becoming increasingly relevant for military and security issues concerning critical subsea infrastructures such as gas pipelines cables for telecommunications and electrical transmissions as well as for the surveillance of marine mineral deposits” Fincantieri said in its statement.

Undersea technology was doubly important in the Mediterranean Sea where activities “such as intelligence surveillance defence and deterrence are experiencing strong growth necessitating a dedicated industrial focus” the firm added.

To increase its clout in the sector Fincantieri is partnering at a new sub-sea center in La Spezia Italy bringing together industry the Italian Navy and academia to work on programs.

Fincantieri also signed a deal last year to work with Leonardo on drones to protect undersea cables and pipelines. In December the former it bought local firm Remazel which manages sub-sea operations for the oil and gas sector and has signed a memorandum of understanding to team with WSense an Italian startup using Norwegian technology to develop underwater communications based on acoustic and optical signals.

Fincantieri is also working with C.A.B.I. Cattaneo an Italian supplier of underwater vehicles to Italy’s naval special forces.

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9lc3BuL2JldHRpbmcvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC80MDEwMjE2Ni9taWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1wYXJsYXktdGlja2V0LWJldHRvci1va2xhaG9tYS1jaXR5LXRodW5kZXItdGV4YXMtcmFuZ2Vycy1rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1jaGllZnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ticket of dreams? One bettor's big decision for $1.7 million,"Open Extended Reactions

Wayne Shelton walked into Paycom Center on Tuesday for his first ever NBA playoff game. It was Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Shelton a single father of one and owner of a real estate appraisal business in Phoenix Arizona is ""nervous as hell."" Over the past year he's become one of the Thunder's biggest supporters -- not for sentimental reasons but because the team may help him cash the parlay of a lifetime.

Shelton avidly watches and bets on sports often using multiple screens to keep up with all of the action. However his method for sports betting isn't exactly conventional: He largely only bets futures very rarely dabbling in day-to-day betting.

""I plant seeds throughout the year"" Shelton told ESPN. ""I bet all the major sports for all the futures divisions whatever. And the whole idea is I'll invest a decent amount but now I get to enjoy the entire season as a sports bettor without having to put more money down. I can enjoy what I invested and enjoy every game because they all matter.""

So over one year ago May 1 2023 when DraftKings offered him a high-limit 50% profit boost he knew he had to take a shot.

Shelton noticed that the Texas Rangers had an outrageously positive run differential a month into the MLB season and on that day believed they were a better shot to win the World Series than their 22-1 odds suggested. He began his process of ""research"" -- but for the purposes of this new bet that term will be used loosely. A family member whose family was ""not really into sports"" started following the Kansas City Chiefs so Shelton felt betting a repeat for the reigning champs could be fun at +600.

Then there was the Thunder who Shelton believed showed potential after a feisty outing as the 10-seed in the play-in tournament. At 70-1 to win in 2024 OKC was the final piece of Shelton's puzzle.

He packaged the three championship futures into a $100 parlay to build a new futures ticket. The payout: $1.7 million.

""I never bet that high on a future especially a lottery ticket like this one"" Shelton said. ""They gave me a high max and I just said 'You know what? This one time max it out let's go.' [I] never do that. [And] here we are.""

In November the Rangers won their first World Series in franchise history. In February the Chiefs repeated as Super Bowl champions. Now the Thunder the Western Conference's No. 1 seed are three series wins away from capturing the franchise's first NBA title since moving to Oklahoma City.

""Most people would prefer to [bet] day-to-day and that's because you get your payout immediately"" Shelton said. ""For someone that does it like me you have to be willing to invest. You have to know you are not going to get paid tomorrow. It's been a year since I made the ticket and I've just enjoyed the ride.""

Shelton aims to have 40 futures tickets active at any given time so he's generally familiar with the options available to him to maximize his profit. However with so much money on the line this time (his previous biggest win was $7000) he has had to think about it a little harder.

The most traditional method is hedging which he did ahead of the Dallas-Oklahoma City series to the tune of a $10000 payout should the Mavericks win. He said he will ""probably"" hedge each round if the Thunder continue to win.

Additionally like all major sportsbooks DraftKings offered a cash out on the wager but at around $75000 following OKC's opening round series win Shelton didn't believe the value aligned and started looking at his options to cash out elsewhere.

After the Super Bowl reports emerged of a betting ticket that was just a Thunder title win away from cashing $1.7 million. Travis Geiger's ears instantly perked up.

About four years prior Geiger Zach Doctor and Guy Dotan all alumni of UCLA founded WagerWire a secondary betting ticket exchange born out of the founders' desires for a place to buy into each other's action. While the company isn't the first of its kind -- PropSwap for example launched in 2015 -- Geiger and his co-founders believe they got in early on something that could become a staple of the betting industry.

""This is not only a way for you to ride with your friends but a way for you to play it like an asset that you're more familiar with like a pair of sneakers like crypto like a stock"" Geiger told ESPN. ""It takes what was a risk class and makes it an asset class. If you game it all the way out it creates a secondary market and as we know secondary markets are kind of an inevitability of capitalism.""

Users sync their sportsbook accounts with WagerWire populating their wagers in the app's system. From there they can shop their bet around to other users or wait for offers to come in. They can of course purchase other users' wagers as well.

The app's bet value calculator tells users how much a given ticket is worth based on the original odds/payout and the probability of it cashing based on events that have already occurred. In Shelton's case WagerWire valued the ticket at just over $180000 ahead of the Thunder's series against the Mavericks.

Expected payout for Shelton's ticket If the Thunder ... Expected Value of Ticket After Game 1 of Thunder-Mavs $228613 Advance to Western Conference finals $330366 Advance to NBA Finals $720420 According to WagerWire calculations.

Geiger wanted the opportunity to land this ticket on WagerWire as it would be the biggest bet the platform ever handled. He reached out to the purported ticket holder -- only it wasn't Shelton but instead a 23-year-old named Sean Koehler who attempted to co-opt the internet fame by claiming the ticket was his.

Shelton caught wind of the scheme and contacted Koehler who admitted to duping media outlets. Shelton eventually verified the bet was his by syncing his DraftKings account in WagerWire. DraftKings declined to comment for this story but confirmed the legitimacy of the ticket.

Though Shelton wasn't sure if he even wanted to sell he listed the ticket on the platform to keep all his options open.

Right now WagerWire makes its money by splitting ""nominal"" buyer transaction fees with sportsbooks which vary from operator to operator. For big transactions like Shelton's -- as well as that of Martwon Weaver who sold a $680960 NFL awards parlay that ultimately lost for $25000 -- the company waives its fees.

The sportsbooks handle all of the actual transferring of wagers -- a feature that keeps the secondary market compliant with betting laws.

""The PropSwap transaction relates to what the holder of the sportsbook ticket wants to do with that piece of paper which is now really a contract between the player and the book"" Nevada attorney Dan Reaser told ESPN about PropSwap in 2017. ""It is not the business of taking wagers to facilitate someone buying or selling that contract.""

Geiger feels that his company's product complements sportsbook's cash-out options which are inherently lower than market value to align with their own business needs. To that end it's possible that WagerWire and similar products could eventually directly integrate with sportsbook interfaces providing a more appealing alternative right in the apps.

It might eventually look similar to the secondary events ticket marketplace: If a user couldn't get the ticket they wanted at the original price they can pay a premium to get in later.

Finding a buyer willing to pay thousands -- or hundreds of thousands in Shelton's case -- to get in on the action can be difficult. This is where another company White Glove Bets enters the picture.

Self-described as a ""concierge service"" for digital betting White Glove Bets has a stable of ""high-level VIPs"" that ordinarily cannot deposit money at major sportsbooks due to the inherent risk they bring with their deep coffers. While they're not what you would call professional bettors these players regularly make six-figure deposits and wagers.

""They have that Type A personality if you will"" White Glove Bets co-founder Kevin Smith told ESPN. ""Many of them are business owners or at least executives that are pretty high up the food chain."" He added that many of the company's clients also work in the financial sector. Smith said the clientele is ""predominantly"" male bettors with some as young as 25 years old. Several have been circling Shelton's ticket.

One of the potential investors who has a particular penchant for futures was very intrigued by the final leg of the wager and expressed interest in buying it. Smith has requested that the potential buyer remain anonymous.

White Glove Bets set them up with WagerWire who facilitated a $100000 offer to Shelton -- who promptly turned it down.

At that time Shelton characterized it as a fair offer given DraftKings' cash out was approximately $55000. But knowing that the Thunder were likely to knock out the Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs he decided to hold onto the ticket anticipating a value increase. He also had some reservations about the still emerging secondary market.

""The first thing that was going through my head was 'Wow ok somebody is considering a hundred grand'"" said Shelton. ""If somebody's willing to offer me a reasonable amount above cash out I'm not going to ignore it no question. It's just that I have to trust the company that I'm talking to or the person I'm talking to and I just don't know these companies well enough to be comfortable saying 'Sure I'll do that.'""

Since then Shelton claims to have gotten several offers over $100000 though he notes that many of these including one for $200000 were not legitimate. Protecting the original ticket remains his top priority.

Still if the secondary market can continue to grow and be taken seriously it could provide the alternative to cash outs that high-end bettors have been waiting for: Only a ""super VIP"" could have the capital to bail Shelton's ticket out above the cash out value and such a buyer could also have the means to properly hedge the bet all the way.

""As [the big betting operators] become more corporate they have less tolerance for high-end VIPs"" Smith said. ""I'm not being critical of them at all or their business model.""

While the financial thrillseekers wait in the wings looking for that moment to make him a life-changing offer Shelton is just enjoying the ride. He says he might take a vacation and wants to meet someone famous if and when he comes away with the money but hasn't put a lot of thought into it because it isn't tangible. For now the betting everyman is staying the course taking his monumental decision day by day.

""My family has been supportive people online -- and there's a lot of them -- have been very supportive and that does help with the immense amount of stress that comes with this"" Shelton said. ""And when I say stress -- find like 30 different emotions bundle them up together and it's that way all the time. But I appreciate that and I appreciate that people haven't been harsh and cruel.""

On Tuesday night with Shelton in attendance the Thunder won the first game of their series. The new value of the ticket according to WagerWire is $228613

""[I'm] relieved that I get a day to breathe"" Shelton told ESPN Wednesday morning. ""Awesome game and environment.""

This was the only game of the series Shelton was planning on attending. Now it's back to Arizona where the largest sweat of his life -- and perhaps others -- will continue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Ukrainian M-2 Sneaked Up On A Russian Tank—And Hit From A Mile Away,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/05/08/a-ukrainian-m-2-fighting-vehicle-sneaked-up-on-a-russian-t-80-tank-at-night-and-hit-it-with-a-missile-from-a-mile-away/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares have rebounded from their retreat a day earlier tracking Wall Street's recovery from the Federal Reserve's reminder it will eventually provide less support to markets.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 jumped 2.8% in morning trading to 28785.24. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 1.4% to 7336.30. South Korea's Kospi rose 0.6% to 3260.11. Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged up 0.1% to 28522.78 while the Shanghai Composite gained 0.9% to 3559.32.

Although the latest bout of jitters over a possible easing of help from the Federal Reserve and other central banks appears to have passed analysts said rising coronavirus cases in the region remained a concern.

“Much of the region is dealing with renewed waves of COVID-19 infections. These waves especially in the case of India Indonesia and some other countries in Southeast Asia are the most severe yet” said Venkateswaran Lavanya at Mizuho Bank in Singapore.

On Monday the S&P 500 snapped 1.4% higher to 4224.79 recovering nearly three-quarters of its worst weekly loss since February. Oil producers banks and other companies that were hit particularly hard last week led the way.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.8% to 33876.97 and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.8% to 14141.48.

Investors are still figuring all the ramifications of the Fed’s forecast that may start raising short-term interest rates by late 2023. That’s earlier than previously thought. The Fed also began talks about slowing programs meant to keep longer-term rates low an acknowledgment of the strengthening economy and threat of higher inflation.

The market’s immediate reaction to last week’s Fed news was to send stocks lower and interest rates higher. Higher rates would make stock prices which have been climbing faster than corporate profits look even more expensive than they do already.

But it’s not like the Fed said it will hike rates from their record low of nearly zero anytime soon.

“If markets are worried about a march back to more normal monetary and fiscal policy as the economy recovers it will be a very long march” Barings chief global strategist Christopher Smart said in a note. In the meantime support from both the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government should continue to help stock prices even if they do look expensive compared with history he said.

Companies whose profits are the most closely tied to the economy’s strength and inflation were among the market's strongest on Monday.

Hess Marathon Oil and Devon Energy all rose at least 6.9% as energy stocks rallied with the price of oil. Banks were also strong with Bank of America up 2.5% and Wells Fargo climbing 3.7%.

High-growth companies able to flourish almost regardless of the economy lagged behind in a reversal from last week’s trend when investors rattled by the Fed piled back into the biggest winners of the pandemic.

Amazon slipped 0.9% and the lagging performance for tech meant the Nasdaq trailed other indexes.

More bumps may be ahead for markets which had been mostly quiet for weeks before the Fed's announcement. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak before a House subcommittee on Tuesday about the Fed's response to the pandemic.

In energy trading benchmark U.S. crude picked up 13 cents to $73.25 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It jumped $1.83 to $73.12 on Monday. Brent crude the international standard gained 23 cents to $75.13 a barrel.

In currency trading the U.S. dollar rose to 110.39 Japanese yen from 110.31 yen. The euro rose to $1.1918 from $1.1914.

Designed by Rafael Vinoly and developed by Marriott Ritz Carlton Hotels and Flag Luxury Properties the 40-story structure will yield 250 guest rooms spread across 150000 square feet at the corner of Broadway and West 28th Street.

Since our last update in March the exterior hoist has been dismantled from the southwestern corner of the superstructure and the envelope of floor-to-ceiling glass and gray paneling has filled in the vertical strip. Additional construction on the podium is progressing on what looks like a steel-framed glass-enclosed elevator shaft next to the future landscaped plaza and main entrance. This is seen in the main rendering and will bring visitors up to the top of the podium where a landscaped outdoor terrace overlooks the intersection well above street level.

Work is also continuing to shape up on the mechanical sections that separate the podium and the start of the hotel floors. The ventilation grilles at this section create a contrast of color and texture with the concrete metal and glass materials.

Below is a dusk rendering spotted on the Ritz Carlton’s website looking south at Lower Manhattan from the hotel. Hotel guests will have expansive views of the Flatiron Building the Hudson River the World Trade Center and the rest of the skyline from Brooklyn to Jersey City. The relatively isolated position of the skyscraper will provide year-round daylight exposure with no tall buildings directly to the south of the hotel.

A final completion date for 1185 Broadway has not been announced but the hospitality company’s main website calls for an opening in late 2021.

Credit: JRDV Urban International

Half of American hotel markets are in a recession or depression. And California is expected to lose more than 150000 hotel jobs from 2020 through 2021 with bankruptcy hitting large establishments like the Fairmont San Jose and San Mateo’s Holiday Inn & Suites. Who would open a hotel in this dismal climate?

Berkeley it turns out.

This October a 16-story Residence Inn will open its doors at 2121 Center St. becoming the city’s third-tallest building behind two other high-rises on the same downtown corner. Managed by Pyramid Hotel Group the Marriott-branded hotel will include 331 extended-stay suites 15000 square feet of meeting space and a rooftop bar and restaurant. The structure which is LEED Gold certified will be wrapped in colored glass that mimics the fetching skies over the San Francisco Bay.

It’s only about two-dozen years in the making.

“We’ve been trying since 1997 to get that spot taken” says Barbara Hillman president of Visit Berkeley the organization that markets the city to the world. “I worked with the Office of Economic Development to designate that particular area as a hotel-and-conference center and we had several bites but it seemed as one bite progressed there was a downturn in the economy. This is the most recent bite coming to fruition and I’m excited because it’s something Berkeley has needed for a long long time.”

The hotel goes some of the distance toward completing Berkeley’s 2012 Downtown Plan which set forth design guidelines to make the district denser and more attractive for visitors and locals. The plan envisioned bringing in taller-than-usual buildings especially hotels if they deliver “significant additional public benefits.” The Residence Inn is one of these high buildings; an 18-story housing development that’s been going under the name of Shattuck Terrace Green Apartments is another. The developer for that project has changed since it was conceived and no construction has begun; it’s still just a Walgreens. There was also supposed to be an 18-story housing project on Harold Way but that was canceled last year due to financing problems.

At 168 feet the Residence Inn will sit slightly in the shadow of the Wells Fargo Building at 176 feet and the SkyDeck building the city’s tallest at 186 feet. Rates aren’t yet available. But a one-bedroom studio with a king bed and kitchen in the Residence Inn closest to Berkeley in Walnut Creek goes for about $270 a night in October according to its website (or about $200 a night if you rent by the week).

Hillman hopes the hotel will help stanch the bleeding-out of visitors and convention attendees in Berkeley. “We have the No. 1 public university in the world. People come and want to hold meetings there but we just didn’t have the space to accommodate them so they would go over to San Francisco and Oakland to hold their conferences. We turned a lot of business away.”

The hotel owes its existence partly to Jim Didion a former real-estate adviser to UC Berkeley and the late brother of writer Joan Didion. “Jim was the first individual who saw the site saw the opportunity contacted us as architects and said let’s put a plan together” says Edward McFarlan principal of JRDV Urban International in Oakland.

The site was previously a Bank of America in a low-rise building with a distinctly suburban-looking front lawn.

“It used to be 15 tellers lined up and everyone would have to come in and do their personal business” says McFarlan. “Well that went away because a lot of people do online banking. It was empty all the time. It was this giant wood frame 1970s – you know some people could call it ugly some people could just call it a very unnoticeable building on the most prominent corner of downtown Berkeley. The bank realized that too. That’s why they said ‘Yeah let’s sell it.’”

Boston-based Pyramid Hotel Group started to pursue the project in 2014 but told the city a couple years later that due to a regional building boom and rising costs it might have to cancel the project. The city council granted the developer about $13 million in tax abatement in 2018 and construction started that year. The city says there have been no changes to that tax agreement. The developer wouldn’t comment on the final costs of building the almost-finished hotel which in 2018 were estimated at $125 million.

The Residence Inn is expected to employ about 110 people by next year and along with Berkeley’s other hotels and motels will eventually chip in transient-occupancy taxes to the general fund. In 2018 the city estimated it would bring in $4 million a year a figure that hasn’t been recalculated since the pandemic.

Berkeley has dozens of hotels and motels that funnel in not just occupancy taxes but sales and property taxes. (They occasionally provide other civic benefits; last year Alameda County leased two Berkeley hotels through Project Roomkey to provide lodging for unhoused people.) In a good year these taxes would amount to several million dollars. With COVID-19 the city expects to collect only about $2.2 million for the 2022 general fund according to preliminary budget figures. Still the Residence Inn will likely become a large tax contributor in decades to come given its size and the brand’s reputation for high occupancy rates that industry experts put in the 75%-80% range.

The hotel arrives among other recent enhancements to the downtown area including a renovated BART plaza and a reconfiguration of Shattuck that brought in new sidewalks and traffic calming.

“I think people want to stay in hotels where there’s a lot of vibrancy and choice” says John Caner CEO of the Downtown Berkeley Association. “If you were a parent or visiting scholar or tourist wouldn’t you love to stay in downtown Berkeley and be able to BART into San Francisco or Oakland or rent a car and go up to wine country?”

‘Very conservative … not love and crazy at all’

The original concept for the hotel was a little too risque for downtown planners according to architect McFarlan. It had a three-dimensional art wall with variously colored apertures and glass that seemed to float over the street.

“You think about it as UC Berkeley and radical and all the leftists activists are there and that’s one of the things we love about Berkeley. … But over time we realized we weren’t getting support and it wasn’t clear why” he says. “I finally realized that actually with Berkeley the zeitgeist they operate on is very conservative in their view of their city. It’s not love and crazy at all which is OK. They really love their tradition as I do – I love downtown Berkeley and the traditional buildings. The only question you ask yourself is ‘What’s a new building have to be to complement that?’”

McFarlan and his colleagues settled on a more traditional brick-and-stone design with glass and white-metal detailing hinting at a modern playfulness. They included sophisticated solar technology with preheated water a green roof a rainwater-harvesting system that feeds the building’s vegetation and a publicly accessible roof deck which McFarlan’s particularly proud of. “It’s going to be the hangout because it looks out over the UC campus over the hills downtown Oakland and you can see pieces of the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco.”

There will be a new street-level restaurant and a second-floor parking garage with spaces designated for Bank of America which is moving back into its historical home on the first floor. There will be four ATM vestibules in the branch and one in the lobby plus expanded office space for bankers to meet with clients according to Bank of America executive Nitu Nanda.

The Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive which sits directly east of the hotel is pumped about the possible boon to art tourism.

“While BAMPFA has deep roots in our local community we’re also proud to serve a large audience of arts lovers from outside the Bay Area who will now have an inviting new accommodation option that’s literally right next door to the museum” says BAMPFA director Julie Rodrigues Widholm.

Planning for a bounce back

Will a sweet exhibit of Gandharan Buddhist sculpture and a free breakfast buffet be enough to draw in visitors when new and more gnarly-sounding COVID-19 variants seem to pop up every moon cycle? The hotel industry certainly hopes so.

“I don’t have the numbers back to the Great Depression but this makes all of our other downturns and recessions pale in comparison to the complete loss of revenue in the hotel business” says Alan Reay president of Atlas Hospitality Group a hotel brokerage-and-research company in Irvine.

Some hotels are seeing a comeback particularly those in “drive-to” markets like coastal communities and wine country as people look to finally escape the house. “A number of our clients (in those markets) have had the best May on record” says Reay.

The problem is hotels in downtown areas and business districts are still struggling. “It’s going to take them longer to come back just because you can’t flip a light switch and expect people to have meetings and conventions.”

Dhruv Patel president of Ridgemont Hospitality predicts local hotels will see a gradual rebound through 2023 but won’t be back to normal until an astonishingly late date of 2025. “We’re heavily reliant not only on corporate and group travel but international inbound. And while America is well on its way to controlling the pandemic we know what’s going on overseas” says Patel whose company operates six hotels in the Bay Area.

The fortunate thing is Berkeley’s newest lodging specializes in extended stay a category that’s done remarkably well during the pandemic. Extended-stay hotels are popular among nurses and first responders and the inn’s location near the university perhaps will entice students who need a place to live while finding more permanent housing. The suites also include kitchens an appealing feature for folks who’ve spent an entire year honing their cooking-at-home game.

“We opened an extended-stay hotel in Alameda in October and that actually outperformed our entire portfolio through the pandemic” says Patel.

The area certainly could use more visitors; foot traffic is still down by about two-thirds compared to pre-pandemic levels according to Caner of the Downtown Berkeley Association. “Our poor merchants have been under such financial duress during COVID” he says. “I’ve been saying to so many people ‘If we can just hang on until August students are going to return people are going to come back to offices and with the hotel we are going to bounce back so much faster than I think other downtowns will.’”

Perhaps the true test of downtown’s comeback will be how well UC Berkeley’s football does. In normal years the games typically draw in huge crowds of spend-happy visitors from Southern California Oregon and Washington.

So far all signs point to a roaring season according to Herb Benenson the university’s associate athletic director for communications. “I do know that nearly 95% of our 2019 football season-ticket holders have renewed their seats for this season and demand for new season tickets is strong.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL2hvdGVscy1yZXNvcnRzL3VzLWhvdGVscy1vd25lZC1ieS1hc2lhbi1hbWVyaWNhbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,13 Amazing Asian American-owned Hotels in the U.S.,"When we check into hotels we rarely think of the owners whose entrepreneurial spirit has created the luxurious accommodations we immerse ourselves in. And for Asian American hoteliers bringing their visions to life often comes with a unique set of challenges.

""Being Chinese and an immigrant I have to work harder to communicate my vision to contractors and vendors and also ensure that clients ultimately appreciate the efforts I've made to create a welcoming and friction-free experience"" Shannon Wu who recently opened her first hotel The Amelia in the Hudson Valley tells Travel + Leisure. Her previous career at the World Bank Group kept her sheltered from any discrimination but she says her view of race has changed since she left that international industry. ""I realized racial inequality and discrimination are rampant and things will never change if people do not stand up for themselves"" she adds. ""Asian Americans are branded as a 'model minority' because while we excel at many things we try to stay out of 'trouble.' The recent anti-Asian hate crimes make it clear that this philosophy of keeping our heads down will not shield us from being victimized."" Now she's grateful for the open community in Hudson and looks forward to sharing that welcoming energy with her guests.

Asian Americans make up a large chunk of hotel owners in the U.S. with members of the Asian American Hotel Owners Association (AAHOA) which was formed by Indian American hoteliers in 1989 accounting for one in two hotels in the country California Hotel & Lodging Association (CHLA) chairman Bijal Patel who has also held AAHOA leadership roles tells T+L. That number represents a wide range of hotels as well as hotel owners.

While nowadays many are second and third generation first-generation immigrants often bought properties in the 1970s when the oil embargo made it affordable. It was also a way to set up roots since family members could chip in and help with operations while also having a place to live he explains. ""These Indian immigrants became 'accidental hoteliers' - people who came to America for a better life and just happened to become the pioneers of America's hotel industry"" Patel who is also the CEO and principal partner of Coast Redwood Hospitality says. ""For Indian Americans in America hoteling has always been a family business. That's even more true now… We count on each other and that makes our problems - whatever they may be - much smaller and more solvable.""

It's that banding together that has made Asian American hoteliers such a powerful force - and that's the message they hope to pass along to their guests. ""As Asian Americans we should all make a concerted effort to help educate and spread that inclusive spirit wherever we travel"" BJ Kobayashi of BlackSand Capital which owns Kaimana Beach Hotel says.

Here are 13 of our favorite Asian American-owned hotels.

Flamingo Resort Santa Rosa California

After the birth of their third child Rebecca Bunyasaranand the daughter of a Thai physician father and Caucasian mother and her husband Stephen Yang the son of Taiwanese scientists decided to give up their New York City careers and go into the hotel business. Among their properties is the 170-room Flamingo Resort which they acquired in January 2019 in California's Sonoma Valley. But entering the industry came with its share of hurdles. ""The challenges are similar to those of any industry where we are at times looked upon as outsiders"" Bunyasaranand tells T+L. ""I recognize the barriers that my father faced as an immigrant which can still be seen in more subtle stereotypes and disadvantages today.""

That's driven her to curate an inclusive art collection at the hotel. Diamond Ring from artist Windy Chien uses rope to represent various eye paths while Serge Gay Jr.'s mural - commissioned during the height of the Black Lives Matter protest last summer - captures a ""multi-ethnic androgynous"" face. ""We have incorporated art composed by artists of different heritages in hopes of creating a space that gives AAPI and others a place that inspires our guests to define themselves and not be defined by others"" Bunyasaranand says.

Blossom Houston Hotel Houston Texas

In February 2021 - just months before the Blossom Houston Hotel was set to open in the spring - owner Charlie Wang should have been completely focused on getting every detail of his 267-room 16-floor property ready. But when he heard that some of his employees were dealing with broken pipelines in their homes because of the harsh winter weather he hit the pause button. Instead Wang who also owns a construction business spent $40000 of his own money sending teams out to purchase supplies and fix busted pipes in at least 120 homes in the area KPRC Click2Houston reported.

It's that kind of warm spirit that Wang has infused into Blossom Houston which opened this June. The property honors the city's notable aerospace and medical industries as well as its Asian culture with lunar-inspired decor the Chinese and sushi restaurant Estrela and translation services into Mandarin (plus Spanish and German). The 400000 square feet of amenities also includes 13 event spaces two other restaurants a karaoke room retail shopping and a rooftop pool.

The Amelia Hudson New York

As soon as Shannon Wu saw the 19th-century Queen Anne-style home on Allen Street in Hudson New York she knew it had good feng shui. ""It is very important for Chinese people to have as much light as possible throughout the day especially southern light. This house is perfect in that sense"" she tells T+L. So Wu purchased the Hudson Valley property and transformed it into her first hotel The Amelia an eight-room boutique that welcomed its first guests in June 2021. ""Coming from Beijing where a lot of old houses were demolished I feel strongly about preserving the history and character of old structures"" she says. ""At the same time I much prefer modern simplicity and to keep the house airy and light.""

The result is a classic turn-of-the-century home with lighter and brighter colors and a simpler more modern vibe. ""Every room in the house has large windows"" Wu says. ""We enlarged the south-facing windows to bring in more light and a grand view of the woods and the Catskill Mountains. We also changed the floor plans to reduce irregular corners and fragmented spaces to create a sense of flow. After the remodeling each and every room in the house projects positive energy and makes you feel relaxed and happy.""

Harbor View Hotel Martha's Vineyard Massachusetts

Bernard Chiu has overseen New England real estate and hospitality assets through his company Upland Capital Corporation since 1998 but it's the Harbor View Hotel in Martha's Vineyard which he acquired in 2018 that has particularly special meaning. After all the Hong Kong native who has been an American citizen for more than three decades lives in Edgartown himself. So he felt a responsibility to preserve the property's legacy with a $15 million renovation. The result is a luxurious experience that has landed the hotel on T+L's 2021 It List for Best New Hotels.

""Asia is known for warm and genuine hospitality. Therefore it is only fitting that we shoot for perfection in order to make our guests' experiences memorable"" he tells T+L. ""Our management and all of our staff share the same vision. Many Asians live to eat and the Bettini restaurant is a fine reflection of that culture despite the contemporary American cuisine.""

Kaimana Beach Hotel Honolulu Hawaii

As Waikiki Beach's only boutique right on the sand the Kaimana Beach Hotel was originally built in 1963 as a Japanese-designed and owned hotel integrating touches of Asian influences. So when it reopened this February owner BJ Kobayashi who long sought to bring the iconic property back into the hands of Hawaiians was careful to honor those traditional odes but also freshen them up into an Instagram-ready getaway. ""When guests enter our lobby and see our beautiful views and the eclectic mix of colors patterns and art we hope they will be inspired by the melting pot of Asian influences that is uniquely found in Hawaii"" he tells T+L. Its Hau Tree restaurant now has Pan-Pacific items throughout the menu and Henderson Design Group sourced the local art and furnishings ""many of which have Asian influences and represent Asian artists.""

While he calls the rise in anti-Asian hate ""extremely saddening"" he's also hopeful that the state can lead the way. ""Here in the Hawaii market we have a long history of Asian Americans in leadership positions across the hospitality industry"" Kobayashi says. ""We all have a unique bond as we have worked hard to preserve and protect the hospitality experience on the islands for all ethnicities to enjoy. I truly feel that there is a lot that people can learn from Hawaii and the inclusive environment we strive for here.""

SaltLine Hotel Seaside Oregon

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States last spring the SaltLine Hotel was still well under construction after breaking ground in September 2019. With nothing but uncertainty in the air owner Masudur Khan forged full speed ahead. ""We were really clear with our team on what our goal was and these are the benefits"" he said on the blog of his company Seaside Lodging LLC which co-owns a dozen properties on the Oregon coast. ""It was a difficult situation but we overcame the challenge.""

Sure enough they opened in July 2020 - and the timing couldn't have been more perfect since it gave SaltLine just enough time to establish itself as the city of Seaside where it's located celebrates its 100th birthday this year.

The ""West of Zen"" theme of the 304-room Renaissance Dallas at Plano Legacy West Hotel infuses global culture into every bit of its ambience. ""The public areas invigorate with Asian-themed artwork and design"" Daniel Moon of the Sam Moon Group which acquired the hotel in 2017 tells T+L. ""Meeting spaces are named after major Asian cities. Crisp lines a calm color palette minimalist contemporary furniture and expertly detailed workspaces and bathrooms promote the Asian sensibilities of rest refresh and reflect.""

While he's grateful that his hotel is managed by Marriott which he says has been making ""guests and staff feel welcome by allowing a safe space to speak out against any sort of racism"" the recent events have been ""emotionally devastating."" He adds ""Asian Americans in the hospitality business should recognize the issues that are plaguing our country and encourage their colleagues guests and staff to speak out and help put a stop to anti-Asian hate crimes.""

For more than 60 years Nelson Ishiyama has been an avid fly fisherman traveling to every corner of the world including Argentina Alaska New Zealand and Russia to fish. But there's no place he enjoys his lifelong pastime more than at Henry's Fork of the Snake River. So when he saw the property in the area more than 30 years ago he left his law practice and opened the fishing lodge Henry's Fork Lodge.

Having fished in the area every year for 50 years Ishiyama ensures that his team makes the experience a top-notch one for fly fisherman who travel near and far to the lodge. This includes airport pickups pairings with outfitters and guides and even making sure your choice drink is waiting on the porch upon returning each day. Apart from the lodge Ishiyama is also on the board of the Asian Pacific Fund.

Chef Lalita Souksamlane is already well-established in San Francisco with five restaurants including Osha Thai and Lao Table but she recently turned her focus to her first hotel project Bann at Oak Knoll Napa which opened at the end of last year.

Souksamlane who grew up in northeastern Thailand has long loved wine country and wanted to build a resort-style bed-and-breakfast that captures the luxurious side of her home nation while providing a stay that features ""indoor and outdoor living options nestled in between sprawling California vineyards"" as described on the property's site. The design elements bring together three different Thai regions - north northeast and south - with each room named after the main provinces of the Kingdom of Siam. It all shines in a home-like stay - appropriate since baan means ""home"" in Thai.

While visitors may chase the northern lights to Fairbanks the true spectacle just might be the seven-room Aurora Villa which opened at the end of 2019. Haiyang Yang a Utah businessman who originally hails from Beijing owns the 10-acre property located about a half an hour from the city center but seemingly a world away.

""With the ups and downs of the mountains ahead the concave and convex of each room are echoed with the mountains ahead"" he told the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. ""The large ﬂoor-to-ceiling windows meet the needs of guests to lie down and see the aurora.""

E-Livestock Global has partnered with Mastercard to launch Provenance a blockchain-based solution that looks to empower farmers across Zimbabwe in proving the origins and health records of their livestock reducing the risk to buyers.

E-Livestock Global’s solution delivers end-to-end visibility to the cattle supply chain. Each cattle is tagged with a unique ultra-high frequency RFID tag by the commercial farmers and dipping officers – – as mandated by the Ministry of Agriculture – who then register it alongside the owner to its solution. Each time the cattle is vaccinated dipped or undergoes medical treatment the tag records this data and adds to its traceability system.

E-Livestock Global looks to leverage Mastercard’s Provenance solution in recording these events to ensure a highly secure and tamper-proof trail of all the animal’s history. This builds confidence in the entire supply chain thanks to the presence of trusted transparent and verifiable data. To the farmers an irrefutable record of ownership that supports its sales and exports is provided in addition to obtaining loans that rely on the cattle as collateral. Buyers can efficiently manage their operations while guaranteeing product quality to their customers.

Mastercard’s prominence runs on blockchain technology to deliver real-time traceability that bridges the gap between data silos and allows for decisions to be based on shared records that drive trust and accountability between supply chains.

The solution raises new hope for the country’s agricultural system following a serious outbreak of the tick-borne disease in 2018 killing over half a million cattle. The lack of a traceability system has resulted in Zimbabwe being unable to export beef to lucrative markets across Europe and the Middle East. This has resulted in reduced export earnings from beef which is vital to the country’s economy.

Mark Elliot MasterCard’s Southern Africa Division president said that “Building trust in industries is essential for a functioning and reliable value chain.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm9tYW4uY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTAzMDA1LWFsaXp6LWlzbGFtaWMtYmFuay1sYXVuY2hlcy1zaGFyaWEtY29tcGxpYW50LW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtY29ycG9yYXRlLWNyZWRpdC1jYXJkc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alizz Islamic Bank launches Sharia-compliant Mastercard corporate credit cards,"Muscat: Alizz Islamic Bank in collaboration with Mastercard announces the launch of Sharia-compliant corporate credit cards to provide corporate clients with enhanced efficiency flexibility and convenience in managing their business expenses.

Zimbabwe is the first African country to see the roll out of E-Livestock Global’s traceability system powered by Mastercard’s Blockchain-based Provenance solution bringing end-to-end visibility to the cattle supply chain

Innovative solution brings new hope for farmers while helping Zimbabwe regain its lucrative beef export market to support economic recovery

Harare Zimbabwe – E-Livestock Global today launched a first-of-its kind solution powered by Mastercard’s blockchain-based Provenance solution empowering Zimbabwean farmers to prove the origin and health records of their cattle while reducing risks to buyers.

A first in the Middle East and Africa the solution brings new hope to the country’s agricultural sector after an outbreak of tick-borne disease in 2018 led to the death of 50000 cattle. The lack of a traceability system has seen Zimbabwe unable to export beef to lucrative markets in Europe and the Middle East in recent years reducing export earnings from beef which are important to the country’s economy.

The E-Livestock Global solution brings end-to-end visibility to the cattle supply chain. Commercial farmers and dipping officers tag each head of cattle with a unique ultra-high frequency RFID tag – as mandated by the Ministry of Agriculture – and register it and its owner onto the solution. Each time the animal gets dipped vaccinated or receives medical treatment the tag records the event onto the traceability system.

Leveraging Mastercard’s award-winning Provenance solution E-Livestock Global records these events to maintain a secure and tamper-proof trail of each animal’s history. This in turn supports the entire supply chain with trusted transparent and verifiable data. For farmers it provides an irrefutable record that proves ownership supports sales and exports as well as allows them to obtain a loan using their cattle as collateral. For buyers it enables them to efficiently manage their operations and guarantee product quality to their customers.

“Mastercard’s Provenance solution can safely and securely track the authenticity of the cattle’s journey at every stage from birth to sale. Tracking the medical history of cattle on a tamper-proof blockchain ledger will foster renewed trust in Zimbabwean cattle farming and re-establish Zimbabwe’s credibility as an international beef exporter. It will also open up new opportunities for farmers – especially small farmers who were impacted the most by the 2018 outbreak. Ultimately this will drive trust for multiple stakeholders by combining industry expertise with data privacy” said Max Makuvise Founder and President of E-Livestock Global.

The Mastercard Provenance Solution leverages the power of blockchain to deliver real-time traceability that bridges the gap between data silos allowing for decisions to be made based on a shared record that drives trust and accountability between supply chain parties. Both industry and data agnostic the solution helps provide a clear record of traceability designed to contribute to customer confidence trust and awareness.

“Building trust in industries is essential for a functioning and reliable value chain. At Mastercard we believe that seamless supply chain transparency can help convey authenticity expand inclusion share sustainability practices and improve back-office efficiencies. Our globally-scaled technology and established network capabilities are advancing this process enabling smarter buying decisions and inclusion of all players whatever their size” said Mark Elliott Division President of Mastercard Southern Africa.

Mastercard continues to bring more transparency and traceability to food systems and has already integrated its blockchain provenance solution with other companies that enable food supply chains around the world. This is further enhancing the supply chains for Australian avocados and Californian shrimp and commodities like coffee and grains in the Americas.

The payments technology giant consistently ranks as one of the top blockchain patent filers in the financial services industry with 106 approved blockchain patents and 278 pending applications – many of which directed to technologies that support digital currencies.

Royal Caribbean he reconsiders. One more time. L'Odyssey of the Seas the company's highly anticipated new ship will debut July 31 2021.

In this article:

It was originally supposed to depart from the port of Civitavecchia. Then had been moved to Haifa for weekly cruises in the eastern Mediterranean. Last June 15 the news: the ship which will accommodate up to 4198 passengers will sail with four-week delay Than expected.

The reason for the delay? Royal Caribbean announced it: Eight members of the Odyssey of the Seas crew tested positive for Covid-19 last June 10 six days after the ship arrived in the United States. Thus the departure set for July 3 was postponed. After all the entire staff (about 1400 people) received the vaccine only upon arrival on U.S. soil.

""All employees who tested positive are in good health and are being monitored by our on-board medical team. No new cases have been detected since June 10 to date"" Royal Caribbean said in a note released to the press. However the entire crew of the Odyssey of the Seas will remain in quarantine on the ship for 14 days following a strategy that the company itself called ""an abundance of caution.""

What will happen to those who had already booked their trip? These days Royal Caribbean is contacting guests and travel agents to propose different options for those who were about to leave. ""This was an unexpected but necessary decision and we will strive to do the right thing for everyone's well-being"" the company announced.

What's new at Royal Caribbean

The Odyssey of the Seas is at present one of the largest cruise ships in the world. Although it is not as large as the Symphony of the Seas (the world's largest cruise ship) is designed to offer all the opportunities and entertainment of a giant resort. It boasts numerous swimming pools a water park for children a skydiving and surfing simulator and a bumper car track. Plus the many many types of cabins. Ranging from tiny 15-square-meter windowless interior cabins to huge two-story Royal Loft Suites that are almost 10 times larger.

Odyssey of the Seas was originally given a 2020 departure from Italy. Then its first voyage was postponed because of the pandemic and re-scheduled to Israel. Finally after the resumption of shelling with the Gaza Strip she had been brought to America for security reasons where-again-she had to revise her plans.

But Royal Caribbean's expansion does not stop with the Odyssey of the Seas. On June 17 at Meyer shipyards in Turku construction began on the Icon of the Seas. Coming in 2023 the Icon series ship will be the first among the company's ships to be powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG). A decision that confirms the company's commitment to preserving the health of the oceans. ""We made a commitment to make clean energy at sea which became a reality when Icon Class was first announced in 2016. We are excited to see the construction of what will truly be a ship unlike any other"" said Royal Caribbean President and CEO Michael Bayley."

Hungary playing in front of a raucous crowd yet again at the European Championship held the World Cup champions to a 1-1 draw on Saturday.

After Kylian Mbappe and Karim Benzema wasted chances Griezmann scored in the 66th minute to dampen the spirit of a crowd which gave Hungary unwavering support throughout the Group F match.

It was Griezmann's 38th goal for France moving him three behind third-place Michel Platini on the national team's scoring list and he did a little celebratory dance in front of the blue-shirted fans.

The 67215-capacity Puskas Arena in Budapest is the only stadium at Euro 2020 to allow full crowds and it produced an atmosphere to remember.

“It’s the first time with a full stadium it’s different from what you are used to” Griezmann said. “You can’t hear anything. We couldn’t even hear each other on the field. But it’s a great pleasure to play in front of fans again.”

Hungary's fans went wild when Attila Fiola gave the home team the lead.

Latching onto the ball after Roland Sallai won a header down the left flank Fiola burst into the penalty area and held off defender Raphael Varane before clipping the ball into the bottom corner.

Some flares were lit and Hungary goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi had to remove paper thrown from the stands which landed in his penalty area.

Mbappe and Benzema both wasted chances before Hungary’s goal.

“We should have been in front. It’s not good enough given what we expected but that’s soccer"" France coach Didier Deschamps said. “They scored with their only chance. Considering the context we’ll take the point.""

Given the quality of their opponents Hungary's draw was more like a victory and Gulacsi pumped his fists as the crowd gave the players a massive ovation.

“Today we managed to earn some glory” Hungary coach Marco Rossi said through a translator. “Tomorrow life will go on as usual.”

The Hungarian players lined up in front of their home fans behind one goal after the match and stood with their hands on their hearts as the crowd sang.

“The Hungarian fans are unmatched. We have unique fans"" Rossi said. “That’s why we work so hard to please them.""

Many of the fans waved the green-white-and-red national flag while others were clad in black T-shirts with Magyaroszag (Hungary) written on them. Still others stood bare-chested behind one of the goals in bright afternoon sunshine.

The French team did have some of their own fans however about 5700 of them according to UEFA.

The mood became intimidating when some sections of the crowd jeered the French national anthem La Marseillaise. But France had enough chances to quiet them down in the first half.

The unmarked Mbappe headed wide from left back Lucas Digne’s cross in the 18th. Benzema then fluffed a straightforward chance when he ran onto Mbappe’s clever flick behind and sent a shot wide near the penalty spot.

Benzema has still not scored in the competition after failing at Euro 2008 and Euro 2012. He was left out of Euro 2016.

“As a forward he knows what people expect from him” Deschamps said. “But the main thing is that he stays confident and that I keep believing in him.”

Mbappe has not scored at this tournament. Both had a goal ruled out for offside in the 1-0 over against Germany on Tuesday.

The draw gives Hungary one point in the group ahead of Wednesday's match against Germany in Munich. Two-time champion France has four points and will stay in Budapest to face defending champion Portugal.

“It’s not as if we were going to crush everyone"" Deschamps said. “We still hold the cards. If we win then we'll finish first.”

Deschamps may have an injury concern for that game.

Substitute Ousmane Dembele who hit the post moments after coming on as second-half substitute went off near the end of the game after appearing to hurt his knee.

“I hope it’s only a minor injury"" Deschamps said. “We’ll know more in the next few days.”

Christian Eriksen's cardiac arrest in the opening Group B game against Finland temporarily derailed all thoughts of the side repeating its victorious Euro 92 campaign but his remarkable recovery has both the team and the fans wanting to get back to winning ways for him.

On a sultry weekend afternoon at Faelledparken teams of boys born in 2006 and representing Skjold and Frederiksberg BK played on a bumpy grass pitch overlooked on one side by the Parken stadium where Eriksen collapsed and on the other by the Rigshospitalet hospital where he was taken to recover.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzI5NDQ3Njktd2lubmVycy1hbmQtbG9zZXJzLWZyb20tdGhlLWV1cm8tMjAyMC1ncm91cC1zdGFnZS1zby1mYXLSAXRodHRwczovL3N5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmJsZWFjaGVycmVwb3J0LmNvbS9hbXAvMjk0NDc2OS13aW5uZXJzLWFuZC1sb3NlcnMtZnJvbS10aGUtZXVyby0yMDIwLWdyb3VwLXN0YWdlLXNvLWZhci5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Winners and Losers from the Euro 2020 Group Stage so Far,"Andreas Solaro/Associated Press

Well the European Championship has kicked off with a bang hasn't it? We've seen some truly great performances some disappointments and one of the most surreal events we've ever seen on a football pitch.

In short there's plenty to talk about.

Let's take a look back at the thrilling first week of play and pick out who's doing well and who isn't ahead of the final group-stage matches at Euro 2020.

But before we get into the good and the bad this tournament has given us a clear reminder that none of it really matters in the grand scheme of things. What matters is life which is why Christian Eriksen's cardiac arrest and collapse against Finland brought the entire sports world to a standstill.

The way the Denmark players came together led by captain Simon Kjaer and goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel demonstrated the true beauty of team sport. Kjaer's immediate first aid helped save Eriksen's life; the way his teammates handled themselves in the moments that followed galvanized a nation and has been lauded worldwide.

It was an unbelievable sequence of events that won't soon be forgotten.

Push: The Favorites

We've seen a bit of a mixed bag with the tournament favorites. This group includes Belgium France Germany Portugal England and Italy the top six in my pre-tournament Power Rankings.

Italy and Belgium? They get an A-plus so far. The Italians have been impenetrable and coasted through to the knockout stage with two equally impressive 3-0 victories. Belgium found it more difficult in its second match versus an emotionally charged Denmark but all it needed to do was bring on Kevin De Bruyne to change everything in the 2-1 victory. The Premier League Players' Player of the Year was fantastic from both sides and scored the game-winner in the 70th minute.

Wolfgang Rattay/Associated Press

France and England have been mediocre and were disappointing in second-match draws against far inferior opposition in Hungary and Scotland respectively. Brimming with talent the two sides carry high expectations for much better performances in their third matches. A knockout-stage meeting is also possible between the two if things fall right in the standings.

Lastly Germany and Portugal. Each pulled off an emphatic win and suffered a difficult defeat.

Most recently the Germans surprised with their 4-2 defeat of Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal. Still none of these six squads particularly the last two should be too concerned about their early form. This is because the route out of the groups is much easier than in years past as the tournament expanded to feature 24 teams instead of 16 in 2016.

There's plenty of time to get the engines revved.

It will lead to some tasty matches in the knockout stages.

Loser: Dark Horses

Again looking back at the initial Power Rankings the nations on the cusp of disrupting the order of things in this tournament have mostly fallen flat.

Turkey arguably the biggest disappointment of the lot has a minus-five goal differential and is likely headed out of the tournament unless things fall its way in the final set of group-stage fixtures. Austria has been quite inconsistent in its two matches struggling initially against North Macedonia before winning 3-1 and then losing to the Netherlands in a mostly pedestrian 2-0 defeat.

Poland another nation we were hoping to see big things from got a 1-1 result against floundering Spain and hasn't really pushed the envelope quite yet. Its still in the mix though going into matchday three with just the one point.

If we expected more they'd be favorites. Still these teams have largely fulfilled the first half of the ""quiet hopeful"" moniker and fallen short of the second.

Winner: Cristiano Ronaldo

Some things are just destined to happen. It seemed coming into this tournament that Ronaldo wanted nothing more than to repeat as European champion with Portugal. Should he break the all-time Euro scoring record (and potentially the all-time international scoring record) all the better for him.

Bernadett Szabo/Associated Press/Associated Press

And as if by magic Portugal needed its superstar leader to deliver during a more-difficult-than-it-should-have-been opener versus Hungary at a packed Puskas Arena in Budapest. With the match scoreless past the 80th minute CR7 didn't put away the opening goal but got himself a five-minute brace to seal it. In doing so he passed France's Michel Platini for most goals scored at the Euros with 11.

It should be noted that Platini scored nine goals in five(!) games in 1984 to Ronaldo's 22 matches played. He then added a third goal in two matches against Germany (despite a pretty ugly 4-2 defeat) to edge ever closer to the all-time goals record. With 107 he sits two behind Ali Daei of Iran's 109.

Oh and he also became the first player ever to feature in five European championships. That is astounding. 2004 2008 2012 2016 2020...and if we're being honest it's likely he'll be around at age 39 for 2024. Some player he turned into.

Loser: Euro 2020 Sponsors

We've all seen the clip by now but if you haven't…

The aforementioned Portuguese legend was seemingly quite displeased with the also legendary soft drink being placed in front of him at his press conference earlier this week. How dare they! Ronaldo knows his body and knows what should go into it and apparently Coca-Cola doesn't make that list.

According to reports the American company saw a $4 billion in stock-price drops soon after. Ronaldo's snub has since produced a number of follow-ups at pressers around the tournament. Paul Pogba's removal of a Heineken bottle (he's Muslim and doesn't drink) being one. Andriy Yarmolenko of Ukraine turned 180 degrees and was just as delightful as you might imagine:

Winners: The Fans

Let's end this by saying how amazing it is to have fans back. Some stadiums have full capacity or close to it while others are much lower. Regardless of the number of bums in seats the noise the energy and the atmosphere across the continent has been outstanding and is a testament to the passion and spirit of the sport's lifeblood.

Two Euro 2020 football matches in Hungary are being investigated for “potential discriminatory incidents” UEFA said.

The governing body of European football said on Sunday that a “UEFA ethics and disciplinary inspector has been appointed” to conduct an investigation without providing any details on the incidents.

The anti-discrimination group Fare which monitors matches for incidents of racism and other forms of discrimination sent a report to UEFA and discussed the matter with officials.

On Saturday during Hungary’s match against France which ended in a 1-1 draw Hungarian fans marched to the Puskas Arena displaying a banner calling on players to stop taking a knee to protest racism.

French players were abused with striker Kylian Mbappe being greeted with monkey chants when on the ball. Fellow forward Karim Benzema was also a target for fans.

Budapest is the only Euro 2020 host city to allow full crowds for games.

Anti-LGBT discrimination

During Hungary’s opening match against Portugal in Budapest on Tuesday images on social media showed banners with “Anti-LMBTQ” on them – the Hungarian abbreviation for Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ).

Hungary’s parliament passed legislation this past week that bans the dissemination of content in schools deemed to promote homosexuality and gender change amid strong criticism from human rights groups and opposition parties.

Hardline nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban who faces an election next year has grown increasingly conservative on social policy railing against immigrants and LGBTQ people during his self-styled illiberal rule which has deeply divided Hungarians.

For Hungary’s next and final game against Germany on Wednesday in Munich the city’s Mayor Dieter Reiter said Sunday he was going to write to UEFA to ask for permission for the Allianz Arena to be lit up with rainbow colours as a sign against homophobia and intolerance when the teams play on Wednesday.

“This is an important sign of tolerance and equality” Reiter told dpa news agency.

Munich’s city council had already called for the stadium to be lit in rainbow colours for the final Euro 2020 group game to protest the Hungarian anti-LGBTQ law."

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,"A super PAC supporting Republican David McCormick's Senate run in Pennsylvania is launching a $4 million TV ad buy today its first in one of the most-watched contests of the 2024 campaign.

During the event hosted at the Markets at Hanover on Broadway owners of area businesses small and large voiced their concerns to the Senate candidate.

Among business representatives in attendance were League-Legacy Burkentine Builders the Hanover Area Chamber of Commerce and many vendors from the markets.

While many questions from the audience focused mainly on broader national issues several local business owners spoke with the candidate on more locally focused issues that they said their businesses had encountered.

That included several in attendance who touched on feeling the pressures of regulations on their local businesses.

During this discussion about regulation McCormick shared his view that two regulations should be removed for each new regulation that is instituted.

Mental health was an additional topic of discussion as several people in the audience spoke of the challenges of mental health in the workforce and the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on mental health locally.

John Schmidt owner of Craft Eats at the market highlighted the issue of mental health to McCormick during the discussion expressing how the lack of support for those struggling with mental health issues can often make it difficult to retain workers.

Schmidt a former coworker of McCormick in a previous career had helped draw McCormick to the Hanover area along the campaign trail.

Among other local issues highlighted in the discussion McCormick touched on an issue familiar to many in the York-Adams region as he discussed the large solar farms that have popped up around the state.

McCormick who said he owns many acres of farmland in Pennsylvania said he has had offers from solar companies to use the land for solar farms for more than farmers can offer due to what he explained as government subsidies towards renewable energy.

McCormick described those subsidies as being part of a larger problem of government spending.

The race in which McCormick is challenging incumbent U.S. Sen. Bob Casey is likely to be one of the most closely watched elections of this cycle.

Following the discussion McCormick was invited on a tour of the market visiting local vendors such as GrillRilla Holistic Vibes 2Delicious and Craft Eats.

Then it was off to the next campaign stop with the campaign bus heading to the Pittsburgh area by the end of the day Wednesday.

MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2ktanVzdC13YXRjaGVkLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1uZXctYWktZHJpdmUtdGhydS1hbmQtaXZlLWxvc3QtbXktYXBwZXRpdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I just watched McDonald's new AI drive-thru and I've lost my appetite,"She's only following orders. Screenshot by ZDNet

I wanted it to be clever.

I wanted it to be surprising enticing well at least a little bit human.

After all AI companies are always telling us how much better than the human equivalent their creations truly are.

So when McDonald's revealed it was testing the idea of replacing humans at the drive-thru with robots I was filled with cautious optimism.

Would customers be greeted with a surprisingly chirpy voice redolent of a young person who really enjoys high school?

Sadly I haven't been near Chicago lately and that's where the burger chain is testing this as yet imperfect system -- McDonald's confesses the robot only grasps your order 85% of the time.

But then a TikToker called @soupmaster2000 documented her experience at the new AI drive-thru.

""Welcome to McDonald's"" began exactly the same female robot voice you've heard every time you've tried to get through to a customer service operative at every internet provider/cellphone carrier/just about every business these days.

The McDonald's robot continues: ""We're currently serving a limited menu so please review the menu before ordering.""

There's little more welcoming than being greeted by an inhuman voice telling you that the thing you want to order may not actually be offered today.

But goodness this is just an experiment isn't it? Surely the robot is programmed to offer a tinge of wit no?

No.

The voice is exactly the same robot voice you've heard in every disturbing sci-fi movie. It's as if Siri's daughter has just got her first job.

Soupmaster orders two medium Oreo McFlurries. The response: ""Alright."" In a voice that suggests you may shortly be approached by two members of the secret police.

The robot then asks if the customer wants anything else and invites the customer to ""please full forward"" because no mere human would know to do that.

Soupmaster described it as ""the most dystopian thing I have ever seen in the 27 years of my life.""

It's hard to disagree. One hopes that over time the voices of robots will become more palatable. Perhaps one day you'll be able to order from BTS or SZA.

There has been though a further little twist. McDonald's is now being sued for allegedly recording voiceprint details of its customers at the robot drive-thru. The lawsuit claims that McDonald's makes the recordings ""to be able to correctly interpret customer orders and identify repeat customers to provide a tailored experience.""

McDonald's isn't of course the only fast-food chain that's drifting toward the idea of personalizing offers for customers. Its purchases of Dynamic Yield and Aprente show that this is very much the idea.

Illinois however is one of 12 that requires both parties to consent to a recording of a voice conversation and the lawsuit claims there's no warning to customers that recordings are occurring.

McDonald's hasn't commented but it's an awkward aftertaste to the company's vision of the future.

Currently many McDonald's franchisees complain they can't find staff. Some are even reluctant to re-open their restaurants for indoor dining as they feel they're doing just fine with drive-thru and delivery.

But if your local McDonald's becomes one large modern vending machine does that inspire love for the brand?

Perhaps the future won't be about love at all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXN0aW4zNjAuY29tL3N0b3J5L2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYW1pbHkvMjAyMS8wNi8yMC9hdXN0aW4tZmFtaWx5cy1sb3ZlLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1jb21lcy10aHJvdWdoLXRocmVlLWdlbmVyYXRpb25zLW93bmVycy1tYW5hZ2Vycy82NzA4NzI3MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Austin family's love of McDonald's comes through in three generations of owners managers,"""They have ketchup in their veins.""

That's what Ross family members say about one another. For three generations they have worked in or owned and operated a total of seven McDonald's restaurants first in Dallas and now in Austin Round Rock and Hutto.

When they gather for family events they talk about normal family stuff — who's doing what at school for example — but they also talk shop — which dipping sauce is the best one for fries or McNuggets which new chicken sandwich they like and which frozen drink is their favorite.

They also talk about business such as how to make the customer service or the employee experience better.

It's become their family business through three generations.

The first restaurant

Ann and Edward Winston Ross Jr. decided to buy their first McDonald's restaurant in 1985 after working for 17 years at Xerox.

""I wanted to start a business that I owned"" says Winston Ross 77. He also didn't want to leave Texas he says.

They were living in the Dallas area and faced knowing that their Xerox jobs were going to be moved to California and then probably back to Rochester N.Y. where Xerox is headquartered.

Ann Ross 77 did some research into what type of business would be a good fit. They saw it as a community as a family but also an opportunity.

They had a neighbor who was a regional manager for McDonald's and had been talking to them about working for McDonald's when they decided to apply for the registered applicants program to become an owner/operator.

They spent the next two years working during the day for Xerox and at night and on weekends in McDonald's restaurants learning how to run one.

""The first day I started out on the frying line"" Winston Ross says. ""Let's see if he goes forward.""

They had to learn everything from how to make a burger and fries to at the time how to make biscuits from scratch.

""I could do everything in the restaurant but make scratch biscuits"" Winston Ross says. ""They didn't turn out at all. They just stuck to my hands.""

When they got to the restaurant each day Winston Ross would work the drive-thru and Ann Ross would head to the kitchen a place she loves. It's the most important part of the store they say because without the kitchen you have nothing.

""You're going from one thing to another if you're in the kitchen"" Winston Ross says. ""You're making a burger one minute and the next minute you're making salads.""

When they bought their first restaurant in south Dallas in 1987 their daughter Erica was 19 and son Edward Winston Ross III who goes by E.W. was 17.

Both E.W. and Erica were McDonald's veterans having had their first jobs at one in high school.

That first store shifted the family business from being engineers and architects to being McDonald's owners.

The new family business

The Rosses are descendants of McKissack & McKissack the oldest minority-owned architecture firm which was founded in 1905 in Nashville Tenn. by Ann Ross' family.

Ann and Winston Ross both became engineers she an architectural engineer he an electrical engineer after graduating from Tennessee State where they met.

E.W. Ross followed in those footsteps and became a civil engineer after graduating from the University of Texas.

While E.W. Ross was at UT his parents saw an opportunity in 1989 to buy a McDonald's on Airport Boulevard in East Austin an area of town where there weren't any locations.

""We thought the opportunities were better in Austin than in Dallas"" Winston Ross says.

That McDonald's is now owned by E.W. Ross who says it's important for major chains to be represented in all areas of town. The family began choosing areas that were diverse.

""People in those communities want to be able to walk to their McDonald's"" E.W. Ross says. ""They want to have the same benefits available to them.""

The Rosses have made it a priority to be part of the communities where their restaurants are.

""When you put a McDonald's in a historically underrepresented part of town we're able to partner with elementary schools that need support"" E.W. Ross 51 says. It's also meant hosting events such as coffee with a candidate running for city council or school board or police officers coming to talk about crime prevention or Capital Metro sharing new bus routes.

At one point Ann and Winston Ross owned four McDonald's. E.W. Ross bought two from his parents including the Airport Boulevard store.

A second generation

Ann and Winston Ross saw McDonald's as a ""stable environment for the family"" Winston Ross says. ""It gives us a legacy. Our kids can just go off and do things for a while and then they come back to McDonald's.""

That's what's happened with both E.W. and Erica.

Erica Ross 53 says the family element to McDonald's is what keeps her coming back. ""You're together in the good times and the bad"" she says. After college Erica returned to McDonald's and became a general manager in her parents' restaurants.

No one had any doubt that E.W. Ross would be a future owner/operator following his parents. His road there was just a little longer.

""He's always been really driven"" Heather Ross says of her husband but she says his independent nature meant he had to do his own thing for a while.

E.W. Ross was a resourceful kid who was always creating a new business.He built his own bicycle out of parts. He collected used golf balls on the golf course and sold the balls to golfers for a discount. He had a lawn business in high school that helped him buy his first car a 1978 MGB convertible.

He also started working at McDonald's during high school which he says is a great first job: ""It teaches you responsibility.""

It's about showing up on time with a clean uniform and being able to make eye contact and talk to people and working as a team he says.

While at UT he owned a bar off Sixth Street with some buddies for a few years. He also worked for UPS.

""He was always trying to figure out how to be an entrepreneur"" says Tony Brown one of his college friends and the best man at his wedding. Brown remembers Ann and Winston Ross teaching the value of money to E.W. and how to work within his budget and to make his case if he needed something more.

When they would go to one of the Rosses' McDonald's E.W. Ross and Brown were reminded that it was a business. ""It's not a free place to eat"" he says.

E.W. Ross met Heather at a party and as he was getting ready to graduate he sold a motorcycle he owned to buy her an engagement ring. She went on to get her law degree and work as an attorney.

After college E.W. Ross put his degree in engineering to work at Applied Materials but after a few years he wanted to start his own business. While still at Applied Materials he turned his love of cars into starting a used car dealership called One Price Cars.

""I was always passionate about creating revenue for myself where I could be my own boss"" he says.

He kept the day job and got up early in the morning and worked late at night and on days off to build the car business.

In that business he says he realized that being your own boss was not a ""get rich quick"" scheme where you could sleep late or sit around watching TV or playing golf.

E.W. Ross made One Price Cars a full-time job after a few years and owned it for 13 years. ""It's where I cut my teeth and learned what it takes to be an entrepreneur"" he says.

The land near Capital Plaza where the dealership was tripled in value and around the late 2000s he realized that he wanted to get into being an owner-operator for McDonald's like his parents. He sold the dealership property in 2011 and used the proceeds to purchase his first restaurant.

He had to qualify to be an owner-operator and go through the same process as everyone else not as a person who had parents who owned restaurants. His parents did not give him a restaurant but he trained in their restaurants while in the training program.

""I didn't even get a first car given to me"" E.W. Ross says. ""I certainly wasn't going to get a franchise given to me.""

E.W. now has five McDonald's restaurants. Three years ago as their three children's schedules became more complicated Heather left her job as an attorney and slowly got pulled into helping out at their restaurants.

Both E.W. and his father are a ""gets stuff done"" kind of person she says. She and Winston's mother come behind them and smooth all the ruffled feathers.

""He is just a leader"" Erica Ross says of her brother. ""He's just so organized. He can do so many things.""

The next generation

All three of E.W. and Heather Ross' children have worked officially or unofficially for McDonald's.

Son Edward Winston Ross IV 19 who is also called Winston or Little Winston is going into his sophomore year at Baylor University where he's studying theatrical design technology. He's been working at McDonald's since he was in high school and received a scholarship from McDonald's to go to college.

Daughter Ryan Elizabeth 18 has worked at a couple of McDonald's locations. She will head to Savannah College of Art and Design in Georgia in the fall and is a model.

Youngest son Roman 15 has put on a Hamburglar costume and worked events at his father's stores just as E.W. used to put on a Batman costume and make appearances at his parents' stores while he was in college.

Roman who will be a sophomore at Hendrickson High School knows that soon he will be working regularly at one of his father's stores. It will be his choice he says but ""I need money.""

The Rosses have a deal that the kids need to put in the bulk of the money for their cars just as E.W. had to buy his own car and later his own McDonald's stores.

Being the boss's son or daughter doesn't give you any breaks Ryan Elizabeth and Little Winston say. Everyone else can leave their job at the job when they go home but the Rosses get to analyze the day and what they could have done differently with their dad. It's on-the-job as well as at-home training for a life of customer service management and entrepreneurship.

Both older generations believe Little Winston will be the next owner-operator. He might go off for a while and do Broadway but ""he's got ketchup in his blood"" Ann Ross says.

Heather Ross remembers when Little Winston was 5 coming into one of his grandfather's stores and giving the employees orders. ""Winston you cannot tell them what to do"" she remembers telling him.

They took a trip to the children's museum in Dallas where there was a pretend store. Before Heather Ross knew it Little Winston had organized the kids into who would work the register and who would stock and they did what he told them to do she says.

Now as a manager at their stores ""He's a real asset"" she says.

This new generation has grown up in the grandparents' and parents' restaurants.

""You would think you would get tired of it"" Ryan Elizabeth says ""but it's just food.""

Little Winston says he grew up thinking McDonald's was only about cheeseburgers. ""When I was older in high school I realized there was the rest of the menu"" he says.

They all agree there's something about those fries.

Ann says: ""We love McDonald's.""

Yes! Now you can even get fries with that COVID-19 vaccination — at eight McDonald’s restaurants in San Diego County.

To help make it easier for people to get vaccinated local McDonald’s franchises and the County of San Diego are teaming up to offer free shots at special one-day events starting Monday June 21 at eight McDonald’s restaurants in Chula Vista El Cajon Escondido National City Oceanside Ramona San Diego and Vista.

To thank them for doing their part in building protection against the virus everyone who receives a free shot will also get a coupon for one free McDonald’s menu item. Maybe a Big Mac? An Egg McMuffin? Or yes even McDonald’s french fries!

In addition everyone who receives a vaccination at the McDonald’s events will be automatically entered into a drawing to win a free pair of San Diego Padre tickets!

The one-day pop-up clinics are open to the public McDonald’s employees and their family members. No appointments are necessary walk-ups are welcome. If you’d prefer to make an appointment some of the sites are offering pre-registration.

The fast food chain plans to employ additional staff and set up new franchises over the next 12 months.

The firm said the additions were not replacing jobs lost throughout the pandemic but were being driven by an expansion drive and in anticipation of increased crew capacity as part of changing government coronavirus guidelines.

Paul Pomroy the chief executive of McDonald’s UK and Ireland said: “It’s fantastic to be able to offer an additional 20000 people an opportunity to work with us.

“There is no doubt the pandemic has had a huge impact on many people’s employment opportunities and threatened the future of high streets up and down the country.

“Our 1400 restaurants are run by 200 local franchisees which means we have a personal stake in every one of our communities.

“It’s a big responsibility and the moves we’ve announced today reflect our commitment to continue to innovate and invest in the local communities and economies we serve.”

McDonald’s employs more than 130000 crew members in the UK and Ireland.

Pomroy told the Sunday Telegraph it was “getting harder and harder to recruit”. He said: “Attracting the talent will be critical.” Pomroy also shrugged off fears over a long-term slump in city centre footfall after the pandemic saying: “The great British high street is going to continue into the future.”

The procedures used a bone repair product called FiberCel Fiber Viable Bone Matrix a malleable bone putty developed by regenerative medicine company Aziyo Biologics. FiberCel which uses human cells is used in a variety of orthopedic procedures.

Aziyo issued a voluntary recall notice on June 2 of 154 units of FiberCel all derived from a single donor that were shipped to 37 facilities across 20 states between March 3 and April 2 according to the CDC.

CDC officials told the The Washington Post the first to report the story that 136 units were implanted into 113 patients. The Post added that eight people have died following their procedures though a cause of death has not been determined.

The CDC warned in a statement that patients who underwent spinal fusions or fracture repairs using the recalled lot of FiberCel are ""likely to have been exposed to mycobacterium tuberculosis"" which can cause severe disease and death if untreated.

A CDC spokesperson confirmed to Fox News on Monday that 105 patients who received the recalled product are now on treatment for TB disease. The spokesperson added that eight states were able to sequester 18 units preventing additional surgeries using the affected lot. All unused units believed to be impacted have been sequestered.

DELTA VARIANT CASES RISING IN U.S. MIDWEST SHOWING HIGHER RATE THAN NATIONAL AVERAGE

Aziyo confirmed it is working with its exclusive distributor Medtronic as well as the FDA and the CDC to investigate the source of the infections.

""We are committed to a thorough timely and transparent investigation into the root cause of these infections"" Aziyo Biologics president and chief executive officer Ron Lloyd said.

While the company said it has ""no reason to believe any other units of FiberCel are affected by this situation"" sales of FiberCel have been suspended until further notice out of an abundance of caution.

IS IT A COLD OR COVID-19? SYMPTOMS TO LOOK OUT FOR

According to the Post Delaware and Indiana have reported the most cases of TB. Indiana state health officials are investigating 30 individuals in 19 counties who received the bone repair product.

""All affected individuals have been notified and appropriate public health actions have been taken' Indiana Department of Health spokeswoman Megan Wade-Taxter told the Post in a statement. ""There is no risk to the public.""

In Delaware 23 patients received the bone repair products an anonymous source familiar with the investigation told the Post. In addition Delaware Division of Public Health spokeswoman Mary S. Fenimore told the outlet that state health officials received notification in late May from a healthcare system about a cluster of patients who developed tuberculosis after surgery 'involving a specific product.'

Richard Williams a 74-year-old who tested positive for tuberculosis filed a lawsuit this week seeking damages from Aziyo and Medtronic. Williams a retired corrections officer claims he contracted tuberculosis during a spinal fusion operation on April 13. at a ChristianaCare hospital that used the contaminated bone graft. The lawsuit states that after Aziyo's voluntary recall was issued Williams had a second surgery to remove the contaminated product and insert new bone five days later.

Medtronic and Aziyo did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment.

The United States reported nearly 9000 cases of tuberculosis in 2019. Up to 13 million people in the United States are estimated to be living with latent TB infection (LTBI) according to the CDC.

Approximately 80% of U.S. TB cases have been attributed to reactivation of latent TB infection. Many people who have latent TB infection never develop TB disease while some can develop TB disease within weeks after becoming infected before their immune system can fight the TB bacteria off.

Other people may get sick years later when their immune system becomes weak for another reason. For people whose immune systems are weak especially those with HIV infection the risk of developing TB disease is much higher than for people with normal immune systems.

Symptoms can include a bad cough that lasts three weeks or longer pain in the chest coughing up blood weakness or fatigue weight loss no appetite chills fever and sweating at night according to the CDC.",,,,,,,,,

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9nb3NzYW1lci1zZWxscy1yaWdodHMtZHJ1Zy1ob3Blcy0xMjExMDAwMjIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gossamer sells rights to drug it hopes can rival a new Merck therapy,"Gossamer Bio has sold rights to an experimental drug that could rival a new medicine from Merck & Co. in a deal at least one analyst believes “bodes well” for the company.

On Monday Gossamer and the Italy-based Chiesi Farmaceutici announced a collaboration and licensing agreement to develop and eventually sell the drug which is called seralutinib. Gossamer has been testing seralutinib as a potential treatment for an uncommon disease known in short as PAH and is currently recruiting patients in a late-stage clinical trial meant to serve as the basis for approval applications.

PAH or pulmonary arterial hypertension is a form of high blood pressure in the lungs. The pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood over time causing the organ to weaken or even fail. The Food and Drug Administration has approved several blood vessel-widening medicines that help alleviate the symptoms of PAH and more recently cleared a first-of-its-kind therapy from Merck & Co.

Unlike other treatments Merck’s Winrevair inhibits a protein that thickens the walls of blood vessels. The therapy is injected every three weeks and is seen as a valuable product by both Wall Street and Merck which acquired it through an $11.5 billion buyout of Acceleron Pharma in 2021. Analysts have predicted Winrevair could generate annual sales anywhere between $1 billion to $8 billion at its peak.

Gossamer believes there’s still room in the market for its drug as it also works differently than available treatment options and comes as an inhaled powder. Results from a smaller PAH study encouraged the company to advance seralutinib into that late-stage trial titled “Prosera” which will enroll 350 participants and complete by late 2025.

While Gossamer remains confident in its drug company investors have questioned the strength of those earlier trial results and whether seralutinib can truly compete with Winrevair. Shares of Gossamer lost three-quarters of their value in late 2022 when findings from the smaller study were announced. As of Monday morning they traded at about 75 cents apiece.

Joseph Schwartz an analyst at investment firm Leerink Partners wrote in a note to clients that the new deal with Chiesi “could address many of the concerns investors have” with Gossamer. Chief among those concerns according to Schwartz is the company’s ability to enroll and fund Prosera.

The collaboration “bodes well” for Gossamer “based on the amount of diligence that typically precedes a collaboration” the analyst wrote.

Story continues

Per deal terms Gossamer will continue leading the development of seralutinib in PAH as well as another related indication the companies are interested in: pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease. Though Gossamer and Chiesi will evenly split development costs the former is responsible for financing Prosera.

In the U.S. the partners plan to evenly share commercial profits and losses. Gossamer will helm commercialization efforts for those two diseases while Chiesi will take the lead for any additional indications.

Chiesi will also have the exclusive right to commercialize seralutinib outside of the U.S. Gossamer will get mid-to-high teens royalties on net sales. Chiesi has agreed to pay Gossamer $160 million as a development reimbursement and may shell out up to $326 million more provided certain regulatory and sales milestones are achieved.

IndieFoxx and Amouranth were also the pioneering streams of the likewise controversial Hot Tub meta. And yet again they are the top users of the ""ASMR Meta."" In the past the account of the latter got accidentally demonetized after the advertisers decided to stay away from similar content.

Twitch has since dedicated a speficic category for the Hot Tub streams.

'ASMR Meta' Ban

What is only clear as of now is that Twitch has banned the center figures of the ""ASMR Meta."" But the reason as to why and how long it will be implemented is still unknown.

Dexerto reported that the famed streamers boasts over four million followers. Around 10000 of them fancy watching them jadedly licking their microphones as they show off their leggings drip.

The traction of the mic licking meta has seen an average of 20000 views. During its early days it only drew 14000 views at best.

To compare with other popular categories it now sits at the 30th spot of the most watch streaming category in the platform.

Other ASMS Steamers

Before the microphone licking streamers flooded the ASMR category there were other streamers involved in reading stories or roleplaying while incorporating the audio stimulation. However the original streamers got pushed down by the likes of Amouranth and IndieFoxx.

Is it the End of the 'ASMR Meta?'

A day before the banning of ASMR streamers a popular Twitch streamer who goes by the name Asmongold said that the platform was at fault for the rise of such bizarre trends. He added that turning deaf into the complaints of its users have encouraged sexual content.

Some critics lambasted the ""ASMR meta"" as it seemingly mimics a sexually suggestive sound.

Consequently users were rallying behind Asmongold and suggesting the ban or move of ASMR Meta to a strict moderation category.

As of now the latest move of Twitch suggests that the platform agrees with what the critics are saying. However once the suspensions of both Amourant and Indiefoxx are lifted they are likely to be seen doing similar kinds of streams Dexerto noted.

The end of the ASMR meta will only be established once Twitch uses its rules and regulations to outright ban any similar content.

Evolving from the “hot tub meta” this new style of content on Twitch has seen some of the Pools Hot Tubs and Beaches category’s largest creators move into the ASMR space where they’ve been providing “ear licking” ASMR content while flaunting their physique on camera.

During her most recent stream Pokimane explained why she believes these kinds of metas will continue to pop up on Twitch saying the issue stems from Twitch’s lack of categorization for sexually suggestive content.

“When we talked about the hot tub meta I said ‘listen Twitch it doesn’t matter if you make a new section for this or you ban these individual people or if you ban hot tub streams indoors they’re gonna find another way to push the envelope’” Pokimane said. “It’s not specifically hot tubs that were the issue. The issue is that Twitch has no way of categorizing sexually suggestive content and on a platform where the top or most viewed channels are extremely forward-facing you’re creating an inevitable time bomb for yourself essentially.”

Pokimane also said even if Twitch continues to add specific sections for this kind of content on the platform these creators will still find ways to push the boundaries.

“They essentially implemented a band-aid fix as opposed to treating the root cause” Pokimane said. “It’s not about your symptoms it’s the root cause which is your TOS and your lack of content organization and labeling. You just need to basically give your mods the power to label certain channels as sexually suggestive.

“I think that if a stream is labeled as sexually suggestive and it’s something that you don’t want to ban off the platform but also don’t want to incentivize then channels like that just shouldn’t be shown in the discovery feed or in certain categories. So then at least the followers of the specific channel can see it but random kids can’t.”

In a clip taken from her stream Pokimane explained her sympathy toward creators who have been making regular ASMR content on the platform after having these other creators enter and rise to the top of the category.

As of now Twitch hasn’t formally addressed this new meta but the platform did take action against two of the largest creators who have adopted this style of streaming. Right now Pokimane and many other creators on the site fear that this kind of content could lead to the platform losing advertising support which would affect all creators on the platform—not solely those participating in these new metas. For now there isn’t a lot that creators can do other than wait to see how Twitch addresses this issue.

Twitch has already faced heavy criticism from its community over the platform’s infamous ‘hot tub meta’ but that debate has now been replaced by scrutiny over a new even more controversial trend sweeping across the streaming service.

Dubbed the ‘ASMR’ or ‘yoga pants’ meta this new controversy emerged after several streamers switched from lounging in hot tubs to holding ASMR performances in gym attire — something many of their fellow streamers called out as a highly inappropriate stretch of the TOS.

The debate continued to pick up steam with streamers and viewers alike chiming in on the matter. The latest major player to share their thoughts on the meta is Pokimane who voiced concerns for Twitch’s future amidst mounting blowback from viewers and advertisers alike.

Article continues after ad

Poki began by pointing to a previous conversation she held with fans during the hot tub meta where she predicted that the creators partaking in those streams would simply find another way to “push the envelope” if Twitch ever cracked down on that particular trend.

She added that the issue itself stems from Twitch’s tools used to categorize that type of content which are severely lacking. “You’re creating an inevitable time bomb” she warned referring to the platform’s failure to properly address the situation from the get-go.

“You’re gonna keep having this same issue” she warned and went on to criticize Twitch for simply slapping a band-aid over what many creators feel is a serious injury instead of treating the root causes: an extremely confusing TOS and lack of effective moderation.

The creator also shared a concern that she felt many others have overlooked: the impact of the controversial meta on established ASMR creators who have been largely overshadowed by streamers jumping into the category to join in on the latest money-making trend.

Article continues after ad

“I feel really bad for legitimate ASMR artists” she shared and also pointed out that many of those creators likely feel quite jaded: “For people to come into your category and get to the top by doing the splits with their butt out and gurgling into a mic? It sucks it’s unfortunate.”

Article continues after ad

Pokimane also drew stark comparisons to similar situations that have unfolded on YouTube known as ‘adpocalypses’ — and like others who have spoken out against Twitch’s handling of these metas she believes the platform is well on its way to suffering an adpocalypse of its own.

“I really hope it doesn’t get to that point with Twitch” she worried and warned that if similar events unfold on the streaming site many top creators could be lumped into a category of “mature content” and lose out on ad revenue — regardless of their participation in these metas.

While some streamers have been banned for taking part in the ASMR meta it remains to be seen how Twitch will ultimately handle the latest wave of controversial content — but if streamers like Pokimane are worried about the outcome that doesn’t bode well for the future.

Trotters and pacers returned to Yonkers Raceway earlier this month but not before the historic harness track just outside of New York City completed a $500000 renovation.

MGM Resorts International which operates the track and the Empire City Casino also located there said in a statement it was the first renovation of the 122-year-old track since 2006.

We are incredibly proud to make this significant investment in the sport” said MGM Resorts Northeast Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Ed Domingo. “We have a strong record of providing one of the safest harness tracks in the country and this regrading will not only protect that record but will enhance the competitiveness and excitement of our races.”

Work began on Memorial Day weekend on the half-mile oval track. Construction crews laid 8000 tons of new surface material with 6000 tons of recycled track material and 64 tons of lime. In addition to the resurfacing crews raised the turns to create 14-degree banks. Those serve as the steepest banks across the country.

Track officials said the new surface will better withstand the rigors of a year-round racing schedule. Races are scheduled to take place 234 days in 2021 with cards scheduled during weekday evenings.

Workers also installed new LED lighting to improve visibility.

Fans Allowed Again at Yonkers

The renovations concluded on June 9. That also coincided with the first day Yonkers welcomed back fans in more than a year.

“Having fans back at the track enjoying racing in person is a great step towards fully returning to regular racing operations” said Alex Dadoyan the director of racing at Yonkers.

The work also wrapped up in time for Yonkers to host its legs of harness racing’s Triple Crown for trotters and pacers. The $500000 MGM Yonkers Trot and the $500000 MGM Grand Messenger Stakes for pacers will take place on July 2.

MGM’s Empire City a Moneymaker

Besides harness racing at Yonkers Empire City Casino offers more than 5000 slot machines and electronic table game seats. However the average number of available machines has been reduced over the past nine months since New York allowed casinos to reopen.

In May Empire City averaged 3216 open machines daily. New York State Gaming Commission data shows the Yonkers casino has begun to see action at levels matching pre-pandemic play.

Last month patrons played $848.5 million and won $790.5 million. Both of those totals were the highest Empire City reported since May 2019. That month the MGM casino reported a handle of $865.3 million and a payout of $804.6 million.

Meanwhile the $56.4 million net win was the casino’s highest since March 2019 when it took in $58.3 million.

Since the new fiscal year started in April Empire City has reported a net win of $112.6 million. More than half of that or $56.9 million goes toward the New York State Education Fund. After 10 percent is taken out to pay gaming vendors the operator receives the rest. However they must earmark 8.75 percent of that toward funding purses and 1.25 percent goes to breeders.

While full-fledged casino resorts aren’t in the cards this year for downstate New York MGM officials have expressed an interest in pursuing one of the three licenses that will be made available by 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1kZXZlbG9wZXItY2xvc2VzLTgwbS1kZWFsLWZvci1zdHJpcC1wYXJjZWwtMjM4MjQ5OC_SAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9sYXMtdmVnYXMtZGV2ZWxvcGVyLWNsb3Nlcy04MG0tZGVhbC1mb3Itc3RyaXAtcGFyY2VsLTIzODI0OTgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas developer closes $80M deal for Strip parcel,"Yes this company is in bankruptcy.

The Aria hotel-casino left located within the CityCenter campus is seen on the Las Vegas Strip on Monday April 26 2021. Several years after the never-finished Harmon hotel was dismantled a group of developers has bought its site on the Strip for about $80 million and plans to build a retail complex.

After the coronavirus outbreak upended daily life turning the Strip into a ghost town of shuttered casinos and boarded-up buildings Las Vegas developer Brett Torino said he started talks to buy a site for another project in the eerily quiet resort corridor.

A year or so later Torino has now acquired a small plot in CityCenter for a huge sum with plans to build a retail complex. And with vaccines rolling out and daily life starting to return to normal Southern Nevada’s once-crushed tourism industry has started rapidly coming back to life.

“You’re seeing this recovery play out really quickly in this market” Torino said.

Torino and New York developer Flag Luxury Group partnered on a deal announced April 26 to acquire 2 acres at the southwest corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Harmon Avenue next to luxury mall Shops at Crystals for around $80 million.

The sale — by MGM Resorts International and its partner in the sprawling CityCenter complex government-owned holding company Dubai World — closed June 8 property records indicate.

The site was home to the now-dismantled structurally flawed Harmon hotel tower and is across the intersection from Harmon Corner a three-story retail complex that Torino and Flag Luxury developed about a decade ago.

Torino owner of Torino Companies said in an interview Tuesday that the new four-level project would span around 200000 square feet and that he expects to open it by September 2022.

He is calling it Project63 saying he and Flag Luxury boss Paul Kanavos were both 63 years old when he named it but noting it could change.

Torino who started working in Las Vegas’ real estate industry when he moved here in the early 1970s sat down with the Review-Journal to discuss his newest plans for the Strip.

The interview was edited for length and clarity.

Did MGM put any restrictions on what you can do at the site?

We actually designed it hand in hand with all the folks at MGM and their partner the Dubai group. CityCenter is a beautiful complex; they just wanted to be sure that what was on their doorstep was complementary to the rest of the facility. We bought it for that reason and we completely respected it for that reason.

What else got you interested in the site?

I’ve been doing business on the Strip now for almost 30 years. Once you learn the business down there it’s intriguing. It’s one of the most competitive real estate markets in the world. You’re dealing with people who are razor sharp. When COVID hit — I’ve known (MGM President and CEO) Bill Hornbuckle for 40 years now — I asked Bill is there an opportunity to do something on your site? He put me in touch with their partner at Dubai World and we started a discussion. I never thought MGM would sell it. I just figured it was part of the CityCenter complex and I thought they would want to retain control of it.

Obviously you didn’t get a discount on the deal; it was around $40 million an acre which might be a record for a vacant property on the Strip. Talk about the purchase price and what that reflects.

Truth be told there’s not a usable 2 acres on that site. However the offset is you have the whole underworld of CityCenter below that property. So yes a lot of money yes you’re not getting a usable 2 acres but you have a whole bunch of infrastructure on the ground level – distribution facilities trash facilities parking utilities. It’s part of a massive complex that we were getting plugged into.

Listing broker Michael Parks told me that not only can you lease out retail space at the site but you can sell advertising space outside the building like you do on the big LED screen at Harmon Corner. Is that something you plan to do at this project?

The existing board at Harmon Corner is about 18000 square feet. This board at Project63 will be between 5000 and 6000 square feet. The vision was we’ll have two spectacular LED screens so we have the ability to leverage our national customers and run advertising that’s parallel.

So you can sell space at the same time on both corners?

Absolutely.

Can you talk about the tenants you hope to get at Project63? Would they be luxury retailers like at Crystals or more affordable shops?

It’s going to be one step up from Harmon Corner and probably a step down from Crystals. Harmon Corner is and was very successful for the tenant base that we have in there. Project63 is going to be an upgrade but we don’t want to compete with Crystals. We’re over 50 percent preleased on 63 already but I can’t start going into the names.

Long before the pandemic brick-and-mortar retail was having a pretty hard time around the country including in Las Vegas. Why does the Strip seem so different? Is it just because you have some many people walking around every day?

That’s one aspect of it. Retailers want flag opportunities on the Strip. They want that exposure; they’re willing to pay for it. During COVID if you went into Crystals and looked at the luxury brands there were lines of people waiting up to an hour an hour and a half to get in the stores to shop. The average Las Vegas customer is going to come here they’re going to spend those retail dollars. It’s just the nature. Las Vegas isn’t going away. COVID didn’t change it.

It certainly shut it down for a while.

Sure did. Absolutely. All our tenants stayed open on the Strip but of course we had to give them help and we wanted to do whatever we could for them. But they’re coming back strong. In the worst of times they were somewhere between a third and a half of their usual sales. Now their sales are back up to 2019 levels.

Did you ever take a walk or a drive along the Strip when everything was shut down just to see what it looked like? What do you remember thinking?

I hope we don’t see another one of these. It’s eerie. In a very surreal sense it’s very beautiful but as a businessperson it isn’t very beautiful. I rode my bicycle up and down the Strip; it’s just a very eerie event.

MGM Resorts International announced on Friday that it was introducing charter air service to the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City.

On Friday MGM Resorts International announced the start of charter air service to the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City. The service will be made available for qualified members of its M Life Rewards program with flights available from dozens of cities across the US. (Image: MGM Resorts International)

In a statement the gaming company said that travelers from up to 75 cities will be able to fly into the New Jersey seaside resort city. Sun Country Airlines operates the flights for MGM Resorts on 173-seat 737-800 aircraft.

Departures are available from such cities as Buffalo Chicago Detroit Houston Louisville Pittsburgh and Raleigh.

Sean Farrell MGM’s executive director of charter services said in a statement that offering chartered flights for patrons is a milestone achievement for the company. The flights are an expansion of service the company currently offers to people going to the Beau Rivage Resort on Mississippi’s Gulf Coast.

MGM’s charter service is available for select members of the company’s M Life Rewards loyalty program who meet the minimum requirements.

Tim Kroll director of the Atlantic City International Airport said in a statement the service benefits more than the city’s largest casino.

The expansion of Borgata’s flight service through ACY on Sun Country Airlines significantly increases the airport’s charter offerings and affords more passengers convenient access to Atlantic City” he said. “The program is valuable to introducing the market to a greater number of communities throughout the U.S.”

Farrell agreed noting that Borgata patrons would be able to visit the famed Atlantic City Boardwalk and take in other attractions in the area during their stay.

MGM’s AC Charter Move Follows Hard Rock

MGM’s announcement comes two weeks after Hard Rock International announced the launch of its charter service to its Atlantic City resort.

Those two brick-and-mortar casinos rank as Atlantic City’s biggest in terms of gaming revenue according to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.

In figures released this past week the Borgata reported $48.7 million in gross gaming revenue for May. Hard Rock reported $35 million. No other Atlantic City casino reported a total higher than $24.6 million.

Both casinos have also been significantly ahead of their peers in terms of year-to-date totals as well. The Borgata reported a total win of $208.9 million for the first five months of the year while Hard Rock reported $151.1 million for the same time span.

Only one other casino the Ocean Casino Resort exceeded $100 million for the first five months.

Service Seeks to Lure Top Caesars Customers too

But MGM Resorts isn’t just looking to compete with Hard Rock in the charter air game. Among the specials they offer on the FlyBorgata.com website MGM offers two complimentary seats on the plane for Seven Stars cardholders with Caesars Entertainment.

Seven Stars is the highest tier in the Caesars Rewards program.

For those not in Caesars Seven Stars program nor high enough in MGM’s M Life program to snag a free flight packages start at $553 per person. That includes the roundtrip flight a three-night stay at the Borgata and transportation between the resort and the Atlantic City airport.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJveGluZ3NjZW5lLmNvbS9pbm91ZS10aW1lLWNvbWVzLWlsbC1yZW1pbmQtY2FzaW1lcm8tcmluZy1ldmVyeXRoaW5nLWhlLXNheS1hYm91dC1tZS0tMTU4NTA20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inoue: When Time Comes I'll Remind Casimero In Ring Of Everything He Had To Say About Me,"It takes a lot for the humble yet confident Naoya Inoue to break character.

The level of trash talk that has come from fellow three-division and reigning bantamweight titlist John Riel Casimero has yet to do the trick. Instead Inoue focuses on the stuff that matters which for this week means the next defense of his unified WBA/IBF bantamweight titles.

“Right now I’m just focused on this fight living in the moment” Inoue told BoxingScene.com ahead of his mandatory title defense versus IBF number one ranked challenger Michael Dasmarinas. “I’ve heard what he’s had to say and choose to not pay attention to that kind of talk.”

Japan’s Inoue (20-0 17KOs) and Philippines’ Casimero (30-4 21KOs) were due to collide last April 25 at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas only for the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic to shut down the event and the boxing schedule as a whole. The sport resumed later that June though largely without fans in attendance for most of the rest of the year.

The top two rated bantamweights ultimately went their separate ways. Casimero defended his WBO title in a rousing third round knockout of Duke Micah last September dragging Inoue’s name through the mud long before and well after the win in hopes of drumming up enough interest to revisit such a fight.

Inoue has fought just once since the pandemic scoring a one-sided seventh round stoppage of top-rated contender Jason Moloney (21-2 18KOs) last Halloween at MGM Grand Conference Center in Las Vegas. The unbeaten pound-for-pound entrant—who has also held titles at junior flyweight and junior bantamweight—fights for the second straight time in Sin City honoring his mandatory versus Dasmarinas (30-2-1 20KOS) atop an ESPN telecast from The Theater at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas.

Less than two months later Casimero enters a dangerous showdown versus two-time Olympic Gold medalist and former lineal junior featherweight champion Guillermo Rigondeaux. Their bout takes place August 14 on Showtime with hopes that wins by both will allow their respective teams to pick up where they left off prior to the pandemic and provide the sport with a bout to determine bantamweight supremacy.

Such a fight remains a short-term goal of Inoue. Also is his sights is a potential rematch versus four-division and newly crowned WBC bantamweight champ Nonito Donaire (41-6 27KOs) who scored a fourth-round knockout of unbeaten Nordine Oubaali on May 29 to win the belt.

Inoue pushed through a fractured orbital bone to drop and eventually outpoint Donaire in their November 2019 unification bout claiming top honors in the World Boxing Super Series bantamweight tournament in the process. The two were cordial throughout the promotion and in the immediate aftermath remaining respectful of one another to this day.

It’s a far different dynamic in the growing rivalry between Inoue and Casimero though the harsh words will continue to only come from one direction. On the other side receipts are being saved for when they are able to reschedule their long-awaited championship showdown.

“When the time comes to fight him I will use it as motivation” notes Inoue. “I will remind him in the ring of everything he had to say about me.”

The Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (DICJ) will have considerably more casino inspectors to regulate the world’s richest gaming hub in the coming months and years.

This week the Macau Executive Council which supports Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat Seng passed an amendment that allocates DICJ funding and its operational structure. The change GGRAsia reports will take effect within the next several weeks.

The revision more than doubles the number of DICJ gaming inspectors the agency is to have rising from 192 currently to 459 positions. There is no official word as to when the positions for 459 inspectors will be fulfilled only that the hiring will be conducted in a gradual manner.

The DICJ has the tall task of regulating Macau’s six licensed commercial casino operators. While there are only six operators they operate more than 40 casinos and/or VIP rooms.

The responsibilities of the DICJ include to examine supervise and monitor the activities of the concessionaires especially on their compliance with the legal statutory and contractual obligations” the agency’s website reads.

Macau is the richest casino market on the planet. The Chinese Special Administrative Region hit its all-time high gross gaming revenue mark in 2013 when enclave casinos won more than $45 billion from gamblers.

Annual win has since declined due to stricter regulations regarding mainland high rollers moving money to Macau which is a tax haven free of China’s substantial taxes. In 2019 Macau casinos won $36.5 billion.

Macau Seeks Tighter Controls

The gaming licenses for Las Vegas Sands MGM Resorts Wynn Resorts Melco Resorts Galaxy Entertainment and SJM Holdings are all set to expire next year in this month.

For the past several years Macau officials have pledged to review all aspects of its gaming industry and issue new tenders to the gaming giants but under new regulatory terms.

Macau unlike Hong Kong — the other SAR in China — remains in the good graces of the People’s Republic. Macau and Hong Kong both have a great deal of government autonomy under China’s “one country two systems” arrangement.

China provides defense and foreign affairs for Macau and Hong Kong. But the regions are otherwise free of Beijing rule. China President Xi Jinping has been greatly concerned with the cross-border flow of money for gaming purposes since that $45 billion number was realized eight years ago.

Xi’s administration and subsequent law enforcement have since greatly scrutinized VIP junket groups. Macau says its DICJ expansion is to enhance “the strength of regulation.”

Deputy Director Added

The DICJ has been headed by Adriano Marques Ho since June of 2020. His tenure was recently extended by 24 months to at least June of 2023.

Ho holds a law degree from Macau’s University of Science and Technology and was an advisor to the Macau Secretary for Security before taking the helm of the DICJ. Ho’s resume also includes a stint at the Macau Judiciary Police where he led the force’s gaming-related crimes unit.

Ho’s DICJ right-hand man is Deputy Director Lio Chi Chong a former criminal investigator. Under the DICJ expansion Chong is set to receive a partner by way of a second deputy director — a position sometimes referred to as the DICJ “subdirector.”"

RESHORING: The Ministry of Economic Affairs said the firm has to show that the investment will be in smart manufacturing and create jobs that pay well

By Angelica Oung / Staff reporter





Memorychip packaging and testing service provider Powertech Technology Inc (力成科技) plans to invest more than NT$20 billion (US$719.17 million) to build a second production facility at the Hsinchu Science Park (新竹科學園區) as part of the government’s Invest in Taiwan initiative the Ministry of Economic Affairs said yesterday.

Powertech was prompted to “reshore” or shift its manufacturing facilities from China back to Taiwan by a US-China trade dispute InvesTaiwan Service Center interim spokeswoman Nicole Chen (陳明珠) said.

“We have been working with them since 2019 to come up with a plan that will allow them to be included in the initiative” Chen said.

The initiative rewards projects with favorable financing terms with the government footing the bill for some bank fees she said.

The government also helps companies find sites and labor although this was not required by Powertech she said.

In return the firm has to show that the investment will be in high-value “smart” manufacturing and create jobs that pay well she said.

More than 2000 jobs will be created by this investment the ministry said in a release.

“It is not easy to hire workers in Taiwan” Chen said. “We only want to create quality jobs that create a lot of value.”

In addition to its second manufacturing location in Hsinchu Powertech is to upgrade its four existing production facilities in Taiwan with the funds.

Seven other companies were approved by the Invest in Taiwan committee but unlike Powertech they were small or medium-sized firms — having a market cap of less than NT$2 billion and generally fewer than 200 employees.

They have to meet the same criteria for smart manufacturing Chen said.

“It does not matter whether you are making semiconductors or noodles” she said.

A-Sha Foods Enterprise (阿舍食品企業) a maker of premium packaged ramen noodles is to invest NT$700 million in a new Tainan facility using AI to monitor production Chen said adding that 115 jobs would be created.

Companies in the initiative have to outline requirements for resources such as water and electricity Chen said in response to questions over whether the reshoring program would add to the stress on utilities in Taiwan amid power outages and a water shortage.

“In this way we can keep track of how much additional water and electricity they require and make sure Taiwan can plan for its resource needs” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3VuLm15L2J1c2luZXNzL21pY3Jvbi1tYWxheXNpYS1vcHRpbWlzdGljLW9uLW91dGxvb2stYW1pZC1ncm93dGgtaW4tZGlnaXRhbC1lY29ub215LUFFNzk4NzAzMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Micron Malaysia optimistic on outlook amid growth in digital economy,"GEORGE TOWN: Micron Malaysia which has committed to RM1.5 billion worth of investments over a span of 10 years is optimistic about its outlook in the country riding on the positive wave of the semiconductor sector and digital economy.

Vice-president and country manager Amarjit Singh Sandhu said the company an entity under Nasdaq-listed Micron Technology Inc first announced it was investing in Penang specifically Batu Kawan in 2018 where it was planning to set up Micron’s Centre of Excellence (CoE) for solid state drive (SSD) assembly and test.

“There are many different aspects of the digital economy and there are various applications as well be it 5G data centres growth gaming devices for online learning e-commerce and so on. We participate in all these different sectors.

“Semiconductors are essential in terms of the needs of the digital economy and the direction the world is heading. Therefore we are very positive in terms of our growth potential and opportunities in this particular market” he told Bernama.

Commenting on its operations in Penang he said things are running quite smoothly despite the Covid-19 pandemic with the completion of its building the hiring of over 2000 workers and even the successful shipment of products to major customers.

Amarjit said Micron Technology in general is focused on growing its memory and storage business and Micron Malaysia is well-positioned to grow with the US-based company’s overall presence in the semiconductor space.

“We certainly have expansion plans here and it is being reviewed on a regular basis; but at this juncture we are busy setting up our operations and once the plans are all firmed up we will announce it at the right time.

“Moving forward we are upbeat on our outlook here. Once the pandemic situation improves in the coming months it would help us further accelerate our growth in Penang” he added. – Bernama",,,,,,,,,

But when he finally got the opportunity the Expedia and Zillow co-founder started with a critique of the program’s name — specifically its pronoun.

“There are no ‘I’s who built anything” Barton explained in an email recounting what he told Raz. “Anything. ‘We’s build stuff. And ‘We’ is way more fun than ‘I’ in my experience. And the group of people I have been lucky enough to work with from college through Microsoft Expedia — and then all of the Expedia diaspora many of whom founded great companies — has been nothing short of miraculous.”

He added “I would start listing companies but I know I would forget some and feel bad. There have been so many. Anyway the tight supportive tech community in Seattle is huge part of that success and I’m grateful and lucky to have landed here.”

Lesson number one: always credit the team and the people around you.

﻿

His critique of the name didn’t make it into the final edit of the show which was recorded a few months ago and released last weekend. However the theme did come up in other ways as Barton credited his success to his good fortune in working with “an insanely smart and hardworking bunch of people” over the years.

The interview traced the course of his career from travel to real estate from his early days at Microsoft where he and his colleagues hatched travel giant Expedia to his current role as CEO of Zillow Group. Barton co-founded the online real estate company in 2005 and was succeeded as CEO by Spencer Rascoff in 2011 before returning to the role in 2019.

A common theme running through Barton’s career is the notion of disrupting established industries through transparency empowering people with information. Examples include Zillow’s closely followed Zestimate home price estimating tool and the company reviews on Glassdoor which Barton co-founded with former Expedia colleague Robert Hohman.

Barton said the key is not disruption but provocation.

“Provocation is a fantastic marketing strategy” Barton explained on the show. “I’ve had many companies now where I’ve used this as a tool.”

Barton’s return as Zillow Group CEO gave the conversation a more timely feel than many other episodes. For example he explained that the tech tools adopted by the real estate industry out of necessity due to COVID safety protocols — virtual home tours digital closings etc. — will remain permanent fixtures even after the pandemic.

However as a longtime listener and fan of the show myself I was surprised that Raz didn’t take advantage of that timeliness to press Barton on more hot-button issues such as the competitive threats facing Zillow from rivals such as Seattle-based Redfin and traditional real estate firms.

Over email I suggested to Barton that Raz may have been taking it easy on him.

“Loads of content landed on the cutting room floor and I honestly don’t remember if there was competitor stuff in there” Barton replied. “You think he took it easy on me eh? You should have seen me the night after the interview. Like Rocky after meeting Apollo Creed.”

He explained “It was a long interview — over three hours — which must be part of his process to make it sound as real and raw as he can. He’s an incredibly talented and smart interviewer. I could hear the wheels spinning as he was figuring out the puzzle — the story. I learned quite a bit from him while I was being questioned. And I learned about myself actually.”

While it was Barton’s first time on “How I Built This” he had spoken with Raz before. Barton interviewed Raz for a Zillow virtual partner event for real estate professionals toward the beginning of the pandemic.

Although his critique of the show’s name didn’t make the final cut Barton did share a few of his best practices for naming companies: Make up a word that you can fill with your own meaning and register cheaply as a domain; seek to incorporate high-point Scrabble letters; and keep it to two syllables if possible.

That last one came in hindsight after Expedia was named — just one of the lessons from Barton’s entrepreneurial journey.

Young men dapper in caps and sneakers smoking cigarettes on a street corner. A couple wearing traditional Khmer clothes at their wedding party in a small apartment crammed with revelers.

The images appear in a recently published photo book Krousar: On the Corners of Argyle and Glenwood by Stuart Isett. The images convey the hardships and cultural dislocation as well as the resilience adaptability and joy of the community of Cambodian refugees many of whom were trying to find their place in American society after escaping the Khmer Rouge genocide and war that had ravaged their homeland.

Khemarey Khoeun's family first settled in the Austin neighborhood of Chicago's Uptown area one of the city's poorest communities in 1981.

It had been a long journey from Siem Reap a Cambodia city best known for the Angkor Wat temple complex to the Sa Kaeo Refugee Camp in Thailand which the family left in 1981 after a two-year stay.

The U.S. government accepted refugees from the camp where thousands of desperate civilians had fled to escape heavy fighting between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese army forces in northwest Cambodia from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s.

Until age 5 Khemarey Khoeun lived in the Uptown neighborhood surrounding the intersection of West Argyle Street and North Glenwood Avenue. Her family then moved to the suburbs and she recalled how she had seen some Cambodian youth in Uptown being drawn into gang life on the streets.

""Around that time [Cambodian] people used to hang out at the beaches nearby Foster and Montrose and it got to the point where people stopped going there because that was where the gangs were going at each other"" she said. ""We did not feel safe anymore.""

Khemarey Khoeun now 40 still lives in Chicago and is board president at the National Cambodian Heritage Museum and Killing Fields Memorial. In 2017 she was sworn in as a park district commissioner in Skokie Illinois making history as the first Cambodian American woman to be elected to public office at any level of U.S. government.

Looking back at her childhood Khemarey Khoeun said it was understandable that many young people turned to the camaraderie and protection of a gang as they grew up in an uprooted and impoverished community.

""Their parents were often not available — both of them were working — and kids were left out by their own to decide for themselves"" she said.

""And they grew up in an environment where their parents were survivors of genocide wars and had PTSD traumas"" she said. ""How easy it would have been for them to be recruited into the Cambodian gangs. So that had become their lifestyle.""

Focused on a community

When Stuart Isett was a young graduate student in photography he mingled with Cambodian youths in the neighborhood documenting their lives and their families from 1991 to 1994.

Almost three decades later he revisited his collection and published it as a book in collaboration with Pete Pin a photographer based in New York City and Silong Chhun a multimedia artist and a community advocate against the U.S. government deportation of Cambodian Americans. Chhun also founded Red Scarf Revolution a clothing brand that promotes Cambodian culture and history.

Pin put Isett's images in order and Chhun wrote the text of the book published by Catfish Books. The book sold out soon after its release at the beginning of the year and it is unclear whether another edition will be published.

Isett told VOA Khmer: ""We called [the book] 'Krousar' the common [Khmer] word for family. And it's about Cambodian families. And it's also about how these young men had to form their own family in some ways which was separate from their Cambodian families. Because they were now living in the United States so they formed these — I don't like using the word 'gang' but they formed gangs.""

Isett developed an interest in Cambodia's humanitarian crisis and conflict when he visited the refugee camps in Thailand after finishing college in the late 1980s. Since then his interest in Southeast Asia has remained constant.

The images resonated personally with Chhun and Pin as Cambodian Americans. As the book's blurb puts it ""They would have been the young boys in the back of the room in many of Isett's images.""

""When I first saw [the photos] I was really really happy because in a sense his photos were a reflection of how my friends and I grew up"" said Chhun 41 whose family had settled in a housing project in Tacoma Washington in 1981. Like many youths Chhun said he relied on his friends on the streets for ""acceptance and value.""

He said the photos also capture how elements of Cambodian culture survive in the U.S.

""There are celebrations and the dancing the older folks and the younger folks doing it"" he said. ""Cambodia has a very community- and village-focused culture based on you know just celebrating together. And despite the hardships and challenges we have to find some light in the dark to keep us going.""

Chhun said the text accompanying the photos was meant to provide context and help ""humanize"" the Cambodian experience and the struggle to find an identity and fit into American society. ""We were labeled as this community that came from nothing and had to try to find a way in the country"" he said.

A flood of refugees

Tens of thousands of Cambodians fled to Thailand from the mid-1970s onward to escape the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime and the subsequent protracted conflict between Pol Pot's forces and the Vietnamese army occupying Cambodia.

Most stayed in the Sa Kaeo and Khao I Dang camps with 200000 refugees passing through the latter camp until resettlement in the U.S. Australia and France or until repatriation to Cambodia in 1993.

In 2016 a learning center opened on the former Khao I Dang site. Supported by the Thai government the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross the triumvirate that once ran the camp the center features an exhibition that includes photographs videos and text.

The 150000 Cambodian refugees who came to the U.S. 35 to 40 years ago were dispersed by the government to cities and towns across the country. The refugees were placed in housing projects and eventually formed sizable communities in Chicago Illinois; Seattle Washington; Long Beach California; and Lowell Massachusetts.

""Many of them came from peasant backgrounds"" said Eric Tang director of the Center for Asian American Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. ""As a result many had to remain on welfare for generations"" because a mismatch of job skills and language made finding jobs difficult.

""So what happens is they are immediately tracked into urban poverty in the United States and that makes for a unique situation of Cambodian refugees and [other] Southeast Asian refugees"" Tang told VOA Khmer.

In addition to struggling to lift themselves out of poverty many Cambodians faced challenges associated with PTSD and other mental health ailments. By 2020 the population of Cambodians in the U.S. reached 340000 and 13% continued to live under the poverty line according to the Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. census data.

Timely revelation​

Isett's photography book appears as public attention and debate grow about the Asian American immigrant experience. Writers such as Vietnamese American Viet Than Nguyen and Cambodian American Anthony Veasna So are gaining critical acclaim.

Sithea San 54 said it was uncommon for her to see a book that intimately captures the Cambodian refugee experience in America and Isett's work had helped her better understand the struggle of the tens of thousands of Cambodian refugees like her across the U.S.

""I thought my life settling into the American ways of life was hard but seeing these photographs showed me how much harder and challenging it has been for other people"" she said noting that she arrived in Long Beach as a 14-year-old refugee in 1981.

Sithea a Cambodian American community leader in Long Beach is the co-founder of Cambodian Town Inc. one of the oldest Cambodian nonprofit organizations working to preserve the community's culture and traditions.

Unlike the many Cambodians who had no family outside their country Sithea and her family were sponsored by a now-deceased uncle who had come to the United States in the early 1970s.

""My uncle and his family provided all the support I needed"" she said. ""They provided a place for me and my family to stay and made sure I was on track with school and stayed out of troubles.""

Khemarey Khoeun said the book would help younger generations of Cambodian Americans understand what their parents went through and achieved by sheer resilience as they grappled with recovering from trauma and raising their families amid hardships.

""There is a younger generation who are growing up who don't know that history and are not as connected to the recent refugee experience because they were born here as the first generation"" she said.

""We faced many challenges and barriers and we still do today"" Chhun said. But we are resilient. We are people that came from nothing and now about 40 years later we've accomplished so much.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
MRNA,Moderna,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RhaXdhbi1oZWFsdGgtY29yb25hdmlydXMtcGFuZGVtaWMtNjZiOGFlNjZhMmJiNDNjNmUwMmQwOTRlZGQwZTVjZWPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US sends Taiwan 2.5 million vaccine doses tripling pledge,"TAIPEI Taiwan (AP) — The U.S. sent 2.5 million doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to Taiwan on Sunday tripling an earlier pledge in a donation with both public health and geopolitical meaning.

The shipment arrived on a China Airlines cargo plane that had left Memphis the previous day. Health Minister Chen Shih-chung and Brent Christensen the top U.S. official in Taiwan were among those who welcomed the plane on the tarmac at the airport outside of the capital Taipei.

Chen said that America was showing its friendship as Taiwan faces its most severe outbreak. “When I saw these vaccines coming down the plane I was really touched” he said over the noise inside a building where the boxes of vaccines some with U.S. flags on them had been brought on wheeled dollies.

Taiwan which had been relatively unscathed by the virus has been caught off guard by a surge in new cases since May and is now scrambling to get vaccines. The COVID-19 death toll on the island of 24 million people has jumped to 549 from only about a dozen prior to the outbreak.

The U.S. donation also signals its support for Taiwan in the face of growing pressure from China which claims the self-governing island off its east coast as its territory. The U.S. does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan under what is known as the one-China policy but is legally bound by its own laws to ensure that Taiwan can defend itself.

“These vaccines are proof of America’s commitment to Taiwan” said Christensen the director of the American Institute in Taiwan the de facto U.S. Embassy. “Taiwan is a family member to the world’s democratic countries.”

The U.S. promised 750000 vaccine doses for Taiwan earlier this month sending Sen. Tammy Duckworth and two of her Senate colleagues to the island aboard a military transport plane to make the announcement. Taiwan has ordered 5.05 million doses directly from Moderna but so far received only 390000 including a second shipment that arrived Friday.

Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen said the U.S. had decided to increase the donation through efforts on both sides over the past two weeks.

In a Facebook post Tsai joined the U.S. in drawing attention to their shared democratic systems. China which has been ruled single-handedly by the Communist Party since 1949 says Taiwan must eventually come under its control and reserves the right to use force if necessary.

“Whether it is for regional peace and stability or the virus that is a common human adversary we will continue to uphold common ideas and work together” Tsai wrote in Chinese.

She has accused China of blocking Taiwan from getting the Pfizer vaccine through BioNTech the German co-developer. Chinese officials have repeatedly denied the charge and say China is willing to provide vaccines to Taiwan. Taiwanese law however bans the import of Chinese-made medicine.

The U.S. donation follows Japan’s shipment of 1.24 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in early June. Taiwan has ordered 10 million doses from AstraZeneca but has yet to receive most of them.

The Moderna vaccine which arrived from Spain will be offered to all Brunei citizens and residents free of charge in phases.

More COVID-19 vaccine doses from US drugmaker Moderna are expected to be delivered later this year as the government had procured 200000 doses of the jab.

The Brunei Darussalam Medicines Control Authority has authorised the emergency use of the Moderna vaccine after verifying its safety and efficacy.

Data from clinical trials showed that the Moderna jab was 94.1 percent effective at preventing COVID-19 infections in people who received two doses.

The arrival of the Moderna jab comes a day before Brunei begins Phase 2 of its COVID-19 vaccination drive.

The second phase will see the rollout broaden to include teachers childcare workers and those with chronic illness such as high blood pressure high cholesterol obesity diabetes stroke heart kidney and lung disease.

Since the vaccine rollout started on April 3 Brunei has been administering Oxford-AstraZeneca and Sinopharm vaccines to priority groups including frontline workers senior citizens and overseas-bound students.

A total of 55505 people or 12.1 percent of the population have received their first dose of a two-shot COVID-19 vaccine while 2.6 percent of Brunei residents have been fully vaccinated.

The health ministry aims to inoculate at least 70 percent of the population to achieve herd immunity against COVID-19.

Eligible individuals who wish to get inoculated can book their COVID-19 vaccination slots via the BruHealth app.

To date Brunei has reported 252 coronavirus cases with no locally acquired infections for over a year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL3BhZ2UvMjAyMTA2LzEyMjY2NDEuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delivery of US vaccines to Taiwan a palpable political ploy: Global Times editorial,"Illustration: Liu Rui/GT

The 2.5 million doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine that took off from the US on their way to Taiwan on Saturday have excited the island's authorities - and they are loudly expressing their gratitude. Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities said Washington's assistance with vaccines confirmed the ""rock-solid friendship between Taiwan and the US."" A senior US administration official told Reuters that ""[the US is] not allocating these doses or delivering these doses based on political or economic conditions"" while he said that: ""we believe that attempts by [the Chinese mainland] to block purchases for political purposes are reprehensible.""Regarding the entry of these anti-epidemic supplies into Taiwan both the US and Taiwan's statements are blatant political operation. They have given themselves away by conspicuously and hypocritically pretending their innocence.After this latest COVID-19 outbreak the DPP authorities' political manipulation is one of the ""best"" in the world. They not only divided specific anti-epidemic measures into ""democratic"" and ""non-democratic"" but added political attributes to the vaccines. They believe the vaccine produced by the mainland cannot be used in Taiwan nor can German's BioNTech vaccine because Shanghai-based pharmaceutical giant Fosun Pharma has the exclusive rights to sell the BioNTech vaccines in the Chinese mainland Hong Kong Macao and Taiwan. The DPP authorities approved only original vaccines from Germany without the participation of Chinese mainland companies. The mainland has become a symbol that Taiwan authorities must eliminate from vaccines.Such a politicalized COVID-19 fight has led to bad results. Taiwan's epidemic situation has spread beyond people's expectations. The huge shortage of vaccines has triggered people's strong dissatisfaction. A few AstraZeneca vaccines have allegedly led to the death of dozens of people causing new anxiety. The DPP authorities have seen their support rate plummet and they are feeling a sense of crisis. Now the US has offered Taiwan 2.5 million doses of the Moderna shot which is like a ""politically timely windfall"" for Taiwan authorities.Washington has no interest in the island's fight against the epidemic. Brent Christensen the ""director of the American Institute in Taiwan"" said on May 26 that he was ""confident"" Taiwan could control the spike in COVID-19 cases noting its infection numbers remained ""quite low."" Now the US finds that the DPP authorities are in deep trouble and that they might ""have an accident"" if Washington refuses to save them. So the US set aside 2.5 million doses of vaccines to help the DPP authorities with this emergency.The current DPP authority has the most loyal politicians in the island who follow the US. Their failure to fight the epidemic was spurned by the Taiwan people and will affect the quality of their service to the US' Indo-Pacific strategy and harm the interests of the US. To help Tsai get through at this point would be to solidify the US' influence in Taiwan.In a series of ""thanks"" from Tsai on Saturday it was clear that the authorities of external affairs of the region and its representative office in the US went all out to ensure the 2.5 million doses of Moderna were sent to Taiwan. They could not have inspired the US by humanitarian appeals. The US' humanitarian response to the epidemic has been completely numbed by its own tragedy of 600000 deaths. Washington thought the epidemic in the island was not a big deal and needed no special help. The only way officials in Taiwan could persuade Washington is to emphasize the political purpose and only political considerations can bring about change.Politics is both the starting point and the end of the Taiwan authorities' position in the region's fight against the epidemic. Washington joined in midway and it certainly had no intention of turning Taiwan's COVID-19 fight driven by politics into one driven by humanitarianism. The arrival of the 2.5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine in Taiwan is all well and good but it is a drop in the ocean for the island's 23 million people. It is hoped that Washington and Taiwan authorities will not take this as a joint play to cajole the people in Taiwan or as a prelude to promoting Taiwan's ""indigenous vaccine.""No region in the world has made the process of obtaining vaccines as dramatic as the island of Taiwan denying abundant sources of vaccines in one direction while pleading for charity in another. Such a focus on political manipulation by the DPP authorities shows that the political foundations on which Taiwan's system operates are shaking and they are panicked.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsbmV3cy5jYS9uZXdzLzc5NjU2NjgvbG9uZG9uLW1pZGRsZXNleC1jb3ZpZDE5LXZhY2NpbmUtcGZpemVyLW1vZGVybmEv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9nbG9iYWxuZXdzLmNhL25ld3MvNzk2NTY2OC9sb25kb24tbWlkZGxlc2V4LWNvdmlkMTktdmFjY2luZS1wZml6ZXItbW9kZXJuYS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 London-Middlesex COVID-19 vaccination clinics to switch from Pfizer to Moderna Monday,"Send this page to someone via email

Starting Monday three COVID-19 mass vaccination clinics in the London and Middlesex region will switch from administering the Pfizer to the Moderna vaccine.

The Middlesex-London Health Unit (MLHU) says this is due to the challenges associated with a delayed delivery of Pfizer next week.

The vaccination clinics at the Western Fair Agriplex North London Optimist Community Centre and the Caradoc Community Centre in Mount Brydges will administer Moderna to adults for first or second doses.

A limited supply of Pfizer will be available at each clinic for youth aged 12 to 17 years old.

The latest health and medical news emailed to you every Sunday.

The vaccination clinic at Earl Nichols Arena remains Pfizer-only according to the MLHU.

The MLHU says the interchangeability of mRNA vaccines has been supported by experts at both the Public Health Agency of Canada and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization.

“Regardless of which vaccine you received for your first dose Moderna is an excellent vaccine for your second dose” Dr. Chris Mackie Medical Officer of Health at the MLHU said.

“Pfizer and Moderna are essentially different brands of the same vaccine and you will have the same protection against COVID-19 regardless of what you get for your first or second dose” he continued.

Those looking to book a vaccine appointment can do so online or by calling 226-289-3560 (8:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Monday to Sunday).

In order to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible it’s important that individuals take the first available mRNA vaccine for their second dose. #LdnOnt #Middlesex /3 pic.twitter.com/goDmoLS9kV — MLHealthUnit (@MLHealthUnit) June 20 2021"

The fund is trying to reconcile a sustainable-investing mantra with the billions it owns in companies that source cocoa from regions where children pick beans that feed the world’s craving for chocolate. So far it has chosen to stay involved rather than sell so it can push for positive change.Its latest filings show the investor has chosen to stay involved rather than sell so it can push for positive change.

“We expect companies to work against child labor but at the same time we recognize that child labor in supply chains and agriculture has complex underlying causes” said Line Aaltvedt a spokeswoman for the fund.

In a global financial world increasingly obsessed with ethical matters the world’s biggest investors -- from BlackRock Inc. to Fidelity Investments -- are navigating gray areas and trying to figure out the best way to engage. While the Norwegian fund’s actions are primarily financial as was the case when it sold $6 billion worth of companies that purely focus on oil exploration and production last year ethical considerations increasingly play a part.

The stakes aren’t insignificant for Norway’s wealth fund which according to its most recent filings owns shares valued at more than $16 billion in some of the world’s largest chocolate makers and confectioners including Nestle SA Hershey Co. and Barry Callebaut AG. The companies all acknowledge child labor exists in their supply chain have explicit policies forbidding the practice and programs in place to mitigate the problem.

It’s the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour and the United Nations held its World Day Against Child Labor a week ago. Still the practice remains hard to eradicate in the world’s cocoa farming regions. Just ask Nouffo.

He was rescued as part of a police operation to clamp down on child labor in Soubre the heart of the Ivory Coast cocoa belt in early May. Nouffo said he was brought to the country from neighboring Burkina Faso by his father when he was 13 years old. He was left to work on his uncle’s plantation where he was found splitting open cocoa pods with a machete.

“Two Ramadans have passed since I’ve been here” said Nouffo in his limited French. That makes him 15 now.

Nouffo who spoke while being held in a center in Soubre said he worked seven days a week splitting open cocoa pods gathered by adult workers drying them and then transporting them by motorcycle to buying centers. School was out of the question.

His uncle was among 24 people arrested as part of the two-day police raid in partnership with the National Committee for the Monitoring of Actions to Combat Child Trafficking Exploitation and Labor which is led by First Lady Dominique Ouattara.

Five of those arrested were sentenced to 20 years in prison for child trafficking including Nouffo’s uncle said Luc Zaka the police commissioner in charge of the raid. Seventeen others were handed five years behind bars and two were released.

As supply chains in the cocoa market are difficult to track it could not be established whether any of the world’s large chocolate makers were supplied by the farm Nouffo worked on.

Demanding Action

Last year the Norwegian fund conducted about 3000 meetings with portfolio companies to discuss how ESG targets were being met. Children’s rights were the topic of 17 such meetings. In 2019 it initiated talks with nine companies in the cocoa business on the subject.

“Typically the chocolate producers are in the fund while the cocoa producers are private farms in West Africa” said Eli-Ane Lund a spokeswoman for the ethics council that makes recommendations to guide the fund.

The debate usually revolves around how patient investors should be with transition assets – those with a self-improvement plan – and when it’s time to punish companies through exclusion. When it comes to child labor mostly in the cocoa business but also in the coffee tea cotton seeds and palm oil trade the Norwegian fund has often decided to stay involved.

Take Barry Callebaut the Swiss chocolate maker that says it will probably continue to have child labor in its supply chain until 2025. It counted Norway’s wealth fund among its biggest shareholders with a 1.4% stake the latest filings show.

The fund which also meets with non-governmental organizations as part of its environmental social and governance investing strategy is putting pressure on firms like Barry Callebaut to improve Carine Smith Ihenacho chief corporate governance officer at the Oslo-based fund said in an interview.

In another example Norges Bank’s executive board asked the fund in 2018 to address the risk of child labor at UPL Ltd. an Indian agro-chemicals maker and its Advanta Seeds unit.

“In our dialogue with the company we have among other things addressed the need to prevent child labor in the supply chain and the company’s approach to monitoring the supply chain” fund spokeswoman Aaltvedt said.

That led to Advanta recently updating its agreements with farmers and further developing procedures for monitoring the supply chain to uncover possible child labor. It also has information activities aimed at farmers suppliers and local authorities to prevent child labor.

“Child labor in the production of hybrid cotton seeds and other seed varieties was among the very first issues considered by the Council on Ethics and this was an issue that the council worked on for many years” said Eli-Ane Lund a spokeswoman for the council.

The ethics panel an independent body has made three recommendations for observation or exclusion of companies on child labor grounds: Monsanto Co. in 2006 Zuari Agro Chemicals Ltd. in 2013 and UPL in 2018. Of the three only Zuari Agro Chemicals was actually excluded.

Global Footprint

With so much money to invest Norges Bank Investment Management’s footprint spans the globe and it owns close to 1.5% of all listed companies in the world.

Other companies exposed to child labor that counted the fund as a shareholder as of the end of 2020 included Nestle Hershey Mondelez International Inc. Procter & Gamble Co. Starbucks Corp. and Lindt & Spruengli AG. The fund’s investments in those companies including Barry Callebaut amounted to more than $16 billion.

While some progress is being made the task remains monumental.

Barry Callebaut says poverty is the root of the problem and that it works to alleviate it provide access to education and raise awareness. It has a code of conduct regarding human rights forced labor and child labor that all employees are obliged to follow.

Working with the International Cocoa Initiative in 2019/20 the company monitored and took remedial action covering 113 farmer groups including 39909 farmers in Ivory Coast and Ghana. It uncovered 22965 cases of child labor.

“ESG has moved from a peripheral investment criteria to a central one” the company said in an emailed statement. “Barry Callebaut welcomes the dialogue with its shareholders on ESG topics.”

Cocoa-producing nations in West Africa have come under increased pressure to clean up the industry with a report last year sponsored by the U.S. government showing that despite chocolate companies pledging to cut child labor the problem actually got worse in the 10 years prior to the publication of the report.

Lagging ESG Standards

While the EU prepares to introduce stricter laws later this year Europe remains the leading destination for Ivorian beans accounting for 67% of its cocoa exports. As fund managers wait for global ESG standards they’ve created their own methodologies to fill in the perceived gaps.

Norges Bank Investment Management says divestments tied to ESG standards are set to rise as it screens for wrongdoers.

The fund has set seven criteria for sustainable investing according to Ihenacho. For the S in ESG it looks at how well companies protect children’s rights and human rights whether they’re transparent taxpayers and whether they avoid corruption.

Over the past two decades the ethics council has successively introduced socially responsible guidelines for the fund manager to follow ranging from selling stakes in fossil-fuel companies to blacklisting firms that abuse migrant workers or dabble in corrupt practices.

After Walmart Inc. was beset by criticism for human rights violations in 2005 including the risk of child labor the fund sold out. The retail giant cleaned up its act and was removed from the fund’s exclusion list more than a decade later in 2019. Norway now owns a stake in Walmart valued at about $2.1 billion.

In a more recent instance the fund has for two years voted in favor of a proposal at Facebook Inc. “to assess the risk of possible exploitation of children on the company’s platforms” Aaltvedt said.

Measuring Misconduct

The fund says it’s harder to catch companies guilty of social misconduct than to identify climate sinners.

“It’s quite clear that the S is in many ways harder to quantify and measure” than the E in ESG Ihenacho said.

Amnesty International in Norway which follows the wealth fund closely says the screening can be tightened up.

“It would have been better if the fund could have avoided investing in a company where there’s a high risk of breaching the ethics council’s framework” said Hanne Sofie Lindahl political adviser at Amnesty in Oslo. “Preemptive screening in countries where we know that there are widespread abuses of human rights could help strengthen the fund’s ethical framework.”

The fund’s chief executive officer Nicolai Tangen says databases with different sustainability targets now used on portfolio companies will be used to improve its screening of companies being considered for addition.

“You have good and bad companies in all countries really” Tangen said in a June 2 live-streamed discussion. “The goal is to keep the rotten apples out of the basket.”

Children aged 12 to 18-years-old should not drink more than 100mg of caffeine a day - but energy drinks contain from about 50 mg to 500 mg of caffeine per serving.

This comes after a young man was left fighting for his life due to his energy drink habit - and is warning others to avoid the same fate.

The unnamed 21-year-old developed heart failure after drinking an “excessive” amount of the caffeinated beverage doctors say.

He drank four 500ml energy drinks a day for two years before he needed hospital care a report in a leading medical journal revealed.

It is not clear which energy drink was his favourite with popular brands including Red Bull Monster and Relentless.

London doctors wrote in BMJ Case Report that the university student sought help after suffering with shortness of breath and weight loss for four months.

He’d also had bouts of indigestion tremors and heart palpitations.

Blood tests scans and ECG readings revealed that he had both heart and kidney failure – with the kidney failure linked to a long standing and previously undiagnosed condition.

Docs from Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust considered a number of diagnoses but concluded: “Energy drink-induced cardiotoxicity was felt to be the most likely cause.”

A dad who had a heart attack after drinking 12 cans of energy drinks every day for a year has warned about excessive consumption of the products.

Lee Kamen collapsed from a heart attack after guzzling between eight and 12 cans a day Hull Live reports.

After a shop sold his 10-year-old daughter an energy drink can he is keen to educate adults and kids about the risks of excessive drinking them.

Children and adolescents aged 12 to 18-years-old should not drink more than 100mg of caffeine a day which is equivalent to a cup of coffee.

Energy drinks contain from about 50 mg to a whopping 500 mg of caffeine per serving.

In around 15 minutes Tejaswini was smiling from a billboard on the facade of the Morgan Stanley’s office at 1585 Broadway. The 20-yearold’s photo was captioned ‘Welcome 2021 summer analysts and associates’.She is among 277 Indian students interning with the company from colleges in Bengaluru and Mumbai.While 13 students from MCC  16 from Jain deemed to be University and 18 from PES University are part of the internship programme there are a few from some other city colleges too. All MCC Jain and PES students among others appeared on the billboards.All Bengaluru students had their moment of glory at Times Square as part of the campaign a global marketing initiative of Morgan Stanley. “It felt too good to be true. Friends asked me whether I edited the photo! My parents are so proud of me” said Tejaswini a second-year BBA student. The students are doing a10-week internship with the company.“Every year Morgan Stanley welcomes thousands of interns to the firm. There is usually excitement on Day 1 but in 2021 given the Covid-19 pandemic and shift to a virtual-only experience over 400 campus interns & experienced professionals who intern with us through the Morgan Stanley Return to Work Internship programme in India were all going to be working from home. In order to welcome and engage the interns; to create a sense of community when in office and replicate the excitement and appreciation the ‘India Interns Lights on Broadway’ campaign was launched. It was to feature individual photos of interns on digital screens at 1585 Morgan Stanley headquarters on Times Square New York among the most visible screens on Wall Street” said the company.The campaign was launched in February 2021 when 91 Spring Interns from India were featured. In March 58 Return to Work interns and in early June 277 summer interns featured in similar campaigns. “We got offer letters for internship by 2020-end. I work in client support service in operations and it’s a great learning experience. We were asked to give photos but not told what they were for. We were told there’s a surprise in store. When it happened it was overwhelming. It took me a lot of time to find myself in that display. Many friends spotted me faster. Morgan Stanley made us feel really special” said Charu Raheja an MCC student.“When Covid numbers dipped by 2020-end we hoped we could go to office in April this year and get the corporate experience.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc which has opened its US offices to staff this week has told its UK staff in a memo that working at its London office is voluntary for now. Those who opt to attend office will observe strict social distancing and mask-wearing. The bank says plans of allowing a full workforce are postponed until July.

JPMorgan Chase & Co too sent a memo postponing openings its offices until July. A majority of its US office workers will be rejoining next month.

The investment banks were planning to bring back staff on rotational basis capped at 50 percent occupancy. Both the banks already had 20-30 percent staff working out of offices with proper protocol in place. Hence they are well equipped by now to entertain more numbers with proper distancing and other norms in place.

The banks believe that delaying the reopening till July 19 in the UK will give a chance to all personnel to get fully vaccinated. Currently about 41 million people have received their first shot and nearly 30 million have had both doses – about 57% of the adult population in the country.

The majority of Goldman Sachs employees have “either had their first dose (of the vaccine) or expect to receive it before Monday 21 June” Richard Gnodde head of Goldman Sachs International wrote in his memo to staff.

Bank bosses are split over whether staff should come back to the office full-time or work from home for some or all days of the week. Goldman Sachs’ group chief executive David Solomon has described working from home as “an aberration”.

NatWest chief executive Alison Rose said the bank would hold conversations with staff over the summer about what options they want. “I would say that we’ve busted the myth that jobs need to be done in a certain way” she previously told staff. “We have learnt new ways of working and it’s important we carry those learnings forward.”

Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman speaking at a conference earlier this week said that it’s time for the bank’s New York workers to head back to the office now that more people are getting vaccinated. “If you can go to a restaurant in New York City you can come into the office. And we want you in the office” Gorman said. He added that “well over 90%” of employees already had received Covid-19 shots and that he expected that number to eventually reach 98% to 99%.

Barclays Bank said that it expected to “invite” more staff back to the office over the summer but said it was “moving towards a hybrid way of working”.

Barclays chief Jes Staley had previously said home working was “not sustainable” for large financial institutions.

All over Europe there are cracks in roads and pavements uprooted by sprawling trees. Ememem an anonymous artist based in France has a solution. Since 2016 he has been fixing broken asphalt not by filling in holes with tar and concrete but by laying down colourful mosaics in cement. Each pattern and design is different.

The young artist works throughout Europe but mostly in France Spain Italy and Norway. He calls his practice “flacking” now the given term for setting beautiful tiles in broken streets. Some local councils remove the work. Many allow it to stay there. Some authorities Ememem says have started inviting him to flack in their towns: he is finding fame by way of muddled mosaics.

“When I discovered flacking it didn’t have a name. In fact it didn’t exist and neither did I” he tells i. “Flacking comes from a whole series of experiences I have had with ceramic materials but above all from an old holey road that accompanied me to work every morning. One day I decided to repair it.”

Ememem says his name comes from the sound of his scooter the transport he uses to carry out his covert artistry under the cover of darkness. The term flacking meanwhile “jumped out of a bottle of champagne on an evening with friends” he explains. It was

derived from the French word “flaque” or “puddle”.

Though shrouded in secrecy it is known that Ememem began flacking in Lyon France. It was there he first became “obsessed with pouring light into dusty old concrete holes”.

“I love working on all aspects of flacking. Walking around the town listening to the potholes that speak to me letting myself become carried away by poetry and the smell of wet bitumen. I work in the middle of the night and experience improbable encounters. I love it all”.

Each pattern and design is different. (Photo: @ememem)

The legality of Ememem’s flacking is a grey area. Buildings he says are a little harder but few are likely to complain upon finding a gap in a run-down walkway has been transformed by bright intricate tiling.

The artist explains: “It depends on where you make them. Many times it has been complicated but personally I never have the feeling of doing something bad.

“I have never had problems with the police – they often greet me and compliment me and stay to see how it turns out.”

He continues: “People tend to be enthused by flacking. The choice of place is mainly dictated by the poetic potential released by different elements: the shape of the hole its surroundings its aura what it has to tell me.

“Potholes tell stories. One in Barcelona told me of a day of clashes between the police and Catalan separatists. Another in Paris told me of an accident between a cyclist and a truck carrying flowers to the market.

“Each hole has its own story and I am there to take note suspend space and time and transform the city into an intimate diary. It is life that draws me to certain areas.”

In February the Chancellor Rishi Sunak promised a fund of £2.5bn to have Britain’s 10 million potholes repaired. Some might hope Ememem gets there first.

“I can’t say much but very soon the first UK flacking will arrive. And then the Moon maybe” he says. Ememem’s ambition is endless.

‘Very soon the first UK flacking will arrive.’ (Photo: @ememem)

It is also difficult not to compare him to Banksy an artist who also adds life to downtrodden city corners and remains unknown despite continued speculation.

There is also the issue of pretenders – or more kindly those who wish to spread flacking further afield.

“I’m someone discreet. I like to stay in the shadows and I don’t say a lot about my future projects. I love to be anonymous.

“I don’t know if I started an art or underground movement. Maybe it will take years to tell

but if others start doing it it would be an honour for a son of bitumen like me.

“I have seen some repeat flacking around the world.”

Few flacks if any will look as mesmerising as those by Ememem which spiral from the obscurest of pavement edges. He is after all a skilled ceramicist who shows his work in Paris galleries.

But he is also willing to teach others to help rid Europe of its potholes.

The highly talented designer reveals that sales shot up during the pandemic and her clients don’t mind being on the waitlist!

Shachee Shah

Mumbai-based jewellery designer and goldsmith Shachee Shah specialises in two signature jewellery styles. In one she magically weaves gold threads to resemble the fineries of Venetian Lace replete with flowers vines and fauna.

Shah has also mastered the age-old Italian art of micro-mosaic creating scenic imagery with minute pieces of tesserae (glass) in a canvas size that is less than one square inch. The pieces of art are given an ornate touch with gold diamonds. Sometimes she combines the two styles. Crafted into earrings necklaces rings and more the final works belie the patience and time needed to create each piece. Shah is a one-woman army and often has a waitlist for her creations.

Her eponymous brand founded in 2008 has had a steady number of clients who are seeking out her wearable works of art but the pandemic took it to another level. In this interview Shah talks about consumers going beyond material value to finding an emotional connect with her work and making it a part of their jewelled collectibles.

How has business been in the last one year?

It has been exceptional surprisingly. A lot of people who have been seeing my work online and have had it on their wish list decided to make the jump and indulge in it during the pandemic. Even though there is no immediate occasion to wear the jewellery they have dipped into their savings to acquire my pieces.

On the wedding front earlier my pieces were part of a bridal trousseau but were upgraded to bridal wear or a wedding function during the last one year. Since the gatherings have been more intimate people are looking to invest in jewellery which is even more detailed. This is plus point where my work stands out. In a close circuit there are many more opportunities to admire the details up close rather than at a large function.

I have also had the chance to interact and reach out to international consumers as well as those in tier-II and tier-III cities in India. Facebook and Instagram have done magic. Everybody has opened up to zoom meets and is open to visualise how it will look digitally rather than trying it on physically before purchasing.

Micro-mosaic earrings featuring a bouquet of flowers surrounded by 18-karat gold lace by Shachee Shah

Are people opting for your gold creations or micro-mosaic?

I am focusing more on my micro-mosaic pieces because the awareness of the art and the demand has increased.

People always appreciate my gold lace work. Those who buy my gold line like art but are also looking for material value. On the other hand consumers who appreciate craftsmanship veer towards the micro-mosaic collection. I was initially worried that people might not see value in glass the basic element for micro mosaic. I am happy to share that people have started seeing it as an art work a collectable item an heirloom that can be passed down the line.

Are there any new collections in the offing?

I am working on a collection of micro-mosaic mismatched earrings. The rationale behind it is that a client will get two co-ordinated but different pieces. It not only adds drama but offers more value. This should be ready by Dussehra 2021. I am also exploring new colours which complement our Indian skin tone.

A lot of unusual projects are also coming my way. I am working on a clutch bag with micro-mosaic in gold a portrait and an interior décor element for someone’s home. These all take time and are in the works at the moment. I am still completing last year’s orders as the lockdown created a delay in procuring raw materials.

Are you working on any daily wear pieces?

I do have a range of daily wear pieces in my Venetian Lace collection in gold but I haven’t promoted it too much since I am a one-person army.

I would love to further scale down my micro mosaic but it is not feasible at the moment. Instead I am trying to make them as statement as possible in the current scale of things.

Shah challenges herself to make the imagery even smaller and finer in each of her pieces

How has consumer’s mindset changed during the pandemic?

People are making an emotional connect with my micro mosaic pieces. There is a lot of imagery that one can capture in mosaic. A mother bought a piece because the reminded her of her daughter. Jewellery that feature flowers especially roses are very popular with men who are buying it for their wives. I want people to continue to resonate with the pieces. These times have really thrown light on everyone’s emotional quotient and whatever one says jewellery that has been inherited or symbolises something is more attractive to the wearer.",,,,,,

Google acquired Motorola Mobility in 2012 ​and sold it to Lenovo in 2014. The Z series smartphones are nearly stock Android with a bit of Moto customization thrown in. They compete well with flagship phones from Google and Samsung. Here's a look at Motorola's recent Z phone releases.

Motorola continues to release Android smartphones  including the Z series which is compatible with Moto Mods. The Mods are a series of accessories that attach to your smartphone using magnets to add features such as a projector speaker or battery pack.

: Android 10.0 Release Date: June 2019 The Moto Z4 (Verizon exclusive) is a 5G-upgradeable phone meaning it can connect to Verizon's 5G network wherever it's available. With a 48 MP night vision-capable rear camera a 25 MP selfie camera and up to two days of battery life the Z4 stands out from the competition. Now with an integrated fingerprint sensor on the display glass the phone has never been more secure. And in a move sure to please audiophiles the 3.5 mm headset jack is back. The Z4 is compatible with Moto Mods has a Nano SD card slot and is available in a 128 GB version.

: 9.0 Pie Release Date: July 2018 The Moto Z3 (Verizon exclusive) and Z3 Play (unlocked) are very similar smartphones the main difference being carrier compatibility and price. The biggest difference is that the Z3 is 5G-ready meaning it can connect to Verizon's 5G network when it launches. Both smartphones are compatible with Moto Mods have micro SD card slots and lack headphones jacks. In addition the phones have side-mounted fingerprint sensors located underneath the volume buttons. The Z3 comes in a 64 GB configuration while the Z3 Play has 32 GB 64 GB and 128 GB versions.

: 7.1.1 Nougat Final Android version : 8.0 Oreo for most carriers 9.0 Pie for Verizon

: 8.0 Oreo for most carriers 9.0 Pie for Verizon Release Date: July 2017 The Z2 Force is an incremental update to the Z Force; the two smartphones are very much alike. The most significant upgrades are the processor camera a redesigned fingerprint scanner and an available update to Android 8.0 Oreo. It also has more carrier support in the U.S. than the Z Force did. The fingerprint sensor is a bit larger than the Z Force's. It also responds better to gesture controls that enable the scanner to act as a Home back and current apps key. Plus it can put the phone to sleep. The Z2 Force has two 12-megapixel cameras on the back producing higher-quality photos than a single lens. The secondary sensor shoots in monochrome so you can get black-and-white snaps. It also helps you create the bokeh effect in which part of the photo is in focus while the background is blurred out. The selfie camera has an LED flash for well-lit self-portraits. Otherwise the Z2 Force is just like the Z Force. It features the same ShatterShield technology that protects it from everyday drops and bumps; however the bezel is prone to scratches. It only has a single speaker embedded in the earpiece. To get better sound you might consider the JBL SoundBoost Moto Mod. Neither of the Force smartphones has a headphone jack but they come with a USB-C adaptor. Both have micro SD card slots.

: 9.0 Pie Release Date: June 2017 The Moto Z2 Play breaks with Motorola tradition and gives both the Verizon and unlocked version the same name rather than tacking Droid to the end of the Verizon version. The Z2 Play adds a variety of voice commands including ""OK Google"" which wakes up the phone and launches Google Assistant and ""Show me"" which you can use to summon weather information and launch apps. ""Show me"" commands work even when the phone is locked and these commands only work with your voice for security's sake. The fingerprint scanner works as a Home button unlike previous models and responds to gestures to go back and show recent apps. This design is an improvement as many reviewers mistook the scanner for the Home button on older smartphones. Still the gestures can sometimes be challenging to execute. The metal back is compatible with Moto Mods. Its battery life isn't as impressive as the Z Force phones but that can be improved by attaching TurboPower Pack Moto Mod. It also has a headphone jack which the Z Force models lack and a micro SD slot.

: 8.0 Oreo Release Date: July 2016 The Moto Z Force Droid is a high-end smartphone exclusive to Verizon with a rugged display protected by Shattershield technology and a metal finish on the back. You'll find many preinstalled Verizon apps on this smartphone along with smart gestures from Motorola including a karate chop motion that turns on the flashlight. The fingerprint scanner is on the front just below the Home button because of the available Moto Mods that attach to the phone's back. Mods include a JBL SoundBoost speaker and a Moto Insta-Share Projector. Like many high-end smartphones the Z Force Droid lacks a headphone jack but comes with a USB-C adapter. It also has a micro SD card slot. The camera which you can launch with a twisting gesture has optical image stabilization to combat blurry photos.

6.0.1 Marshmallow Final Android version: 8.0 Oreo

8.0 Oreo Release Date: July 2016 The Moto Z Play Droid (Verizon) and the Moto Z Play (unlocked) are mid-range devices compared to the Moto Z and Z Force smartphones which are faster and lighter. The added bulk is due to a larger battery that Lenovo (which owns Motorola) says will last for up to 50 hours on a single charge. The smartphones also retain the much-loved-by-many headphone jack that new models often eschew. The Z Play models lack the ShatterShield display featured on the Z and Z Force phones and the back is glass rather than metal. Another difference is that the Z Play cameras lack optical image stabilization to compensate for shaky hands. Like other smartphones in the Z series it's easy to mistake the fingerprint scanner for a Home button. While the Verizon version comes jammed with bloatware the unlocked version (AT&T and T-Mobile) has only a few Motorola add-ons including a series of gestures and a one-handed mode. Smart gestures include a Star Wars-inspired Jedi move in which you wave your hand over the smartphone's face to light it up and show your notifications and the time. Both models have micro SD card slots for extra storage.",,,,,,,,,,,,

We ASX investors love our Australian shares. And fair enough too. The S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) has been a great place historically to find great companies to invest your money into for long-term gains. However like any index the ASX 200 isn't perfect. It's heavy on ASX banks and miners and light on tech companies. At least where it counts: market-capitalisation weighting.

That's where the US markets can come in handy. Not only is America home to some of the best companies in the world such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). it also offers ASX investors some exposure to trends and sectors that the ASX 200 just can't.

So here are 3 ASX exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have the potential to easily expose any ASX investor's portfolio to the US markets.

3 ASX ETFs that can offer ASX investors easy US markets exposure

iShares S&P 500 ETF (ASX: IVV)

Here we have a simple cheap US-based index fund. The S&P 500 Index (INDEXSP: .INX) is one of the largest and most-tracked index in the world. It holds 500 of the largest companies in the US. That's everything from Apple and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) to Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE). This is the index that IVV tracks. This ETF has been an objectively solid performer over the past 10 years returning an average of 17.93% per annum. it also has one of the lowest management fees of any ETF on the ASX at 0.04% per annum.

BetaShares Nasdaq 100 ETF (ASX: NDQ)

Another US-based index fund here. But instead of the S&P 500 NDQ tracks the Nasdaq-100 (INDEXNASDAQ: NDX). This index is a little different holding only the companies that list on the Nasdaq exchange. The Nasdaq is one of the major stock exchanges in the US but it's a lot newer than its main rival the New York Stock Exchange. As such it tends to house mostly tech companies. It's largest holdings are Apple Microsoft and other tech giants like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX).

NDQ charges a management fee of 0.48% per annum and has retuned an average of 20.94% per annum since its inception in 2015.

VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (ASX: MOAT)

This ETF is a little different from the above examples as it is not an index fund. Rather it can be described as an 'active ETF'. That's because it invests in companies that meet certain criteria – that of a wide economic moat. VanEck works with Morningstar to identify a concentrated portfolio of at least 40 US shares that show signs of a 'wide moat'.

'Moat' is a Warren Buffett term that describes a company's intrinsic competitive advantage. This can be in a powerful brand cost advantage or other factors that enable a company to stay on top of its competition. Some of MOAT's top holdings include Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) and Buffett's own Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). MOAT charges a management fee of 0.49% per annum. It has returned an average of 20.38% per annum since its inception in 2015.",,,,,,,,,

You can use this app on your smartphone tablet computers and even TVs. The user experience is pretty decent overall in the apps but there may be a few things that you are unintentionally ignoring. In this tutorial I will give you a few Netflix tips to improve your entertainment experience.

Netflix Tips to Enhance User Experience

You may already be aware of a few of these tips and some may actually be new to you. So read along.

Netflix Tip 1: Switch Off Autoplay

Sometimes when you are simply browsing to watch something the trailers start to play and that too with sound. It is very annoying and there is a way to turn this Autoplay off.

Step-1: Open your Netflix app on your Windows 10 computer.

Step-2: Open the profile for which you want to change the settings for.

Step-3: Click on the three dots on the top right corner of the app.



Step-4: Select Settings.



Step-5: Click on Account Details.



Step-6: You will be directed to your browser and the Netflix settings will open here. Click on the profile you want to manage changes for.



Step-8: When the settings expand scroll down a little and click on Change next to the Playback Settings.



Step-9: Uncheck Autoplay previews while browsing on all devices. Click Save.



Tip 2: Switch Off Post-Play

You can also switch off the ‘Play next episode’ feature. This feature we all love but sometimes when you try to resist the temptation of binge-watching an entire season in one go turning off this setting helps.

Open your Netflix app on your Windows 10 computer. Open the profile for which you want to change the settings for. Click on the three dots on the top right corner of the app. Select Settings. Click on Account Details. You will be directed to your browser and the Netflix settings will open here. Click on the profile you want to manage changes for. When the settings expand click on Change next to the Playback Settings. Uncheck the Autoplay next episode in a series on all devices box. Click Save.

Tip 3: Get Better Algorithm Recommendations

This is something that I wasn’t aware of for a very long time. If you don’t rate what you watched Netflix automatically assumes that you liked it and it will recommend similar movies or shows. So if you want to get better recommendations in your algorithm make sure you rate it.

Step-1: Open your Netflix App.

Step-2: Click on the show/movie you just watched.

Step-3: Click on the thumbs-up rate button.



Step-4: Now select thumbs up or thumbs down depending on your experience.



Netflix Tip 4: Use VPN

Netflix provides different shows and movies in different regions. So if you don’t like the shows from your region or want different options get a VPN. Change the server and log in to your Netflix account again. This is a great option. For example if you are a fan of anime then logging in from Japan will give you many anime options. If you want to watch British TV shows then you should log in from the UK.

Tip 5: Change Subtitle Styles

You can always stick to the default subtitle styles but you can style the subtitles if you want to add a little more customization to your profile.

Open your Netflix app on your Windows 10 computer. Open the profile for which you want to change the settings for. Click on the three dots on the top right corner of the app. Select Settings. Click on Account Details. You will be directed to your browser and the Netflix settings will open here. Click on the profile you want to manage changes for. Select Change next to Subtitle appearance.

From here you can change color font text size and add shadows to the font style. Once you are done click Save if you want to go back to the default style select Reset to default.



Tip 6: Test Participation

If you are one of those people who like to try things before they become popular then Netflix has that feature as well. You can preview features before they get a wide release.

Open your Netflix app on your Windows 10 computer. Open the profile for which you want to change the settings for. Click on the three dots on the top right corner of the app. Select Settings. Click on Account Details. In the Settings section click on Test participation.

Turn the toggle switch On. Then select Done.

I hope these Netflix tips help and add to your overall user experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9hd2FrZS1vbi1uZXRmbGl4LXRoZS1lbmRpbmctZXhwbGFpbmVkLWFuZC1hbGwteW91ci1xdWVzdGlvbnMtYW5zd2VyZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Awake on Netflix: The ending explained and all your questions answered,"What happens when everyone in the world loses the ability to fall asleep? We all go mad according to Netflix's Awake a sci-fi thriller starring Gina Rodriguez as a mom protecting her children during an ""extinction event"". If you missed the flick's explanation for how the world reached this state here are some answers including what's next after that hopeful ending.

Warning: Spoilers ahead

Why do people lose the ability to fall asleep?

While Jill's in custody at the military hub Major Murphy starts talking about the no-sleeping phenomenon. ""It was some sort of a solar flare"" she says continuing ""It changed our electromagnetic wiring. It affected our glymphatic system. Messed with our clocks.""

Let's break all of that down. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency ""Solar flares are large eruptions of energy coming off the Sun containing several different forms of energy: heat magnetic energy and ionizing radiation."" So that ionizing radiation which can damage satellites made it through the Earth's atmosphere which normally protects us. The magnetic energy interrupted everything from radios to our electromagnetic wiring.

What's our electromagnetic wiring? According to one simple definition ""You are an electric field -- a giant electric field which holds your atoms together and which uses other electric fields to talk to other bits of yourself."" As for your glymphatic system according to Nueronline ""The glymphatic system is a network of vessels that clear waste from the central nervous system (CNS) mostly during sleep."" This explains the acceleration of everyone's descent into madness.

Why don't cars work anymore?

We first see the power cut that kicks off events when Jill (Rodriguez) is driving. She Noah and Matilda hear static on the radio then it crackles and shuts off. Several cars veer across the road and Jill slams the breaks only for another car to smash them into the nearby lake. Later a soldier says ""Anything with a microchip is fried."" Cars use semiconductors tiny but critical chips for fuel injection infotainment systems and cruise control. The first microprocessor chips were put in cars in the early '80s. The men at the garage get a Dodge Polara first introduced in the early '60s working again by fitting it with an older battery. ""We need an old car no electrics"" one of them says.

Why can Matilda fall asleep?

After emerging from the lake Jill and Noah see Matilda already on the bank where police officers perform CPR and revive her. The sheriff says she was ""out for a minute"" and that she'll be fine. Of course later Matilda realizes that in that minute she was actually dead. But the new rules of the world saw her come back to life with the ability to fall asleep. ""Maybe I started over."" Basically the solution to the sleep problem is a factory reset: Turn yourself off and on again.

How exactly does Murphy die with the syringe?

Early on Matilda demonstrates that you must ""always clear out the air"" from a syringe before her grandmother Doris uses one. Later at the military hub Dr. Katz saves Matilda from being experimented on by using a syringe to inject Jennifer Jason Leigh's Major Murphy without clearing out the air first. According to Healthline ""These air bubbles can travel to your brain heart or lungs and cause a heart attack stroke or respiratory failure."" It isn't clear which of these Murphy suffers when she collapses -- all we know for sure is that she's not getting up.

Is Jill's husband dead?

Pictures on the mantle of Doris' house show Jill's wedding picture with her husband in military uniform. Later when Dodge asks Noah what happened to his father Noah says ""He died in the war.""

Why does Jill not have custody of her children?

When Doris asks Jill for sleeping medication Jill replies ""I don't do that anymore. You know the judge said that I wasn't allowed."" Doris implies Jill might have used drugs herself saying ""Well I guess you really aren't using if you're awake too."" Jill's troubled past (and present) explains why the children live with their grandmother.

Did Jill used to be in the army?

Yes. When Jill is caught snooping around Murphy's office for sleeping pills and a soldier catches her she says ""I'm 68 Whiskey. Corporal Adams. Out of Fort Huachuca.""

How do Jill and Murphy know each other?

Jill thanks Murphy a psychiatrist whose expertise is sleep for getting her a job as a security guard at the unnamed university. Jill later tells her son Noah that she and Murphy worked together in the army overseas. ""In the desert Murphy would help set parameters for interrogation. Sleep deprivation it was torture"" Jill explains adding ""They killed people."" No wonder Jill can't trust Murphy with Matilda.

Why does Jill want to go to the hub?

Despite knowing what Murphy is capable of Jill realizes she must rescue the woman being held at the hub who's also able to fall asleep. Jill needs her because otherwise there won't be anyone to take care of Matilda when she dies.

Why is there a shoot up at the military hub?

Murphy explains that the soldiers inject a cocktail that helps with mental acuity but it also causes some neurological damage. After six days the soldiers start to hallucinate. One soldier sees what he believes to be a grenade but is in fact a pinecone. The soldiers start shooting at the thin air -- and then at each other.

What happens to Noah?

After Noah cuts into a wire believing it's a fish which his dad had taught him how to debone he's badly electrocuted. Jill attempts to revive him with a defibrillator but because she and Matilda are touching him and each other the electrical current passes through all of them reducing the shock needed to restart Noah's heart or shock it back into its correct rhythm.

Does Jill survive?

After the kids deduce that they must kill their mother for her to restart they drown her. They attempt to revive her using CPR chest compressions. When the screen goes black we hear Jill gasp confirming she comes back to life. Now that the Adams family have figured out how to restart everyone's ""clocks"" they can no doubt use Jill's military contacts to spread the word and save the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c3RsZS5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC90di1zaG93cy1saWtlLXNleC1hbmQtdGhlLWNpdHktb24tbmV0ZmxpeNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 Shows To Watch On Netflix If You Love 'Sex And The City',"The Sex and the City reboot probably won't air until late 2021 and when it does it has some big shoes to fill. The original series which ran on HBO over six seasons from 1998 to 2004 has already spawned two commercially successful movie spin-offs — the first grossed $415 million worldwide while the latter managed $294 million — though this time the show has to cope without the return of Samantha played by Kim Cattrall. Much ink has already been spilled about whether the show can do so effectively (some think yes others say no) but perhaps it doesn’t matter either way; there are plenty of great shows like Sex and the City on Netflix that serve the show’s quintessential blend of friendship glamour and romantic mishaps.

On this list you’ll find other shows written by SATC creator Darren Star who was little involved in the final few seasons of the HBO original and found the resolution with Carrie marrying Mr Big rather unsatisfying. “I think the show ultimately betrayed what it was about which was that women don't ultimately find happiness from marriage"" Star said in The Kindle Singles interview. Besides that there’s plenty of friendship drama A-plus fashion and yes lots and lots of sex.

Emily in Paris

Lily Collins in Emily in Paris Carole Bethuel/Netflix

This Netflix original series was created by Star so in many ways it has a very similar vibe. It stars Lily Collins as the titular Emily who moves to Paris to take a new PR job. She's woefully out of place in her new city and she's also kind of oblivious to how ridiculous she is — not at all unlike Carrie. If you loved the Paris episodes of SATC then you'll love that this whole series takes place in the romantic city and you’ll also love that the fashion is particularly jazzy since it was costume designed by Patricia Field. In fact Field told Fashionista in an interview that ""For me Emily in Paris in certain ways was an elongated version of Carrie in Sex and the City. It's about an American in Paris. Paris is the place for passion. Paris is exciting."" In fact so enamored is Field with her new gig that she will not return to work on the SATC reboot so she can focus on the costumes for Emily in Paris season 2.

New Girl

If Emily in Paris strikes the fashion note from Sex and the City Fox’s New Girl’s strikes a different note entirely. Instead of four successful ladies living their dreams in NYC this is a cast of roommates who are trying to survive and thrive in Los Angeles. Yes Jess (played by Zooey Deschanel) wears some cute dresses and headbands but at its heart this is a show about friendship love sex and the sacrifices one makes to keep all those things in one’s life. It’s also laugh-out-loud funny thanks to Deschanel’s brilliant co-stars Jake Johnson Max Greenfield Lamorne Morris and Hannah Simone. There were seven seasons in total running from 2011 to 2018 so there are 146 hours to work through including a will-they-wont-they finale that fans of Carrie and Big will enjoy.

Girlboss

If you've ever rewatched Sex and the City then you've probably noticed that Carrie is quite an unlikeable lead character even though you root for her and want her to win. Well so is Sophia in Girlboss except unlike in SATC this was far more intentional. “I think that's sort of the point to the show to be honest with you” said Britt Robertson who played Sophia for the show’s one season run on Netflix in a previous interview with Bustle. “She's not a traditional female heroine. But you know I think it's all fair. You can feel however you want to feel about the character."" Sophia is a fashion entrepreneur who finds herself jobless broke and behind on her rent until she buys a jacket on eBay and turns a stunning profit ($9 to $600 if you must know). She then sets up her business and well it turns out she’s kind of a sh*tty person. However it's still a super fun watch if you just accept that you're going to be yelling at your TV when she keeps messing up.

Grace & Frankie

If Sex and the City had kept going and we watched the characters grow old together it may well have turned into the titular characters of Grace & Frankie. The Emmy-nominated Netflix original follows the aftermath of two women's marriages falling apart when their husbands who are also work colleagues and best friends leave them for each other. What comes next is an unlikely but sweet friendship between the uptight Grace (Jane Fonda) and the hippy Frankie (Lily Tomlin). Together the two commandeer the beach house which the two couples previously shared turning it into their own domain where they date cute younger men and eventually create their own lube and launch a vibrator line for seniors. Is that not absolutely something that Samantha would do? Watch all six seasons on Netflix — the seventh and final season is delayed as filming was halted due to COVID-19 — to find out.

Schitt's Creek

Schitt’s Creek Pop TV

Here is a show where the fashion game is totally on SATC's level though it’s a little less earnest in how it’s talked about on the show itself (yes there will be cooing over clothes but there will also be mocking about said cooing). Nevertheless style is still a big part of the show’s six season run which saw them nabbing nine Emmys in their final season. “Wardrobe is probably the most important element in storytelling outside of actually writing” WWD quotes Dan Levy as saying in a behind-the-scenes special. In the same interview we also learn that Daphne Guinness served as the inspiration for Moira Rose’s style played to Emmy-winning perfection by Catherine O'Hara (who also personally suggested all the wigs) while Annie Murphy’s character Alexis Rose wore a mixture of Isabel Marant Celine and Chloé. Besides the fashion the show focuses on yet another cast of unlikeable characters that you just can't help but love despite their many many flaws. Sound familiar?

Girlfriends

This eight-season show came out in 2000 — just two year’s after the release of the first season of Sex and the City — and it has a ton of similar themes. Set in Los Angeles it shares the stories of a group of Black women as they navigate friendship love and career with each other by their sides. Among the cast is Tracee Ellis Ross who earned a BET Comedy award in 2005 for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series thanks to this show. There are some 172 episodes of the show from its 8 year-run which was partly shaped in reaction to the limitations of SATC. “When I saw Sex and The City I didn’t see myself represented” show runner Mara Brock Akil told Vibe in 2015. “Also the type of shows that were on for black people were more like family sitcoms. I wanted to do sophisticated [shows] for young adults.”

Grey's Anatomy

At first glance Grey's Anatomy might appear to be a category in its own right but when you break it down it’s another show SATC fans will like. Even if you have watched it already with 16 seasons to go through a re-watch will probably uncover storylines you totally forgot about. Plus for fans of the sex in Sex and the City the Emmy-winning show has plenty of steamy hookups and nicknames for love interests (McSteamy and McDreamy anyone?). Plus there are lots of close friendships — namely Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) and Cristina (Sandra Oh) who coined the expression “my person” — and a dose of heart-racing medical drama. Everything a good TV series needs.

Girlfriend's Guide to Divorce

Self-help author Abby (Lisa Edelstein) sees her career falter when she announces that she and her husband are separating. Good thing she had a great group of friends to turn to when the going gets tough. Like Sex and the City Girlfriend's Guide to Divorce was a book first namely The Girlfriends' Guide series written by Vicki Iovine. Ironically Iovine never actually wrote about divorce — her books were more about motherhood — though that didn’t stop the series clocking up a five season run with Girlfriends' Guide to Freedom Girlfriends' Guide to Bossing Up and Girlfriends' Guide to Ever After in seasons three four and five respectively.

Bridgerton

Bridgerton LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX

Gossip romance betrayal steamy sex scenes — Bridgerton is just a period drama version of Sex and the City. Like Sex and the City which was inspired by the columns of Candace Bushnell Bridgerton has its own literary inspiration courtesy of Julia Quinn. The first season of the show was based on Quinn’s book The Duke and I and tells the story of scheming mothers and marriage through the experience of Daphne Bridgerton (Phoebe Dynevor) a young woman who needs to get married soon and Simon Bassett (Regé-Jean Page) the Duke of Hastings. The show which is set in Regency England is produced by Shonda Rhimes and features the kind of hot and heavy scenes Samantha would be proud of. There’s currently only one season of the show on Netflix but the second is already in production. You just know if this show came out in the SATC-verse Charlotte would be totally obsessed with it.

Jane the Virgin

Okay this show is a little more dramatic than SATC ever was since it borrows from the telenovela style of storytelling. The starting premise is that Jane a 23-year-old virgin from Miami falls pregnant after she is accidentally impregnated by her gynaecologist. But it has one of those classic Big or Aidan-esque TV love triangles that will divide you and your friends between those who think Jane (Gina Rodriguez) should end up with Rafeal (Justin Baldoni) or Michael (Brett Dier). Full warning: your opinion will even switch between episodes and you too may well become hooked like Miranda became to Jules & Mimi a sadly-not-real British sitcom.

Easy

Sex and the City was mostly about sex (duh) and so is Easy. The three-season series created by Joe Swanberg is made up of star-studded anthology episodes set in Chicago like the infamous Season 1 Episode 6 where Orlando Bloom and Malin Akerman play a couple looking for a threesome to shake things up in the bedroom. If you found SATC a little too heteronormative then Easy offers a much more inclusive look at sex and relationships with queer couples featuring outside of the Gay Best Friend trope. Other episodes star Dave Franco Marc Maron Jake Johnson Gugu Mbatha-Raw and more.

The streaming service recently unveiled the trailer for the show’s Season 2.

Per Netflix Season 2 of the coming-of-age comedy will follow Indian American teenager Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) as she continues to deal with the everyday pressures of high school and drama at home while also navigating new romantic relationships. The Season 2 trailer teases that Devi will face some competition via a new student — “another Indian girl who is prettier cooler” Devi exclaims with dismay in the trailer.

“Never Have I Ever” is created and executive produced by Kaling (“The Office”) with Lang Fisher serving as co-creator executive producer showrunner and writer. The Universal Television project is also executive produced by 3 Arts Entertainment’s Howard Klein and David Miner.

The first season of the show which premiered on Netflix in 2020 marked Kaling’s first series for the streaming service and was Ramakrishnan’s Hollywood debut. Other Season 1 stars included Poorna Jagannathan Richa Moorjani Benjamin Norris Adam Shapiro and Ramona Young.

“Never Have I Ever” Season 1 received strong reviews from critics including IndieWire’s Kristen Lopez who said it was a “must-watch for teen girls” in her grade B review in April 2020.

“Netflix appears to be in the coming-of-age business so much so that it’s easy to overlook one that doesn’t involve superheroes or overwhelming angst sex and drugs” Lopez said in her review. “This isn’t to shade any show in particular but to illustrate the mountain ‘Never Have I Ever’ has to climb. The new drama/comedy from co-creators Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher is the type of teen series aimed at the average teenager whose life might not be filled with orgies but their problems still make them feel like the entire world is going to implode nonetheless. Effervescent and droll scripts coupled with a vivacious cast of newcomers leads to a series that initially feels haphazard but leans into its awkwardness for an emotionally resonant series you want to see continue.”

Stream Time is where Tom's Guide senior editor Henry T. Casey dives into the big choices we make about streaming media. We tackle it all from the best and worst streaming services and devices to the never-ending list of shows to watch.

SharePlay announced at WWDC 2021 is the feature I needed throughout the pandemic. Similar to Netflix Party Disney Plus GroupWatch and other offerings SharePlay will let you enjoy a streamed movie or song at the same time with others and it adds a FaceTime call on top.

This is a huge gain for those of us who have been forced to go online for shared live experiences during the last year (and years prior). On a frequent basis I've used either Discord or Google Meet to watch shows with friends who I couldn't be in the same room with.

That's how my little horror movie club managed to keep the frights alive as well as how I managed to make some of the silliest movies of the last year — including Wonder Woman 1984 and Zack Snyder's Justice League — a bit more palatable watching and cracking jokes with friends.

That method though was flawed at best. We had to do a countdown at the start of the movie and it didn't always go right. Someone inevitably would get out of sync. Most of the time we weren't watching movies on Disney Plus Hulu or Prime Video so we couldn't use the existing options.

That said I can already see the cracks in the mold when it comes to SharePlay — and they start with the big red elephant in the room notable by its absence.

SharePlay partners and notable absences

Apple announced a pretty decent list of apps that will support SharePlay up front. You've got Disney Plus Hulu and ESPN Plus (the Disney Plus bundle) though the first two already have their own ways for synchronous viewing. SharePlay adds to the Disney Plus GroupWatch and Hulu Watch Party functionality with the addition of video calls via FaceTime.

As someone who has tried to juggle multiple devices and services at the same time for these calls to work out I'm excited at this kind of unification. SharePlay also features a trick that takes the effort out of these calls as Apple claims ""volume automatically adjusts so you can keep talking while you watch"" instead of muting and un-muting yourself.

HBO Max and Paramount Plus are two big partners for the service as they don't have any remote-watching functionality at all. The list of other announced apps includes the NBA app Pluto TV TikTok Twitch MasterClass and Zillow. Of course your mileage may vary when considering the value in watching each with others remotely.

Apple is trying to make SharePlay a universally adopted feature as evidenced by its SharePlay for Developers page. But right now it's missing Amazon Prime Video (which has its own Watch Party feature) and there is no live TV streaming service as the likes of Sling TV YouTube TV and Fubo TV were not mentioned. We're hoping that Hulu inclusion means Hulu With Live TV is also there but we're not sure.

And while I'm a little irked to not see those omissions (as well as YouTube's) on this list Netflix's absence is much more concerning.

Netflix needs SharePlay

Netflix one of the biggest services on the planet (and in my own daily consumption) is not a part of this conversation right now. And it's long lacked any kind of shared viewing experience and it's gotten kind of irksome. Sure Netflix Party and others exist but they don't work with streaming devices (just laptops) and Apple's solution is far more ideal — merging shared and synchronous streams with video calls.

And since both sides of the SharePlay call seem to need their own subscriptions to the apps and services in question this doesn't seem to be a situation where DRM issues are a concern. Which all makes me wonder why Netflix isn't on that list since it's clear they're lacking and need something like this.

I called up Paul Dergarabedian senior media analyst at Comscore to get his take. He believes Netflix does need this or something similar telling me ""I think this is really in a sense the future of [the industry] as you might think 'Well you can get this content on your computer on your phone on your TV through these various devices. There's tons of content where is there to go?' Well the magic element here is that interactivity that communal capability.""

It's not as much fun to watch Netflix all by yourself. (Image credit: Shutterstock)

We'd bet Netflix is likely working on its own version set to roll out ... eventually. This isn't a feature that the company necessarily needs — people subscribe to services for shows not software — but if done perfectly it would probably make Netflix look better in the eyes of customers.

Dergarabedian agreed saying ""we're in a world right now where it's primarily I think and first and foremost content driven but I think the way you take all of this to the next level ... is to offer up an experiential part that's delivered through technology"" So while Netflix's library may be its biggest weapon he says ""in the future it may become a combo where I want my content but if it doesn't have this value added ability to commiserate with others and be in that communal experience that may be a deciding factor not necessarily on getting rid of a certain service but adding another.""

He also believes it could be key for Netflix's partnerships saying ""I think it'd be in their best interest to have it particularly if filmmakers and creatives go 'We want to have that option.' ... FOMO isn't just for consumers. It's also for creatives and even a technology companies.

SharePlay flaws I can already see from here

First off SharePlay only works on iOS 15 iPadOS 15 macOS Monterey and tvOS 15. That means you can only stream with folks inside Apple's 'walled garden' and that everyone has to upgrade to the latest OS. And while the latter is easily remedied my horror movie club has an Android-using member — and we're not going to force him to switch to an iPhone.

Secondly while the inclusion of tvOS and the Apple TV is great it's hard to envision how it's going to work. The Apple TV doesn't have a camera or a microphone so how will those using SharePlay via an Apple TV do this? Would Apple TV ever support external webcams?

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Some people will watch video on their smaller screens but it's not hard to argue for the need to prepare the Apple TV and tvOS for true SharePlay support.

There is a possible solution. Could tvOS work with the front-facing camera in your iPhone iPad or Mac? Face ID on the iPhone is supposed to work with tvOS app login in this fall's updates so it doesn't sound impossible since that's already using the front-facing camera.

All you'd have to do now is prop up your iPhone iPad or MacBook to focus on your face.

SharePlay outlook

Most of these flaws (we doubt SharePlay is coming to Roku and Fire TV) could be corrected by fall 2021 when SharePlay is set to debut across all of Apple's new OS updates. And for the sake of all parties involved they should. Without Netflix's participation Apple doesn't look that great here again missing a key player in an online conversation (Fortnite gamers say ""what's up?"").

Maybe by then Netflix will have its own solution. One that works across Fire TV and Roku devices with your iOS or Android phone. Or maybe that's too many partners to get it done right. We're holding out hope though as a better remote watch-party is something we all deserve especially after the last year-plus of nonsense.

Still more have pointed to the age of the presenters wondered aloud why any young person would tune in and predicted its swift demise. After all Britain is not ready for a rightwing TV channel.

But those looking in from afar – specifically Australia – are warning not to underestimate it and its leader.

And they predict that ultimately the channel will blossom like the rightwing Murdoch-run Sky News Australia where the GB News chief executive Angelos Frangopoulos made his name.

“Sky is very successful here particularly when you also take account of the online numbers” says Paul Barry the presenter of the ABC’s Media Watch program and one of Sky News Australia’s fiercest critics. “I am sure it will work in the UK.”

“They are underestimating him” says Janine Perrett a veteran business journalist who worked with Frangopoulos for a decade at Sky.

Dr Denis Muller a senior researcher at the Centre for Advancing Journalism at the University of Melbourne also doesn’t hesitate to predict success for GB News.

“I think so absolutely” he says. “This is part of redtop populist journalism. There is a big appetite for that in the UK.”

Media watchers in Australia already see product parallels between the nascent GB News which began broadcasting on 13 June and Sky in Australia.

The new channel has borrowed heavily from Australia’s Sky News in its focus and formats although unlike the Australian version which reverts to a breaking news format during the day GB News is going down the path of 24-hour commentary and discussions.

Frangopoulos who spent two decades at Sky News Australia is credited with having honed the art of cheap but compelling panel-style conservative television.

Sky News in Australia began life as a 24-hour news channel in 1996 owned by the commercial TV networks News Corp and the telecommunications company Telstra. But it soon added a night-time panel format known as Sky After Dark.

Since Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp took full ownership in 2016 the After Dark lineup has morphed into a steady diet of strident rightwing conservative opinion more aligned with Fox News. It doesn’t mind a controversy or three.

GB News has gone straight for the part of Sky that rates best: panel shows heavy on opinion and commentary.

If Frangopoulos continues to follow his previous playbook one can expect GB News will take aim at the same hot-button issues that are daily fodder in Australia: the national broadcaster climate change immigration Muslims Covid lockdowns government spending the opposition environmentalists and political correctness in schools.

The first ratings for GB News have been promising.

According to the UK TV industry magazine Broadcast GB News peaked in its opening minutes with 336000 viewers and averaged 262000 viewers meaning it outperformed the 100000 who watched BBC News across the hour and the 46000 who watched the British Sky News.

‘TV news in his blood’

Frangopoulos comes with a long pedigree in commercial TV news and nearly two decades in 24-hour news. Former colleagues in Australia describe him as a real newsman.

“He’s one of the best I have worked with” says Perrett.

She says he was particularly good at spotting and managing the talent and convincing them to stay at a network that paid them very little.

“He certainly has TV news in his blood” says David Speers who served as Sky News Australia’s political editor for over a decade until 2020 when he moved to the ABC Australia’s public broadcaster. “He began as a television journalist and he has extraordinary drive and vision about what he wants.”

Both point to Frangopoulos’s willingness to try new things and innovate.

Sky in Australia began as “a smell of an oily rag” news channel where presenters did their own makeup and appeared in front of automated cameras. But soon it was winning awards.

Its election coverage was praised. The channel revived a people’s town hall for staging election debates. Its in-depth political interviews were rewarded with Walkleys Australian journalism’s highest honour.

But over the years its night-time lineup of provocative panel-style discussions crept deeper into the schedule and has steered solidly to the right.

In those early days these panels often featured journalists from other media groups because they would appear for free and were polished talent. But under Frangopoulos the channel began recruiting provocateurs mainly from the right but sometimes from the left as well.

“Frangopoulos was happy to have a contest of ideas and didn’t mind having journalists from non-News Corp publications on Sky” Perrett says.

But that changed when News Corp bought out the other shareholders in 2016 and took full control of Sky in Australia. Frangopoulos quickly sniffed what the new management wanted and Sky lurched further to the right.

The extent to which Frangopoulos is responsible for the “Foxification” of Sky News in Australia is a matter of hot debate.

Anti-immigration voices like Pauline Hanson the leader of the Australia’s One Nation party and Mark Latham a maverick former Labor leader who has now joined One Nation as a state MP were given airtime by Frangopoulos.

There were some ugly incidents under his watch. Former Liberal MP Ross Cameron was sacked from the Outsiders program – the channel’s most over-the-top panel show – after he described Chinese people as “black-haired slanty-eyed yellow-skinned”. Latham was sacked from the same show over his response to a video about feminism made by students at Sydney Boys high school. Latham called the teenagers “dickheads” and said: “I thought the first guy was gay.”

After the full takeover by News Corp a number of its high-profile rightwing columnists were given prime-time slots – the likes of Andrew Bolt and Miranda Devine.

Appearances by media identities from other organisations were phased out Labor presenters mostly dropped and figures like Peta Credlin former conservative prime minister Tony Abbott’s chief of staff were promoted as stars and cross-promoted through columns in Murdoch-owned newspapers.

Barry says the After Dark lineup is now regularly getting peaks of 85000 viewers and an average viewership of 60000.

“Its three to four times the audience they get throughout the day for the news channel” he says.

And when it’s in its panel mode it regularly outguns the ABC’s 24-hour news channel.

“People who watch Sky here love it” says Barry. “The Australian [Murdoch’s national daily newspaper] also has strong appeal to its audiences. Stories on climate change or political correctness attract hundreds of comments.”

While that partisan popularity is evident observers say Sky has also been a contributing factor in the coarsening of the political debate in Australia. Its commentators often rail against against what they see as leftwing abuse of politicians they admire and attack journalists who take Sky to task on accuracy.

In recent weeks the channel has been forced to apologise to a former Greens leader after falsely accusing him of inciting criminal behaviour by anti-logging protests and to former prime minister Kevin Rudd after Credlin claimed his petition calling for a royal commission into the Murdoch media was a “data-harvesting exercise”.

Another commentator Alan Jones was also forced this year to publish a correction to a 2020 editorial railing against Covid restrictions in Victoria after a watchdog ruling that he had “misrepresented the research” on the effectiveness of masks and lockdowns.

Reach not ratings

Most who discount Sky’s influence in Australia point to its relatively small audience on pay TV compared with say the main ABC channel which regularly attracts 700000-plus viewers to its prime-time news bulletin and the millions who listen to the ABC radio news.

But Muller says Sky’s influence is much greater than its ratings.

“Its influence on Australian politics is amplified by being part of the bigger News Corp commentariat” he says.

News Corp has also employed deliberate strategies to get Sky in front of decision-makers. Federal politicians receive free Foxtel pay TV subscriptions in their offices giving them access to Sky News. Sky News is also ubiquitous in all the executive lounges at airports.

Sky has also sought to extend its reach into regional Australia through deals with television operators to carry its After Dark programs on free-to-air TV. This could see it reach 7 million people in some of the more conservative areas.

Muller says Sky has also extended its reach with an aggressive strategy to disseminate its content via the internet and social media to international audiences.

The After Dark shows are cut into bite-sized videos that are then uploaded on to Sky’s YouTube channel so they can be readily shared via social media.

Barry agrees with Muller: “Some of those videos get over a million views. It’s a central part of News Corp’s strategy to appeal to rightwing audiences internationally.”

Popular Sky News Australia videos include reports on an alleged coverup by China on the activities of the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the origins of Covid-19; commentary on Joe Biden’s alleged cognitive decline; Hunter Biden and allegations of corrupt dealings; the “stolen” US election.

This in turn has seen Sky After Dark commentators venture ever deeper into US politics and topics that might be more at home on a QAnon website such as the “Great Reset” which according to Sky’s Rowan Dean is an “evil” agenda by woke billionaires to dismantle capitalism that is being pushed via the next Davos economic summit and promoted by Prince Charles.

Whether GB News will elect to actively pursue an online audience through social media remains to be seen but Frangopoulos will be familiar with all the strategies to make his mouse roar.

A Murdoch stalking horse?

Among Frangopoulos’s former colleagues in Australia there’s speculation that GB News could be a stalking horse for News Corp’s ambitions to launch a Fox News-style channel in the UK or at the least a testing ground to see if a right-aligned news product can work.

News Corp had talked about starting its own Fox News-style channel in the UK but in April announced it was no longer pursuing a traditional cable channel and would instead focus on online video rather than “linear TV”.

Few leave the bosom of News Corp and remain within the fold. But Frangopoulos appears to still enjoy good standing despite departing from Sky News Australia in 2018 for a job at Sky News Arabia which is not owned by News.

Frangopoulos surprised many by appearing at Lachlan Murdoch’s 2019 Christmas drinks at his harbourside mansion in Sydney and was seen chatting cordially with News’s executives.

GB News has so far received benign coverage in the News Corp-owned UK papers which are not shy about attacking media rivals.

The question many in Australia are asking is: if GB News succeeds will Murdoch be willing to cede the territory of rightwing television to another? And is there room for two?

The Guardian approached Frangopoulos for an interview but he was not available during the launch week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9saWZlc3R5bGUvZHJhZy1xdWVlbi1jb3VydG5leS1hY3QtYW5zd2Vycy1jaGlsZHJlbnMtcXVlc3Rpb25zLWFib3V0LWdlbmRlci1vbi1hYmMta2lkcy9YVEJLWlc3WUdPR1EzM1FURjI0Sk1FV1FLRS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Drag queen Courtney Act answers children's questions about gender on ABC Kids,"Drag queen Courtney Act on Little Kids Big Talk.

An ABC segment featuring a drag queen answering children's questions about gender identity has been praised as ""beautiful"" by viewers.

Courtney Act whose real name is Shane Jenek took part in Little Kids Big Talk a social media video series produced by the broadcaster.

The latest episode featuring six children interviewing the RuPaul's Drag Race star has been viewed more than 770000 times since being posted to the ABC Kids Community Facebook page on Friday.

""Why is all drag queens so beautiful?"" one girl asks the 39-year-old in the video.

""Oh wow – well that's a very lovely compliment"" he replies.

""I think the cool thing about drag is that it's about expressing how you feel and I think that there's something really beautiful about people being themselves.""

Another boy asks whether people treat him differently ""when you're Shane"".

""They do actually it's quite interesting because when I am dressed up as Shane … I present looking like a boy and people treat me differently"" he says.

""Regardless of how I look the world looks the same to me but sometimes people look differently and react differently to me depending on how I'm dressed.""

Another asks whether he likes being ""called a boy or a girl"".

""I don't really mind"" he says.

""I find that as long as people are being kind and polite then that is what is important. And I always find that whatever someone tells you that they want to be called it's always best to listen to them and call them the name that they want to be called.""

Jenek was also asked about his hardest experiences growing up.

""I was a young boy and people told me that boys should look or act or even feel a certain way and I always enjoyed more of the things that the girls liked when I was at school"" he says.

""And sometimes people said that boys shouldn't like girls things and that boys should like sport and football and I preferred dancing and singing and colourful fun things.""

He offered encouragement to one boy who likes ballet.

""I think the world is changing and people are coming to understand that everybody regardless of your body parts should be able to do whatever they want to do"" he says.

Jenek who is also hosting ABC interview series One Plus One this month as Courtney Act has described himself as ""pansexual polyamorous and genderfluid"".

Many Facebook users praised the ABC Kids segment.

""Freaking love how we are normalising gender fluidity for the younger generation"" one woman wrote. ""Courtney looks absolutely gorgeous and those kids are really open minded! Great to see.""

Another said ""This so beautiful and the kids are so cute asking some very good questions. Courtney was amazing with the kids. Kids behave with what they are taught at home. Always be kind to everyone no matter what race religion or gender – this is what I've tried to instil in my son.""

Another added ""Love how they are so open and accepting. Gives me happy feels that their generation will normalise the rainbow community. Congratulations to their parents too.""

Not all of the responses were positive.

""Let kids be kids"" one woman wrote.

""There is a place and time for people to pursue this sort of behaviour and lifestyle if they want to and that's when they are adults. Please stop confusing children and influencing them to go down that path where they can ruin their lives.""

Former Australian Christian Lobby managing director Lyle Shelton slammed the ABC accusing the national broadcaster of ""indoctrinating children"".

She says he was particularly good at spotting and managing the talent and convincing them to stay at a network that paid them very little.

“He certainly has TV news in his blood” says David Speers who served as Sky News Australia’s political editor for over a decade until 2020 when he moved to the ABC Australia’s public broadcaster. “He began as a television journalist and he has extraordinary drive and vision about what he wants.”

Both point to Frangopoulos’s willingness to try new things and innovate.

Sky in Australia began as “a smell of an oily rag” news channel where presenters did their own makeup and appeared in front of automated cameras. But soon it was winning awards.

Its election coverage was praised. The channel revived a people’s town hall for staging election debates. Its in-depth political interviews were rewarded with Walkleys Australian journalism’s highest honour.

But over the years its night-time lineup of provocative panel-style discussions crept deeper into the schedule and has steered solidly to the right.

In those early days these panels often featured journalists from other media groups because they would appear for free and were polished talent. But under Frangopoulos the channel began recruiting provocateurs mainly from the right but sometimes from the left as well.

“Frangopoulos was happy to have a contest of ideas and didn’t mind having journalists from non-News Corp publications on Sky” Perrett says.

But that changed when News Corp bought out the other shareholders in 2016 and took full control of Sky in Australia. Frangopoulos quickly sniffed what the new management wanted and Sky lurched further to the right.

The extent to which Frangopoulos is responsible for the “Foxification” of Sky News in Australia is a matter of hot debate.

Anti-immigration voices like Pauline Hanson the leader of the Australia’s One Nation party and Mark Latham a maverick former Labor leader who has now joined One Nation as a state MP were given airtime by Frangopoulos.

There were some ugly incidents under his watch. Former Liberal MP Ross Cameron was sacked from the Outsiders program – the channel’s most over-the-top panel show – after he described Chinese people as “black-haired slanty-eyed yellow-skinned”. Latham was sacked from the same show over his response to a video about feminism made by students at Sydney Boys high school. Latham called the teenagers “dickheads” and said: “I thought the first guy was gay.”

After the full takeover by News Corp a number of its high-profile rightwing columnists were given prime-time slots – the likes of Andrew Bolt and Miranda Devine.

Appearances by media identities from other organisations were phased out Labor presenters mostly dropped and figures like Peta Credlin former conservative prime minister Tony Abbott’s chief of staff were promoted as stars and cross-promoted through columns in Murdoch-owned newspapers.

Barry says the After Dark lineup is now regularly getting peaks of 85000 viewers and an average viewership of 60000.

“Its three to four times the audience they get throughout the day for the news channel” he says.

And when it’s in its panel mode it regularly outguns the ABC’s 24-hour news channel.

“People who watch Sky here love it” says Barry. “The Australian [Murdoch’s national daily newspaper] also has strong appeal to its audiences. Stories on climate change or political correctness attract hundreds of comments.”

While that partisan popularity is evident observers say Sky has also been a contributing factor in the coarsening of the political debate in Australia. Its commentators often rail against against what they see as leftwing abuse of politicians they admire and attack journalists who take Sky to task on accuracy.

In recent weeks the channel has been forced to apologise to a former Greens leader after falsely accusing him of inciting criminal behaviour by anti-logging protests and to former prime minister Kevin Rudd after Credlin claimed his petition calling for a royal commission into the Murdoch media was a “data-harvesting exercise”.

Another commentator Alan Jones was also forced this year to publish a correction to a 2020 editorial railing against Covid restrictions in Victoria after a watchdog ruling that he had “misrepresented the research” on the effectiveness of masks and lockdowns.

Reach not ratings

Most who discount Sky’s influence in Australia point to its relatively small audience on pay TV compared with say the main ABC channel which regularly attracts 700000-plus viewers to its prime-time news bulletin and the millions who listen to the ABC radio news.

But Muller says Sky’s influence is much greater than its ratings.

“Its influence on Australian politics is amplified by being part of the bigger News Corp commentariat” he says.

News Corp has also employed deliberate strategies to get Sky in front of decision-makers. Federal politicians receive free Foxtel pay TV subscriptions in their offices giving them access to Sky News. Sky News is also ubiquitous in all the executive lounges at airports.

Sky has also sought to extend its reach into regional Australia through deals with television operators to carry its After Dark programs on free-to-air TV. This could see it reach 7 million people in some of the more conservative areas.

Muller says Sky has also extended its reach with an aggressive strategy to disseminate its content via the internet and social media to international audiences.

The After Dark shows are cut into bite-sized videos that are then uploaded on to Sky’s YouTube channel so they can be readily shared via social media.

Barry agrees with Muller: “Some of those videos get over a million views. It’s a central part of News Corp’s strategy to appeal to rightwing audiences internationally.”

Popular Sky News Australia videos include reports on an alleged coverup by China on the activities of the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the origins of Covid-19; commentary on Joe Biden’s alleged cognitive decline; Hunter Biden and allegations of corrupt dealings; the “stolen” US election.

This in turn has seen Sky After Dark commentators venture ever deeper into US politics and topics that might be more at home on a QAnon website such as the “Great Reset” which according to Sky’s Rowan Dean is an “evil” agenda by woke billionaires to dismantle capitalism that is being pushed via the next Davos economic summit and promoted by Prince Charles.

Whether GB News will elect to actively pursue an online audience through social media remains to be seen but Frangopoulos will be familiar with all the strategies to make his mouse roar.

A Murdoch stalking horse?

Among Frangopoulos’s former colleagues in Australia there’s speculation that GB News could be a stalking horse for News Corp’s ambitions to launch a Fox News-style channel in the UK or at the least a testing ground to see if a right-aligned news product can work.

News Corp had talked about starting its own Fox News-style channel in the UK but in April announced it was no longer pursuing a traditional cable channel and would instead focus on online video rather than “linear TV”.

Few leave the bosom of News Corp and remain within the fold. But Frangopoulos appears to still enjoy good standing despite departing from Sky News Australia in 2018 for a job at Sky News Arabia which is not owned by News.

Frangopoulos surprised many by appearing at Lachlan Murdoch’s 2019 Christmas drinks at his harbourside mansion in Sydney and was seen chatting cordially with News’s executives.

GB News has so far received benign coverage in the News Corp-owned UK papers which are not shy about attacking media rivals.

The question many in Australia are asking is: if GB News succeeds will Murdoch be willing to cede the territory of rightwing television to another? And is there room for two?

The Guardian approached Frangopoulos for an interview but he was not available during the launch week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9saWZlc3R5bGUvZHJhZy1xdWVlbi1jb3VydG5leS1hY3QtYW5zd2Vycy1jaGlsZHJlbnMtcXVlc3Rpb25zLWFib3V0LWdlbmRlci1vbi1hYmMta2lkcy9YVEJLWlc3WUdPR1EzM1FURjI0Sk1FV1FLRS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Drag queen Courtney Act answers children's questions about gender on ABC Kids,"Drag queen Courtney Act on Little Kids Big Talk.

An ABC segment featuring a drag queen answering children's questions about gender identity has been praised as ""beautiful"" by viewers.

Courtney Act whose real name is Shane Jenek took part in Little Kids Big Talk a social media video series produced by the broadcaster.

The latest episode featuring six children interviewing the RuPaul's Drag Race star has been viewed more than 770000 times since being posted to the ABC Kids Community Facebook page on Friday.

""Why is all drag queens so beautiful?"" one girl asks the 39-year-old in the video.

""Oh wow – well that's a very lovely compliment"" he replies.

""I think the cool thing about drag is that it's about expressing how you feel and I think that there's something really beautiful about people being themselves.""

Another boy asks whether people treat him differently ""when you're Shane"".

""They do actually it's quite interesting because when I am dressed up as Shane … I present looking like a boy and people treat me differently"" he says.

""Regardless of how I look the world looks the same to me but sometimes people look differently and react differently to me depending on how I'm dressed.""

Another asks whether he likes being ""called a boy or a girl"".

""I don't really mind"" he says.

""I find that as long as people are being kind and polite then that is what is important. And I always find that whatever someone tells you that they want to be called it's always best to listen to them and call them the name that they want to be called.""

Jenek was also asked about his hardest experiences growing up.

""I was a young boy and people told me that boys should look or act or even feel a certain way and I always enjoyed more of the things that the girls liked when I was at school"" he says.

""And sometimes people said that boys shouldn't like girls things and that boys should like sport and football and I preferred dancing and singing and colourful fun things.""

He offered encouragement to one boy who likes ballet.

""I think the world is changing and people are coming to understand that everybody regardless of your body parts should be able to do whatever they want to do"" he says.

Jenek who is also hosting ABC interview series One Plus One this month as Courtney Act has described himself as ""pansexual polyamorous and genderfluid"".

Many Facebook users praised the ABC Kids segment.

""Freaking love how we are normalising gender fluidity for the younger generation"" one woman wrote. ""Courtney looks absolutely gorgeous and those kids are really open minded! Great to see.""

Breaking: The ABC has just removed the link on the ABC Kids Community Page to Courtney Act’s Facebook page (compare the screenshots) - a page filled with sexualised & gender-fluid imagery. To see where the ABC was sending children you can read my blog: https://t.co/JG2OgCZgwT pic.twitter.com/NKg5OjP6qO — Lyle Shelton (@LyleShelton) June 20 2021

Another said ""This so beautiful and the kids are so cute asking some very good questions. Courtney was amazing with the kids. Kids behave with what they are taught at home. Always be kind to everyone no matter what race religion or gender – this is what I've tried to instil in my son.""

Another added ""Love how they are so open and accepting. Gives me happy feels that their generation will normalise the rainbow community. Congratulations to their parents too.""

Not all of the responses were positive.

""Let kids be kids"" one woman wrote.

""There is a place and time for people to pursue this sort of behaviour and lifestyle if they want to and that's when they are adults. Please stop confusing children and influencing them to go down that path where they can ruin their lives.""

Former Australian Christian Lobby managing director Lyle Shelton slammed the ABC accusing the national broadcaster of ""indoctrinating children"".

It might be the last thing you want to hear but it's the truth: A stock market crash is inevitable.

Since the March 23 2020 bottom investors have enjoyed a historically strong bounce-back rally -- the widely followed S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.51%) has gained an impressive 90%. But both history and valuation metrics unequivocally suggest that a big drop is upcoming for the stock market.

History is pretty clear that trouble lies ahead

For example there have been one or two double-digit percentage declines within the three years following a bottom in each of the previous eight bear markets prior to the coronavirus crash (i.e. dating back to 1960). Although bull markets tend to last years rebounds from a bear market are never this smooth. We're nearly 15 months past the March 2020 bear-market bottom in the S&P 500 and have yet to see anything close to a double-digit correction.

To add to this point data from market analytics firm Yardeni Research shows that there have been 38 double-digit declines in the S&P 500 over the past 71 years. That's a crash or correction on average every 1.87 years. Though the market doesn't adhere to averages it does give a general sense of when to expect these hiccups.

On a valuation basis the S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a waving red flag. The S&P 500's Shiller P/E -- a measure of inflation-adjusted earnings over the previous 10 years -- almost hit 38 earlier this week. That more than doubles its 151-year average and it's the highest level in nearly two decades. The previous four times the Shiller P/E surpassed and held above 30 during a bull market rally the index subsequently declined by a minimum of 20%.

Make no mistake about it -- a stock market crash is coming.

Every crash or correction is an opportunity for patient investors to make money

However a crash is no reason to duck and cover. While history may signal trouble ahead it also tells us that each and every double-digit decline has been a buying opportunity. Eventually every big drop in the major indexes is erased by a bull-market rally. When the next crash does occur the following five high-conviction stocks can be confidently bought hand over fist.

CrowdStrike Holdings

Cybersecurity is projected to be one of the safest double-digit growth trends this decade. No matter the size of the business or the state of the U.S./global economy protecting enterprise and consumer data is paramount. This means cloud-based cybersecurity stock CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD 1.33%) can thrive in any environment.

CrowdStrike's success derives from its cloud-native Falcon security platform. Because it's built in the cloud and relies on artificial intelligence it's growing smarter at identifying and responding to threats all the time. It's currently overseeing 6 trillion events on a weekly basis and it's far more cost-effective at protecting data than on-premise solutions.

We can also look to the company's income statements to see clear-cut evidence that businesses favor CrowdStrike's cybersecurity platform. It's been retaining 98% of its clients has seen existing clients spend 23% to 47% more on a year-over-year basis for the past 12 quarters and recently reported that 64% of its customers have purchased at least four cloud module subscriptions. Scaling with its customers is CrowdStrike's ticket to big-time cash flow expansion.

Facebook

Brand-name businesses can make patient investors a fortune and social media giant Facebook (META 0.60%) is the perfect example.

When the curtain closed on March Facebook tallied 2.85 billion monthly active users (MAU) visiting its namesake site and an additional 600 million unique MAUs visiting WhatsApp or Instagram which it also owns. All told this equates to 44% of the global population interacting with its owned sites each month. There's simply no social media platform businesses can go to get their message to a broader (or potentially targeted) audience which is why Facebook ad-pricing power is so strong.

But here's the kicker: Facebook hasn't even put the pedal to the metal. Although it's on track to generate more than $100 billion in advertising revenue in 2021 nearly all of these ad sales are coming from its namesake site and Instagram. WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger which are two of the six most-visited social sites in the world aren't being meaningfully monetized as of yet. Further the company's Oculus virtual reality devices are still in the early stage of their growth. Suffice it to say Facebook offers ample upside as its other operating segments are monetized and mature.

NextEra Energy

Another high-conviction stock to buy hand over fist the next time a crash or steep correction strikes is electric utility stock NextEra Energy (NEE 2.38%).

Did I put you to sleep when I said ""electric utility stock?"" Electric utilities are traditionally known for their market-topping dividend yields and persistently low growth rates. But this doesn't describe NextEra Energy. NextEra has aggressively invested in renewable energy projects and is leading the country in solar and wind capacity. As a result of these investments its electric generation costs have declined and its compound annual growth rate has consistently been in the high single digits for more than a decade. It also doesn't hurt that NextEra is front-running any potential green-energy legislation that might come out of Washington.

In addition to growth rates that are well above the sector average NextEra still benefits from the predictability of energy demand. For instance its regulated utilities (i.e. those not powered by renewable energy) require approval from state utility commissions before price hikes can be passed along to households. This might sound like an inconvenience but it's actually great news. It means NextEra won't be exposed to potentially volatile wholesale pricing.

Visa

When the next stock market crash arrives payment processing kingpin Visa (V 0.49%) is a winning company to confidently buy hand over fist. It's also another brand-name company that can still make its shareholders a fortune.

Buying into the Visa growth story is a simple numbers game. Visa grows its revenue and profits when consumers and businesses are spending more. This happens when the U.S. and global economy are expanding. Although contractions and recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle they tend to be short-lived. Meanwhile periods of economic expansion are almost always measured in years. Buying into Visa during these short-lived crashes or corrections should allow long-term investors to be handsomely rewarded by this numbers game.

The other interesting thing about Visa is that it's shunned becoming a lender. You'd think that Visa could generate big bucks from interest income and fees by lending during these long-lived periods of expansion. But lending would also expose Visa to the credit delinquencies that arise during recessions. Operating solely as a payment processor means not having to set aside cash to cover delinquencies. It's why Visa rebounds so much faster than most financial stocks following a recession.

Amazon

Lastly (and who couldn't see this coming?) investors should take any discount they can get during a crash on e-commerce behemoth Amazon (AMZN 0.80%).

Amazon's online marketplace has proved virtually unstoppable for well over a decade. An April 2021 report from eMarketer pegged the company's share of U.S. online sales at 40.4%. That more than quintuples its next-closest competitor and effectively solidifies Amazon as the go-to source for online shopping in the U.S.

What about those pesky low retail margins you ask? Amazon has signed up more than 200 million people globally to a Prime membership. The fees collected from Prime members help to offset some of the company's retail-based margin weakness. Prime members are extremely loyal to the Amazon ecosystem and spend far more than non-members too.

But it's Amazon's cloud infrastructure segment that's the superstar. Amazon Web Services (AWS) brings in around one-eighth of the company's total sales but accounts for well over half its operating income. Since cloud margins are superior to retail and advertising margins AWS is the company's key to explosive cash flow growth this decade.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result Chile’s kits for the South American tournament have undergone a sudden and significant edit.

For Friday night’s Group B match against Bolivia the Nike logo on Chile’s jerseys was covered with a patch of the Chilean flag. Chile’s coaches and staff covered the Nike logo on their shirts and pants with tape. It was all part of a subtle protest related to an ongoing contract dispute between the sportswear company and the Chilean football federation.

For the remainder of the tournament the team will play without a visible kit sponsor as Chile’s National Association of Professional Football (ANFP by its Spanish acronym) fights Nike in court. According to Chilean outlet La Tercera the ANFP alleges that Nike abruptly ended their million dollar agreement two weeks ago.

“Nike canceled the contract unilaterally” an ANFP spokesperson told La Tercera. “This will be a court battle.”

According to the report Nike withheld payments including those for merchandise sales for the period of July 2019 to July 2020 since Chile’s senior national team did not play the minimum of 10 matches per year stipulated in their contract. Chile played its final match of 2019 a friendly against Guinea in Spain on October 15 2019 but between social unrest that took hold in Chile that month and the subsequent spread of COVID-19 they did not play again until their World Cup qualifier against Uruguay in October 2020. Nike and the ANFP which alleges it is owed about $6 million of a $7 million per year deal have been involved in court proceedings since March of this year according to AFP.

Nike and Chile had an eight-year contract with a total of $56 million that began after Copa America 2015 and was supposed to run through the end of the 2022 World Cup. La Tercera says the ANFP first sued Nike in civil court in Santiago Chile. From there the case moved to the International Chamber of Commerce’s Court of Arbitration in New York.

Before partnering with Nike Chile made a reported $2.5 million per year over five years from a kit deal with Puma.

Chile drew 1-1 with Argentina in their first 2021 Copa America match then beat Bolivia 1-0 in their second. They previously won the competition in 2015 and 2016 most recently finishing fourth in 2019.

Prior to Chile entering Brazil for this edition of Copa America there was a “drone skirmish” during one of their training sessions in Santiago when team officials spotted an airborne device they suspected of being an Argentine spy camera. Chile manager Martin Lasarte reportedly ordered a drone of their own be sent to investigate the suspicious machine. The two drones collided and were retrieved. It was later learned that the “invading” craft belonged to the local power company which was checking nearby street lights.

How is Nike rethinking its financial support of track and field in the United States a sport that has been sustained by its largess for decades?

Nike is notoriously secretive and as a result a mystery leading into the Tokyo Olympics has blossomed from the company’s smaller maneuvers: canceled or reduced sponsorship agreements executive shuffling and its internal responses to scandals in the sport.

The company won’t say whether its moves are connected with a broader strategy. A spokeswoman declined to make any executives available for interviews and said in a statement that Nike had been “a long standing supporter of the sport and remain extremely proud of our commitment.” The statement added that “like many brands we continue to deal with new dynamics around our business but Nike remains passionate about and committed to Track and Field.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2UtcGctNS1jbGlwcGVycy1hd2F5LWN3MzE0Ni0wMDQtcmVsZWFzZS1kYXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike PG 5 Clippers Away CW3146-004 Release Date - SBD,"Paul George’s Nike PG 5 surfaces in another Los Angeles Clippers color blocking that resembles the team’s city edition jerseys.

On the line’s latest model the Air VaporMax 2021 both of these key pieces are still intact.

The shoe’s launch slate includes five colorways: “Armory Blue/Light Smoke Grey/Metallic Silver/White” “Particle Grey/Aluminum/Light Liquid Lime/Barely Grey” “Grey Fog/Bright Mango/Anthracite/White” “White/Black/Metallic Silver/White” and “Black/Black/Anthracite/Black.” These color schemes run the gamut from vibrant to understated but all five feature a similar construction and tech specs.

VaporMax cushioning units are kept to two sizeable-but-sleek pieces one in the forefoot the other in the heel. All sit atop recycled rubber outsoles and are bolstered by recycled TPU clips. Uppers are made from stretchy Flyknit and adorned with large midfoot Swooshes. The Air VaporMax 2021’s main divergence from its predecessor the Air VaporMax 2020 is its lacing system: where the 2020 used FlyEase technology the 2021 returns to a more standard lacing system. There’s also a classic Nike Sportswear Sunburst graphic on the insoles and VaporMax hits on the tongue and heel’s pull tabs. The Air VaporMax 2021’s build is at least 40 percent recycled content by weight a notable sum but one that’s less than the 2020 iteration — which promised a build that was at least 50 percent recycled content by weight.

Expect the Nike Air VaporMax 2021 to release on the Nike webstore in the coming weeks. Its MSRP is set at $200 USD.

The Minotaur 1 rocket uses two surplus stages taken from the U.S. Air Force’s stockpiles of Minuteman 2 ballistic missiles. Northrop Grumman adds avionics a payload compartment and two solid-fueled upper stages to convert the missile parts into a satellite launcher.

The 69-foot-tall (21-meter) rocket took off from pad 0B at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Virginia at 9:35 a.m. EDT (1335 GMT) Wednesday June 15. The rocket’s solid-fueled first stage quickly ramped up to full power producing more than 200000 pounds of thrust to accelerate the Minotaur 1 past the speed of sound in less than 30 seconds.

Heading southeast over the Atlantic Ocean the Minotaur 1 rocket fired three more solid motors to inject three classified satellites into orbit for the National Reconnaissance Office.

These photos show the Minotaur 1 blasting off from the spaceport at Wallops Island Virginia. The yellow material peeling off the rocket at liftoff sometimes called the “banana” is a thermal cover designed to regulate temperatures for the Minuteman-heritage solid rocket motors while on the launch pad.

Consider These 3 Space Stocks Instead,"Three choices for investors who are looking to the skies for stock ideas.

Jeff Bezos is heading to space. The longtime Amazon CEO announced earlier this month that he intends to board a rocket soon after his planned July 5 retirement from an active role at the e-commerce giant.

Bezos and his brother will be among the first passengers his Blue Origin space company takes into space the beginning of what Blue Origin hopes is a lucrative space tourism business.

It is an exciting time to be following Blue Origin and investors surely would love to go along for the ride. But Bezos thanks to his Amazon billions doesn't need outside funding to get Blue Origin airborne and seems to have no desire to take the company public.

Even if buying Blue Origin shares is out of the question there are other ways for investors to buy into the growth potential of space. Here's why three Fool contributors believe Maxar Technologies (MAXR) Northrop Grumman (NOC 0.39%) and believe it or not General Motors (GM 0.69%) deserve consideration for those interested in out-of-this-world investing.

In three years this expensive stock could be a bargain

Rich Smith (Maxar Technologies): I have to admit that I haven't always been a fan of Earth imaging satellite operator and space tech-industrialist Maxar Technologies -- but this stock is starting to grow on me.

After reporting its first-quarter 2021 earnings last month Maxar was punished by investors for its big loss. At the same time though Maxar made significant strides toward fixing its balance sheet in Q1 paying off $350 million in debt and reducing its net debt load to about $2.3 billion. Granted that's still nearly as big as the company's own market capitalization of $2.9 billion. But it's movement in the right direction and for that the company deserves some applause.

Also noteworthy is the fact that Maxar is back in positive free-cash-flow territory. With $20 million in cash profit generated over the last four quarters the company looks on course to finish in the green on free cash flow this year (after burning cash last year). And analysts who follow the stock see FCF rising nearly 600% next year to $188 million as the company wraps up the spending needed to build its new fleet of imaging satellites then nearly doubling again in 2023 to $349 million according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

What does this mean for investors? Based on its current enterprise value of $5.2 billion Maxar stock sells for less than 15 times its likely cash profit just two years out -- and barely 12 times fiscal 2023 projected earnings. That's an appealing price to pay to own one of the leading companies in satellite photography of Earth -- and a key participant in NASA's Project Artemis plan to return to the moon.

A more ""defensive"" space pick

Lou Whiteman (Northrop Grumman): No doubt space is cool. And the pace of innovation in the sector is accelerating which is good reason for investors to get excited.

The problem is for all the developments space is still a relatively small market. NASA's annual budget sounds impressive at $20 billion-plus but the part that goes to contractors is hardly bigger than the price of one of the Pentagon's aircraft carriers. Private demand for space services from tourism to satellites is steady but niche. There is only so much a pure-play space company can be expected to grow unless something dramatically changes in the market.

Northrop Grumman offers a best-in-class space portfolio inside a massive defense arsenal. The company has a long history as a government space leader that was boosted by its 2018 acquisition of Orbital ATK. Today Northrop's space business is involved in launch and propulsion systems human spaceflight commercial satellites and payloads and a large top-secret component.

Space has been a standout performer inside Northrop. The space business grew sales by 29% in the most recent quarter doubling its backlog in 2020. Overall space generated $2.5 billion in revenue in the quarter accounting for about 27% of Northrop's total sales.

In Northrop investors get not just an impressive space franchise but also Pentagon priorities including an $85 billion program to replace the nation's intercontinental ballistic missile and a separate $50 billion franchise to develop the new B-21 bomber. Northrop's aerospace and space chops should also help the company win a growing share of contracts related to the development of hypersonics missiles capable of traveling more than five times the speed of sound.

Northrop Grumman provides investors a way to buy into an industry-leading space portfolio and have the benefits of a company with a $80 billion backlog of orders and a 1.7% dividend yield. All of that at a reasonable 13 times earnings and 1.6 times sales.

Given the risks and uncertainty of pure-play space investments it is one of the more attractive ways to buy into the modern-day space race.

How this old automaker could become a critical space supplier

John Rosevear (General Motors): GM is many things but is it really a space company?

The truth is although GM has played some interesting roles in America's space-exploration efforts over the years GM isn't really a space company -- at least not yet.

But the auto industry's pivot to electric and connected vehicles has led GM to develop some interesting new lines of business and there's at least one that could play a meaningful role in efforts to explore and commercialize space in the years to come: Fuel cells.

Fuel cells are devices that chemically convert the energy in hydrogen gas to electricity emitting only water. They've been around for decades -- and GM has been tinkering with them for over 50 years -- but it's only recently that efforts by GM and others to make them commercially viable have started to bear fruit.

GM's ""Hydrotec"" fuel-cell systems use fuel cells manufactured by a joint venture between GM and Honda Motor. (Honda uses the fuel cells in its own separate line of products.) Just in the last several months GM has struck deals to develop Hydrotec fuel-cell systems to power heavy trucks with Nikola and Navistar International for railroad locomotives with Wabtec and for aviation with German aerospace supplier Liebherr-Aerospace.

Could space be next? I think it's likely. After all GM also recently announced a deal to partner with Lockheed Martin on a new lunar rover -- 50 years after GM helped to develop the first lunar rover.

More broadly GM's unfolding plan to become a major fuel-cell supplier will provide an intriguing new stream of revenue that isn't dependent on the ups and downs of global auto sales. As GM moves beyond cars and trucks to become a provider of mobility-related services and products (like fuel cells) its bottom line and its stock price both seem likely to benefit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvcmVhbGx5LXVnbHktcGxhbmUtdGVycm9yaXplZC1pc2lzLW5vLW90aGVyLTE4ODEwMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Really Ugly Plane Terrorized ISIS Like No Other,"Cessna may be the most well-known name in civilian aviation with the Cessna 172 widely recognized as the most successful aircraft in history.

The U.S. military leads the world in stealth aviation technology but not every fight requires a fast-moving radar defeating fighter; sometimes all it takes to win a fight is a good old-fashioned Cessna strapped to the nines with Hellfire missiles.

Cessna may be the most well-known name in civilian aviation with the Cessna 172 widely recognized as the most successful aircraft in history. There have been more Cessna 172s built than literally any other airplane on earth and chances are if you ever take classes to earn your pilot’s license a fair portion of the hours you log will be in a 172. The aircraft’s sturdy high-wing design and reliable powertrain coupled with its low cost and availability make it a favorite for flight schools who value its ability to fly multiple times per day with inexperienced pilots.

In fact the Cessna 172 is so user-friendly that an inexperienced German teenager managed to fly his Cessna straight through the most elaborate air defenses in the world at the time to park his 172 right in Moscow’s Red Square. The ordeal led to the firing of numerous senior Soviet defense officials and may have helped usher in the end of the Cold War. Not bad for an aircraft I’ve heard described as a “lawnmower with wings” by fighter pilots.

But Rust’s wasn’t the only Cessna to get involved in the squabbling of nations. The same things that make Cessnas such good choices for beginner pilots (low cost ease of use low stall speed resilient design) also make the aircraft an excellent choice for reconnaissance surveillance and even some combat air support in environments without formidable air defenses. In fact the Cessna 172’s younger sister the Hellfire missile packing Cessna AC-208 has been terrorizing the skies over the Middle East for years thanks to a conversion handled by Orbital ATK a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman.

The AC-208 can pack Hellfire missiles and 70mm rockets

Converting the Cessna C-208 into the AC-208 Combat Caravan also known as the Eliminator required more than simply mounting some rails underwing. In order to leverage the incredible accuracy offered by the AGM-114 Hellfire missile ATK equipped the Cessna with a combat sensor suite and laser-designator that can be used to pinpoint targets on the fly.

Hellfire missiles are incredibly accurate–so accurate that a secretive version of the weapon has been built that forgoes explosives in favor of retractable swords for targetting bad guys using civilians to shield them from more conventional airstrikes. In the hands of a capable operator with a laser designator Hellfire missiles can be fired from Cessna’s AC-208 at targets that are literally miles away. The AC-208 can also carry “fire-and-forget” AGM-114K Hellfires which are guided by their own internal radar and don’t require continued control after firing.

This insane footage shows what it looks like to fire a Hellfire missile from the cabin of your Cessna:

Related: THE STORY OF AMERICA’S HELLFIRE MISSILE FULL OF SWORDS

While Hellfire missiles represent the most potent ordnance this Cessna brings to the fight the AC-208 has other options available to it. Its modular and reconfigurable weapons system allows for the mounting of two Hellfire missiles beneath each wing for a total of four weapons but each wing can also carry a rocket pod that can be used to deploy a variety of guided 70mm rockets including the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) or Guided Advanced Tactical Rockets (GATR).

It takes more than strapping on Hellfire missiles to make a Cessna a warbird

Ballistic panels were also added to the AC-208’s cockpit to protect the pilot and sensor operators from small arms fire while conducting low passes over an active combat zone. A variety of screens mounted in the cockpit offer all sorts of information from common in-flight control data to feeds sourced from the aircraft’s high-definition electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors. As many as six different sensors can be mounted on the MX-15D turret the AC-208 uses to find its prey. Each aircraft carries a crew of three: a pilot a co-pilot and a mission system operator to oversee the sensor and weapon systems.

While modern and advanced air defense systems can engage aircraft at nearly any altitude most dated and shoulder-launched platforms in use in places like Iraq and Afghanistan are limited to targetting aircraft at 10000 feet or lower. The Hellfire-packing Cessna AC-208 can fly at more than twice that altitude but just in case it also comes equipped with a missile warning system and BAE Systems AAR-47/ALE-47 Defensive Countermeasures System meant to throw off an inbound infrared or radar-guided missile with flares or chaff.

(U.S. Air Force photo/Staff Sgt. Aaron Allmon)

Speed isn’t a high priority for the AC-208–in fact it’s the aircraft’s ability to maintain very low speeds while surveying its environment that makes it so handy over war zones in Iraq Afghanistan and other nations across Africa and South America. Its 876 horsepower Pratt & Whitney PT6A-140 turboprop can push this Hellfire packing Cessna along at a respectable 213 miles per hour for distances in excess of 1200 miles. When serving as a stable reconnaissance platform the AC-208 can fly as slowly as just 70 miles per hour without risk of stalling the engine.

Its rugged tricycle-style landing gear is perfectly suited for operating from austere airstrips or even just a nice flat stretch of field.

The Eliminator is already combat proven

The idea behind the AC-208 Eliminator is believed to have come from the U.S. military who were looking to find an inexpensive way to equip the Iraqi government with much-needed air support assets. They contacted Orbital ATK in 2008 to discuss converting the civilian Cessna C-208 into a militarized airplane that could carry ordnance like Hellfire missiles as well as conduct reconnaissance and gather intelligence for the increasingly independent Iraqi Air Force. ATK moved swiftly fielding a prototype for live-fire testing in just 11 months.

The first AC-208 debuted in 2009 with the more modern Eliminator that entered service in 2017 commonly referred to as the “Block II” iteration. It’s already seen service in the aforementioned Middle Eastern nations as well as Argentina Honduras Kenya Lebanon Mauritania Niger and Yemen. Reports clearly indicate that deals to purchase these aircraft are brokered by the United States and Air Force personnel have been used to train pilots to operate AC-208s in their respective nations but for the most part acquisition and training related to the AC-208 Eliminator tends to fly under the radar.

According to the U.S. Air Force all they’ll officially acknowledge is that the branch itself does not own any AC-208 Combat Caravans. News reports about these unusual Cessnas prowling the skies over nations like Iraq lofting Hellfire missiles at bad guys don’t crop up very often–but that doesn’t mean the AC-208 doesn’t get into its fair share of scraps.

The AC-208 got its first taste of combat in 2014 when the Iraqi military used the Cessna to launch Hellfire missiles at ISIS targets throughout Fallujah and Ramadi and they haven’t let up since. In 2018 an Iraqi AC-208 was even shot down by ISIS fighters using anti-aircraft artillery fire.

On 16 June 2021 USAF's Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) issued a Sources Sought Notice (SSN) for the ""Bridge Tanker"" Programme to determine the number of qualified interested companies capable of providing solutions for the planned non-developmental tanker recapitalisation programme.

An SSN is used by the US government to solicit interest in a project under consideration by for instance the USAF. Also on 16 June the 46th Boeing KC-46A Pegasus was delivered to the USAF. The latter is now based with Seymour Johnson's 916th Air Refueling Wing.

The USAF plans to release the final Request For Proposal (RFP) by the end of 2022. The Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker will be 70 years old when the USAF expects to receive its last Pegasus delivery in 2029.

With a new non-developmental tanker programme in mind Boeing and Airbus could compete again for the USAF tanker modernisation. Earlier a version of the Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) called the Airbus/EADS (North America)/Northrop Grumman KC-45 was proposed to the USAF for its KC-135/KC-10 tanker replacement ""KC-Y"" programme and selected. After Boeing's protest the programme was impaired and eventually cancelled.

The current existing Boeing KC-46A firm-fixed price contracts are limited to 13 production lots with the last planned procurement in 2027 and delivered in 2029. As a commercial derivative aircraft the ""Bridge Tanker"" will be based on existing and emerging technologies with a full and open acquisition competition.

To be continued.

These new radars will enable the Royal Canadian Air Force to detect identify and direct fighter interceptors to potential threats in Canadian and North American aerospace. These radars can also be transported and deployed world-wide to support operations and training exercises for the Royal Canadian Air Force.

The radars which will be delivered by Thales Canada but manufactured by Lockheed Martin will be replacing the Northrop Grumman TPS-70 solution currently in service.

Two of these will replace the existing ones located at 4 Wing Cold Lake in Alberta and 3 Wing Bagotville in Quebec and the third one will be used as needed based on Canadian Armed Forces operational requirements.

First deliveries of the new radars are expected to begin in 2023.

The order is actually divided in two with the first contract covering the acquisition of three new tactical control radar systems sub-systems and associated equipment and second contract for in-service support for an initial work period of five years.

According to the defense ministry the new radars will be ready to accommodate changing technology and improve the systems throughout their life-cycle leading to an overall reduction of life-cycle costs.

The radars are expected to be fully operational within three and a half years of the contracts being awarded.

The company cited low market prices and their transition away from coal as the reason for the closures.

“Closing these plants was a difficult but necessary decision” NRG Energy said in a statement.

The affected plants in Illinois are in Romeoville and Waukegan. They will close in June 2022.

The Waukegan plant which is at 401 East Greenwood Avenue along Lake Michigan employs 65 people.

“Employees will have the opportunity to apply for open positions within NRG” the company said.

“We understand the impact this decision will have on our employees and the local communities. Employees will have the opportunity to apply for open positions within NRG” the statement added.

NRG will also provide transition assistance and severance in accordance with their policies and will engage in Effects Bargaining with IBEW Local 15 for the employees they represent.

Brian Urbaszewski director of environmental health programs for Respiratory Health Association told the Chicago Sun-Times that the plant closings are a “testament to the tireless work of local community leaders living in the shadow of smokestacks.”

Urbaszewski cited a 2012 study that found almost a third of Waukegan High School students had been diagnosed with asthma or experienced asthma symptoms the Sun-Times reported.

The Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition said they applaud the work of Clean Power Lake County Citizens Against Ruining the Environment (CARE) and many others for their “unwavering fight for environmental justice.”

“Years of work hundreds of volunteer meetings and thousands of petition signatures have made this moment possible” the organization said in a statement.

“All eyes are on NRG and state leaders to ensure that communities are included in planning the transition of these plants and the polluted sites they sit on. The closing of the last Chicago-area coal plants also points to the urgent need to pass comprehensive clean energy legislation that includes provisions for a just transition” the statement said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWxhd2FyZW9ubGluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA2LzE5L25yZ3MtaW5kaWFuLXJpdmVyLWNvYWwtZmlyZWQtcG93ZXItcGxhbnQtZXhwZWN0ZWQtY2xvc2UtbmV4dC15ZWFyLzc3NTMwOTAwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indian River coal-fired power plant slated to close next year amid low power prices,"The Indian River coal-fired power plant operated by NRG is slated to close by June of next year according to a announcement by the company during its Investor Day.

The news comes after low power prices were noted in a recent auction from grid-manager PJM. The Millsboro-area plant will close along with two others in Illinois.

“Closing these plants was a difficult but necessary decision” NRG said in a statement.

The plant provides jobs for many in the area and has enough capacity to support an estimated 600000 homes.

Three units of the plant were shut down in previous years leaving the fourth and largest coal unit as the only one remaining.

Coal-fired power plants have struggled to keep up with natural-gas-fired plants that are able to operate with less workers. Energy sources such as wind and power have also become more competitive with coal and Delaware has continued to invest in these efforts.

Natural gas prices have also been low due to an abundance of supplies coming out of deposits in Pennsylvania.

NRG said it will provide transition assistance and severance in accordance with company policies and applicable collective bargaining agreements and will engage in Effects Bargaining with union leadership for represented employees at the impacted sites.

By Will Johnson

Messenger Reporter

GRAPELAND – The Grapeland Chamber of Commerce hosted their monthly mid-morning coffee on Thursday June 17 at Vulcraft a Division of Nucor as the largest employer in Houston County showcased their newly opened grating facility.

Vulcraft GM Josh Wall led off the meeting and welcomed everyone in attendance.

“We had everyone out about a year and a half ago when we did a tour of the joist shop. It was great to have you here and I remember riding around with you and seeing everything we are doing here. This building (grating) has gone up in the last year. We are really getting this business off of the ground. We have folks here from Vulcraft-Utah our sister division. We have new grating teammates here and out in the shop over there. We have a lot going on and it is an exciting time to be a part of Vulcraft-Texas” he said.

Wall then turned the floor over to Chris Gibbs the regional sales manger for grating.

“I wanted to try and start from the beginning and paint a picture of how this came to be here in Grapeland Texas” Gibbs said as he began.

Chris Gibbs



Nucor acquired a grating company called Fisher and Ludlow in 2007 along with other grating assets from another company known as Amoco in 2016 Gibbs said.

The corporation took a hard look at the acquisitions and decided it would like to make a few changes to the newly acquired grating operations “… so we can increase our standing in our product group. The corporation trusted us in Grapeland to take that mission on. It was a huge honor for us and $26-$28 million later along with lots of man hours we have this building. We completed ahead of time and under budget. Since that time we have seen a lot of growth with the plant.”

Gibbs went on to say in the last 18 months the corporation had added 153 new employees and since 2021 86 new jobs have been created.

“We are really excited to continue to bring jobs into the community along with opportunities. A couple of those have been transfers from other Nucor facilities transplanting to the great state of Texas” he said.

“The (grating) business” he continued “we are very excited to say – Josh gets to brief corporate next month – but we are excited to say within the really two months we have been operational we are profitable. It wouldn’t have been possible without the contributions of many of the teammates within the community.”

Rhonda Wuerch

Next to speak was Human Resources Supervisor Rhonda Wuerch.

“I have been with Vulcraft for the past 15 years and it has been my pleasure to work with all of the scholarship kids during that time. I am always blown away by Nucor’s scholarship program. Since 1974 Nucor has paid out over $109 million to help our kids further their education” she said.

Wuerch went on to say recently she received a letter from an area high school senior inquiring about a scholarship. Despite not having a parent working for Nucor Wuerch said she took it before the scholarship committee to see what else the corporation could do to help in the community.

“Our leadership team decided to award up to four $2500 scholarships and we started this year. We developed a scholarship committee and we expect this to grow year-after-year” she said.

Drafting Supervisor Ashley Owens was next to speak and extolled the benefits of being able to work for Nucor in her hometown.

She explained recently Chris Cravens with Latexo ISD had approached the company about what she called an externship.

“He came in and we talked about the benefits what it does how it could help the community and how we could help kids in school who are about to graduate. What we have done this week is have (Latexo FFA Advisor Larry) Mr. Langford here. We are also working with Workforce Solutions out of Lufkin. They are setting up this program and sponsoring it. He (Langford) is coming in to try and understand the career paths we have here” Owens said.

“A lot of people from the outside looking in when they think about Vulcraft they think about welders. They say oh they just hire welders. Well we hire engineers we have IT network administrators we hire drafters and we hire all kinds of other positions. Shipping diesel mechanics and there are a lot of other types of positions we have to offer” she added.

Ashley Owens

Owens explained during Langford’s visit to the facilities the hope was he would learn about the different career paths available be able to bring that back to the district and share it with the students.

She went on to say that next year there was a plan in place to allow seniors and possibly a few juniors to shadow some of the Vulcraft employees in order to see what they do based on their interests.

“We just think this is a great way to show the kids what real life is” Owens said. “If these kids know about the great careers we have here then that is a win.”

Following the various presentations members of the Chamber were offered a tour of the state-of-the-art grating facility and shown how the product was manufactured.

NVDA,Nvidia,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9udmlkaWEtcnR4LTMwODAtcnVtb3JzLW5ld3MtcmVsZWFzZS1kYXRlLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9udmlkaWEtcnR4LTMwODAtcnVtb3JzLW5ld3MtcmVsZWFzZS1kYXRlLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia GeForce RTX 3000: Price release date specs and everything we know,"The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3000 range brings some much-needed updates to the RTX lineup. These new cards sport the Ampere architecture which is built on Samsung’s 8nm process. This new generation is different though delivering performance increases that Nvidia hasn’t seen in many years.

To help you navigate the range — and hopefully the GPU shortage — we rounded up everything you need to know about every Ampere card. The RTX 3080 is the flagship card followed by the RTX 3070 and RTX 3060. There’s also the powerful RTX 3090 for workstation purposes and Ti variants of the rest of the range.

Release date and price

The RTX 3080 was announced on September 1 2020 and it began shipping shortly after on September 17.

Nvidia launched the card for $699 which is the same price as the RTX 2080 and 2080 Super. The larger and more powerful card of the generation the RTX 3090 costs $1500. The 3090 in some sense replaces both the RTX 2080 Ti and RTX Titan. It’s sold in prebuilt gaming PCs though it features 24GB of GDDR6X memory for workstation performance in fields like data science and media production.

Moving down the range the RTX 3070 replaces the 2070 Super and costs $499. It was released shortly after the RTX 3080 and 3090 in October 2020. The “sweet spot” GPU the RTX 3060 Ti was released shortly after in December for $399.

Nvidia announced the RTX 3060 during its CES 2021 press conference replacing the RTX 2060 and 2060 Super. It has an MSRP of $329 and launched in February 2021.

Finally Nvidia revealed the RTX 3080 Ti and 3070 Ti during its Computex 2021 keynote. The RTX 3080 Ti launched on June 3 for $1199 and the the 3070 Ti came a week later on June 10 for $599.

Design

The RTX 3080 Founders Edition features a new “unibody” design that’s a bit more modest compared to the reflective aluminum of the RTX 2000-series cards. We found the card to be quite classy in our review with an angular design that features a matte dark grey finish with white backlighting instead of the traditional green hue used on prior GeForce cards.

Early leaked images revealed a very industrial-looking card with a dual-fan design and they turned out to be accurate. Marking a stark departure from older graphics cards where all the fans are aligned on the same side the RTX 3080 has a fan on each side of the card in an effort to better control the flow of hot and cold air throughout the desktop. Nvidia calls its thermal solution a “dual axial flow” and says it results in twice the cooling performance of its predecessor.

The RTX 3090 uses this same design only it’s much larger as the card utilizes a triple-slot format. The RTX 3070 meanwhile uses a more traditional dual-fan system. For a size comparison check out the photo below. The RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti both use the dual axial design as the more expensive cards in the range.

The RTX 3060 Ti uses a similar design as the RTX 3070 with dual fans on the front for the Founder’s Edition as does the RTX 3060.

The rumor mill has been spinning over a new 12-pin PCIe power interface system for some of these new cards and the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 will make use of the low-profile connectors. The company stated that the new connector combines the power of dual eight-pin connectors in a space-saving design. The RTX 3070 meanwhile uses just a single eight-pin connector as does the RTX 3060 Ti. The RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti utilize the 12-pin connector which you can split off into an eight-plus-eight-pin connector.

Port selection includes three HDMI 2.1 ports and a DisplayPort 1.3a. Importantly HDMI 2.1 supports a variable fresh rate of up to 120Hz in 4K . New OLED TVs have begun to support this new standard which could open up more options for PC gaming in the living room.

Specs

Nvidia made some ambitious claims about its new RTX 3000-series cards and they turned out to be true. First off it said that both the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 are more powerful than the current RTX 2080 Ti. As you can see from the chart below it’s not hard to see how that’s true.

CUDA cores Memory Memory interface Boost clock Graphics card power RTX 3090 10496 24GB GDDR6X 384-bit 1.70GHz 350W RTX 3080 Ti 10240 12GB GDDR6X 384-bit 1.67GHz 320W RTX 3080 8704 10GB GDDR6X 320-bit 1.71GHz 320W RTX 3070 Ti 6144 8GB GDDR6X 256-bit 1.77GHz 290W RTX 3070 5888 8GB GDDR6 256-bit 1.73GHz 220W RTX 3060 Ti 4864 8GB GDDR6 256-bit 1.67GHz 200W RTX 3060 3584 12GB GDDR6 192-bit 1.78GHz 170W RTX 2080 Ti 4352 11GB GDDR6 352-bit 1.54GHz 250W RTX 2080 Super 3072 8GB GDDR6 256-bit 1.82GHz 250W RTX 2070 Super 2560 8GB DRR6 256-bit 1.77GHz 215W

The RTX 3080 features 8704 CUDA cores making for a 65% leap over the RTX 2080 Super and a 50% increase over the RTX 2080 Ti. It’s also a more power-hungry card rated at 320 watts versus the standard 250 watts of the RTX 2080 Ti and RTX 2080 Super.

The RTX 3080 also features 10GB of GDDR6X memory at 19Gbps which is as fast as it gets. Nvidia said it had collaborated with Micron for the G6X video RAM on the card which according to the memory partner delivers a bandwidth of up to 1TB per second. The new Ampere RTX 3080 GPU comes with 30 shader TFLOPs up from 11; 58 ray tracing TFLOPs up from 34; and 238 tensor TFLOPs compared to 89.

Nvidia is also bundling in its new RTX I/O to help improve game loading times on its GPUs. There are three components in play here for the new RTX I/O including new APIs for fast loading and streaming directly from SSD to GPU memory GPU lossless decompression and collaboration with Microsoft for direct storage for Windows.

The result of all this Nvidia claims is twice the performance of the original RTX 2080. In real-life performance the RTX 3080 can consistently run games at 60 fps (frames per second) in 4K with RTX turned on and though performance varies widely across different titles we found in our review that 4K at 60 fps stays. Even ray tracing in 4K at decent frame rates is possible if you turn on DLSS.

Even bigger claims were made about the RTX 3090 which can reportedly play games in 8K at 60 fps. Although that’s a little far the RTX 3090 is still a monster of a card. This is done using DLSS 2.0 of course rather than native rendering. The RTX 3070 meanwhile is supposedly 1.6 times faster than the RTX 2070.

Moving into the mid-range Nvidia has two offerings: The RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3060. The 3060 Ti has already proven itself as the sweet spot for price and performance with an MSRP of only $400. It’s a remarkable card at that price delivering performance similar to the last-gen RTX 2080 Ti (a $1200 GPU) in most games.

The RTX 3060’s specs are for the most part what we’ve come to expect from Nvidia’s RTX 3000 range. The exception is the 12GB of GDDR6 memory surpassing the RTX 3060 Ti 3070 and even 3080.

We have some general performance specs too: 13 shader TFLOPs 25 ray tracing TFLOPs and 101 tensor TFLOPs. Although much lower than the flagship RTX 3080 the RTX 3060’s specs surpass the RTX 2080 Super.

The RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti update the higher-end cards in the range. The RTX 3080 Ti mirrors the RTX 3090 in most specs utilizing nearly as many CUDA Tensor and RT cores. The difference is that it comes with half of the GDDR6X memory making it a great card for gaming but a weaker choice for data science and 3D modeling.

The RTX 3070 Ti is more of a marginal upgrade. It comes with 256 more CUDA cores and a slightly boosted clock compared to the base 3070. The big upgrade is 8GB of G6X memory which is able to deliver much higher bandwidth on the same 256-bit bus.

Performance

The new cards are all built on the new Ampere microarchitecture which is based on Samsung’s 8nm processor featuring 28 billion transistors. Ampere uses second-generation RT cores and third-generation Tensor cores to boost performance.

In our RTX 3080 review we found the performance of the card to be quite impressive. In our 3DMark Time Spy test the performance of the RTX 3090 was 15% better than the RTX 2080 Ti despite the latter costing $500 more than Nvidia’s newest offering and 28% better than the RTX 2080.

We found that the RTX 3080 delivered solid performance uplift compared to the RTX 2080 but the gains weren’t quite as high as what Nvidia claimed. In Assassin’s Creed Odyssey we found that the RTX 3080 was able to hit 61 fps on the game on native 4K resolution when played at 60 fps on Ultra High settings. This translates to a 30% performance boost compared to the RTX 2080 Super. Similarly in the graphics-intensive Battlefield V the game averaged 97 fps in 4K at Ultra settings a result that was 33% better than the RTX 2080 Super.

While the generational improvement in performance was expected for a new GPU family the new Ampere cards perform significantly better at ray tracing the hallmark feature of the RTX family and an area of struggle for the RTX 2000 series. Ampere’s improvements with artificial intelligence and DLSS improve ray tracing performance especially when games are rendered at higher resolutions.

In our test of the RTX 3080 on Battlefield V we found ray tracing capabilities to be far superior when compared to the RTX 2080 Ti. In the mission Tirailleur we found that the scenes rendered beautifully with nice reflections and shadows and the game played at 55 fps in 4K at Ultra settings. When DLSS was enabled performance jumped to 69 fps compared to just 45 fps on the RTX 2080 Ti.

Still there were some performance bottlenecks when ray tracing was turned on. In Fortnite for example our review showed that the RTX 3080 was able to squeeze out an average of 23 frames per second when played at 4K with the highest settings enabled. In 1440p (2K) resolution the game averaged 53 fps. Depending on the game your monitor’s resolution and what you hope to achieve you may want to still leave ray tracing disabled at higher resolutions even on the RTX 3080.

Bringing in the other cards you can expect around a 20% difference in performance for each step down. The RTX 3070 performs about 80% as well as the RTX 3080 and so on. The Ti models complicate things a bit though.

The RTX 3080 Ti is a significant upgrade over the RTX 3080 on paper but it only represents around a 10% improvement in practice. In our RTX 3080 Ti review we found a 9% improvement in 3DMark Time Spy scores compared to the RTX 3080 and it earned around five extra frames per second in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Battlefield V.

We noted a similar performance increase in our RTX 3070 Ti review. We measured an 8% improvement across synthetic and real-world benchmarks mirroring the RTX 3080 Ti (though without the price premium). That said the RTX 3070 Ti isn’t an RTX 3080 killer. It’s more of a 1440p card than a 4K one though it can still run some less demanding games at 4K .

GameRant reports that the prices for NVIDIA and AMD GPUs have been on a steady decline in certain European countries which could suggest that the GPU shortage is going to end much sooner than expected. Average prices for the latest NVIDIA and AMD cards have dropped by as much as 50 percent over there which is one of the biggest price drops yet.

A certain Reddit user plotted the data on the chart and the numbers don't seem to lie. As soon as June started GPU prices are on the downward trend with several of the latest releases from NVIDIA (i.e. RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3060/3060 Ti) dropping to their lowest asking prices since launch.

Digital Trends also picked up on the trend stating that the pricing for the NVIDIA RTX 3080 (which has become the ""poster child"" of the GPU shortage) dropped from around $2700 minimum to around $1700 within a one-month span. That's already a massive $1000 discount though it's still far from the advertised MSRP of $699.

Graphics cards from Team Red are on a downward trend as well when it comes to pricing. The RX 6700 XT for one now sits at an average of 799 (roughly $947 at the time of this writing) as of June 17 from a high of 929 ($1100) a month ago as reported by Tom's Hardware. Other RDNA2 cards have also seen $100-$300 price drops.

NVIDIA and AMD Finally Keeping Up With Demand?

NVIDIA made headlines earlier this year for claiming that the GPU shortage will last until 2021 ends. Perhaps they didn't really see this trend coming but maybe they should have.

One of the biggest contributing factors to graphics card prices going berserk is the current cryptocurrency mining boom. Miners have been snagging GPU stocks since last year which caused street pricing to go bonkers. This is why NVIDIA tried its absolute best to sway miners from buying up stocks by releasing LHR versions of the RTX 3000 line. And these cards actually work too.

But does this mean NVIDIA and AMD are now keeping up with demand? Not really though actual GPU stocks are doing fine. Major retailers do have graphics cards for sale right now even if the prices are still inflated.

Crypto Mining Not As Profitable Anymore

Asrock a major GPU maker forecasts that graphics card demand from miners is going to decrease soon. And that's because some major governments (China specifically) are cracking down at crypto mining mainly due to its insane power requirements. It also doesn't help that crypto values are becoming increasingly volatile which means miners aren't earning as much in the long run.

If you're a PC gamer then you should brace yourself: the GPU-pocalypse could finally end soon.

In fact a number of smartphones and other small gadgets were once upon a time running on low-power NVIDIA chipsets.

We’re talking of course about NVIDIA’s Tegra lineup of processors that went up against systems on a chip (SoCs) from Qualcomm Samsung and others back in the day. That’s right the range of chipsets now powering the likes of the Nintendo Switch gaming console and NVIDIA Shield media player can trace their ancestors back to early smartphones.

Microsoft's Zune HD was the first gadget to use NVIDIA's Tegra.

In fact the very first product to use an NVIDIA Tegra chipset was 2009’s Microsoft Zune HD. Microsoft’s Kin was the first cellphone powered by this range of chips. They weren’t exactly the most popular products back in their day but the company did find a bit more success in the following years.

Android powered by NVIDIA

Nvidia’s next-gen Tegra 2 chipset boasted a much more powerful dual-core Arm Cortex-A9 CPU and an ultra low power GeForce GPU. The Tegra 2 held the Android performance crown for a few months particularly against the commonplace single-core processors on the market. But that lead was short-lived once the dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S3 came along later in the year followed by Samsung’s Exynos 4 Dual.

Still the chipset found success inside 2010’s Android-powered Motorola Droid X2 and LG Optimus 2X handsets although neither sold like hotcakes. The Tegra 2 also powered a reasonably sized selection of other smartphones tablets and even the odd notebook from a variety of brands.

NVIDIA Tegra mobile phones include the Motorola Droid X2 LG Optimus 2X Samsung Galaxy R HTCOne X and Xiaomi Mi 3.

Perhaps the most memorable Tegra 2 release was 2011’s Samsung Galaxy R. The Galaxy R was a bit of a Galaxy S2 spinoff featuring a “Tegra Zone” application that allowed customers to download games optimized specifically for the device — an idea that lasted about as long as you’d expect. Furthermore the chip was considerably more mid-range come 2011 and wasn’t as powerful as the flagship Galaxy S2 model.

NVIDIA followed up with the Tegra 3 in 2011. This next-gen chipset boasted a quad-core Cortex-A9 CPU setup with NEON extensions and a fifth ultra low power companion core a more powerful NVIDIA GeForce GPU and a suite of video decoder technologies making it a much more powerful multi-media machine than its predecessor.

The Tegra 3 powered a small number of memorable Android smartphones. The list comprises the HTCOne X HTCOne X+ and LG Optimus 4X. The One X and X+ reviewed particularly well and played a key role in HTC’s rise to becoming one of the big players in the smartphone game before its equally spectacular fall from grace.

Nvidia’s Tegra 3 had the option for much higher clock speeds too making it suitable for tablets as well as phones. The Tegra 3 powered the Nexus 7 (2012) model ASUS Transformer Pad Sony Xperia Tablet S and the original Microsoft Surface. It was also the brawn behind the ill-fated Ouya Android gaming console.

Moving beyond smartphones

Although NVIDIA’s Tegra powered a small selection of Android smartphones in the early 2010s it wasn’t to last. Smartphone chipsets became increasingly complex with the CPU and GPU playing diminished roles compared to advanced networking and co-processor capabilities in the following years. Instead NVIDIA shifted its chipset ambitions towards the tablet multi-media and eventually handheld game console market.

2013’s Tegra 4 began this transition with a power-hungry 72-core GPU configuration that made it 7x more powerful than the Tegra 3. Combined with four 1.9GHz Cortex-A15 CPU cores low power companion core LPDDR3 memory and a host of video hardware decoding blocks the Tegra 4 continued to find success in Android tablets. It also powered the gaming-centric NVIDIA Shield Portable and the unreleased Mad Catz Mojo as well as the Xiaomi Mi 3 smartphone.

A trimmed down Tegra 4i version with a quad Cortex-A9 CPU and 60-core GPU powered the LG G2 Mini the privacy-focused Silent Circle Blackphone and a couple of Tegra 4 smartphones from Wiko. But this chip marked the end of NVIDIA’s smartphone ambitions.

2014 saw NVIDIA announce the Tegra K1 sporting powerful 192-core Kepler graphics and the option of either a quad-core Cortex-A15 or intriguing dual-core in-house Denver CPU setup. The latter model powered the fan-favorite HTCNexus 9 tablet but the traditional Arm core model was more popular. That version ended up in a small selection of tablets and even a couple of Chromebooks from Acer and HP.

Tegra's breakout success didn't arrive until 2017's Nintendo Switch.

Although appearing in plenty of NVIDIA phones and other devices over the past decade Tegra’s breakout commercial success didn’t arrive until 2017 and the launch of the Nintendo Switch. The handheld console sported 2015’s Tegra X1 and later its 16nm X1+ revision. It was the most powerful Tegra chipset to date with a 256-core Maxwell GPU octa-core Cortex-A57 and A53 CPU and a host of the latest H265 and VP9 video encoding and decoding hardware blocks. The Tegra X1 also powers the hugely popular NVIDIA Shield Android TV devices which set the benchmark for the modern smart TV experience. See also: The best Android TV boxes you can get right now

Subsequent launches of the Tegra X2 Xavier and Orin SoCs have mostly ended up in development boards and automotive systems. It’s not clear if NVIDIA is even focused on consumer products for these chips as its focus switches to machine learning and AI markets.

NVIDIA remains interested in mobile

Nvidia

From music players to smartphones and game consoles NVIDIA has powered a range of popular portable products over the past decade. Although the company may still be best known for its powerhouse PC graphics cards mobile remains firmly in its sights. Up next: What NVIDIA buying Arm means for your next smartphone

NVIDIA is currently seeking regulatory approval to purchase Arm for $40 billion. Remember Arm licenses its CPU architecture and cores found in Tegra Snapdragon Exynos Apple and pretty much every other mobile processor on the market today and over the past decade.

“We finally got one here” Bidinger said after holding off Kevin Blackburn to capture the Cedar Creek Beef Jerky USRA Modified feature win.

Bidinger earned $1000 for the win in the headliner of the Big Adventure RV Weekly Racing Series program.

Other feature winners in the action Presented by iHeart Media were Scotty Allen (O’Reilly Auto Parts USRA Stock Cars) Johnny Fennewald (Missouri Metal Buildings ULMA Late Models) and Andy Bryant (Ozark Golf Cars USRA B-Mods).

Joining the action as a special guest class were the Pure Stocks and Mason Beck earned that feature win.

In the night’s headline division Bidinger took over the lead from Jason Pursley on lap 11 of the 25-lap feature and went on to prevail but it was far from easy for Bidinger.

Bidinger held off repeated challenges from Blackburn and Dillon McCowan and finished .337 seconds – or about one car length – in front of Blackburn. McCowan finished third with Kyle Thompson fourth and Ryan Middaugh fifth.

“I feel like I’ve given away a couple here so hopefully this one makes up for it” said Bidinger who also won on Friday night at Lakeside Speedway. “I just have to thank my family. My dad he helps me a ton and I have to thank my wife and have my entire family.

“This is a big family sport and we enjoy it. All you fans I’m glad you’re here. That’s what makes it fun to come out and race.”

Pursley started on the pole with Bidinger to his outside and it was Pursley leading the first 11 laps before Bidinger took over and prevailed in a hard-fought battle the over the final 14 laps.

McCowan the season points leader made a run at Bidinger on the inside for several laps before Blackburn wrestled away the second position and himself took a run at Bidinger but was unable to get past him.

Allen emerged from a thrilling four-way battle making a last-lap pass to edge Burl Woods and Derek Brown for the O’Reilly Auto Parts USRA Stock Car win by a half-car-length.

Woods wound up second and Derek Brown was third as the trio was separated by just under a half-second at the finish line.

This after Allen came to the white flag behind Woods and Brown.

“There were two super race-car drivers right there Derek Brown and Burl Woods” Allen said. “They have dominated this class and they are great to race with. That was clean good hard racing. We rubbed and touched but nobody was gonna take anybody out. That was a lot of fun.”

The race with four different leaders was a dandy from the start. Brown passed Robert Southerland for the lead coming out of turn four to complete lap three. Just after he slipped back to fourth on the next circuit Southerland spun going down the backstretch to bring out the race’s first caution.

Woods took over the top spot as the race returned to green getting by Brown with an inside move out of turn four. Woods remained in front until the final lap when Allen rallied for his second straight feature win.

Robert White finished fourth and Ed Griggs was fifth.

For the second straight week Fennewald turned the Missouri Metal Buildings ULMA Late Model feature into a complete runaway.

Fennewald started on the front row and led all 20 laps finishing 7.68 seconds in front of second-place Tucker Cox. Just like a week earlier Fennewald’s winning margin equaled nearly a half lap. He lapped half the 20-car field.

The caution-free race took only six minutes and four seconds.

“It’s been not a very good year but we’re kind of hitting on some stuff now” Fennewald said after his third feature victory of the season following finishes of 10th and 11th in the opening two weeks. “The car is really good right now and we have some really good help.

“Hopefully we can keep this up. We’re plugging away” Fennewald said of the points battle which saw him 74 points behind Cole Henson at the start of the night. Henson finished sixth in the feature and the lead is now unofficially 55 points.

“We’re up to second in points. Hopefully we can keep this up and make it a good points battle” Fennewald said.

J.C. Morton started eighth and finished third while Larry Ferris rallied from 17th to finish fourth.

Bryant’s first Ozark Golf Cars USRA B-Mods victory of the season was decisive as he led all 20 laps. He finished 1.86 seconds in front of defending track champion Kris Jackson.

“It’s always stiff competition in the B-Mods here” Bryant said. “You’ve got the last five or six years nationals champions who race here weekly.”

Bryant started on the front row and had opened up a 3.8-second lead by lap five over Jackson when a caution wiped that margin out. But it didn’t take long before Bryant riding the high groove opened up another comfortable margin.

When a lap-15 caution slowed things Bryant was 3.2 seconds in front of Jackson with Ryan Gillmore 6.1 seconds behind the leader. Bryant handled the restart without issue and pulled away for his fifth USRA B-Mod win overall in 2021.

Gillmore finished third with Tyler Kidwell fourth from a 14th-starting position and JC Newell wound up fifth.

Beck led all 15 laps to earn the Pure Stocks feature win a race plagued by six cautions forcing Beck to protect his lead on each restart.

Beck wound up 1.9 seconds in front of runner-up Jeremy Wheeler. Conrad Kaufman was third and Dustin Ladd finished fourth. Kaufman started third but spun on the opening lap to bring out a caution and had to rally from tailback.

“I’ve never raced against any of these guys before. I didn’t know what to expect” Beck said. “I’ve raced here but I’d never seen any of them or raced against them at any other track.”

Beck won on Friday night as his hometown Dallas County Speedway. He was 12th in the Pure Stocks’ other appearance this season at Lucas Oil Speedway on April 17.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Father's Day can bring up a myriad of emotions for dads.



If your father is still around it's likely a time of celebration and joy. But if you've lost a child or recently lost your father or never had a dad it can bring on a sense of grief and sadness.



Old Dominion University Basketball Coach Jeff Jones isn't quite sure how he will feel on Sunday.



""I haven't really thought about it. And I think that's been intentional on my part"" Jones said as his eyes welled with tears and he choked up with emotion.



It's likely you don't know that Bob Jones Jeff's father and a famous coach in his own right passed away five weeks ago. It wasn't mentioned by the local media or on our websites.



But Jeff's father had a remarkable life one worth celebrating especially as we celebrate the fathers in our lives on Sunday.



Bob Jones looked remarkably like Jeff his oldest son and was a successful high school and college coach. He was an assistant coach on two Division II national championship teams at Kentucky Wesleyan and after being named head coach won a national title in 1973 when he was named the Division II Coach of the Year.







He was a successful baseball coach at both the high school and collegiate level.



He was also a pretty good human being.



He taught special education students and often volunteered in the community to help kids.



His innate sense of goodness was revealed during his funeral when a former Kentucky Wesleyan baseball player stood up and told a story about him.



It was April 4 1968 the day Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Kentucky Wesleyan was playing at Florida A&M an historically Black university. FAMU's athletic director interrupted the game walked toward the Wesleyan bench and told Jones that Dr. King had been assassinated.



""You'd better get your team out of here"" he said.



There were riots nationwide and the students on the Tallahassee Florida campus were understandably angry. Some began to rock the bus as Wesleyan's team departed.



An hour or so down the road the team stopped to eat.



""The team had one African-American player"" Jeff said. ""The guy at the front door says 'You guys can come on in but that boy will have to eat in the back.' ""



That ""boy.""



At the time teams from predominantly white schools tolerated Black players being forced to eat in the kitchen at restaurants.



But not Bob Jones.







He responded by saying ""(bleep) you. We're out of here.""



Jeff hadn't heard that story until the funeral.



""You find out all kinds of things about your parents later in life"" Jeff said. ""I liked that story. I liked it very much.""



Bob Jones had a hard side to him as a coach but not so much to his sons and daughter.



""My mom was the disciplinarian"" Jones said.



""To us he was affectionate and fun. He was great dad. There was that kind of contrast between being strong and tough as a coach but at home he was gentle and caring.""



Jeff and his brother Doug were standout basketball players from an early age. They both attended Kentucky Wesleyan practices and when practice was over they would play one-on-one in the gym until Bob Jones was ready to go home.



Jeff knew his father was a great coach but he set boundaries early on.



""When I was in the seventh or eighth grade I told my Dad I didn't want him to be my coach"" Jeff said. ""I wanted him to be my father.""



Bob Jones smiled and readily agreed.







Bob Jones had a wry sense of humor which his family saw when they would come together at the Outer Banks almost every summer.



Bob Jones loved to tease Jeff's two daughters Meghann and Madison. One time he poured ketchup onto a butcher knife then added a few tufts of hair he cut from his head and ran indoors and yelled that that he'd been attacked by a bear.



They were fooled only momentarily.



As Jeff Jones moved into head coaching Bob Jones tagged along for the ride. Jones became close with many of his son's players at both the University of Virginia and American University.



Bob Jones once attended a U.Va. practice with Doug Jones just before the Cavaliers were set to play Notre Dame. Afterwards he approached assistant coach Dennis Wolff (who is now at ODU) and told him that U.Va. standout Junior Burrough simply could not play against the Fighting Irish.



""He was pathetic"" Wolff remembers Bob Jones telling him.



Turns out that Junior Burrough was simply not a good practice player. He scored 20 points the next night. Jeff said his dad was stunned.



Jeff Jones came to ODU eight years ago and his players here didn't have as much a chance to meet Bob. He was sick much of the last decade of his life. He had open heart surgery several years ago and was treated for cancer.



Cancer runs in the family. Jeff's mother Carol beat breast cancer a few years ago. Jeff has battled prostate cancer since 2015. Bob Jones also beat cancer albeit just shortly before he died.







At his viewing in Alexandria Kentucky there was a long line around the building for three hours. The next day Grant's Lick Baptist Church was full for his funeral. Former U.Va. players sent flowers and testimonials poured in from around the country.



Rex Chapman the former University of Kentucky and Charlotte Hornets star described Bob Jones as ""his first idol"" on Twitter. Chapman was a standout at Apollo High School in Owensboro Kentucky the same school Jeff attended. He often attended Bob Jones' summer camps.



A few paragraphs from Bob Jones' obituary stood out to me.



""Bob will be remembered as a gentle giant who embraced God and his loved ones with an unyielding heart. Bob was also a man of contrasts. His extreme toughness on the court was matched by the tenderness his family evoked.



""He was a demanding coach and he didn't suffer fools. But if he liked you his fierce loyalty and protectiveness were profound. He had strong convictions and was greatly respected but never took himself too seriously.







""The only thing better than Bob's big open smile which you saw in every photograph was Bob's big open heart.""



I had the privilege of interviewing Bob Jones a couple of years ago just before Jeff won his 500th game in November of 2019. Earlier that year Jeff had cried unashamedly into a towel after his team won its first Conference USA title.



As Bob Jones told me ""The only one crying harder than Jeff was me.



""I know this sounds like a father but I truly believe if anyone deserves that kind of recognition it's Jeff.



""This hasn't been easy for him. Nothing has been given to him. He had to work for everything.



""I'm proud of his 500th win. It's a tremendous accomplishment.



""But his humbleness how he treats people how he tries to help others he doesn't even know all of that makes me the proudest of all as a father.""

The Terps offered Long on March 12 2020 and remained the only power five school to extend an early offer to the sophomore. He chose Maryland over offers from Old Dominion Massachusetts and Temple.

“Gods Timing! Proud To Announce That I Am 110% Committed To The University of Maryland!” Long wrote in a Twitter post.

Long saw action in six games during the shortened 2020 season for St. Peter’s Prep but sat behind senior quarterback Tahj Bullock on the offensive side of the ball. Despite that Long served as the team’s primary punter booting 21 kicks for 653 yards (31.1-yard average) with three landing inside the 20 yard line. His effort as a punter earned him a spot on the 2020 Hudson Reporter All-Area Defensive Team.

Appearing in eight games as a freshman quarterback in 2019 Long completed 81 of 140 passes for 1317 yards and 13 touchdowns with five interceptions. He added 246 yards and three touchdowns on the ground.

At 6-foot 200 pounds Long has decent size with room to continue growing as a quarterback. He posesses natural athletic ability with the option to scramble always present but particularly does a good job of taking contact and pushing forward. He also throws an accurate ball and can make some key plays on the move.

Long becomes the first commitment for Maryland’s 2023 Class making the program one of 10 to have a pledge this early in the cycle.

As the Terps prepare for the future beyond Taulia Tagovailoa Long will follow 2022 commits AJ Swann Jayden Sauray and potentially Preston Howard at the position. Maryland head coach Mike Locksley and offensive coordinator Dan Enos have put a strong focus on the quarterback position putting the pieces together to be competitive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNobmljaWFub25saW5lLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvbmMtc3RhdGUtYmFzZWJhbGwtb3BlbnMtY29sbGVnZS13b3JsZC1zZXJpZXMtd2l0aC1iYWNrLWFuZC1mb3J0aC12aWN0b3J5LW92ZXItc3RhbmZvcmQvYXJ0aWNsZV80OTU1MDA4Yy1kMTUyLTExZWItYThjMi0xYjBjOTJkY2YzY2QuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NC State baseball opens College World Series with back-and-forth victory over Stanford,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Pick up one of these officially licensed OMAHOOS shirts with super speedy delivery! Available in both navy blue and gray and in adult tshirt youth tshirt and adult hoodie styles. Buy now.

In the Columbia Regional the Hoos had to overcome the high-powered Old Dominion Monarchs and their lineup which led the nation (at the time) in home runs. Then they earned a three game series with the team immediately behind the Monarchs in Dallas Baptist and their 101 homers (good for third in the country). Now it’s only fitting that Virginia’s opening opponent at the College World Series the Tennessee Volunteers come in just behind the Patriots at 98 home runs on the year. The Cavaliers pitchers were able to stymy their previous opponents bats just enough to get the wins but will they be able to do the same against the Volunteers.

As a team the Vols hit .280 good for fifth in the SEC. Their 98 home runs were second in the conference behind the nation’s leader Arkansas. While they definitely have pop they are also prone to the strikeout coming in fourth in the SEC with 557 Ks. That’s something Virginia will have to take advantage of if they wish to stay at the top of the bracket in Omaha.

Tennesse is anchored by their left side led by third baseman Jake Rucker and shortstop Liam Spence. Rucker was second on the team in hitting with a .331 batting average and led the squad in hits and doubles. On the year he was named to the All-SEC First Team and was a Third Team All-American by Baseball America. Next to him in the infield is Spence who’s an on-base machine. The senior from Australia reached base at a .477 clip which led the conference. He led the team in runs and walks and it should be a focal point of Virginia’s game plan to keep him off the base paths.

The right side of the Volunteer infield is where you’ll find the power. At first Luc Lipcius only hit .248 but tied for the team lead in home runs with 15 and was third on the team in runs scored with 47. Joining Spence up the middle is Max Ferguson. The junior batted .256 and knocked 12 home runs. He was second behind Spence in walks with 46 but did lead the team in strikeouts with 70.

Around the outfield the Volunteers have a trio who all hit double-digit home runs. Jordan Beck mans the left side and tied Lipcius with 15 dingers on the year. Beck led the team in RBI and was second in the SEC in that category. Coming in just one home run behind is Evan Russell. The senior rightfielder knocked 14 long balls and was third on the team in slugging percentage at .520. Up the middle Drew Gilbert hit .275 while hitting ten home runs. He also came in second on the team in RBI and led the team in hit by pitch. Gilbert a sophomore also pitches for Volunteers having appeared in seven games and having a 0.00 ERA to show for it.

Behind the plate is Connor Pavolony. Pavolony only played in 47 games this season but he made them count. In just 148 at bats he slugged seven home runs. A number that is more than all but four Cavaliers.

Virginia and Tennessee face off Sunday at 2 PM EDT. The game will be on ESPN2 as both teams look to get their CWS started with a win."

I am from Syria. More than three years after completing my studies I escaped from the war and arrived at Lebanon in 2014.

What was your education experience before joining the MBA programme?

At Aleppo University I studied management and accounting for small and intermediate projects as an undergraduate. In Lebanon I studied again from the start and got a degree in business management in 2019 from Lebanese International University.

What are the barriers to pursuing higher education in Lebanon?

The most important obstacles that refugees face in their studies in Lebanon are difficulty obtaining residency permits in addition to the bad economic situation – especially for Syrian refugees who find it difficult to complete their university studies through their own income if they have an income.

How did you find out about Theirworld’s MBA scholarship programme?

Through an invitation I received on the e-mail of the organisation where I work. The administration shared it with those interested in completing their higher studies. And also through a link that was shared on the WhatsApp group of some friends.

Why did you want to study for an MBA?

To complement the ambition I have had since the beginning of my university studies in Syria. It will necessary for us to seek to obtain skills and academic education to work on the advancement of the country again when the situation changes after the war.

Also I want to improve my professional life and be able to create my own business when the opportunity arises.

What has been your favourite part of the course so far?

The comprehensiveness of the materials and how to use them in practical situations. There is also flexibility in dealing with those in charge of the programme.

What do you hope to do after graduating?

In the short term work on developing my own project. And obtaining a doctorate in the same specialty.

What has been the most important lesson you have learned outside of a classroom?

Work life is very different from academic study. Through my work for about 10 years and studying in several universities I note that the academic study looks at issues and theories from a rigid perspective.

As for practical life there is more than one way to deal with situations and it is not easy to treat them in the same way that can be established through theories. I think the mean reason for success is passion.

How has a difficult year in Lebanon – with the financial crisis and political crises and Covid-19 – affected you and your studies?

2020 was one of the most difficult years. The quarantine had a negative moral effect apart from the critical economic situation in Lebanon. Throughout the year I was trying to ignore the bad situation in Lebanon to try to focus more on studying but the quarantine had an impact on work and studying.

The work was going on a long time because of being at home all day which caused more pressure.

Has your experience of being a refugee changed your thoughts on education and its importance?

Continuing education and excellence has a great impact in relieving the pressures of social life in the country of asylum. It also provides an opportunity for professional development and to expand concepts and capabilities.

If you were making the case for education to a room full of world leaders what would you say?

First of all it is necessary to read the reality of education in the countries of asylum and to understand the extent of the disaster facing an entire generation of children and youth who have lost their education.

They must take the issue of educating them seriously and provide what is necessary for the continuation of their education. Because knowledge is the only saviour from ignorance and extremism.

From another point of view they must pressure host countries to facilitate the education process for refugees and find mechanisms to follow up on dropouts from education. They need the facilities and scholarships to complete education.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Graphene presents an attractive value proposition to nearly every possible engineering discipline from heavy duty coatings through to water filtration mechanisms. However the global semiconductor business now worth close to half a trillion dollars a year is where this unique material is likely to be most impactful. In this article we look at what graphene’s implications could be both in the short term and much further ahead for this huge global industry.

Graphene is comprised of an atom-thick arrangement of carbon atoms that are held together by ultra-strong nuclear bonds. This material offers very high electron mobility the speed at which electrons move through the material when a voltage is applied. Industry analysts at McKinsey estimate that by 2030 the annual market for graphene-based semiconductors will have reached approximately $70 billion. There is the prospect of digital integrated circuits (ICs) power discretes displays and optical transceivers plus various forms of next generation sensor devices all benefiting from its inclusion.

Using graphene the operational frequencies at which processors run could be heightened and the durability of the solid-state drives used in data storage extended. It will be possible to produce wireless devices that can address the higher end of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum while also remaining compact and inexpensive. The overall robustness of devices could be markedly improved with elevated working temperatures alongside greater resilience to voltage transients and electro-static discharge (ESD) strikes.

Graphene’s incredible ability to conduct generated heat will result in less room needing to be taken up by thermal management mechanisms. Its superior radiation tolerance will make it invaluable in space-oriented applications while a combination of its optical and conductive characteristics will be pivotal in the advancement of photonics — allowing faster modulation and higher degrees of sensitivity.

So given that graphene was first successfully isolated by a university research team way back in 2004 and we are now in 2021 – why has this universally celebrated ‘wonder material’ still to see widespread adoption by chip manufacturers?

The overriding problem is that though graphene is relatively easy to make on a small scale inside a stable laboratory environment migrating its production to volume manufacturing facilities has considerable technical challenges. Yet this is something that is clearly going to be required by the major players in the semiconductor industry. Here the investment in production equipment is huge so acceptable profit margins can only be achieved if the output quantities are high enough. Graphene synthesis therefore needs to be done in a completely scalable manner.

Lessons learnt from history

Key to graphene securing adoption within this sector will be the capacity for its production to be successfully aligned with established semiconductor fabrication processes. There must be adequate provision for it to be ramped up to very high volumes rather than just remaining restricted to small batches with overly heavy price points. To do this calls for a method via which graphene deposition can be done across a wide area.

There are clear similarities here with what happened within the semiconductor industry many decades ago. The early IC prototypes put together by Jack Kilby gave some idea of what was possible but they did not come close to offering a commercially viable end product. It was not until an efficient way of producing these devices in large volumes was found that things could really start to take off. Once this was finally achieved a few years later then IC sales kept growing year on year — not just gradually but at very close to an exponential rate. The much-famed Moore’s Law took hold and because of the increasing transistor densities this projected unit costs kept on falling.

What was needed for ICs to become a success was the means to produce them in very large amounts with little expense — and this is the same dynamic that is at play when we talk about graphene today. By finding an effective volume production method for graphene that is suitable for semiconductor integration it will be possible to tap into the economies of scale that drive the chip industry.

Re-evaluating synthesis methodologies

Currently the commercial production of wide-area graphene monolayers relies on chemical deposition onto a metal catalyst (most commonly in the form of copper or nickel foil). If the graphene is going to be applied to a useful semiconductor substrate a transfer procedure needs to be carried out. This means etching away the copper film picking up the graphene layer and transferring it to a semiconductor wafer like silicon. Copper from the catalyst that the graphene monolayer was originally grown on can end up being taken with it. The contamination impinging onto the graphene layer is detrimental to device reliability and yield. In addition structural inconsistencies are commonly witnessed which curb the performance parameters that can be achieved.

Besides the quality issues outlined above the transfer process is highly labor intensive. This makes it difficult to integrate the process into existing manufacturing facilities and therefore and raises the cost. All the resources poured into chemical deposition of graphene onto a copper substrate have failed to produce a scalable process that produces graphene at a quality the industry needs.

A new approach

Paragraph has pioneered an alternative to the flawed chemical deposition methodologies which supports large-area graphene synthesis while still ensuring product purity. Its patented metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) technique means that graphene may be grown directly onto the semiconductor substrate rather than needing to be transferred thereby avoiding all the issues associated with such actions. MOCVD delivers consistently repeatable results and brings graphene synthesis in line with standard processes that represent the largest proportion of today’s semiconductor production. The graphene produced exhibits high degrees of structural integrity while avoiding the contaminant problems that are associated with other methods.

Graphene deposition is the starting point for wide scale use of the material in semiconductor applications. From there growth of dielectrics on or below the graphene lithography and contacting all play a part in device design and performance. Adoption of new graphene growth methods opens the industry up to take advantage of its properties and develop complementary technologies for device manufacture.

It is possible for a wide variety of different semiconductor substrates to be employed – such as Si (Si) gallium nitride (GaN) silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon germanium (SiGe). All kinds of semiconductor products could thus be improved via having graphene elements incorporated into them. Furthermore the process will be straightforward for chip manufacturers to assimilate into their existing workflows so there will be minimum disruption.

The future of graphene in semiconductors



Current manufacturing capacity allows for only small quantities of devices. However new and existing partnerships in the semiconductor industry will enable an expansion of capacity to full product level. Graphene-based products will remain more expensive that their alternatives in the short term until the supply chains are fully developed and the benefit of economies of scale are realised. However there is an immediate step change in device performance available from graphene-based devices.

Graphene Hall Effect sensors developed by Paragraf are now seeing increasing use with high-energy physics among the areas of greatest traction so far. Published collaborations between Paragraf and CERN have shown that Graphene Hall affect Sensors (GHS) exhibit negligible “planar Hall effect.” This property which separates graphene from other materials will enable new kinds of high accuracy magnet characterisation techniques. It is expected the graphene-enhanced RF components and optical modulators will also soon start to emerge. Graphene-based semiconductors will continue to build further momentum in the coming years as this sector gradually matures.

Likewise with a newly-appointed vice premier at the microchip helm China is leaving itself no more excuses to fail.

The nation’s decision to anoint a “chip czar” is the latest step to advance its semiconductor industry in the face of harsh US sanctions.

While China still has a ways to go in catching up to the US Taiwan and South Korea Vice Premier Liu He is a worthy choice to spearhead the development of future semiconductor technologies Business Standard reported.

He’s headed China’s technology reform since at least 2018 acted as chief negotiator in US-China trade talks and his position within leader Xi Jinping’s inner circle ensures his recommendations get heard.

The Harvard-educated career bureaucrat is not an engineer but more of an expert in economics and industrial policy.

That means the 69-year old Liu will have to rely on experts when it comes to decisions in his remit: semiconductor materials equipment and processes.

But rather than merely catch-up Liu’s chip strategy will likely be to explore areas rivals have yet to master in the hope that China can colonize these technologies.

It’s the kind of moonshot approach that the People’s Republic already practices. China last week released the first images taken on Mars as part of its Tianwen-1 interplanetary mission.

That success according to Beijing-based consultancy Trivium “validates the focus on pursuing leapfrog development” focusing on next-generation technologies where no country has a clear advantage.

Beijing is right to trumpet this success in space and the results ought to boost morale within its struggling chip sector.

According to the South China Morning Post China’s output of integrated circuits (IC) in May reached an all-time single month high as the country pulled out all stops to produce chips according to central government data.

China’s chip output in May surged 37.6% from a year ago to 29.9 billion units the National Bureau of Statistics date showed.

Could China’s bold technological success on Mars inspire equal success on the domestic semiconductor front? Courtesy: Xinhua.

While China’s chip makers are not able to produce high volumes of advanced 14-nm node chips — the type needed to power the latest iPhones — the country’s chip designers and manufacturers can produce mature technology ICs for home appliances and automobiles SCMP reported.

In the first five months of this year China produced 139.9 billion IC units a 48.3% surge compared to the same period last year data showed.

The latest data confirms that China is sparing no effort in its pursuit of self-sufficiency in semiconductors SCMP reported.

In March Beijing moved to waive levies on imported semiconductor parts and materials until 2030 SCMP reported. The Chinese government has declared its ambition to cultivate a US$237 billion domestic component market by 2023.

Meanwhile Huawei Technologies is adamant in its pursuit of developing world-beating semiconductors despite toughened US sanctions according to Catherine Chen a Huawei director and senior vice-president Nikkei Asia reported.

Chen said the company has no intention of restructuring chip design subsidiary HiSilicon despite the fact it has more than 7000 workers on its payroll and is expected to go years without contributing to earnings.

But Huawei is privately held and unaffected by external forces and its management has clearly shown it intends to retain HiSilicon Chen said.

In May 2020 the US government barred companies using American-made products or services from doing business with Huawei in principle.

As a result Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) the world’s biggest contract semiconductor maker and other companies have stopped accepting new orders from Huawei.

The action was harshly criticized by ASML Holding CEO Peter Wennink who told Bloomberg export controls against China will not only fail to halt its technological progress but also and ironically hurt the US economy.

China has been blocked from acquiring advanced lithography tools from the Dutch industry leader due to the US-China tech war.

“I believe that export controls are not the right way to manage your economic risks if you have determined that there is an economic risk” Wennink said during an online industry event arguing that if “you close China from access to technology that will also cost non-Chinese economies a lot of jobs and a lot of income.”

While it will take a long time for China to build its own semiconductor equipment and technology due to a lack of access to foreign technology eventually non-Chinese companies will be shut out of one of the largest chip markets Wennink said.

If American business with China on semiconductors is cut off completely it will probably cost anywhere between US$80 billion to US$100 billion in sales and 125000 jobs in the US Wennink added citing Commerce Department estimates Bloomberg reported.

ASML which has a de facto monopoly on advanced extreme ultraviolet lithography equipment needed to make cutting-edge chips is a crucial supplier to Samsung Electronics and TSMC but it has plans to drive deeper into China.

Beijing wants to build a world-class home-grown chip industry to wean itself off foreign imports — an effort that would need ASML’s one-of-a-kind EUV machines Bloomberg reported.

Yet the company faced difficulty getting the Dutch government to renew a license to export the systems to China amid ongoing trade tensions.

The bad news?

Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) the nation’s flagbearer in manufacturing is still years behind global leaders TSMC and Samsung.

And those rivals aren’t sitting still. TSMC is set to invest US$100 billion over the next three years to extend its outright dominance while Samsung and Intel Corp. have announced bold spending plans.

Nevertheless SMIC has taken the lead in realizing Beijing’s goals securing municipal funding to establish a US$2.6 billion plant in Shenzhen.

Europe too is hoping to ensure to become less dependent when it comes to microchips.

An investment of over €1.6 billion in the production of high-quality semiconductors at a Milan factory was announced this week InnovationOrigins reported.

The plant will produce silicon wafers with a diameter of 300 millimeters. It is the first of its generation in Italy and one of the few such plants in Europe. STMicroelectronics (STM for short) is a French-Italian company in which both states hold a minority stake.

The commissioning last week of a chip factory in Stuttgart Germany is also seen in this context where Bosch is beginning production of complex semiconductors for the automotive industry.

In addition the US Senate is currently mulling over a bill that would provide US$30 billion in funding for the American semiconductor industry.

Congress approved similar legislation last summer but did not fund it. However lawmakers have been moved to action as the chip shortage has disrupted American car production.

The development of such a device could enable next-generation satellite communication systems capable of transferring more data at a faster rate and over longer distances according to the research team.

Scientists at LLNL and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) reported on the design and simulation of the novel photoconductive device in a paper published in the IEEE Journal of the Electron Devices Society. The device utilizes a high-powered laser to generate an electron charge cloud in the base material gallium nitride while under extreme electric fields.

Unlike normal semiconductors in which electrons move faster as the applied electrical field is increased gallium nitride expresses a phenomenon called negative differential mobility where the generated electron cloud doesn’t disperse but actually slows down at the front of the cloud. This allows the device to create extremely fast pulses and high voltage signals at frequencies approaching one terahertz when exposed to electromagnetic radiation researchers said.

“The goal of this project is to build a device that is significantly more powerful than existing technology but also can operate at very high frequencies” said LLNL engineer and project principal investigator Lars Voss. “It works in a unique mode where the output pulse can actually be shorter in time than the input pulse of the laser — almost like a compression device. You can compress an optical input into an electrical output so it lets you potentially generate extremely high speed and very high-power radio frequency waveforms.”

If the photoconductive switch modeled in the paper could be realized it could be miniaturized and incorporated into satellites to enable communication systems beyond 5G potentially transferring more data at a faster rate and over longer distances Voss said.

High-power and high-frequency technologies are one of the last areas where solid state devices have yet to replace vacuum tubes Voss added. New compact semiconductor technologies capable of operating at more than 300 gigahertz (GHz) while delivering a watt or more in output power are in high demand for such applications and while some high electron mobility transistors can reach frequencies higher than 300 GHz they are generally limited in energy output researchers reported.

“Modeling and simulation of this new switch will provide guidance to experiments reduce costs of test structures improve the turnaround and success rate of laboratory tests by preventing trial and error and enable correct interpretation of experimental data” said lead author Shaloo Rakheja an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and resident faculty at the Holonyak Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory at UIUC.

Researchers are building the switches at LLNL and are exploring other materials such as gallium arsenide to optimize performance.

“Gallium arsenide expresses the negative differential mobility at lower electric fields than gallium nitride so it’s a great model to understand the tradeoffs of the effect with more accessible testing” said LLNL postdoctoral researcher and co-author Karen Dowling.

The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) plans to build a chip manufacturing facility in Arizona might have more to them than meets the eye. Taking stock of TSMC's public announcements the fab will invest $12 billion in Arizona over the course of the next few years with the facility set to produce semiconductors on the 5nm process node in 2024.

However several rumors have hinted that TSMC is considering going beyond the initial scope of its announcements. Now job applications for the seventeen posts open for TSMC's Arizona hint that perhaps something larger might be afoot a fact that bolstered by the company hiring a decades-old Intel Corporation human resources and recruiting veteran for the Arizona plant at the start of this year.

TSMC's Acceptance Rate To Beat Harvard If Public Statements Hold

The first rumors of TSMC's management considering expanding its Arizona plans surfaced in February when Taiwanese sources reported that the fab offered financial incentives to its employees in the country for working in the Arizona foundry. These sources also claimed that TSMC's plant expansion consideration involved increasing its footprint to include six factories to bump its publicly outlined output of 20000 wafers/month five times to 100000 wafers/month.

To boost these rumors when we look at the number of job applications that TSMC has received for its Arizona plant openings and assume highly conservative acceptance rates then it appears that we've found another potential link for the narrative that it might expand the facility's manufacturing footprint.

A cursory look at the facility's job openings reveals that seventeen positions are open for applications right now. Opening them up redirects us to their Linkedin pages where data gathered from the job application site reveals that for all engineering positions a total of 13166 applications have been submitted to the platform.

Applications for the role of a process integration engineer responsible for fine-tuning TSMC's manufacturing process and working with its customers reveals that 2340 applicants have applied for the role as of yesterday. Image: LinkedIn

Publicly TSMC has revealed that it plans to recruit 300 engineers for its entry-level positions in the U.S. plant. Assuming that the company does not expand the Arizona facility and ends up hiring only 300 engineers from the thirteen thousand applications submitted reveals that the fab's acceptance rate would stand at 2.2%. This implies that it is more selective than Harvard University even though the comparison is ill merited.

Additionally our analysis also does not factor in the fact that some applicants should have applied for more than one position. Assuming that a third of all applicants have done so puts the actual number of people applying for positions at TSMC at 8777. Should the company hire only three hundred from these its new acceptance rate turns out to be 3.4% which is still lower than Harvard's 5.2% rate this year.

Another event that adds to the narrative that perhaps something larger is afoot in Arizona is the fact that Intel's former Technology Manufacturing Human Resources Director Mr. Benjamin Miller joined TSMC in January this year. At Intel Mr. Miller spent more than 25 years and started from managing teams made up of 12 employees to manage all of Intel's human resources professionals globally for technology manufacturing. Mr. Mill is now TSMC's head of human resources and perhaps he too is motivated by the vast number of employees under his charge once the Arizona fab kicks off production in 2024.

All in all unless TSMC officially confirms that it will expand production at the Arizona plant everything suggesting so is speculation. The fab's primary motivation in doing so will be its customer demands as its chief executive officer Dr. C.C. Wei highlighted the rationale behind expanding a Chinese fab during its latest earnings call earlier this year. With the United States Government seemingly going 'all-in' to boost homeland chip production there is plenty of incentive for TSMC to make the shift already."

The 23-year-old signed on loan from Jamaican Premier League club Montego Bay United back in April was on target in the first half to double the Switchbacks’ lead after they went behind as early as the 11th minute through a Marlon Vargas strike.

Guinean international Hadji Barry who provided three assists on the night scored in the 80th to stretch his side’s lead to 3-1 and even though Alec Diaz pulled one back five minutes later Congolese international Michee Ngalina added a fourth and his second of the game for Colorado in the 89th minute.

The victory was the first for Colorado at the new Weidner Field and only their second of the new season keeping them one from bottom in the Mountain Division on eight points.

Vargas opened the scoring when he capitalised on poor defending to score from close range but Ngalina equalised with a terrific lob from 22-yards after being released by Barry.

Beckford who featured for Jamaica Under-23s at the 2019 Pan American Games then gave the hosts the lead in the 36th minute arriving at the far post to finish off a clinical move which started out on the right when full back Sebastian Anderson squared for Barry who then provided the assist.

Up 2-1 at the half Colorado were forced to wait until 10 minutes from time for their third goal when Barry completed a flowing move.

Some nervousness was created when Diaz rounded the ’keeper and scored the visitors’ second but Ngalina’s solo run down the left killed the game off.

Another Jamaican Rojay Smith scored his second of the season and provided an assist but Sporting Kansas City II crashed to a 4-3 defeat to hosts FC Tulsa at Oneok Field.

The 24-year-old Smith opened the scoring in the seventh minute when Tulsa lost the ball just outside the 18-yard box and the former Harbour View player calmly beat the ’keeper to his left with a low left-footed drive.

However the hosts responded emphatically when Rodrigo da Costa and Marlon both scored in the last four minutes before the break before Dario Suarez added a third from the spot in the 62nd after being brought down by Kayden Pierre.

When Joaquin Rivas added the fourth in the 72nd minute the game appeared done and dusted but Smith set up the first of Tyler Freeman’s two late strikes to make things interesting at the end.

Tulsa’s win broke a three-game losing streak and left them third on 12 points in the Central Division while the defeat for Sporting was their first in four games but their fourth in nine outings leaving them one from bottom on seven points.

At MSU Soccer Park in New Jersey veteran Jamaican striker Dane Kelly netted his second of the campaign but Charlotte Independence went down 3-1 to New York Red Bulls II.

The 30-year-old scored from the penalty spot in the 69th but a first half brace from Jeremy Rafanello along with a 62nd strike from Roald Mitchell had already put the hosts in control of the encounter.

At AutoZone Park in Memphis Trinidad and Tobago international Ajani Fortune was sent off in the 36th minute for a second yellow card as his Atlanta United 2 suffered a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Memphis 901 FC.

Your payment may be deductible,"As ransomware attacks surge the FBI is doubling down on its guidance to affected businesses: Don’t pay the cybercriminals. But the U.S. government also offers a little-noticed incentive for those who do pay: The ransoms may be tax deductible.

The IRS offers no formal guidance on ransomware payments but multiple tax experts interviewed by The Associated Press said deductions are usually allowed under law and established guidance. It’s a “silver lining” to ransomware victims as some tax lawyers and accountant put it.

But those looking to discourage payments are less sanguine. They fear the deduction is a potentially problematic incentive that could entice businesses to pay ransoms against the advice of law enforcement. At a minimum they say the deductibility sends a discordant message to businesses under duress.

“It seems a little incongruous to me” said Rep. John Katko the top Republican on the House Committee on Homeland Security.

Deductibility is a piece of a bigger quandary stemming from the rise in ransomware attacks in which cybercriminals scramble computer data and demand payment for unlocking the files. The government doesn’t want payments that fund criminal gangs and could encourage more attacks. But failing to pay can have devastating consequences for businesses and potentially for the economy overall.

A ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline last month led to gas shortages in parts of the United States. The company which transports about 45% of fuel consumed on the East Coast paid a ransom of 75 bitcoin — then valued at roughly $4.4 million. An attack on JBS SA the world’s largest meat processing company threatened to disrupt food supplies. The company said it had paid the equivalent of $11 million to hackers who broke into its computer system.

Ransomware has become a multibillion-dollar business and the average payment was more than $310000 last year up 171% from 2019 according to Palo Alto Networks.

The companies that pay ransomware demands directly are well within their rights to claim a deduction tax experts said. To be tax deductible businesses expenses should be considered ordinary and necessary. Companies have long been able to deduct losses from more traditional crimes such as robbery or embezzlement and experts say ransomware payments are usually valid too.

“I would counsel a client to take a deduction for it” says Scott Harty a corporate tax attorney with Alston & Bird. “It fits the definition of an ordinary and necessary expense.”

Don Williamson a tax professor at the Kogod School of Business at American University wrote a paper about the tax consequences of ransomware payments in 2017. Since then he said the rise of ransomware attacks has only strengthened the case for the IRS to allow ransomware payments as tax deductions.

“It’s becoming more common so therefore it becomes more ordinary” he said.

That’s all the more reason critics say to disallow ransomware payments as tax deductions.

“The cheaper we make it to pay that ransom then the more incentives we’re creating for companies to pay and the more incentives we’re creating for companies to pay the more incentive we’re creating for criminals to continue” said Josephine Wolff a cybersecurity policy professor at the Fletcher School of Tufts University.

For years ransomware was more of an economic nuisance than a major national threat. But attacks launched by foreign cybergangs out of reach of U.S. law enforcement have proliferated in scale over the past year and thrust the problem of ransomware onto the front pages.

In response top U.S. law enforcement officials have urged companies not to meet ransomware demands.

“It is our policy it is our guidance from the FBI that companies should not pay the ransom for a number of reasons” FBI Director Christopher Wray testified this month before Congress. That message was echoed at another hearing this week by Eric Goldstein a top official at the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency.

Officials warn that payments lead to more ransomware attacks. “We’re in this boat we’re in now because over the last several years people have paid the ransom” Stephen Nix assistant to the special agent in charge at the U.S. Secret Service said at a recent summit on cybersecurity.

It’s unclear how many companies that pay ransomware payments avail themselves of the tax deductions. When asked at a congressional hearing whether the company would pursue a tax deduction for the payment Colonial CEO Joseph Blount said he was unaware that was a possibility.

“Great question. I had no idea about that. Not aware of that at all” he said.

There are limits to the deduction. If the loss to the company is covered by cyber insurance — something that also is becoming more common — the company can’t take a deduction for the payment that’s made by the insurer.

The number of active cyber insurance policies jumped from 2.2 million to 3.6 million from 2016 to 2019 a 60% increase according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office Congress’ auditing arm. Linked to that was a 50% increase in insurance premiums paid from $2.1 billion to $3.1 billion.

The Biden administration has pledged to make curbing ransomware a priority in the wake of a series of high-profile intrusions and said it is reviewing the U.S. government’s policies related to ransomware. It has not provided any detail about what changes if any it may make related to the tax deductibility of ransomware.

“The IRS is aware of this and looking into it” said IRS spokesperson Robyn Walker.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Vivendi had recently said it was in talks with the financial vehicle about selling it the stake in the label home of the likes of Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga.

Vivendi has long been planning an initial public offering of the music firm in Amsterdam by late September and that plan is still on with the SPAC Pershing Square Tontine Holdings telling shareholders Sunday that they will receive the shares in UMG later this year after the IPO. UMG will release a 22-minute video about the company to Pershing Square Tontine shareholders on Wednesday June 23rd.

Vivendi previously sold a 20 percent stake in UMG to a consortium led by Chinese online giant Tencent. It has said it plans to distribute 60 percent of UMG while retaining the remaining 10 percent for a minimum period of two years.

UMG is the world’s biggest music label and follows Warner Music to the public markets. Warner Music IPOd in 2020 with a $15 billion valuation it is currently valued at just under $18 billion. The rise of streaming services like Spotify and social platforms like TikTok have significantly bolstered the music business in recent years.

Blank check companies or Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) take over privately held firms and usually take them public in an alternative to a traditional IPO. Over the past year-plus Wall Street has seen a big number of SPAC IPOs.

This deal would be different however with UMG still set to go public via an IPO in the third quarter of 2021. Instead Pershing Square Tontine said it will have about $1.5 billion left over after the UMG deal is complete which it will use to try and find another company to take public. The company will also create what it calls a “SPARC” which will be given to shareholders trade separately and which will also seek to merge with another private company.

The deal is subject to the authorization of the plan to take UMG public by Vivendi shareholders at a shareholder meeting on June 22. The transaction would be the largest SPAC deal on record according to Dealogic data.

Vivendi led by CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine has previously said: “In addition the Pershing Square funds and their affiliates have indicated that they may acquire additional economic exposure to UMG by acquiring Vivendi securities and/or by acquiring UMG securities following the distribution of UMG shares by Vivendi.”

He was one of the first significant investors in as well as chief executive officer of the electric car manufacturer Tesla.

Early life

Musk was born to a South African father and a Canadian mother. He displayed an early talent for computers and entrepreneurship.

At age 12 he created a video game and sold it to a computer magazine.

In 1988 after obtaining a Canadian passport Musk left South Africa because he was unwilling to support apartheid through compulsory military service and because he sought the greater economic opportunities available in the United States.

PayPal and SpaceX

Musk attended Queen’s University in Kingston Ontario and in 1992 he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia where he received bachelor’s degrees in physics and economics in 1997.

He enrolled in graduate school in physics at Stanford University in California but he left after only two days because he felt that the Internet had much more potential to change society than work in physics. In 1995 he founded Zip2 a company that provided maps and business directories to online newspapers.

In 1999 Zip2 was bought by the computer manufacturer Compaq for $307 million and Musk then founded an online financial services company X.com which later became PayPal which specialised in transferring money online.

The online auction eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $15 billion.

Musk was long convinced that for life to survive humanity has to become a multiplanet species. However he was dissatisfied with the great expense of rocket launchers.

In 2002 he founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to make more affordable rockets.

Its first two rockets were the Falcon 1 (first launched in 2006) and the larger Falcon 9 (first launched in 2010) which were designed to cost much less than competing rockets.

A third rocket the Falcon Heavy (first launched in 2018) was designed to carry 153 000 kg to orbit nearly twice as much as its largest competitor the Boeing Company’s Delta IV Heavy for one-third the cost.

SpaceX has announced the successor to the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy: the Super Heavy–Starship system.

The Super Heavy first stage would be capable of lifting 100 000 kg to low Earth orbit.

The payload would be the Starship a spacecraft designed for providing fast transportation between cities on Earth and building bases on the Moon and Mars.

SpaceX developed the Dragon spacecraft which carries supplies to the International Space Station (ISS).

Dragon can carry as many as seven astronauts and it had a crewed flight carrying astronauts Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken to the ISS in 2020.

Musk sought to reduce the expense of spaceflight by developing a fully reusable rocket that could lift off and return to the pad it launched from.

Beginning in 2012 SpaceX’s Grasshopper rocket made several short flights to test such technology.

In addition to being CEO of SpaceX Musk was also chief designer in building the Falcon rockets Dragon and Grasshopper.

Tesla Musk had long been interested in the possibilities of electric cars and in 2004 he became one of the major funders of Tesla Motors (later renamed Tesla) an electric car company founded by entrepreneurs

Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.

In 2006 Tesla introduced its first car the Roadster which could travel 394 km on a single charge.

Unlike most previous electric vehicles which Musk thought were stodgy and uninteresting it was a sports car that could go from 0 to 97 km per hour in less than four seconds.

In 2010 the company’s initial public offering raised about US$226 million.

Two years later Tesla introduced the Model S sedan which was acclaimed by automotive critics for its performance and design.

The company won further praise for its Model X luxury SUV which went on the market in 2015.

The Model 3 a less-expensive vehicle went into production in 2017.

Musk expressed reservations about Tesla being publicly traded and in August 2018 he made a series of tweets about taking the company private noting that he had “secured funding.”

The following month the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for securities fraud alleging that the tweets were “false and misleading.”

Shortly thereafter Tesla’s board rejected the SEC’s proposed settlement reportedly because Musk had threatened to resign.

However the news sent Tesla stock plummeting and a harsher deal was ultimately accepted.

Its terms included Musk stepping down as chairman for three years though he was allowed to continue as CEO.

Dissatisfied with the projected cost (US$68 billion) of a high-speed rail system in California Musk in 2013 proposed an alternate faster system the Hyperloop a pneumatic tube in which a pod carrying 28 passengers would travel the 560 km between Los Angeles and San Francisco in 35 minutes at a top speed of 1 220 km per hour nearly the speed of sound.

Musk claimed that the Hyperloop would cost only US$6 billion and that with the pods departing every two minutes on average the system could accommodate the six million people who travel that route every year.

However he stated that between running SpaceX and Tesla he could not devote time to the Hyperloop’s development. — Britannica.",,,

To receive weekly updates on this series sign up for our CGMA Advantage newsletter.

Sergey Mamonin ACMA CGMA is CFO for PepsiCo’s businesses in the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States).

With a remit across 11 countries in Eurasia covering commercial finance including FP&A and revenue and cash flow management Mamonin also oversees the controlling function.

The finance team of 200 is decentralised he explained. “We don't really have a massive central team. We're trying to get as close to the real business as possible.” He sees business partnering as a critical 21st-century skill: the ability to be “a thoughtful business partner who really understands and values what your counterparts are doing”.

The business operates across five product categories — classical beverages snacks juices baby food and dairy. Food accounted for 55% of net revenues last year and beverages 45% the company’s 2020 annual report showed. Net revenue from outside the US made up 42% of the more than $70 billion total; the business’s core operating profit was $10.5 billion in 2020 down 1% on 2019.

Mamonin spoke to FM about the skills needed now and in the future to be an effective finance leader.

If you were starting out on your management accounting career which skills or aspects of finance would you be focusing on to get a competitive edge?

Sergey Mamonin: When you're just starting your career I don't think that competitive edge at that moment of time is dramatically important.

What is more important is basically to understand yourself start building your base seek advice seek mentorship explore the opportunities. Don't be afraid to try. Try and fail and then based on this experience build up understand where your competitive edge might be and then build around that.

We live in a world that is multidimensional so it's not about one career path that fits all.

Looking ahead how do you see the role and responsibilities of finance changing? Which skills do you think are going to become the key ones in the next five years?

Mamonin: If you look back ten years back you will see that the CFO profile was completely different from the CFO profile of the future and from what companies are looking for right now.

There are two particular characteristics of this change for the finance professional. One characteristic we're calling “a navigator of change”. Basically the person should be able to lead through the uncertainty to lead through change to lead through the transformation.

Finance has to take a critical role in this because very often finance professionals are the ones who at least from the internal perspective know it the best.

They have the access to the systems. They know how to use the logical part of the brain to analyse. But how do you use it? How do you navigate through the change? I think that is becoming more and more critical going forward.

The second thing is what we're calling the “catalyst” of the change. The finance function should not work in isolation from the rest [of the business]. Finance should be playing a critical role to drive change not only within our own function but within other functions as well. So how do you catalyse this process without having any formal power or responsibility over something? That's a very big skill that will be more and more important.

It’s about being able to find a common solution being able to articulate the common goal [and] maybe to play some kind of intermediary role between the different parties involved.

Looking at new people coming into the finance team — what strengths do you see amongst those people?

Mamonin: The new people joining the company Generation Z in many cases — I think there are several characteristics that I would like to highlight. First of all and I think that is something that we as Generation X or Millennials can learn from them is they are absolutely fearless to explore and experiment.

The new generation is very much open to change. They are keen to try. I'm not quite sure that they are keen to fail but they are keen to try for sure.

The second thing is technological savviness. Young people are absolutely tech-savvy in all of these [new] applications know how to install basic programming.

The third thing here is that they are very resistant to — more comfortable with — [the effects of] uncertainty because they grew up in the universe of the small things. Our generation grew up in the universe of the big things — when the big corporations were driving the whole economy. They grew up in a different environment.

When you say to the person like this look there is no answer but you have to find it out usually they are quite fine with that.

What skills do you use to best deal with uncertainty? Can they be learned and how do you learn those skills?

Mamonin: We need to concentrate on two things in order to navigate the organisation through this uncertainty.

First of all it's the ability to forecast what will happen. Classically we were more keen as finance professionals to look only at the big trends. Whereas right now the economy is becoming a little bit different. It's not the big trends it's rather a combination of the small trends which get into patterns.

The ability to work with these patterns is becoming more and more critical in order to fulfil the forecasting role; the ability to explain what is happening on the market in very simple terms.

The second [skill] is that no matter how good you are at forecasting things there always will be an element of unpredictability and we need to be able to build the systems that are flexible enough in order to cope with this uncertainty.

As well as an ability to see the big picture we shouldn't be doing our job just for the sake of doing the job we should do it with the purpose in mind.

The [further] skill is don’t be afraid to try and don't be afraid to fail. Not all of the tools coming up are as big as SAP. There are a lot of good nice small applications which make your life much easier.

Collaboration and business partnering: How can finance executives promote that across the business?

Mamonin: In order to be a great business partner you need to understand your counterpart. You need to understand what drives them and what they are trying to achieve rather than just drive your own agenda. Then it will be much easier for you to be a thoughtful business partner who really understands and values what your counterparts are doing. For me that's probably the most critical building block of any good business partnership model that I've seen.

Collaboration is that a similar skill?

Mamonin: It's actually more an answer to the question “How?”. Basically understanding the common goal is about the what and collaboration is about the how.

I think the 25 layers of the organisation basically that we have seen in [the] 1980s and the 1990s will be gone at some point in time and people will be working in cross-functional teams which are organised by the matrix principles. How do you organise yourself within such a team? Collaboration is the most important element of that.

People need to learn how to work not only with the finance department. From the very early stage of their career they should be able to work with the supply chain with marketing with sales with the general management with corporate relationships.

What is important is how we're using our asset of having an independent view of what’s happening. If the finance function is perceived to be not trustworthy for me that's a very big red flag and the CFO and the finance executives have to fix it first. Trust is the basic thing that you need to have in the organisation.

Have you learned any professional skills recently? Any new skills?

Mamonin: I think 2020 and especially 2021 teaches us resilience. Usually we perceived resilience as the personal skill rather than the professional skill. It's becoming more of a professional skill because we understand that in the years like 2020 well many bad things can happen.

Resilience to drive the business world forward and not give up on things be flexible on how you achieve the goals is dramatically important and I think all of us are learning. But it's a great time as well because it allows us to implement the things that we have never thought about before. For example take working from home was it possible to work like this one and a half years ago? I would say no it's impossible.



Right now yes we can make it work this way. For me everything starts with the mindset the ability to see the opportunities the ability to see the open doors even when the crisis comes.

How does PepsiCo support finance team members in their professional growth?

Mamonin: We see that finance professionals with the changes in the world economy that are happening right now will need to move towards the role of the navigator and the catalyst of change. Towards the role of the strategic business partner to the organisation.

Of course once we have understood that we're adjusting all the more classical tools like training mentorship sponsorship all of those things to fit into this particular goal.

What we're trying to do in PepsiCo is not to leave the tools floating in isolation from everything else. We are trying to give a purpose first and this purpose is to create a much more strategic organisation and a much more business partnership-oriented organisation that drives commercial value.

Because people are different you would choose the different type of tools to drive him or her towards this goal depending on the personal circumstances.

Have you seen in other organisations how they do skills and career development — is there anything to learn from that?

Mamonin: One of the great examples that I've seen and I don't really know why but it's not widely applied by the market is in McKinsey.

I worked for McKinsey for more than six years and I think it's an absolutely amazing company because it forces you to develop and to race against yourself all the time.

One of the tools that I have seen there is the secondment. Basically the organisation is very open to have a discussion: If someone feels [they] want to have more experience in an area but can't get it within the particular organisation [let’s] agree that I'm going somewhere else outside the organisation for let's say two three four years [and] will learn something and will return back.

What do you see as your number one professional challenge at the moment and why?

Mamonin: The right people with the right capabilities in the right places.

On the one hand the requirements for the finance professional are changing massively and even our educational system is not designed to cope with the fast change.

The second problem is that there is an increased competition for the talent. It's not enough anymore to have a big brand or a big company to be very successful on your talent acquisition strategy.

Tech companies are extremely competitive. Retail companies are extremely competitive. Consulting or startups is a massively important area for the people who are just joining the labour market right now.

So combining these two things that makes our life much more difficult but on the other hand that will make us stronger. Competition always makes the participants stronger.

Rapid-fire questions

What’s the number one skill a finance professional should have?

Mamonin: The ability to see the forest behind the trees — the big picture.

Soft skills or tech skills which are more important?

Mamonin: Both are important. That's for sure. Ten years back I would say tech skills were more important. Right now both.

The most important action finance professionals should take to advance their careers?

Mamonin: Find your own competitive advantage and leverage up to the max.

In 2012 a Pepsi commercial came out where we were introduced to Uncle Drew. The spot began with Drew pulling up to a local blacktop basketball court in Bloomfield NJ talking about how “these young ballers out here got all these cheap headphones and all this rappity hippity hop all these flashy shoes. These guys don’t practice the fundamentals anymore.” And that’s what Drew was there to do show these “young bloods” what the game of basketball should look like.

Drew’s nephew brought the old man into the game but he had a slow start. Like a switch turning on Uncle Drew quickly took over the court. After building an audience and dominating everyone out there he looked to the camera and said “it’s too easy out here against these young bloods.” Seemingly that was the commercial. Cut to: a reveal of who Uncle Drew really is.

Seven-time all-star two-time All-NBA professional basketball player Kyrie Irving. On behalf of Pepsi Max Kyrie Iriving transformed from the 19-year-old rising star he was to an old head with glasses and a gut; but that didn’t hinder his skills. In a brilliant ad campaign for Pepsi this commercial for Pepsi Max soda ended with its tagline “a zero-calorie cola in disguise.” This five-minute advertisement written and directed by Kyrie Irving quickly gained internet traction and Pepsi turned the commercial into five film-style episodes adding in Uncle Drew’s NBA and WNBA friends in each one with the storyline of Drew getting his old team back together. The amount of praise and fandom this raised ultimately led to the production of a feature-length ‘Uncle Drew’ movie about the titular character similarly on a road trip to get the old band back together with the collaboration of PepsiCo and Temple Hill Entertainment.

Kyrie Irving meets Pepsi and Prosthetics

A 19-year-old Kyrie Irving at the time of the Uncle Drew x Pepsi Max release had worked on a broader ad campaign previously with the company. The marketing team saw a star in him that wasn’t just on the basketball court and figured that if he can sell seats merchandise and memorabilia why couldn’t he sell soda? Furthermore since Pepsi had marketed their new no-calorie Pepsi Max as “cola in disguise” claiming that it did not taste like a zero-calorie drink they chose to keep the theme of disguise and dress up one of the most exciting young NBA players who was known for his flash as an old man using makeup and prosthetics. This old man was there to preach fundamentals and trash-talk the younger players and show them the way the game is meant to be played coining his phrase “don’t reach young blood.”

Although the videos were spearheaded and funded by Pepsi each segment was a Kyrie Irving film. Irving was an integral part of the creation of this campaign writing and directing the stories and bringing in his real-life friends along for the ride. That was what made the campaign so successful: they were less-so ads and more-so short films. Other than the intersected shots on the fans drinking Pepsi Max the commercials did not feel like commercials because PepsiCo was not pushing a product to the consumer. Instead they were taking them on a fun ride and subliminally linking the excitement of basketball of Uncle Drew with the feeling of drinking Pepsi; that is brilliant marketing.

After each Kyrie Irving film Irving would show us him and his teammates sitting in makeup chairs for hours as they were completely transformed into old disheveled grumpy old men and women. For Drew his character design was complete with white hair a white beard and a big belly that stayed hidden in the full tracksuit that he tucked into his knee socks. The illusion of Uncle Drew became a worldwide phenomenon and even became Irving’s NBA-adopted nickname. The more popularity that each episode brought the bigger the spots and the name of Uncle Drew became.

In the second episode of Uncle Drew he met with Hall of Famer Bill Russel who told him that he had to put his old team back together. Next thing you know we were following Drew as he road-tripped across the blacktops of the US finding and hooping with the real-life stars of Kevin Love Nate Robinson Maya Moore Baron Davis and Ray Allen not to mention the feature of comic JB Smoove. The already viral campaign kept growing with its ensemble that brought excitement to every NBA fan ever-eager for a new segment to come out.

The first Uncle Drew x Pepsi commercial acquired 52 million views on Youtube influencing a wave of fans most of which didn’t even know they were being marketed to. They were just enjoying the content engaging with sponsored ads like they would with professional media. Including all five segments of the Kyrie Irving films the entire campaign has over 100 million views on Youtube and remains fresh and engaging even nine years later. In fact those millions of views and the craze about the concept of Uncle Drew led PepsiCo to consider a big move bringing the character and fanbase of their titular character to Hollywood making a feature film and turning Kyrie Irving into an all-around multi-platformed superstar.

Uncle Drew the Movie

In 2018 Irving in his hair makeup and prosthetics took his blacktop presence to the big screen with the theatrical release of ‘Uncle Drew.’ Produced by PepsiCo and with the assistance of Temple Hill Entertainment the movie was verifiably successful with a budget of $18 million and ultimately grossing $46.5 million at the box office worldwide.

The film’s plot took on a similar storyline to the original ad campaign but decided to steer away from precise continuity. ‘Uncle Drew’ centered around Irving’s character being pulled back into basketball by Lil Rey’s Dax a kid whose skill had never matched up to the passion of his game. After he was left by his wife (Tiffany Haddish) and kicked off of his tournament team replaced by NBA star Aaron Gordon as Casper he brought on Uncle Drew to get his old crew of aged players to win the tournament and put a little light back in Dax’s life.

Drew’s team was packed with former NBA and WNBA superstars including Shaquille O’Neal Reggie Miller Nate Robinson and Lisa Leslie. Along for the ride were also Chris Webber JB Smoove Nick Kroll and more. The movie relying on its star power and basketball acumen didn’t offer the most robust storyline. Still it was a fun ride with decent laughs and leaned heavily on the perceived age difference and play styles of old versus new basketball and its players.

A box office and audience success ‘Uncle Drew’ made for a solid comedy for the whole family being able to appeal to a vast array of generations. Even six years after the initial craze of the Uncle Drew ad campaign Pepsi was still able to monetize the IP and character creation while trusting an NBA player with no acting background along with a large professional athlete ensemble to fully carry a Hollywood movie. For the athletes and executives to pull that off is a success in and of itself; even the cult classic ‘Space Jam’ relied on the brilliant voice acting of the Looney Tunes.

The path from silver screen and internet commercials to becoming a Hollywood hit is one that has not been shared by many so when phenomena like this occur they are truly special and must be treated as such. Kyrie Irving is now leading the Brooklyn Nets in the 2020-21 NBA season playoff run so it’s time to see what Uncle Drew can really do — hopefully the young bloods don’t reach.

Thin potato slices fried crisp in oil date from the early 19th century when they are said to have been invented by chef George Speck in Saratoga Springs New York. Chips as they came to be called were first produced commercially either in Massachusetts in 1908 or Ohio in 1910. Flavorings were added for the first time — cheese & onion and salt & vinegar — by an Irish company Tayto in the 1950s and America got into the act with chips made with barbecue-sauce flavorings later in the same decade.

After that all bets were off. American companies started selling chips flavored with various combinations of chile powder and other spices citrus sour cream pickle juice assorted cheeses ranch dressing and more. British manufacturers went crazy producing variations whose flavorings were meant to simulate the tastes of prawn cocktail oysters roast chicken roast beef roast ham with cranberries roast lamb with mint sausage and mustard even haggis. Japan put its own twist on chips with examples that evoked the flavors of nori seaweed pickled plums fish roe and (why not?) Pepsi Cola.

The craze for flavoring extended beyond potato chips to tortilla chips (like Doritos) the unique little corn chips called Fritos and various other crispy snacks — including the faux-potato chips called Pringles made with extruded potato flour. These are 25 “junk foods” that are actually not so bad for you.

Food companies are constantly developing new products of course and that includes new flavored chips and suchlike. Often these are limited editions or sold only in certain markets. Sometimes though they’re launched nationwide and just don’t fly off the shelves so get discontinued — sometimes just as we’re starting to develop a taste for them. Chips after all are among the 40 popular discontinued snack foods we miss the most.

24/7 Tempo has assembled a list of 20 potato chips and snack chips of a few other kinds that were introduced but then faded from sight. They’re some of the ones we miss the most — chips with forthright and sometimes unusual flavors that deserve another chance. We consulted a number of online lists including those published by ChipReview Taquitos.Net Insider and METV as well as corporate sites for various chip manufacturers.

(Submitted)

Old Sam isn't going anywhere but the label on the popular bottle of rum is changing.

The new version comes after a Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corporation review of the possible negative stereotype on the original label which depicted a laughing elderly man commonly perceived to be Black. That move was made in the wake of PepsiCo pulling the name and logo of its Aunt Jemima product line because of its racial stereotype.

The NLC which blends and bottles the Guyana rum at its St. John's plant committed to reviewing the brand last June and has now dropped the image and altered the label.

Wally Dicks the NLC's chief operating officer told CBC Radio's On The Go the company spoke with the production distillery and with the brand's previous owners but couldn't find anything conclusive that linked the name or the label to any negative stereotypes.

But Dicks said the company couldn't find anything conclusive to say otherwise either.

""What we decided to do was basically do the right thing. Since we couldn't conclusively say that or others might perceive it as a negative stereotype we decided to change the label"" Dicks said.

""We were planning to review Old Sam anyway. Every five or six years we'll review our brands we'll update we'll refresh. We did it with Screech back in 2013 or so.""

Old Sam is among the company's best sellers with between 8000 and 9000 cases sold each year — about 5000 of which are sold in Newfoundland and Labrador. The NLC bought the brand which dates back to the 1700s in 1999.

Dicks said the new labels are slowly rolling out across the province over the next couple of months with certain stores only stocking certain-sized bottles with the new look for the time being. The design was created in-house at the NLC.

""Basically what we're saying is 'new look the same Old Sam'"" said Dicks.

""We haven't seen any real positive or negative reaction yet.""

The Palestinian Authority has canceled an agreement with Israel that was to have seen at least 1 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine for Covid-19 transferred to the West Bank and Gaza.

The abrupt turnaround came after health officials in Ramallah inspected the first delivery of almost 90000 doses Friday afternoon the Palestinian Health Minister said.

”It was found that the doses did not conform to the technical specifications as previously agreed upon and that their expiry date was close” minister Mai Alkaila said according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.

”Hence we reached out to Prime Minister Muhammad Shtayyeh and a decision was made to cancel the deal” Alkaila added.

The move to transfer Israel’s surplus stock of Pfizer vaccines to Palestinians in the occupied territories an arrangement already in the works under the previous Netanyahu administration according to Israeli media reports was announced Friday morning by the Israeli government.

A government statement had acknowledged the vaccines “will expire soon” but it was not clear exactly how much time remained for Palestinian health authorities to administer the doses before expiration.

According to Reuters Alkaila said Israel had told the PA the vaccines expired in July or August but it turned out the true date was June.

As part of the agreed arrangement a shipment of Pfizer vaccines intended for the PA later in the year was to have been transferred to Israel instead. The PA says it is now calling on Pfizer to speed up that shipment to Palestinians as per the original contract.

Israel’s leaders won considerable international acclaim for the country’s highly successful rollout of Covid-19 vaccinations to its population of 9 million earlier in the year.

But they were criticized for failing to provide vaccines to cover Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza which under the Geneva Conventions Israel is obliged to do.

Israel argued that it was relieved of those obligations by the Oslo Accords signed by Israeli and Palestinian leaders in the 1990s which allocate responsibility for medical care provision to the Palestinian Authority.

Almost 450000 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza have received a Covid-19 vaccine so far according to PA figures of whom just over 270000 have received two doses. The two territories have a population of between 4.5 million and 5 million people.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYm9vc3Rlci12YWNjaW5lLXRyaWFsLW1peC1hbmQtbWF0Y2gtc2hvdHMtcGZpemVyLW1vZGVybmEtamFuZGotMjAyMS020gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9ib29zdGVyLXZhY2NpbmUtdHJpYWwtbWl4LWFuZC1tYXRjaC1zaG90cy1wZml6ZXItbW9kZXJuYS1qYW5kai0yMDIxLTY_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man in booster trial who got Pfizer then Moderna COVID-19 shots,"From left: Study volunteer and virologist Joseph Hyser Chanei Henry senior research coordinator of molecular virology and microbiology and Dr. Robert Atmar the principal investigator on the study.

Baylor College of Medicine



Scientists in the US are starting a booster shot trial giving fully vaccinated people another jab.

Participants are given a booster shot of the Moderna vaccine – whether they previously got 2 shots of an mRNA vaccine (from Pfizer or Moderna) or 1 adenovirus (J&J) shot.

shot of the Moderna vaccine – they previously got 2 shots of an (from Pfizer or Moderna) or 1 (J&J) shot. One participant told Insider his booster dose of Moderna gave him similar side effects to his second Pfizer shot but the third was ""a little bit more severe.""

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Virus expert Joseph Hyser has been fully vaccinated since the end of January and he's not really worried that his COVID-19 protection from the Pfizer vaccine has waned much since then.

Yet when he got an email last month asking if he'd be interested in getting a third dose booster shot – this time from Moderna – he did not hesitate to say yes.

The virologist at Baylor College of Medicine signed right up and took the elevator down six floors to Baylor's Vaccine Research Center where he offered up his arm for a third jab.

""Oooh I got boosted!"" he remembered bragging to family and friends afterwards who were nonplussed about his unique booster shot experience.

Perhaps they didn't realize that Hyser is one of the first Americans to participate in a groundbreaking COVID-19 mix-and-match study aimed at assessing whether boosters work and whether different COVID-19 shots are safe – and possibly more effective – when they're mixed together.

Though Hyser says he experienced ""similar types of side effects"" from both Moderna's and Pfizer's mRNA shots he said the side effects were ""a little bit more obvious with the Moderna.""

Is it safe to mix shots from Moderna Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson?

Dr. Robert Atmar is leading the booster dose study at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.

Baylor College of Medicine



This is not Hyser's first vaccine trial he's been in studies of smallpox shots anthrax vaccines and annual flu jabs.

""I'm a dyed in the wool nerd so I mean of course I think that this is interesting"" he said of the trial. ""I like being involved in being a part of producing science and information for the world.""

The study that he's now part of funded by the National Institutes of Health will evaluate mixing different coronavirus booster shots to assess whether they will be safe and effective for adults of all ages across the US.

For now the study is boosting only with a single dose of Moderna's vaccine whether participants' first shots were from Moderna or from Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson – the other two US-authorized vaccines. Other combinations of the vaccines and which order they're taken in will be added in to the study later on.

Study participants will get routine blood draws (Hyser already had his first) and initial results could be ready within months.

A big question this study will explore is whether boosting people who've had J&J's one-shot adenovirus vaccine with Moderna's mRNA shot might make the performance similar. (J&J's vaccine did not protect as well against mild and moderate disease compared to Pfizer and Moderna's two dose mRNA regimens during clinical trials.)







""Is it because of the [vaccine] construct or is it because of the one dose? We don't really have the answer to that"" lead study researcher Dr. Robert Atmar from the Vaccine Research Center at Baylor told Insider of J&J's lower efficacy.

A day of chills body aches and ibuprofen after the 3rd dose

While Hyser's Moderna side effects were a little more intense he said they faded with some ibuprofen and a day of rest.

""I did for Pfizer have a little bit of chills a little bit of muscle ache but nothing that prevented me from conducting my normal day to day activities"" he said remembering how the day after his second shot in January he did some work went grocery shopping and made a pot of chili.

""With the booster it was a little bit more severe"" he said describing waking up the day afterwards feeling ""like I had done a very rigorous gym workout"" with chills and arm soreness like he'd gotten a ""hard punch in the shoulder."" He popped some ibuprofen which helped ease the aches and by the following day he felt like himself again.

""Given the dramatic impact that [the coronavirus] has had on the world as a scientist it's actually really heartening that these clinical trials are still going on and the secondary and tertiary questions are still being asked"" Hyser said estimating that he'll make about $600 total (compensation for his time) over the course of this study.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9mYWN0Y2hlY2svMjAyMS8wNi8yMC9mYWN0LWNoZWNrLWNocmlzdGlhbi1lcmlrc2VuLWRpZG50LXJlY2VpdmUtY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZS83NzEzMjc1MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fact check: Christian Eriksen didn't receive COVID-19 vaccine before collapsing,"The claim: Danish soccer star Christian Eriksen who collapsed mid-match had recently received Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine

A Danish soccer player's recent collapse is being misconstrued on social media as a reaction to the coronavirus vaccine.

On June 12 during the UEFA European Football Championship Christian Eriksen suddenly collapsed on the field. Eriksen is a midfielder for Inter Milan and the Denmark national team.

USA TODAY reported that 43 minutes into the match between Denmark and Finland Eriksen suddenly staggered and fell forward while preparing for a throw-in on the sideline. The Denmark team doctor told reporters Eriksen had gone into cardiac arrest but that he was ""OK considering the circumstances.""

In the flurry of social media posts that followed a Czech blogger's tweet saying Eriksen had recently received a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine went viral. Soon after users on Twitter Facebook and Telegram began to share the post and speculate the COVID-19 vaccine caused Eriksen's heart to stop.

But there is no link between Eriksen's collapse and the COVID-19 vaccine. He wasn't vaccinated.

Fact check:Hillary Clinton was not hanged at Guantanamo Bay

USA TODAY reached out to several users who posted screenshots of the tweet for comment.

Eriksen wasn't vaccinated

The rumor began to spread after Luboš Motl quote-tweeted a post saying Inter Milan's chief medic had told Radio Sportiva an Italian station that Eriksen had recently been vaccinated with Pfizer's COVID-19 shot.

""The chief medic and cardiologist of (Inter Milan) confirmed on an Italian radio station that Eriksen has received the Pfizer vaccine on May 31st"" Motl said in the tweet.

Fact check:CDC data on adverse effects of vaccine cannot determine cause

However Radio Sportiva denied that claim causing Motl to delete the original tweet. But multiple Facebook users as well as anti-vaccine groups on Telegram continued to spread the claim using a screenshot of the tweet.

On June 12 Inter Milan team director Giuseppe Marotta put the rumors to rest when he told Rai Sport an Italian sports TV channel that Eriksen ""didn't have COVID and wasn't vaccinated either.""

VAERS possibly at root of speculation

Speculation about Eriksen's collapse could be rooted in misconceptions about the Vaccine Adverse Reporting System (VAERS) a government-run database that anti-vaccine advocates regularly use to discourage vaccination.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration run VAERS as an “early warning system” to detect safety problems associated with vaccines. Anyone can submit reports to VAERS which are not all subject to verification.

In another tweet Motl again speculated the vaccine had caused Eriksen's collapse. His evidence: reports from VAERS.

""Thousands have died from the Covid vaccines CDC reports. And yes I think that Eriksen the Danish soccer star who collapsed on the pitch was more likely than not a heart muscle inflammation victim due to a Pfizer or Moderna Covid vaccine too"" Motl wrote.

Fact check:White pine tea likely not helpful against COVID-19; vaccinated don't 'shed' particles

As USA TODAY has reported reports of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination do not necessarily mean the vaccines are to blame. However the CDC is investigating reports of myocarditis a heart inflammation condition in teenagers and young adults who received vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna.

Our rating: False

The claim that Danish soccer player Christian Eriksen collapsed as a result of receiving a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is FALSE based on our research. The director of Eriksen's club team Inter Milan said Eriksen had never received a coronavirus vaccine.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3V0YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJvLWxpdHRsZS10cmFuc2Zlci1wb3J0YWwtY29tbWl0bWVudC11dGFoLWJheWxvci1wZy10cmFuc2Zlci0tMjMxMzU1NDU3L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3V0YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJvLWxpdHRsZS10cmFuc2Zlci1wb3J0YWwtY29tbWl0bWVudC11dGFoLWJheWxvci1wZy10cmFuc2Zlci0tMjMxMzU1NDU3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BREAKING: Four-star transfer PG Miro Little has committed to Utah,"On Tuesday Craig Smith and the Runnin' Utes picked up a very valuable transfer portal addition after former Baylor guard and four-star transfer Miro Little announced his commitment to the program. This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well.

37 Russell 3000 companies (3.1%) failed Say on Pay thus far in 2021 14 of which are in the S&P 500. 15 companies failed since our last report and are highlighted in bold later in this post. Our evaluation of the likely reasons for failure indicates that ten of the thirty-seven failed Say on Pay votes are due in part to Covid-19 related actions.





Say On Pay Observations

The current failure rate (3.1%) remains above the failure rate at this time last year (2.2%) but is an overall decline from our 5/13 report failure rate of (3.3%); however the percentage of Russell 3000 companies receiving greater than 90% (79%) is greater than the percentage at this time last year’s support (76%)

The current average vote results of 90.8% for the Russell 3000 and 88.6% for the S&P 500 are below the average vote results at this time last year

The average Russell 3000 vote result thus far is 220 basis points higher than the average S&P 500 vote result which is 120 basis points higher than the spread at this time last year

Data provided by ESGAUGE and Semler Brossy; analysis by Semler Brossy. Russell 3000 sample as of July 1 2020; S&P 500 sample as of March 22 2021.

ISS Impact On Say On Pay Vote Results

The current average Say on Pay vote result for companies that received an ISS “Against” recommendation is 35 percentage points lower than for companies that received an ISS “For” recommendation

The 35-percentage point gap is above the historical average range of 24 to 32 percentage points; ISS “For” rate is consistent with the rate at this time last year

The current ISS against rate is 10% which is lower than 2020 rate of 11%

Data provided by ESGAUGE and Semler Brossy; analysis by Semler Brossy. Russell 3000 sample as of July 1 2020; S&P 500 sample as of March 22 2021.

2021 E&S Proposal Results

Thus far in the proxy season shareholders have voted on 58 social proposals and 16 environmental proposals

Median support for social proposals is 33% and median support for environmental proposals is 37%

Thirteen social proposals (22%) and seven environmental proposals (44%) have received greater than 50% support in 2020; this is much higher than the 9% of social proposals and 16% of environmental proposals that received greater than 50% support in 2020

We have observed significantly higher support (often above 70%) for proposals that request reporting on EEO-1 statistics diversity and inclusion efforts Board diversity lobbying payments climate impact reporting and emission reduction target disclosure

Spotlight: Phillips 66

Shareholders submitted a proposal requesting that Phillips 66 adopt greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets for emissions caused by its operations and certain products.

The proposal passed with 79% vote support

The proponents of the proposal noted that climate-related risks are a source of financial risk and that limiting climate change is essential to risk management

The proponents also requested that the company report on the strategy and policies for reaching the targets

The Board recommended “Against” the proposal. They referenced a previous announcement that the company was working toward setting targets as well as noted its dual obligation to provide affordable energy and address climate change; the Board stated that the company added two metrics to its annual bonus plan focused on emissions

ISS recommended “For” the proposal and noted that the company has not yet disclosed GHG emissions reduction targets and reports on year-over-year emissions are lagging peers

The Company also received a shareholder proposal for a report on climate lobbying (passed with 62% vote support )

2021 Director Election Results

Director Election Observations

Thus far average vote support for Director nominees of 96.1% is 120 basis points higher than the year-end support observed in 2020; however average vote support was 96.0% as of this time last year before declining to the year-end level (94.9%)

The high level of shareholder support to-date may suggest a shareholder preference for continuity over the past year

Over the past five years average Director election vote support at companies that received a Say on Pay vote below 50% in the prior year is five percentage points lower than at companies that received above 70% support

Thus far in the proxy season average vote support for female Director nominees is 120 basis points higher than average support for male nominees which is slightly smaller than the difference observed in the last two years

Telegraph Fire drops to 67% containment

The Telegraph Fire which decreased containment from 72% to 67% burned 179678 acres as of Saturday according to information posted by the U.S. Forest Service.

The department wasn't immediately available to comment on the reason for the decrease in containment.

Fire crews were keeping an eye on the fire as it backed down the Mescal Mountain on the southwest end of the fire the service reported.

Crews focused control efforts to protect power lines and structures along State Route 77 the service explained.

SR 77 from U.S. 70 to El Capitan was restricted to El Capitan residents only.

There were concerns of high winds on Sunday that could affect the fire according to the service.

Emergency closures were issued by the Bureau of Land Management Gila District including lands west to Sandman Road south to the Gila River and along SR 177 Winkelman east to the San Carlos Apache Reservation and north to the junction of U.S. 60 and SR 188.

Pinnacle Fire remained 15% contained

The Pinnacle Fire grew to 27807 acres by Saturday evening and remained 15% contained according to information from the U.S. Forest Service.

There were a total of 428 personnel assigned to the fire.

Crews on the southwest end of the fire reinforced their containment and looked over the fire as it cooled from recent suppression efforts the service explained.

Fire managers worked on a plan to control the fire's western movement and planned to focus on this end of the fire for the next few days the service said.

On the east end things remained calm with little to no smoke.

Crews laid sprinkler pumps and water blivets to protect structures at Black Rock in case the fire came back that way the service explained.

Evacuation orders were in place for all Black Rock Road area residents and all residents in the Klondyke-Aravaipa corridor in Graham County according to the service.

Thunderstorms expected to pass the area in the next few days could create enough gusts and erratic winds to spread the fire in multiple directions according to the information provided by the service.

Slate fire downgraded

The Slate Fire was 73% contained by Saturday after burning 11435 acres since it began on June 7 according to U.S. Forest Service Deputy of Public Affairs Randi Shaffer.

The fire was downgraded to a type 4 with 50 personnel left assigned to the fire Shaffer said. A type 4 fire is the second least complex type of fire and requires less complex planning.

The fire had not grown for a few days as crews continued to hold the lines and kept an eye on any progress Shaffer added.

Presidential candidate Ebrahim Raisi speaks during a campaign rally in Tehran Iran June 15 2021. (Reuters)

The win for Raisi 60 an implacable critic of the West whose political patron is Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei burnishes his chances of one day succeeding Khamenei at the pinnacle of power analysts say.

Accused by critics of human rights abuses stretching back decades - allegations his defenders deny - Raisi was appointed by Khamenei to the high-profile job of judiciary chief in 2019.

Later that year Raisi headed the legal system as authorities used the courts to suppress the bloodiest political unrest since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Iran says its legal system is independent and not influenced by political interests.

""Raisi is a pillar of a system that jails tortures and kills people for daring to criticize state policies” said Hadi Ghaemi executive director of New York-based advocacy group the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) in a statement.

Iran denies it tortures prisoners.

A mid-ranking figure in the hierarchy of Iran’s Shi’ite Muslim clergy Raisi has been a senior judiciary official for most of his career. He served as deputy head of the judiciary for 10 years before being appointed prosecutor-general in 2014.

Gaining a reputation as a feared security hawk he was one of four judges who oversaw executions of thousands of political prisoners in 1988 rights groups say. Amnesty International has put the number executed at around 5000 saying in a 2018 report that ""the real number could be higher"".

SUPPORT FOR IRAN TALKS

The CHRI said that those executed were ""buried in unmarked mass and individual graves based on the committee’s determination of their 'loyalty' to the newly established Islamic Republic. These prisoners had already been tried and were serving their issued prison sentences"".

Iran has never acknowledged the mass executions. However some clerics have said the trials of the prisoners were fair and those judges involved should be rewarded for eliminating the armed opposition in the revolution's early years. Raisi himself has never publicly addressed allegations about his role.

In 2020 U.N. human rights experts called for accountability over the 1988 deaths warning ""the situation may amount to crimes against humanity” if the Iranian government continued to refuse to hold responsible those involved.

The United States imposed sanctions on Raisi in 2019 for human rights violations including the 1980s executions and his part in the suppression of unrest in 2009.

Raisi who lost to pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani in 2017 offered no detailed political or economic programme during his election campaign while wooing lower-income Iranians by promising to ease unemployment.

However by promising not to ""waste a single moment"" in removing U.S. sanctions Raisi signalled his support for talks with world powers aimed at reviving a 2015 nuclear deal.

A Raisi presidency will strengthen Khamenei's hand at home and rights activists fear it could usher in more repression.

""He would not have registered as a candidate if his chances were not all but certain and Raisi's decision to register would have almost certainly been guided by Khamenei himself"" said Kasra Aarabi a senior analyst on Iran & Shia Islamist Extremism at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change.

NEXT SUPREME LEADER?

With the rejection of prominent moderate and conservative candidates by a hardline vetting body voters had a choice only between hardliners and low-key moderates in the election. Turnout was as expected a record low amid rising anger over economic hardship and curbs on personal freedoms.

""By taking its exclusionary strategies to a new height the Guardian Council has left no space for surprise"" said Ali Vaez senior adviser at the International Crisis Group.

An election win would increase Raisi's chances of succeeding Khamenei who himself served two terms as president before becoming supreme leader upon founder of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 1989 death analysts said before Friday's vote.

""Raisi is someone that Khamenei trusts ... Raisi can protect the supreme leader's legacy"" said Sanam Vakil deputy director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa Program.

Born in 1960 to a religious family in Iran's holy Shi'ite Muslim city of Mashhad Raisi was active in the 1979 revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed Shah and continues to proclaim his fidelity to the ""fundamental values"" of Khamenei.

""The deep state is willing to go as far as undermining one of its pillars of legitimacy to ensure that Ayatollah Khamenei's vision for the revolution's future survives him when Raisi takes over the Supreme Leader's mantle"" said Vaez.

Vaez was referring to the republican pillar of Iran's dual system of clerical and republican rule. Critics say the hardline election body's rejection of leading moderate and conservative hopefuls to enter the election race has cleared the way for tyranny a charge Iranian authorities deny.

Despite being one of the strongest sectors in the market this year the energy sector is still out of fashion with investors. Zooming out and taking a longer-term view it's clear that the energy sector has been a huge laggard even after its recent bounce to start 2021.

Yet could things be changing? In the wake of the pandemic and amid the rise of electric vehicles U.S. shale producers appear to have have widely adopted a new operating and capital allocation paradigm. Major producers have consolidated cut costs and plan on limiting their production growth milking assets for cash flows and paying most of it out as dividends. As a result U.S. oil companies' dividends could soar as the economy recovers.

Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) with the lowest costs per barrel in the Permian basin has announced its adoption of this new paradigm and stands a great chance of generating tremendous cash flow at current oil prices. As a result management predicts its current 1.4% dividend could climb sixfold over the next two years should oil prices stay near current levels.

Pioneer follows others to limit production and pay a variable dividend

Like some of its U.S. peers Pioneer is adopting a new operational paradigm of limiting production growth to 0-5% per year which will lower capital expenditures and generate free cash flow. Also like others Pioneer has announced a ""fixed-plus-variable"" dividend beginning in 2022.

Pioneer currently pays a fixed $2.24 per share dividend or about 1.4% at the current stock price and plans to pay out 75% of its free cash flow above that figure over the long-term. In its own wrinkle the company will pay out the variable dividend based on the prior year's free cash flow not the current year. So 2021 free cash flow will dictate variable 2022 dividends 2022 results will dictate 2023's dividend and so on as long as the company realizes WTI prices above $42.

That assures investors should know what to expect and the company will be able to keep ample liquidity on its balance sheet. The dividend structure will partially kick in next year when the company intends to pay out 50% of excess free cash flow while paying down debt to 0.75 times EBITDAX then ramping up to up to 75% thereafter.

On the recent conference call with analysts CEO Scott Sheffield said that at current strip prices -- which were in the low $60s at the time of the early May conference call but are over $70 right now -- Pioneer would be able to raise its dividend yield to about more than 4% next year and potentially over 8% in 2023 when the full variable dividend kicks in.

Pioneer's low-cost producer status should lead to hefty cash flow

If oil producers stay disciplined and keep supply in check -- and that is a big if if history is any guide -- Pioneer should be able to generate high margins. Pioneer has the lowest costs per barrel of any U.S. shale producer with breakevens in the high $20 range. Additionally the company just bought out two sizable oil companies Parsley Energy and DoublePoint Energy with land directly adjacent to Pioneer's in the Midland basin of the Permian.

These high-quality adjacent assets should yield Pioneer an additional $525 million in operational synergies by the end of this year further boosting margins. Pioneer used mostly stock to fund these deals which will keep its leverage low. It's also encouraging that both target company shareholders were willing to take equity in the ""new"" Pioneer entity rather than cash.

A new beginning for oil stocks or more of the same?

Disciplined by the shale revolution's oversupply it appears oil executives now realize their industry isn't a growth industry anymore. Ironically that could actually be a much better thing for their stocks provided that U.S. shale producers and OPEC+ continue with their current supply discipline. By limiting growth milking assets for cash and returning it to shareholders oil stocks may be able to attract yield-seeking value investors in the 2020s.

Investors will have to keep an eye out for other producers that ramp up production and disrupt this dynamic but assuming oil demand picks up with economic reopening the biggest dividends in the 2020s stock market could come from oil drillers just as banks became low-growth but highly profitable dividend growth stocks last decade following the financial crisis.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks including The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Special to The News-Press

The Progressive Insurance TV commercials are hilarious but also profound. You know the ones with the Sully Sullenberger lookalike as group therapist Dr. Rick who tries to help homeowners from turning into their parents: “Guess what” he informs them “the waiter does not need to know your name.”

The commercial’s talented actors and familiar message got me wondering about Father’s Day: are we really all just clones of our parents?

Charlie McGrath had a yeoman’s task as my father. He jury-rigged a system of mild discipline and Christian principles to usher six boys and two girls through childhood higher ed and out the door to our separate lives without any detours to juvi or rehab.

While I hope I inherited his good qualities I swore I'd avoid what I considered his mistakes. So as funny as those characters are I of course have never needed Dr. Rick’s help unlike the homeowner in one commercial who is practically getting underneath the sink with the plumber when Dr. Rick admonishes him: “Okay Tom we talked about this. You hired him. You’re not his assistant.”

Yes my father used to do that too if he hired a painter or when he summoned me as his handyman to fix something and he stood “watch” ostensibly to make sure the work was getting done right but probably more out of curiosity or entertainment to the growing annoyance of whoever was doing the work.

Determined not to replicate Dad’s behavior I always make sure to stay out of the way of hired help except of course in cases when I want to watch a technician or tradesman’s every move so I know how to fix it myself the next time.

More:Guest opinion: New hip newer procedure new me

One other bad habit of Charlie McGrath was television. The year my parents got cable TV with a remote-control device was also the year my mother became a baseball widow. Or I should say baseball and game show widow.

Dad’s stuffed armchair was planted no less than 7 feet directly in front of the tube where he’d surf through his favorite channels around eight hours a day making sure to watch every inning of all 162 White Sox games occasionally switching to a golf tournament when he needed a nap.

Not to say that every once in a while he didn’t enjoy watching Carol Burnett or an episode of “The Golden Girls” with Mom. But for better or worse Charlie was the King of Cable in his house on Long Street.

Fortunately I am not at all like my Dad in the television department either.

Because our smart TV is 50 inches wide I can sit and watch it much further away than Dad. At least ten feet or a full fifteen when Marianne asks me to back up so she can vacuum.

Moreover I’m more partial to football than to baseball. Granted I may watch more than 8 hours on a Saturday or a Sunday and of course on Thanksgiving and New Year’s. But NFL Ticket was not available in Dad's era which pretty much compels subscribers like myself to watch every single game to make the monthly satellite bill worthwhile.

Does that make Marianne a football widow? Certainly not as she has her own slightly smaller TV with a permanent but unobtrusive vertical blinking line on the left side of the screen which she pays no attention to while watching her favorite Hallmark programs while she relaxes on the surprisingly comfortable spare kitchen chair in the guest bedroom.

All of which means Dr. Rick that your commercials may be funny but the joke’s not on me as anyone reading this can easily see

So what I want to say for Father’s Day is that Charlie McGrath loved his children and grandchildren more than himself and his wife even more. He taught us through his own example that getting ahead in the world was a good goal as long as it never compromised being kind and honest with your fellow man or being true to your own beliefs.

Those are my Dad’s attributes which I wish to emulate while forgiving him those pesky peccadillos.

Asgar Sanchawala of Progressive has been using smart strategies and technologies to deliver good results as Noel D’Cunha finds out

There is certain resilience about Surat the city that was hit by a plague in 1995 and its people. In a year the city was adjudged India’s cleanest city in 1996.



The then city’s municipal commissioner SR Rao was credited with the transformation imagined and implemented changes which were necessary. “Efficiency was one of them. He cracked down on corruption got the bureaucracy out of its slumber” says Asgar Sanchawala director at Progressive Printing Press located in Khatodra area of Surat.



“Many people who had left the city returned” says Sanchawala. “That further strengthened the spirit of the city.”

In 2013 the Rockefeller Foundation identified Surat as one of the 100 “resilient” cities which gave a fillip to the city to tackle natural disaster and the effects of climate change. Today the city is among the preferred cities for investors. There are action plans in addition to 20 goals that are envisaged for the decade – 2016 to 2025. With these steps in place Surat was declared the Resilient City 2020 in the Smart Cities of the World in September 2020.



“Before the transformation period Surat was a city that didn’t care much towards the city’s upkeep except for business” says Sanchawala. While the outlook towards the city has changed the business acumen has only become better.



Who in the right mind would invest in new equipment when businesses around were squirrelling away any spare funds?

Sanchawala did. A fifth RMGT 755 a five-colour offset press and a second Kodak Trendsetter 800 are the two pieces of equipment which has been installed at Progressive’s 50000 sqft two-floor plant. For those uninitiated businesses of sizeable print firms who have not been smart enough are down anywhere between 50% and 80%.



But Sanchawala has confidence that his company’s brand and ability to find new avenues will allow him to sprint or at least trudge into this fiercely howling wind. Since 1998 Progressive Printing Press has worked to develop a strong reputation for itself in Surat’s print industry. The company established in 1965 was using a treadle machine initially and then single-colour machines to produce four-colour jobs. Besides commercial jobs such as brochures fashion books catalogues Progressive also produces self-adhesive labels and packaging boxes.



I asked Sanchawala “How?” “Honestly in the past 12 months orders we received were not related to the kind of print jobs we specialise in. We had huge orders for mask packaging pandemic circulars laboratory reports and the related stationeries. This bought us out of the regular business which had dried up” he says.



Sanchawala acknowledges that this pandemic is a lifetime experience but there will be a turnaround. “Surat is a textile and diamond hub. The two industries are a dominant part of our business when it comes to advertisement and packaging. Textile business in Surat is worth over Rs 10000 crores” he says with an air that suggested he was quietly convinced.



Kodak NexPress: Any print run that’s under 200 is produced on this Kodak kit

Staying ahead of the curve

In June 2017 Progressive celebrated its 50 years of operation by hosting the RMGT-Provin open house at its plant. Running its recently-installed third brand-new RMGT press the 7 Series RMGT 760 five-colour press live the open house for print CEOs from Surat Vadodara and Ahmedabad had a chance to test the efficiency of the press.



Showcasing the press was one of the reasons. While Progressive’s customers were thrilled the competitors weren’t very sure of how well we were using our new presses. “We opened up our shop-floor and more than 60 print CEOs showed up” remembers Sanchawala.



Besides the newly installed RMGT 760 then Progressive already had a Ryobi 920 and RMGT 920 all brand new presses installed in the previous two years. The company had replaced all the pre-owned presses at the plant with new ones. “There are two major reasons why we replaced all the old presses with new ones – quick delivery and consistency of quality” recalls Sanchawala. “We had been running second-hand machines all through and somewhere down the line we used to be hampered by inconsistency in print quality. After we installed the first Ryobi we were convinced that with a new machine print quality is assured.”



And though it sounded a bit risky Sanchawala explains that his facility was far ahead of its time from an infrastructure standpoint that his competitors then did not quite understand what they were seeing. Soon enough there were print companies in the Khatodra area and around who actually installed new presses replacing the old ones.



Progressive’s advanced standing however did not let Sanchawala stop his company’s momentum and he later went on to add another RMGT press a 790ST-4XL+ IR+OC+SLD in April 2019 as well as the latest one.

“If you look around you will find that we have strengthened our shop-floor differently” Sanchawala says. “We looked at the entire flow of the print jobs we produce rather than the traditional way of looking at one particular area of print jobs.”



Business and viability

Explaining the company’s transformation since 2015 Sanchawala says he has constantly asked his customers what their needs were and if they were interested in doing it differently. The answer he received was: consistent print quality and quick delivery.



At that time the industry standard was basic second-hand four-colour presses which required regular maintenance and manual intervention. To address the customer demands Sanchawala completely overhauled his shop-floor created a more efficient operation and allowed it to introduce more automation. “New presses were our answer to quality and quick delivery and reduced dependency on manpower though we did not reduce our workforce. We just deployed them in a more effective manner” Sanchawala says.



Not surprisingly the staff at Progressive is as old as 40 years and more or less trained within the press. “We are an inseparable family and have taken full care of each and every employee. No one has left us even during the pandemic” Sanchawala says.



“The three most fundamental areas of business that influences the profitability and viability of any business are customer market and employees. We have touched upon customer and employees. To grow a business today requires a multi-faceted approach with considerations that are much broader in scope than in the past” exerts Sanchawala.



Progressive considers printing 200 copies of a catalogue on offset as a viable proposition. Why not digital I ask to which Sanchawala answers “If you calculate 200 copies with 50 pages each the cost of printing on digital will be say Rs 50000 at Rs 5 per print. And I am not talking about odd sizes. Even if I charge Rs 50000 for the same job by printing on offset I will be making more profit than digital. All this after having calculated my overhead costs. I am not sure if the guy who will supply at



Rs 5 per page of the digital print will include overhead costs. I doubt it.”



And printing on the new machine may take more or less the same time but the advantage Progressive has is that it can add value to print which digital cannot afford to provide at the same cost.

Offset and quick printing? What about producing plates which is time-consuming? Sanchawala points to the Kodak Trendsetter 800 which it has been using since 2015 and the new one it recently acquired. “Producing

plates in a jiffy is a no brainer. And we run both processless and with processor” he says.



Incidentally Progressive was the first in Surat to install a platesetter way back in 2006.



Progressive celebrated its 50 years of operation in June 2017 by hosting the RMGT-Provin open house at its plant with more than 60 print CEOs from Surat and neighbouring state in attendance

Stay ahead of the curve

Progressive believes in staying ahead of technology. Being updated in the advanced technology by itself is an inspiration to update and bring in new equipment to the press. “Making an estimate of the present and future demands with a desire to improve and attain perfection and quality with a delivery period as fast as light helps us to move ahead” says Sanchawala.



But Sanchawala is not all anti-digital. “Any print run that’s under 200 is produced on the Kodak NexPress. Our jobs range from 200 to 1200 per month” says Sanchawala.

The average print runs in offset at Progressive range from 1000 to 2000 copies. However during the pandemic the range has dropped to 200 to 500 copies but the number of jobs have increased by 20%. Of these 80% jobs are pure offset while 20% are with embellishments – endless creation of foil UV varnishing – as Sanchawala says.



And to achieve the perfect colour matching the company uses a GMG proofing system – GMG colour server and GMG ink optimiser. Sanchawala says the print industry is made of niches and when one attains it people follow and then there’s overkill. “That’s when you start looking for the next niche that something which will add value to our business.”



In 2015 when Sanchawala’s son Latif wanted to do something new at Progressive he let him work with it. Since then GMG is the only colour management tool the company uses. The optimisation is based on GMG’s 4D DeviceLink profiles. The CMY colour component is replaced by black while exactly retaining the colour impression. Sophisticated ink reduction algorithms ensure that only the structure of the separations is altered not the colour impression.



“The improved colour composition makes it possible to stabilise the entire printing process meaning that for example the gray balance reacts less to colour fluctuations. Depending on the printing process and the substrate GMG ink optimiser simultaneously achieves up to 20% savings on ink” says Latif.



Sanchawala claims his company pioneered the use of Kaliedo inks in Surat and the rest followed. “It was hard work. We still do it but very few customers use the Kaliedo inks and we charge a premium for doing it.”

Besides Progressive has a huge consumption of fine/art papers for its specialised jobs. “We purchase ink paper and other raw materials in bulk which enables smooth flow of production. A huge holding capacity and good payment reputation are key to a very respectful relationship with suppliers” explains Sanchawala.

How to lead in tough times?



Just when things had started to look up the second wave of Covid-19 seems to have put the brake on things. The economy is shaken there is unemployment and one is hard-pressed to find good economic news.

Sanchawala says there are four things we as a print community can do.



First your employees are the vital cog in your business wheel. They know what’s going on. “Be candid about what the pandemic is doing to your business. As we say we are all in it together so are your employees.”



Second the pandemic has been a major shock but there may have been times when you have experienced tough times. “Take lessons from the past success your company has had in tough times. Put that across in context even to your employees.”



Third look for opportunities. “It’s perhaps the best time to identify where you can cut-cost or find saving ideas without impacting quality and speed as also new markets to go after. I would think your employees will be better tuned to find cost-saving ideas.”



Fourth and last stay positive. “If you don’t there are people around you at your workplace who will eventually be affected too.”



Sanchawala concludes with an air of optimism “I’ve been in the print business for over 50 years now. And every time things have looked hopeless I was determined to make them otherwise.”



And that particularly resonates with Progressive’s success.",,,,,,,,,

India became an epicentre with a spike in cases in the second wave of the pandemic amidst shortage in medical supplies. There are concerns about the possibility of a third wave hitting the country ICICI Prudential Life said in its annual report for 2020-21.

In FY21 the life insurance industry reported a modest 3 per cent growth in new business premium said the report adding the industry continues to get a higher share of household savings because of the increased attractiveness of life insurance savings products the unique proposition of protection and annuity products among others.

""In the short-term the profitability of the insurance industry is expected to be an area of concern given the increase in mortality and morbidity rates induced by the pandemic. Even more than a year after the pandemic first struck there continues to be significant uncertainty regarding its absolute impact on mortality and morbidity experience"" the insurer said.

The pandemic has posed multiple challenges for the Indian life insurers. The onset of the pandemic saw a sharp fall in equity prices while interest rates also declined.

Insurers have exposure to equities in unit-linked and participating businesses. Thus interest rate movements impact their liabilities and guarantees based based schemes. While a credit risk can impact their investments made incorporates.

The sharp movements in markets coupled with any asset liability mismatches that insurers may have can impact the solvency position.

The report said there are emerging risks related to environmental social and governance (ESG) issues on the insurance industry of which climate change is a bigger challenge.

Apart from climate change there are emerging risks associated with public health trends such as increase in obesity related disorders and demographic changes such as population urbanisation and ageing said the report.

Industry's growth even during the pandemic shows a promising future for the domestic life insurance sector however the pandemic has also exposed the gap the protection gap in the country said the report.

The number of Covid-19 related death claims is fraction of the number of overall lives lost highlighting the vulnerability of the families ICICI Pru Life said.

The insurer said it has become imperative for every working individual to add life insurance as a key ingredient of financial planning.

During the year the pandemic amplified the need for life insurance among people leading to the category slowly moving from being a ""push product"" to a ""nudge product"" ICICI Prudential Life Insurance said.

The company's total premium income during FY21 was Rs 35733 crore of which Rs 13032 crore was new business premium.

""On the back of the risk-averse behaviour of our customers there was considerable interest for traditional long-term savings products which grew by 61.2 per cent for the year. Similarly annuity products registered a robust 120 per cent growth year-on-year.

""With ULIPs (unit linked investment plans) at 48 per cent traditional savings products at 31 per cent protection at 16 per cent and group products at 5 per cent we now have a well-balanced product mix which now insulates us better from market volatility"" said the insurer.

It has become imperative for every working individual to add life insurance as a key ingredient of financial planning.

Over 8800 have applied online for 252 posts. Further among these nearly 70 per cent are postgraduates while the required qualification is graduation.

Despite being a 11-month contract-based appointment conducted by Samagra Shiksha where the rules highlight that these appointment will automatically lapse with the completion of contract period the department is overwhelmed with the applications that are being scrutinised at the moment.

“The appointment of contract-based teachers for Class 6-8 for schools of excellence will not be provisioned in the budget. The contract for these teachers will automatically lapse with the completion of period and they would be relieved. In such a case no employee or candidate can challenge or appeal in the courts as the appointment will lapse automatically” the rules laid out by Samagra Shiksha states.

Among reasons cited for the high number of applications officials state that the salary offered is one of the attractions. “Since we want to have the best of teachers the salary offered is good. Even those who are teaching in private schools might have applied” said State Project Director Samagra Shiksha P Bharathi.

The appointed teachers will be offered a monthly salary of Rs 26000. Three teachers per school (total 84 schools) will be appointed for Maths Science Language and Social Science.

As per the analysis of applications data the highest applications — around 4000 — have been received for Social Science while the least is for Maths-Science.

Similar trend is reflected in the number of candidates with post graduation too. Of the 1100 applicants for Maths-Science barely 310 have postgraduation degree. However of 4000 applicants for social science 3050 are postgraduate.

The merit list expected to be released after verification in a week will be followed by calls for objections. The candidates will be ranked as — 20 marks for graduation 5 for postgraduation 25 for BEd PTC and TET 50 marks.

A mandatory three-year experience is required for applicants with an age bar of 40. The contractual teachers are being recruited by the education department for 84 existing model schools that are being converted into ‘residential schools of excellence’ in first phase of school of World Bank funded excellence project.

These 84 schools with Samagra Shiksha are majorly in backward blocks except districts of Anand Porbandar Bharuch Dang Navsari Junagadh Chhota Udepur. The existing residential model schools were set up in 2015-16 in the blocks that have low literacy levels as identified under Census 2001.

“Admission of students will be entirely done on merit basis. Though an entrance test was scheduled on April 18 but due to Covid-19 it could not be conducted. So this year 25000 students with marks above 60 per cent will be admitted in Class 6-9 for which the academic session will commence on July 7” said Darshana Suthar official of Samagra Shiksha supervising the recruitment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdWRpZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20uc2EvYXJ0aWNsZS82MDc5NzfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eng.

In fact a number of smartphones and other small gadgets were once upon a time running on low-power NVIDIA chipsets.

We’re talking of course about NVIDIA’s Tegra lineup of processors that went up against systems on a chip (SoCs) from Qualcomm Samsung and others back in the day. That’s right the range of chipsets now powering the likes of the Nintendo Switch gaming console and NVIDIA Shield media player can trace their ancestors back to early smartphones.

Microsoft's Zune HD was the first gadget to use NVIDIA's Tegra.

In fact the very first product to use an NVIDIA Tegra chipset was 2009’s Microsoft Zune HD. Microsoft’s Kin was the first cellphone powered by this range of chips. They weren’t exactly the most popular products back in their day but the company did find a bit more success in the following years.

Android powered by NVIDIA

Nvidia’s next-gen Tegra 2 chipset boasted a much more powerful dual-core Arm Cortex-A9 CPU and an ultra low power GeForce GPU. The Tegra 2 held the Android performance crown for a few months particularly against the commonplace single-core processors on the market. But that lead was short-lived once the dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S3 came along later in the year followed by Samsung’s Exynos 4 Dual.

Still the chipset found success inside 2010’s Android-powered Motorola Droid X2 and LG Optimus 2X handsets although neither sold like hotcakes. The Tegra 2 also powered a reasonably sized selection of other smartphones tablets and even the odd notebook from a variety of brands.

NVIDIA Tegra mobile phones include the Motorola Droid X2 LG Optimus 2X Samsung Galaxy R HTCOne X and Xiaomi Mi 3.

Perhaps the most memorable Tegra 2 release was 2011’s Samsung Galaxy R. The Galaxy R was a bit of a Galaxy S2 spinoff featuring a “Tegra Zone” application that allowed customers to download games optimized specifically for the device — an idea that lasted about as long as you’d expect. Furthermore the chip was considerably more mid-range come 2011 and wasn’t as powerful as the flagship Galaxy S2 model.

NVIDIA followed up with the Tegra 3 in 2011. This next-gen chipset boasted a quad-core Cortex-A9 CPU setup with NEON extensions and a fifth ultra low power companion core a more powerful NVIDIA GeForce GPU and a suite of video decoder technologies making it a much more powerful multi-media machine than its predecessor. See also: AMD vs NVIDIA — What’s the best add-in GPU for you?

The Tegra 3 powered a small number of memorable Android smartphones. The list comprises the HTCOne X HTCOne X+ and LG Optimus 4X. The One X and X+ reviewed particularly well and played a key role in HTC’s rise to becoming one of the big players in the smartphone game before its equally spectacular fall from grace.

Nvidia’s Tegra 3 had the option for much higher clock speeds too making it suitable for tablets as well as phones. The Tegra 3 powered the Nexus 7 (2012) model ASUS Transformer Pad Sony Xperia Tablet S and the original Microsoft Surface. It was also the brawn behind the ill-fated Ouya Android gaming console.

Moving beyond smartphones

Although NVIDIA’s Tegra powered a small selection of Android smartphones in the early 2010s it wasn’t to last. Smartphone chipsets became increasingly complex with the CPU and GPU playing diminished roles compared to advanced networking and co-processor capabilities in the following years. Instead NVIDIA shifted its chipset ambitions towards the tablet multi-media and eventually handheld game console market.

2013’s Tegra 4 began this transition with a power-hungry 72-core GPU configuration that made it 7x more powerful than the Tegra 3. Combined with four 1.9GHz Cortex-A15 CPU cores low power companion core LPDDR3 memory and a host of video hardware decoding blocks the Tegra 4 continued to find success in Android tablets. It also powered the gaming-centric NVIDIA Shield Portable and the unreleased Mad Catz Mojo as well as the Xiaomi Mi 3 smartphone.

A trimmed down Tegra 4i version with a quad Cortex-A9 CPU and 60-core GPU powered the LG G2 Mini the privacy-focused Silent Circle Blackphone and a couple of Tegra 4 smartphones from Wiko. But this chip marked the end of NVIDIA’s smartphone ambitions.

2014 saw NVIDIA announce the Tegra K1 sporting powerful 192-core Kepler graphics and the option of either a quad-core Cortex-A15 or intriguing dual-core in-house Denver CPU setup. The latter model powered the fan-favorite HTCNexus 9 tablet but the traditional Arm core model was more popular. That version ended up in a small selection of tablets and even a couple of Chromebooks from Acer and HP.

Tegra's breakout success didn't arrive until 2017's Nintendo Switch.

Although appearing in plenty of NVIDIA phones and other devices over the past decade Tegra’s breakout commercial success didn’t arrive until 2017 and the launch of the Nintendo Switch. The handheld console sported 2015’s Tegra X1 and later its 16nm X1+ revision. It was the most powerful Tegra chipset to date with a 256-core Maxwell GPU octa-core Cortex-A57 and A53 CPU and a host of the latest H265 and VP9 video encoding and decoding hardware blocks. The Tegra X1 also powers the hugely popular NVIDIA Shield Android TV devices which set the benchmark for the modern smart TV experience. See also: The best Android TV boxes you can get right now

Subsequent launches of the Tegra X2 Xavier and Orin SoCs have mostly ended up in development boards and automotive systems. It’s not clear if NVIDIA is even focused on consumer products for these chips as its focus switches to machine learning and AI markets.

NVIDIA remains interested in mobile

Nvidia

From music players to smartphones and game consoles NVIDIA has powered a range of popular portable products over the past decade. Although the company may still be best known for its powerhouse PC graphics cards mobile remains firmly in its sights. Up next: What NVIDIA buying Arm means for your next smartphone

NVIDIA is currently seeking regulatory approval to purchase Arm for $40 billion. Remember Arm licenses its CPU architecture and cores found in Tegra Snapdragon Exynos Apple and pretty much every other mobile processor on the market today and over the past decade.

“You will not be a father and you won’t get married” he said describing what one of his closest friends told him when he came out as gay during graduate school.

Those words went on to shape his career and his identity.

The journey of coming out can be daunting for anyone who identifies as LGBTQ. For the leader of a luxury fashion chain it’s an intensely personal story that he’s sharing to influence others to be true to themselves especially during Pride Month.

Van Raemdonck 49 calls it being his “authentic self.” He considers it liberating to blend his identity as a gay man with his work leading the Dallas retail chain.

The fashion industry is known for its acceptance of all lifestyles. Van Raemdonck wants Neiman Marcus to become known as a leader in offering inclusive benefits to its over 9000 workers.

“When you accept who you are and you put it out there there is nothing to defend” van Raemdonck said in an interview with The Dallas Morning News. “People can decide not to accept you but that’s their problem. I am not defending who I am. What you see is the authentic self.”

Now in his fourth year at the helm van Raemdonck led Neiman Marcus into and out of one of the darkest periods in the storied company’s history: bankruptcy. It emerged after shedding $4 billion in debt that constrained the company for years.

With financial woes in his rearview mirror van Raemdonck turned his attention to matching the company’s benefits to his own identity.

“We live in a world where we need diversity of thought and backgrounds” he said.

The need for diversity

As a young professional studying for his MBA at the University of Chicago van Raemdonck describes a night in his personal journey when he met a man and spent the evening in engaging conversation. He considers it “one of the most beautiful moments of my life.”

It was the “most natural thing — that’s when I realized this is who I am and this is who I connect with” van Raemdonck told employees and other attendees at a recent Neiman Marcus Pride celebration.

In 2016 he married interior designer Alvise Orsini in New York City. The couple moved from Paris when van Raemdonck got the Neiman Marcus job.

Van Raemdonck said he spent a lot of his life defending who he is and sometimes hiding his identity. During the company’s bankruptcy he and Orsini faced a barrage of criticism when a luxury publication featured their contemporary $2.3 million home in Dallas’ Lakewood neighborhood that Orsini decorated. It’s where the couple raises their twin sons.

In the past three years van Raemdonck said Neiman Marcus has looked to give more women leadership roles. Of the company’s seven-member board of directors four are women. The company’s executive team is 48% women and 100% of Bergdorf Goodman’s leadership team are women. The company’s overall workforce is 70% women.

“It’s really a one-way street” van Raemdonck said. “We are going to commit to a journey.”

Van Raemdonck said he admires the retailer’s founders for being “inclusive” leaders during the company’s inception in 1907 when the first store opened in Dallas.

“It’s been part of the DNA” he said. “We are a company that was co-founded by a woman” — Carrie Marcus Neiman.

In 1950 the board selected Carrie Marcus Neiman as its chair alongside CEO Stanley Marcus and executive vice president Edward Marcus. Moira Cullen a colleague of Carrie’s was the company’s first buyer paving the way for more women to enter leadership roles at Neiman Marcus.

Todd Sears founder and CEO of OUT Leadership which works with companies on inclusion efforts for LGBTQ identities said developing sound recruitment and retention strategies must accompany top executives speaking out.

“The business community is the strongest force for equality” Sears said.

OUT Leadership produces a business climate index that measures state laws and attitudes on LGBTQ issues. The lowest a state can score on the index is 25% and the highest is 100%. In 2020 Texas received a 38% rating. That improved to 45% this year. Texas ranks 41st in the nation.

Adding benefits

In honor of Pride Month Neiman Marcus is launching several initiatives to support its LGBTQ employees.

One is an effort to improve the company’s score on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index an annual ranking of policies practices and benefits pertinent to LGBTQ employees. More than 1142 companies nationally took part this year.

There were 767 companies at the top of list with 100% scores giving them bragging rights as best places to work for LGBTQ equality. North Texas-based companies American Airlines McKesson Corp. Texas Instruments Inc. and others made the list. So did van Raemdonck’s former employer Ralph Lauren Corp.

Neiman Marcus estimates it will score around 85% when the index is released for 2022.

To improve its ranking the company decided to update its code of ethics to include gender identity and expression make medical and soft benefits for same-sex spouses and domestic partners equal to that of other employees offer insurance plans to workers identifying as transgender create gender transition guidelines for supportive bathrooms and dress codes and implement new associate training and recruitment efforts.

“The new benefits that roll out this month and throughout 2021 complement [Neiman Marcus Group’s] outward celebration of the LGBTQ community with meaningful internal investments in equitable access to health insurance relocation assistance associate discounts and legal protections against discrimination for LGBTQ associates and their loved ones” said Mimi Sterling the company’s vice president for environmental social and governance and belonging.

To foster dialogue among employees van Raemdonck hosted a virtual event June 9 with Andrew Gelwicks author of The Queer Advantage where they discussed their personal identity journeys and how to become an ally for LGBTQ individuals. He is also participating in a virtual event with Retail Leaders Industry Association president Brian Dodge in late June.

Most storefront windows in Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores are displaying LGBTQ pride support and in-store visuals this month. Neiman Marcus stores are also raising money for the Human Rights Campaign through point-of-sale donations and “More Colors More Pride” lapel pins online and in 10 locations.

A look forward

For van Raemdonck the world is moving fast and he said that requires everyone to adjust their thinking.

At the June 9 Zoom event he told the audience of 220 that his 85-year-old grandmother had once introduced him and an ex-boyfriend as her grandchildren.

“She basically said ‘This is my family love it or not’” van Raemdonck said.

It made him realize that if his grandmother could accept and appreciate his identity so should everyone else.

“We all need to adjust and learn. We cannot rely on one single model. We cannot rely on what was true in the past” van Raemdonck said. “When you are faced with change when you are faced with the unknown your best ability to handle it is to be able to recognize what is new and what is different and to internalize and grow.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
RJF,Raymond James,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBld3RlcnJlcG9ydC5jb20vcHItcm91bmR0YWJsZS1pcy1icmFkeS1hbHJlYWR5LXdvcnRoeS1vZi1idWNzLXJpbmctb2YtaG9ub3Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PR Roundtable: Is Brady Already Worthy Of Bucs Ring of Honor?,"The PewterReport.com Roundtable features the opinions of the PR staff as it tackles a topic each week that involves the Bucs. This week’s topic: Is Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady already worthy of being inducted into the Bucs Ring of Honor?

Scott Reynolds: Yes Brady Already Belongs In The Bucs Ring Of Honor

What is the Bucs Ring of Honor? I see it as public recognition for legendary performance playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The enshrined get their names permanently affixed to the inside of Raymond James Stadium as a salute to their service to the Bucs organization. In my mind players (and coaches) eligible for the Bucs Ring of Honor should have helped contribute to Tampa Bay making the playoffs or winning championships and/or setting franchise records as one of the best at their position to suit up in a Buccaneers uniform. Despite playing just one season in Tampa Bay so far quarterback Tom Brady meets both of those criteria.

Under the harshest conditions – no offseason no preseason and a truncated training camp – Brady shined in his first season with the Bucs. He helped Tampa Bay go 11-5 and end a playoff drought that went back to 2007. Brady was instrumental in helping the Bucs win three playoff games on the road and Super Bowl LV. He was also the MVP in Super Bowl LV. Not to mention the fact that he set a new franchise record with 40 passing touchdowns in a season. He added three more scores on the ground to give him a total of 43 TDs. That’s the most touchdowns in a single season by a Bucs player in team history.

In just one year Brady broke Bucs records won a Super Bowl and was the game’s MVP. He’s already done more than some players that have played for the organization for multiple seasons. I’ve been asked before about Gerald McCoy’s worthiness for the Bucs Ring of Honor. It’s not my call but I wouldn’t endorse his candidacy because it doesn’t meet my criteria. McCoy never played for a playoff team and he didn’t leave his mark on the Bucs’ record book. Yes he was voted to the Pro Bowl six times but that’s an individual accomplishment. I think McCoy was a very good player but not a great player. There’s no doubting Brady’s greatness as a Buccaneer – even after just one season. Brady already deserves to be in the Bucs Ring of Honor.

Mark Cook: Not So Fast My Friend

While like all Bucs fans and most members of the media I marveled at the ability of Tom Brady to take a floundering franchise put it on his back and take it to the NFL mountain top last season however I can’t say that Brady is worthy of Ring of Honor accolades – just yet.

There has to be some criteria to being selected and I believe longevity should be one of these. While what Brady did in 2020 was nothing short of remarkable to be bestowed such an honor there needs to be a longer resumé than just one season. We can’t just start throwing in one-year success stories within the franchise. While clearly Brady had a 20-year run of success prior to coming to Tampa Bay that has proven him to be the best to ever play the QB position in the NFL those 20 seasons in News England can’t have any bearing on his worthiness as a Ring of Honor member for the Bucs.

Now if you ask will he eventually be inducted yes of course I do But I also believe there is a lot more of we saw in 2020 still to come from Brady. Two more years and another Super Bowl title would cement it for me. But it has to be more than one season of success or in my opinion it really cheapens the honor and is a slap in the face to the ones ones who are current members that played or coached for a number of years. There are still quite a few players who while they didn’t have the immediate success of Brady meant a lot to the franchise and the community and put up outstanding numbers. Yes Glazers I am talking about James Wilder specifically. But two more years of playoff football and another trip to the Super Bowl and I’ll be the first banging the drum for Brady’s induction.

Jon Ledyard: Doesn’t Get More Impactful Than Brady’s 2020 Season

There are no written criteria for the Bucs Ring of Honor but if there were I would happily adhere to those. If such a thing were written by the organization it would likely include more than one year of playing time with the organization. That’s an understandable mark that would give some credence to longevity being critical to making the Bucs Ring of Honor.

But until such stipulations are clarified in writing Brady should be a lock for the Bucs Ring of Honor. In a COVID-impacted season in which he didn’t even have time to get a full grasp of the Bucs offense until late in the regular season Brady was magnificent. He was easily the team’s MVP in leading the formerly disaster-ridden franchise out of a losing culture and all the way to their second Super Bowl ring. Yes plenty of players and coaches deserve credit but none more than Brady. In an offense that has always put a massive burden on the quarterback to be great Brady was among the best in the league.

And although he had a great group around him Brady’s weaponry wasn’t flawless in 2020. It was probably Mike Evans’ roughest season partially due to injuries. Chris Godwin missed more than four games with various ailments and Antonio Brown didn’t play until Week 9. It took Brown awhile to get the offense down after that and then he was injured for much of the playoffs. O.J. Howard tore his Achilles in Week 4 after becoming one of Brady’s favorite targets. And the Bucs running back room dropped more passes than any group in the NFL.

Brady was brilliant despite it all putting up massive numbers leading the team to multiple comeback victories and saving them in the wild card round while almost everyone else in red and pewter struggled that day. Yes the defense was critical to finishing the job in the playoffs but they never would have gotten there if not for Brady. It’s hard to argue against his 2020 season being Ring of Honor worthy if there is no requirement for longevity in order to make the list.

Matt Matera: Of Course Brady Transcended The Bucs’ Turnaround

Before answering about Brady a quick question. Did you know that the Miami Heat have Michael Jordan’s jersey number retired? Yes the Miami Heat who have all-time greats such as Dwyane Wade and Shaquille O’Neal with their jerseys in the rafters of the American Airlines Arena also have Jordan’s numbers 23 up there. For those that didn’t know Jordan didn’t play a game for Miami. What Jordan did though was transcend the game of basketball to the point that it made other teams shutter at the idea of another player wearing 23. Now back to Brady. Brady actually played for the Bucs and in less than one year brought the Bucs to new heights that they couldn’t have dreamed of reaching. Like Jordan Brady transcends the sport and he actually played for the team that will retire his jersey.

For starters Brady is responsible for getting Rob Gronkowski and Leonard Fournette here. That’s just the beginning of it. He didn’t just show up and expect to be great. Brady instilled a work ethic and an aspiration for greatness that this team always wanted but never believed they had until he showed up. You can’t find that looking at a box score so let’s bring in the stats now. Brady’s 40 touchdown passes was a franchise record. It took him one year in a season that canceled the offseason workouts for him to accomplish it. Mike Evans had 13 touchdown receptions for a franchise record with 12 of them coming from Brady. Coincidence that he had one of his best years with Brady? I think not.

By the way Brady was also the Super Bowl MVP for the Bucs’ Super Bowl LV win at home. He’s entering a season where the Bucs are expected to win the division and contend for another Super Bowl again. Should he at least get the Bucs to the postseason while along the way breaking the NFL’s all-time passing record then how do you not retire his number? He’ll accomplish offensive milestones that weren’t even thought of in this organization until Brady got here.

PETERSBURG — Growing up with a father who served on City Council politics was always around Ken Welch but it never interested him.

“I always said as a kid I would never go into politics” he said recently.

Now after a 20-year career on the Pinellas County Commission the 56-year-old has entered the race for mayor of St. Petersburg. And if elected Welch would be the city’s first Black mayor.

It’s the love he has for his city — where he grew up graduated from high school met his wife and has raised his daughters — that he said compelled him to run.

“I think we’re at an important point in our history” he said. “The decisions we make in the next few years will affect generations.”

A Lakewood High School graduate Welch began his entry into politics while in graduate school writing about city issues in the 1990s as a columnist for then-St. Petersburg Times weighing in on topics like baseball in the city and chronicling an incident when he said he was racially profiled by police in Largo.

He ran unsuccessfully for the Pinellas County School Board in 1998 and later ran in 2000 for County Commission winning a newly-created single-member district that includes St. Petersburg. He won reelection four more times and served until 2020 when he did not seek reelection in order to run for mayor.

Among what Welch considers his greatest accomplishments during his time on the County Commission are his work on homelessness small business enterprise and poverty reduction.

He chaired the county’s first policy group on homelessness in 2006 from which came Pinellas Hope in partnership with Catholic Charities. He pushed to increase the county’s small business enterprise program from $70000 to more than $20 million and he pushed for the incorporation of the South St. Petersburg Community Redevelopment Area the first CRA in the county with the purpose of fighting poverty.

He was also on the County Commission when it started the county’s housing trust fund which Welch said now has more than $100 million in its coffers. And he touted Pinellas County’s record on diversion programs redirecting kids and adults accused of minor crimes away from jail.

An accountant by trade Welch went to the University of South Florida St. Petersburg for his undergraduate degree and then to Florida A&M University for his master’s in business administration. He worked at Florida Power Raymond James and St. Petersburg College upgrading their accounting systems.

“I’m really into business process” he said and wants to take that experience to make city government work more efficiently.

As an executive Welch said he would lead with his six “I”s: in touch with the community inclusive informed innovative intentional equity and impact.

He described the city as having experienced incredible growth the last decade shirking the “heaven’s waiting room” label to blossom into a city of art and food and luxury apartments.

“But growth in and of itself isn’t progress” Welch said. “I want to make sure that we have inclusive progress in every part of our city.”

He said he is the person to restore constructive dialogue with the Tampa Bay Rays over a stadium deal that the team’s split-season idea is worth exploring and the Al Lang Stadium site — where the Rays sought to build a new venue in 2008 — should be back on the table.

But his priority he said is ensuring the redeveloped Tropicana Field site delivers on the unkept promises of new homes and jobs for the residents of the Gas Plant area the neighborhood that was displaced before the stadium went up. He said he would not pay “any price” to keep baseball but does believe it’s critical to decide first if a stadium will go on that site before moving forward with the development.

“We’ve waited 35 years” he said. “I think waiting another year to get it right is the right course to take.”

He also wants to see a transit referendum put on the ballot soon and prioritizing investing in youth opportunities particularly upgrading the city’s recreation centers.

In 2018 Welch drew criticism for lobbying for his wife who had been fired from leading a youth literacy program funded by taxpayer dollars. Welch who that year began expressing interest in running for mayor has said he did not use his political clout to help his wife and believes her firing was orchestrated by his political rivals.

Welch’s political committee Pelican PAC has raised more than $159000 while his campaign has raised more than $123000.

Other candidates include City Council members Robert Blackmon and Darden Rice and former City Council member and state Representative Wengay Newton.

Others in the field include restaurateur Pete Boland former political operative and marketer Marcile Powers University of South Florida political science student Michael Ingram Torry Nelson and former congressional write-in candidate Michael Levinson.

The primary election is Aug. 24. If no candidate earns more than 50 percent of the votes the top two candidates will face off in the Nov. 2 general election.

The new mayor will be sworn in Thursday Jan. 6 2022 and will serve a four-year term.

By Apeksha Bagchi |

This article is more than 2 years old

NBC’s popular crime-thriller series The Blacklist which is currently in its eighth season was recently renewed for the ninth season. Fans were hoping to see more of the ongoing animosity between lead characters Elizabeth Liz played by Megan Boone and James Spader’s Raymond “Red” Reddington. But it has been recently reported that Season 8 will mark the end of Boone’s character’s journey as the actress will be exiting the series.

Megan Boone who became a renowned star thanks to the series has led The Blacklist for eight seasons alongside Emmy-winner James Spader But recently Deadline has reported that she will be leaving the long-running NBC series. Season 8’s finale episode will be her last as a series regular. From hunting those on the FBI’s Blacklist Boone’s character Liz has now become the hunted and now occupies the no. 1 position in the list.

Last we saw Liz on The Blacklist she was discovering the truth behind all the lies told to her in the past eight years. She was taken to the center of Red’s operations discovers why the imposter Raymond Reddington was created in the first place and what really happened to her mother Katrina. But before she could learn the whole truth she was badly wounded by Townsend and his men. She was saved in time by Reddington who activated a self-destruct device to kill Townsend after apologizing for the role he played in his family’s demise.

What happens next in The Blacklist remains to be seen. Who Reddington really is where is the real Katrina and whether Reddington will be able to help Liz allowing her to make it out of the bunker alive are questions that will be answered in Season 8’s morbidly named finale “Konets” which means “the end” in Russian. Whether it hints at the end of Liz or the culmination of all the problems in her life till this point is something only the finale will tell.

Perhaps the only silver-lining the news of Boone’s departure carries is the fact that her exit was not something that was hastily planned. As per Deadline plans for Boone’s exit from The Blacklist were made early on such that it allowed a well-crafted arc for her character Elizabeth Keen in Season 8. Her departure doesn’t look like something that has been haphazardly put together. Reportedly the decision of ending Liz’s arc on the show was something that Boone and the creators of the series took together so no drama there. Boone was one of the original cast members along with Spader Diego Klattenhoff as Donald Ressler and Harry Lennix as Harold Cooper who have been on the show since Season 1.

Renowned series that have enjoyed decade-long runs have been known to perish when someone from its lead cast makes the decision to bow out. But NBC’s thriller tv series The Blacklist has maintained its strong viewership numbers and has remained a favorite of critics for eight seasons despite the departure of many from its original cast like Ryan Eggold Parminder Nagra and Mozhan Marnò. But it remains to be seen whether it will continue achieving the same success after losing one of its leading stars."

These new cards sport the Ampere architecture which is built on Samsung’s 8nm process. This new generation is different though delivering performance increases that Nvidia hasn’t seen in many years.

To help you navigate the range — and hopefully the GPU shortage — we rounded up everything you need to know about every Ampere card. The RTX 3080 is the flagship card followed by the RTX 3070 and RTX 3060. There’s also the powerful RTX 3090 for workstation purposes and Ti variants of the rest of the range.

Release date and price

The RTX 3080 was announced on September 1 2020 and it began shipping shortly after on September 17.

Nvidia launched the card for $699 which is the same price as the RTX 2080 and 2080 Super. The larger and more powerful card of the generation the RTX 3090 costs $1500. The 3090 in some sense replaces both the RTX 2080 Ti and RTX Titan. It’s sold in prebuilt gaming PCs though it features 24GB of GDDR6X memory for workstation performance in fields like data science and media production.

Moving down the range the RTX 3070 replaces the 2070 Super and costs $499. It was released shortly after the RTX 3080 and 3090 in October 2020. The “sweet spot” GPU the RTX 3060 Ti was released shortly after in December for $399.

Nvidia announced the RTX 3060 during its CES 2021 press conference replacing the RTX 2060 and 2060 Super. It has an MSRP of $329 and launched in February 2021.

Finally Nvidia revealed the RTX 3080 Ti and 3070 Ti during its Computex 2021 keynote. The RTX 3080 Ti launched on June 3 for $1199 and the the 3070 Ti came a week later on June 10 for $599.

Design

The RTX 3080 Founders Edition features a new “unibody” design that’s a bit more modest compared to the reflective aluminum of the RTX 2000-series cards. We found the card to be quite classy in our review with an angular design that features a matte dark grey finish with white backlighting instead of the traditional green hue used on prior GeForce cards.

Early leaked images revealed a very industrial-looking card with a dual-fan design and they turned out to be accurate. Marking a stark departure from older graphics cards where all the fans are aligned on the same side the RTX 3080 has a fan on each side of the card in an effort to better control the flow of hot and cold air throughout the desktop. Nvidia calls its thermal solution a “dual axial flow” and says it results in twice the cooling performance of its predecessor.

The RTX 3090 uses this same design only it’s much larger as the card utilizes a triple-slot format. The RTX 3070 meanwhile uses a more traditional dual-fan system. For a size comparison check out the photo below. The RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti both use the dual axial design as the more expensive cards in the range.

The RTX 3060 Ti uses a similar design as the RTX 3070 with dual fans on the front for the Founder’s Edition as does the RTX 3060.

The rumor mill has been spinning over a new 12-pin PCIe power interface system for some of these new cards and the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 will make use of the low-profile connectors. The company stated that the new connector combines the power of dual eight-pin connectors in a space-saving design. The RTX 3070 meanwhile uses just a single eight-pin connector as does the RTX 3060 Ti. The RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti utilize the 12-pin connector which you can split off into an eight-plus-eight-pin connector.

Port selection includes three HDMI 2.1 ports and a DisplayPort 1.3a. Importantly HDMI 2.1 supports a variable fresh rate of up to 120Hz in 4K . New OLED TVs have begun to support this new standard which could open up more options for PC gaming in the living room.

Specs

Nvidia made some ambitious claims about its new RTX 3000-series cards and they turned out to be true. First off it said that both the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 are more powerful than the current RTX 2080 Ti. As you can see from the chart below it’s not hard to see how that’s true.

CUDA cores Memory Memory interface Boost clock Graphics card power RTX 3090 10496 24GB GDDR6X 384-bit 1.70GHz 350W RTX 3080 Ti 10240 12GB GDDR6X 384-bit 1.67GHz 320W RTX 3080 8704 10GB GDDR6X 320-bit 1.71GHz 320W RTX 3070 Ti 6144 8GB GDDR6X 256-bit 1.77GHz 290W RTX 3070 5888 8GB GDDR6 256-bit 1.73GHz 220W RTX 3060 Ti 4864 8GB GDDR6 256-bit 1.67GHz 200W RTX 3060 3584 12GB GDDR6 192-bit 1.78GHz 170W RTX 2080 Ti 4352 11GB GDDR6 352-bit 1.54GHz 250W RTX 2080 Super 3072 8GB GDDR6 256-bit 1.82GHz 250W RTX 2070 Super 2560 8GB DRR6 256-bit 1.77GHz 215W

The RTX 3080 features 8704 CUDA cores making for a 65% leap over the RTX 2080 Super and a 50% increase over the RTX 2080 Ti. It’s also a more power-hungry card rated at 320 watts versus the standard 250 watts of the RTX 2080 Ti and RTX 2080 Super.

The RTX 3080 also features 10GB of GDDR6X memory at 19Gbps which is as fast as it gets. Nvidia said it had collaborated with Micron for the G6X video RAM on the card which according to the memory partner delivers a bandwidth of up to 1TB per second. The new Ampere RTX 3080 GPU comes with 30 shader TFLOPs up from 11; 58 ray tracing TFLOPs up from 34; and 238 tensor TFLOPs compared to 89.

Nvidia is also bundling in its new RTX I/O to help improve game loading times on its GPUs. There are three components in play here for the new RTX I/O including new APIs for fast loading and streaming directly from SSD to GPU memory GPU lossless decompression and collaboration with Microsoft for direct storage for Windows.

The result of all this Nvidia claims is twice the performance of the original RTX 2080. In real-life performance the RTX 3080 can consistently run games at 60 fps (frames per second) in 4K with RTX turned on and though performance varies widely across different titles we found in our review that 4K at 60 fps stays. Even ray tracing in 4K at decent frame rates is possible if you turn on DLSS.

Even bigger claims were made about the RTX 3090 which can reportedly play games in 8K at 60 fps. Although that’s a little far the RTX 3090 is still a monster of a card. This is done using DLSS 2.0 of course rather than native rendering. The RTX 3070 meanwhile is supposedly 1.6 times faster than the RTX 2070.

Moving into the mid-range Nvidia has two offerings: The RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3060. The 3060 Ti has already proven itself as the sweet spot for price and performance with an MSRP of only $400. It’s a remarkable card at that price delivering performance similar to the last-gen RTX 2080 Ti (a $1200 GPU) in most games.

The RTX 3060’s specs are for the most part what we’ve come to expect from Nvidia’s RTX 3000 range. The exception is the 12GB of GDDR6 memory surpassing the RTX 3060 Ti 3070 and even 3080.

We have some general performance specs too: 13 shader TFLOPs 25 ray tracing TFLOPs and 101 tensor TFLOPs. Although much lower than the flagship RTX 3080 the RTX 3060’s specs surpass the RTX 2080 Super.

The RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti update the higher-end cards in the range. The RTX 3080 Ti mirrors the RTX 3090 in most specs utilizing nearly as many CUDA Tensor and RT cores. The difference is that it comes with half of the GDDR6X memory making it a great card for gaming but a weaker choice for data science and 3D modeling.

The RTX 3070 Ti is more of a marginal upgrade. It comes with 256 more CUDA cores and a slightly boosted clock compared to the base 3070. The big upgrade is 8GB of G6X memory which is able to deliver much higher bandwidth on the same 256-bit bus.

Performance

The new cards are all built on the new Ampere microarchitecture which is based on Samsung’s 8nm processor featuring 28 billion transistors. Ampere uses second-generation RT cores and third-generation Tensor cores to boost performance.

In our RTX 3080 review we found the performance of the card to be quite impressive. In our 3DMark Time Spy test the performance of the RTX 3090 was 15% better than the RTX 2080 Ti despite the latter costing $500 more than Nvidia’s newest offering and 28% better than the RTX 2080.

We found that the RTX 3080 delivered solid performance uplift compared to the RTX 2080 but the gains weren’t quite as high as what Nvidia claimed. In Assassin’s Creed Odyssey we found that the RTX 3080 was able to hit 61 fps on the game on native 4K resolution when played at 60 fps on Ultra High settings. This translates to a 30% performance boost compared to the RTX 2080 Super. Similarly in the graphics-intensive Battlefield V the game averaged 97 fps in 4K at Ultra settings a result that was 33% better than the RTX 2080 Super.

While the generational improvement in performance was expected for a new GPU family the new Ampere cards perform significantly better at ray tracing the hallmark feature of the RTX family and an area of struggle for the RTX 2000 series. Ampere’s improvements with artificial intelligence and DLSS improve ray tracing performance especially when games are rendered at higher resolutions.

In our test of the RTX 3080 on Battlefield V we found ray tracing capabilities to be far superior when compared to the RTX 2080 Ti. In the mission Tirailleur we found that the scenes rendered beautifully with nice reflections and shadows and the game played at 55 fps in 4K at Ultra settings. When DLSS was enabled performance jumped to 69 fps compared to just 45 fps on the RTX 2080 Ti.

Still there were some performance bottlenecks when ray tracing was turned on. In Fortnite for example our review showed that the RTX 3080 was able to squeeze out an average of 23 frames per second when played at 4K with the highest settings enabled. In 1440p (2K) resolution the game averaged 53 fps. Depending on the game your monitor’s resolution and what you hope to achieve you may want to still leave ray tracing disabled at higher resolutions even on the RTX 3080.

Bringing in the other cards you can expect around a 20% difference in performance for each step down. The RTX 3070 performs about 80% as well as the RTX 3080 and so on. The Ti models complicate things a bit though.

The RTX 3080 Ti is a significant upgrade over the RTX 3080 on paper but it only represents around a 10% improvement in practice. In our RTX 3080 Ti review we found a 9% improvement in 3DMark Time Spy scores compared to the RTX 3080 and it earned around five extra frames per second in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Battlefield V.

We noted a similar performance increase in our RTX 3070 Ti review. We measured an 8% improvement across synthetic and real-world benchmarks mirroring the RTX 3080 Ti (though without the price premium). That said the RTX 3070 Ti isn’t an RTX 3080 killer. It’s more of a 1440p card than a 4K one though it can still run some less demanding games at 4K .

In the summer of 1978 I worked as a rodman/chainman for Boston Survey Consultant (now the BSC Group). My crew partnered with the engineering staff to conduct soil percolation tests for septic system design. At one point our boss informed us he had just attended a meeting at our corporate office in Boston on the status of the GPS satellite constellation. Little was known about this technology as the first GPS satellite (NAVSTAR 1) had only been launched months earlier. He told us that within a few years you would be able to put a “magic black box” on the surface of the earth and obtain XYZ coordinates. As an 18-year-old kid it was impossible for me to comprehend as we were in the process of locating the percolation test holes with a turn of the century K&E transit a handheld magnifying glass to read the vernier a Philly stadia rod for distance interpolation and a machete for cutting line. As I reflect on this story I realize how lucky I am to have witnessed all these measurement technology enhancements over the last four decades.

Entrepreneurs and innovators like Charlie Trimble Javad Ashjaee and Dr. Benjamin Remondi (the father of GPS kinematic principals) capitalized on this technology. The cost for one GPS receiver when they hit the market in the late 1980s was about $100000. Three GPS receivers software and state-of-the-art computers were needed since most of the survey applications required GPS static survey methodology creating a half million-dollar investment on equipment alone and resulting in only a handful of companies adopting this emerging technology. But those who did became pioneers and industry leaders.

Game Changer #1—Real Time Kinematic (RTK)

On December 8 1993 GPS Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was announced by a joint venture between the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation. On April 27 1995 GPS Full Operational Capability (FOC) was announced by the U.S. Air Force Space Command. This event reassured both public and private stakeholders of the validity of GPS. Real Time Kinematic systems started “trickling” into the profession.

My employer at that time was Mangini and Associates in Pueblo Colo. Having worked for the progressive thinking BSC Group I was versed enough in GPS technology to talk company management into buying an RTK system. I felt like a spaceman with my backpack Trimble 4000 GPS receiver GPS antenna whip radio antenna extension poles heavy camcorder batteries and cables. Early RTK receiver technology suffered from limitations. The most notable was range or distance from base station to rover. Most manufacturers RTK systems specified positioning performance as 1 cm + 1 ppm RMS HZ x 2 cm +2 ppm RMS VT. The parts per million (PPM) component plays an important role later in this article.

Game Changer #2—Real Time Networks (RTNs) and Virtual Reference Station (VRS) Technology

Around the year 2000 my company was a sub-consultant on a Colorado DOT project in Grand Junction Colo. The CDOT Project Manager told us that Mesa County had several UHF broadcasting base stations in the area. Having used RTK since its infancy I understood the language he gave but the workflow was foreign to me. All my RTK experience involved utilizing my base station and my rover. How was I to trust a third-party source of correction data? After observing multiple project control points with my RTK rover via corrections from one of the local Mesa County stations I was sold! These local stations became the foundation for the Mesa County Real Time Virtual Reference Network (RTVRN)—one of the longest operational VRNs in the country. As robust as GNSS network solutions have become with enhancements of correction data via internet protocol they all have limitations. For one they cover a specific geographic location that is typically geo-fenced—whether that be city county states or larger. Another limitation to RTN solutions is cellular coverage no cell = no data! Yes RTK “bridge” technology exists that incorporates cellular boosters that rebroadcast the internet-based correction via UHF. However this requires another piece of hardware cables and in most cases a designated ISP data account.

Are Satellite Based Correction Services the “Next Utility” for the 21st Century?

On several occasions during the mid to late 1990s I had the opportunity to collaborate with GIS professionals on creating survey grade GIS databases and schemas. The consultants utilized Trimble MGIS/resource-grade backpack mounted receivers and antennas with a handheld data collector. I was told that these units were OmniSTAR compliant and could receive satellite corrections from this fee structured Satellite-based Augmentation System (SBAS). Upon arrival I would setup my RTK system and get to work. The GIS team on the other hand would assemble their system and then wait for almost an hour to receive OmniSTAR “convergence.” Meanwhile I had already collected a fair amount of RTK data. When we compared observed coordinate values at best they were within a meter or so of my centimeter RTK value.

Now fast forward to March of 2011 when Trimble Navigation acquired certain assets from OmniSTAR. This initiated a campaign of “disruptive innovation” not totally realized until May 5 2020.

There exists a series of privately owned SBAS solutions from a variety of manufacturers (Novatel/TerraStar EOS/Atlas Trimble/RTX). Also publicly available SBAS systems encompass the globe—WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation System) EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) GAGAN (GPS-aided GEO Augmented Navigation) and MSAS (MTSAT Satellite Augmentation System). Although beneficial these publicly available SBAS solutions yield 1-2-meter accuracies at best. Trimble CenterPoint RTX (Real Time Extended) yields 2 cm (RMS) horizontal and 5cm (RMS) vertical accurate solutions in less than 1 minute. Automated transformations from global ITRF (2014) current values to NAD 83 (2011) are now performed real time in Trimble Access (TA) 2020. Additional enhancements are included in the December 2020 release of TA 2020.20. Most notably is the inclusion of plate motion deformation models. See: white paper “Deformation Models in Trimble Access 2020.20 and Trimble Business Center 5.40” at https://frontierprecision.com/wp-content/uploads/Trimble-Def-Models.pdf. In the U.S. (NAD83 2011) the Horizontal Time Dependent Positioning utility (HTDP v3.2.9) was incorporated. These new features resolve RTX to NAD83 (2011) legacy offset issues that required localization routines to remedy.

Briefly mentioned earlier in the article on May 5 2020 Trimble announced coast-to-coast coverage of CenterPoint RTX Fast service (less than 1 minute to convergence). All of this has happened since Q2 of 2020 which now makes RTX a “utility” that is much more than a game changer. Imagine being a large survey engineering firm with projects scattered around the U.S. or for that matter around the globe. All crews regardless of location could simultaneously work from the same correction source on the same geodetic datum with real time corrected data all with the same accuracies! Mind blowing isn’t it? This is just the beginning of an avalanche of GNSS rendered enhancements I predict will happen over the next 5 years (or less)!

How does Trimble CenterPoint RTX work?

Trimble owns and operates a network of terrestrial tracking stations strategically placed around the globe. These stations receive data broadcast by all GNSS satellites (GPS GLONASS Galileo BeiDou QZSS) and are the basis for a precise global modeling campaign including GNSS satellite orbit clock and atmospheric errors. This data is then sent to the RTX control center and processed. The RTX control center transmits the processed data to two entities. One: IP/cellular. Two: the processed data is also up-linked to geostationary L-band satellites. The L-band satellite then broadcasts correction data to the end user in the field providing real-time cm level positioning without the need for a base station UHF radio VRS/RTN connection nor internet connectivity.

Over the past decade as Trimble’s network of tracking stations has densified convergence/initialization times have been reduced dramatically. On May 5 2020 the densification of these ground-based GNSS tracking stations was sufficient for Trimble to release RTX Fast service for the U.S. and parts of Southern Canada. RTX Fast service boasts less than 1 minute to converge at 2 cm (RMS) HZ. With that said I independently tested these specifications utilizing Trimble’s R10 Model 2 GNSS receiver and TSC7 Trimble Access and no cellular connection or local base. The result of using this technology in different environments in different states and at varying times of the day was eye opening. Trimble CenterPoint RTX converged in less than a minute and met specifications. However for even better results I wait on average 5-7 minutes to obtain precisions of 0.03’/1cm HZ (DRMS) x 0.08’/2.5cm VT (1sigma). I chose these settings since DRMS (not RMS as in the specifications) has been the defaulted precision display in both legacy Trimble Survey Controller and Trimble Access for almost 25 years. Access 2020 gives users the option to select the job precision displays of legacy DRMS 1 Sigma 95% or 99% reporting. This enhancement integrates Trimble Access settings with those in Trimble Business Center as DRMS has been added to Trimble Business Center as well.

So what’s in it for me?

Trimble CenterPoint RTX yields centimeter accurate positioning. However not all applications require these accuracies. Trimble RTX offers a complete portfolio of solutions based on accuracy specifications (to see the range of RTX performance levels offered visit HERE). Regardless of the tier being used all data collected from multiple disciplines would be rendered on the same global datum. For national state county and city entities this could be huge. For the private sector surveyor the benefits are significant considering the time saved not having to setup and breakdown a RTK base station not counting the liability of leaving the station unattended. To validate the concept that a Trimble CenterPoint RTX solution will yield similar results to other legacy correction sources I conducted a very basic test on one point. Prior to the December 2020 release of Trimble Access 2020.20 I utilized ITRF 2014 (2010) values in my testing. Since the recent incorporation of displacement models in Trimble Access (previously mentioned in this article) the test was conducted in NAD 83 (2011). Another point worth mentioning as with RTK RTX observed data renders not only HZ and VT precisions values but a full covariance matrix as well (QC2 in Trimble Access settings).

The test data consists of 4 solutions as shown in the penny diagram in this article. Point “1_NA” was calculated through a least-squares network adjustment and tied to the national CORS network to create a “standard.” Point “1_RTX” is the result of a 180-epoch real time “observed control point” observation in Trimble Access with converged Trimble CenterPoint RTX. Point “1_VRS” was generated from the local Colorado-based Trimble VRS Now RTN. Point “1_OPUS” is the coordinate rendering via NGS’s OPUS RS Service incorporating a 1-hour data set. As shown all is centimeter accurate (distances are horizontal in meters). Simply amazing all falling within the diameter of a penny!

Another benefit to Trimble CenterPoint RTX as compared to traditional RTK—there is no compounding parts per million components. Depending on the specifications of the RTX receiver being used my yearlong testing reveals that somewhere around the 3-mile mark (RTK base station to RTK rover) a threshold is met where RTX accuracies surpass that of traditional RTK. I do realize that Trimble VRS (Virtual Reference Station) solutions minimize ppm error by localizing a correction packet but this is not the case with RTK. For long linear jobs (pipelines powerlines railroads) the benefit of this technology is substantial and worth investigating.

My preferred linear project workflow would be a least squares network adjusted “static” survey of primary control then supplemented with RTK secondary control. Unfortunately due to time constraints budgets and other variables many companies opt for an OPUS and/or RTK “traverse” survey. Both options are riddled with potential problems. I witnessed a situation where a surveyor was hired to survey around 70 miles of pipeline. He chose to “leapfrog” or traverse the line with RTK continuously compiling both RTK and PPM error. Unfortunately for him the pipeline had minimal design grade.

Trimble CenterPoint RTX solves most of these problems bringing seamless accurate and repeatable geodetic control to all crews throughout the continental United States and Southern Canada. Naturally if tight vertical control is required a combination of RTX and RTK or differential level analysis could be incorporated as part of the project workflow and Standard Operating Procedures.

In closing the title of this paper is a question: Are satellite-based correction services the “next utility” for surveyors and measurement professionals? After reading this article I hope you will agree the answer is yes! This technology will continue to improve with enhancements to not only the geodesic sphere of GNSS but also global terrestrial tracking networks precise modeling of the atmosphere and satellite clock and orbit algorithms. GNSS receiver and data collection hardware and firmware will continue to evolve capture our imagination increase productivity and so much more. Consider all your positioning solution options and remember “Measurement is a science not the press of a button.” #HowYouMeasureMatters

The graphics card features a striking look and a high-performance hybrid cooling system. While out-of-box the card features rather moderate clocks its sophisticated voltage regulator module (VRM) and cooler almost guarantee high overclocking potential with excellent stability. Only 1000 of such boards will be made each will be priced at nearly $5000.

Colorful's iGame GeForce RTX 3090 Kudan carries Nvidia's flagship GA102 graphics processor with 10496 CUDA cores that is paired with 24GB of GDDR6X with a 19.5 GT/s data transfer rate. The board operates at an Nvidia-recommended 1395 MHz/1695 MHz (base/boost) frequencies but at the push of a button it can push boost clocks all the way to 1860 MHz. The VRM and cooling systems look capable enough of supporting considerably higher clocks but this remains to be seen.

The iGame GeForce RTX 3090 Kudan has three eight-pin auxiliary PCIe power connectors that can deliver up to 450W of power. Colorful rate the graphics card at around 350W to 370W in normal operation and between 420W to 450W when overclocked. Meanwhile Colorful officially rates it for up to 500W which is still a pretty much enormous amount of power for a graphics board.

To cool down the monster the iGame GeForce RTX 3090 Kudan uses a custom-designed hybrid cooling system. The card itself carries a multi-piece heatsink featuring six 6-mm heat pipes a water block (which essentially removes heat from the heat pipes that touch the GPU) a backplate with another heatsink and three 90-mm fans. Colorful says that the air cooling system is powerful enough to work even without its liquid cooling addition.

Since the iGame GeForce RTX 3090 Kudan is a limited issue collector's item it features an aesthetic that is unmatched by anything else in the industry. The main cooler has multiple mechanical elements that look like gears from fine watches. It also has some Chinese design patterns and fully customizable RGB lighting. Colorful also did not forget about functionality so the cooling system also has a display with real-time monitoring information which can be flipped 90° when the card is used in vertical mounting orientation.

Colorful will only make 1000 of its iGame GeForce RTX 3090 Kudan graphics boards each priced at $4999. To emphasize how exclusive this product is Coloful will bundle Kudan-themed screwdriver keycaps and a graphics card holder.

The manufacturer posted a full unboxing video and compared the card to the last-generation KUDAN the RTX 2080 Ti iGAME which was a beast itself.

Colorful iGame GeForce RTX 3090 iGame KUDAN Is An Insane Graphics Card With A 240mm AIO Hybrid Cooling Solution 500W Power Limit & Over $5000 US Pricing

The Colorful iGame KUDAN series has always been the top-of-the-line product of the brand. The KUDAN series takes everything up to 11 with insane designs and massive cooling solutions. More recently Colorful has started using hybrid cooling technologies which include both air and liquid cooling. We last saw this with the RTX 2080 Ti iGame KUDAN which featured a hybrid design and came in a triple-slot form factor.

The Colorful iGame GeForce RTX 3090 KUDAN comes in a hard shell carry case which includes the card the radiator several accessories and a few additional goodies such as a tiny miniature of the card itself that could be used as decoration. As for the design of the card Colorful has gone with a CNC machined aluminum shroud which features black and silver aesthetics in a triple-slot / triple-fan form factor. The shroud features several gears that have been previously used on the RTX 2080 Ti and GTX 1080 Ti KUDAN series too. The card also gets a side-mounted LED display which is also featured on the Vulcan-X series from Colorful but this is a more refined and better-looking version.

The iGame GeForce RTX 3090 KUDAN has a hybrid cooling system that has both air-cooling and water-cooling systems. The RTX 3090 KUDAN’s air cooling system features a triple-fan heatsink with six 6mm high-performance heat pipes. It uses COLORFUL’s newly developed “Storm Chaser” 90mm fans with fixed-rotating fan blades. The heatsink features the iGame Vacuum Copper Plate Technology – a signature of the Advanced Series graphics cards. The air-cooling system delivers efficient heat dissipation on its own. The RTX 3090 KUDAN also has a liquid cooling system with a nine-stage water block and a high-performance 240mm radiator. The water block and integrated heat sink use the Breathe-Gill Technology used in the Neptune Series graphics cards. It features a much denser water lane structure and a stronger cooling performance. Just like its predecessors the iGame GeForce RTX 3090 KUDAN uses quick-release fittings for easy mounting and dismounting of the radiator-pump unit. The RTX 3090 KUDAN uses Swiss-made high-quality fittings designed by Stäubli which can be rotated 360° for easy installation and troubleshooting.

As we mentioned the previous iGame KUDAN from Colorful also featured a hybrid cooling design and the inlets led to a 240mm radiator. The radiator on the iGame GeForce RTX 3090 KUDAN includes the pump and has hard-sleeved tubes that are plugged in the inlet/outlet on the card.

One interesting feature is that the tube ports can be moved for easier installation and reduces tension when installing the card. Given the size of this massive behemoth it's a well-added and well-though feature. Once again the radiator is fully optional as the air-cooler itself is an exceptionally built design but for those looking for even better cooling the radiator is there within the package.

2 of 9

The Colorful iGame GeForce RTX 3090 KUDAN also comes with a full coverage backplate and is powered by a triple 8-pin connector configuration allowing for higher GPU power limits for OC enthusiasts. Coming to clocks and power details the iGame KUDAN has a boost clock rated at up to 1860 MHz and has a graphics OC power of up to 500W.

The talks also covered the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline (NS2). The top diplomats stressed that Poland and Ukraine perceive this project not only from the energy security perspective but also from the angle of national security. „We agree that if completed the NS2 will weaken Ukraine and make it possible for Kremlin to put a number of European countries under political pressure” said Polish foreign minister.

Speaking with the Romanian Foreign Minister Bogdan Aurescu Minister Rau assured him that Poland attaches great importance to strategic partnership with Romania in all dimensions. „Romania is a reliable NATO’s ally and Poland’s valued partner in the EU. We hope that despite the pandemic we will continue our intensive political dialogue” said Minister Rau. The head of Polish MFA added that he sees potential in further intensification of Poland’s cooperation with Romania in European and regional matters as well as in the area of security and defence sustainable development agriculture regional development and infrastructure. The talks also focused on NATO’s Strategic Concept which will provide guidelines for the Alliance’s works in the years to come. „It is very essential that this strategic document precisely defines how to prioritize various threats on the basis of their impact on our security” said Minister Rau.

The head of Polish MFA started his meeting with his Turkish counterpart - Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu with thanking the host for an invitation to participate in the forum. Minister Rau expressed satisfaction with the excellent state of Polish-Turkish bilateral relations. He thanked Turkey for its increased commitment in NATO’s Eastern flank also through supporting NATO Baltic Air Policing mission. “We expect to continue our cooperation with Turkey also in the context of the forthcoming debate on NATO’s new Strategic Concept” said Minister Rau. He also assured his interlocutor about Poland’s consistent support for Turkey’s European aspirations. „The EU and Turkey need each other as trustworthy and stable partners particularly in the field of security fight against terrorism trade and migration.

Alvaro Morata gave Spain the lead after a VAR review slotting home from close range and initially seeing his striker ruled offside. Robert Lewandowski powered home a header in the second half for a share of the spoils.

The result leaves Group E wide open with all four teams still able to qualify as they head into Wednesday’s final round of matches.

Morata broke the deadlock in the 25th minute pouncing to sweep home Gerard Moreno’s driven ball into the box and though a linesman’s flag for offside delayed the celebrations the goal was awarded following a VAR review.

Lewandowski equalised with a towering header from Kamil Jozwiak’s cross in the 54th minute and four minutes later a Moreno penalty came cannoning off the left-hand post with Morata missing the rebound and several more second-half chances.

The draw leaves Sweden top of Group E on four points with Slovakia second with three Spain third on two points and the Poles bottom with one. Sweden play Poland in their final game on Wednesday when Spain meet Slovakia.

Robert Lewandowski struck to keep Poland’s Euro 2020 hopes alive after coming from behind to draw 1-1 with Spain in Seville where the hosts missed a second-half penalty.

Spain who could only manage a 0-0 draw with Sweden in their opening Group E fixture went ahead in the 25th minute through Alvaro Morata after his close-range effort had initially been ruled out for offside before being overturned by VAR.

Poland beaten by Slovakia in St Petersburg on Monday responded and were deservedly level early in the second half when Bayern Munich forward Lewandowski headed in at the back post.

There was though more drama to come when Spain were awarded a penalty after the referee reviewed the incident on the pitchside monitor only for Gerard Moreno to hit the post with his spot-kick and Morata then knocked the rebound wide.

Both sides still have qualification in their own hands heading into their final Group E matches when Slovakia go to Seville and Poland play Sweden – who picked up three points from their second fixture – in St Petersburg.

Poland had created an early chance when Mateusz Klich tried his luck with a long-range effort which flew just over.

However it was Spain who took the lead as they went ahead midway through the first half.

Morata swept in a low cross by Moreno which was swiftly flagged offside – only for VAR to overturn the decision and allow the goal to stand.

After seeing his 20th international strike confirmed Atletico Madrid frontman Morata – who had been four games without a goal – ran straight over to celebrate with coach Luis Enrique.

Spain were close to a second when Gerard’s 20-yard free-kick curled just wide of Wojciech Szczesny’s right-hand post.

Poland threatened when Lewandowski clipped the ball across to Karol Swiderski at the near post.

The PAOK forward though could only smash a volley over the bar from close range when he looked set for a simple header.

Poland should have equalised just before half-time.

Swiderski’s low 20-yard drive smashed against the base of the post and Lewandowski – who plundered a Bundesliga record 41 goals for Bayern last season – sent the rebound straight at Unai Simon from point-blank range.

There was still time for Spain to break down the left through Jordi Alba and Moreno sent a low effort into the side netting.

Poland started the second half brightly and equalised through Lewandowski in the 54th minute when he headed home a deep cross from Kamil Jozwiak at the back post.

Spain though were given a chance to swiftly retake the lead.

Moreno went down in the area following a challenge from Jakub Moder when contact on the Spaniard’s foot looked minimal.

Initially Italian referee Daniele Orsato had not given a foul but was advised to review the incident – and he then signalled a penalty.

Moreno hit his spot-kick against the base of Szczesny’s right-hand post and Morata stabbed the rebound wide.

Seville June 20: Robert Lewandowski rescued Poland with a second-half equaliser and Gerard Moreno missed a penalty as Spain were held to a 1-1 Euro 2020 draw at La Cartuja Stadium.

Álvaro Morata silenced his critics by opening the scoring in the Group E encounter in Seville on Saturday (June 19) after coming under fire for his performance in a stalemate against Sweden.

A defeat would have ended Poland's hopes of qualifying for the round of 16 but their record goalscorer and captain Lewandowski equalised with a header nine minutes into the second half.

Moreno failed to put Luis Enrique's side back in front from the spot just after Lewandowski's leveller leaving Spain and Poland third and fourth in the group respectively with one game to play.

La Roja were in front 25 minutes in Morata turning in Moreno's tame shot from close range with his right foot and belatedly running away to embrace coach Luis Enrique after the VAR ruled he was onside.

Moreno starting at the expense of Ferran Torres curled a free-kick narrowly wide before Karol Swiderski volleyed a glorious chance to equalise off target from point-blank range.

Swiderski rattled the post with a thunderous left-foot drive and Lewandowski was denied by Unai Simon following up with Moreno firing into the side-netting late in an entertaining first half.

Poland were level nine minutes into the second half the prolific Lewandowski rising above Aymeric Laporte to brilliantly head home Kamil Jozwiak's inviting cross.

Lewandowski had barely finished celebrating when referee Daniele Orsato pointed to the spot after taking another look at Jakub Moder's tackle on Morata.

Moreno was unable to restore Spain's advantage striking the post and Morata failed to spare his blushes when he put the rebound wide with the goal gaping.

History was made when Poland substitute Kacper Kozlowski became the youngest player to feature in a European Championship aged 17 and 246 days in a tense encounter which remained in the balance.

Wojciech Szczesny spread himself magnificently seven minutes from time to thwart Morata as Spain endured a frustrating evening and Poland stayed alive.",,,

ROST,Ross Stores,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvanVuLzIwL2dvb2dsZS1zdG9yZS1tYWtlcy1ueWMtZGVidXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google store makes NYC debut | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"Google has opened its first retail store in New York City highlighting the internet giant's effort to promote its consumer hardware devices.

The store in Manhattan's trendy Chelsea neighborhood opened last week the Mountain View Calif.-based company said in a blog post. The shop which is a block away from rival Apple Inc.'s 14th Street store occupies part of the first floor of Google's New York offices.

Google began experimenting with pop-up stores in 2016 the same year it debuted its Pixel smartphone and Nest smart home speaker. In the years since the company has introduced a plethora of hardware devices and hosted subsequent pop-ups to learn more about what consumers expect from a retail store said Jason Rosenthal Google's vice president of direct channels and membership.

""It's like walking into a dream"" Ivy Ross vice president of design user experience and research for design and services said during a virtual tour. ""I hope customers feel the same way. I want them to be happy and inspired like I am being in here.""

Ross oversaw the planning for the store.

The store was designed like a social space with sitting areas tables and other furniture that invites a level of public intimacy and intermingling that has been a rare experience during the covid-19 pandemic. The company said it will limit the number of people who can be in the store at once and that associates as well as customers will have to wear masks inside.

The furniture including sofas and oval-shaped tables is made of blond wood and cork -- neutral colors so the products would stand out Ross said. The company also wanted customers to see what Google's products would look like ""in context"" so in the store speakers may be placed next to piles of books and other design knick-knacks to give it more a feel of being in someone's home. Phones tablets and other devices are operational and untethered so visitors can fiddle around with them.

Ross said there's a children's room to ""park your children while shopping."" There's also a space where people can use the Pixel phone's Night Sight feature to take images in the dark and email the photos to themselves. There's a room where three people can play video games through Google's Stadia streaming service. And there's the Imagination Space -- partially enclosed by a 17-foot-tall glass round structure with screens inside. On the screens visitors can experience advanced or experimental Google services that may not be available to the public yet.

Rosenthal said it was important for Google to create a direct retail channel that embodies the Google brand and lets customers hear straight from the company and gives Google feedback from customers. He declined to comment on whether the tech giant would open additional stores.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXN0aW4zNjAuY29tL3N0b3J5L2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYW1pbHkvMjAyMS8wNi8yMC9hdXN0aW4tZmFtaWx5cy1sb3ZlLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1jb21lcy10aHJvdWdoLXRocmVlLWdlbmVyYXRpb25zLW93bmVycy1tYW5hZ2Vycy82NzA4NzI3MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Austin family's love of McDonald's comes through in three generations of owners managers,"""They have ketchup in their veins.""

That's what Ross family members say about one another. For three generations they have worked in or owned and operated a total of seven McDonald's restaurants first in Dallas and now in Austin Round Rock and Hutto.

When they gather for family events they talk about normal family stuff — who's doing what at school for example — but they also talk shop — which dipping sauce is the best one for fries or McNuggets which new chicken sandwich they like and which frozen drink is their favorite.

They also talk about business such as how to make the customer service or the employee experience better.

It's become their family business through three generations.

The first restaurant

Ann and Edward Winston Ross Jr. decided to buy their first McDonald's restaurant in 1985 after working for 17 years at Xerox.

""I wanted to start a business that I owned"" says Winston Ross 77. He also didn't want to leave Texas he says.

They were living in the Dallas area and faced knowing that their Xerox jobs were going to be moved to California and then probably back to Rochester N.Y. where Xerox is headquartered.

Ann Ross 77 did some research into what type of business would be a good fit. They saw it as a community as a family but also an opportunity.

They had a neighbor who was a regional manager for McDonald's and had been talking to them about working for McDonald's when they decided to apply for the registered applicants program to become an owner/operator.

They spent the next two years working during the day for Xerox and at night and on weekends in McDonald's restaurants learning how to run one.

""The first day I started out on the frying line"" Winston Ross says. ""Let's see if he goes forward.""

They had to learn everything from how to make a burger and fries to at the time how to make biscuits from scratch.

""I could do everything in the restaurant but make scratch biscuits"" Winston Ross says. ""They didn't turn out at all. They just stuck to my hands.""

When they got to the restaurant each day Winston Ross would work the drive-thru and Ann Ross would head to the kitchen a place she loves. It's the most important part of the store they say because without the kitchen you have nothing.

""You're going from one thing to another if you're in the kitchen"" Winston Ross says. ""You're making a burger one minute and the next minute you're making salads.""

When they bought their first restaurant in south Dallas in 1987 their daughter Erica was 19 and son Edward Winston Ross III who goes by E.W. was 17.

Both E.W. and Erica were McDonald's veterans having had their first jobs at one in high school.

That first store shifted the family business from being engineers and architects to being McDonald's owners.

The new family business

The Rosses are descendants of McKissack & McKissack the oldest minority-owned architecture firm which was founded in 1905 in Nashville Tenn. by Ann Ross' family.

Ann and Winston Ross both became engineers she an architectural engineer he an electrical engineer after graduating from Tennessee State where they met.

E.W. Ross followed in those footsteps and became a civil engineer after graduating from the University of Texas.

While E.W. Ross was at UT his parents saw an opportunity in 1989 to buy a McDonald's on Airport Boulevard in East Austin an area of town where there weren't any locations.

""We thought the opportunities were better in Austin than in Dallas"" Winston Ross says.

That McDonald's is now owned by E.W. Ross who says it's important for major chains to be represented in all areas of town. The family began choosing areas that were diverse.

""People in those communities want to be able to walk to their McDonald's"" E.W. Ross says. ""They want to have the same benefits available to them.""

The Rosses have made it a priority to be part of the communities where their restaurants are.

""When you put a McDonald's in a historically underrepresented part of town we're able to partner with elementary schools that need support"" E.W. Ross 51 says. It's also meant hosting events such as coffee with a candidate running for city council or school board or police officers coming to talk about crime prevention or Capital Metro sharing new bus routes.

At one point Ann and Winston Ross owned four McDonald's. E.W. Ross bought two from his parents including the Airport Boulevard store.

A second generation

Ann and Winston Ross saw McDonald's as a ""stable environment for the family"" Winston Ross says. ""It gives us a legacy. Our kids can just go off and do things for a while and then they come back to McDonald's.""

That's what's happened with both E.W. and Erica.

Erica Ross 53 says the family element to McDonald's is what keeps her coming back. ""You're together in the good times and the bad"" she says. After college Erica returned to McDonald's and became a general manager in her parents' restaurants.

No one had any doubt that E.W. Ross would be a future owner/operator following his parents. His road there was just a little longer.

""He's always been really driven"" Heather Ross says of her husband but she says his independent nature meant he had to do his own thing for a while.

E.W. Ross was a resourceful kid who was always creating a new business.He built his own bicycle out of parts. He collected used golf balls on the golf course and sold the balls to golfers for a discount. He had a lawn business in high school that helped him buy his first car a 1978 MGB convertible.

He also started working at McDonald's during high school which he says is a great first job: ""It teaches you responsibility.""

It's about showing up on time with a clean uniform and being able to make eye contact and talk to people and working as a team he says.

While at UT he owned a bar off Sixth Street with some buddies for a few years. He also worked for UPS.

""He was always trying to figure out how to be an entrepreneur"" says Tony Brown one of his college friends and the best man at his wedding. Brown remembers Ann and Winston Ross teaching the value of money to E.W. and how to work within his budget and to make his case if he needed something more.

When they would go to one of the Rosses' McDonald's E.W. Ross and Brown were reminded that it was a business. ""It's not a free place to eat"" he says.

E.W. Ross met Heather at a party and as he was getting ready to graduate he sold a motorcycle he owned to buy her an engagement ring. She went on to get her law degree and work as an attorney.

After college E.W. Ross put his degree in engineering to work at Applied Materials but after a few years he wanted to start his own business. While still at Applied Materials he turned his love of cars into starting a used car dealership called One Price Cars.

""I was always passionate about creating revenue for myself where I could be my own boss"" he says.

He kept the day job and got up early in the morning and worked late at night and on days off to build the car business.

In that business he says he realized that being your own boss was not a ""get rich quick"" scheme where you could sleep late or sit around watching TV or playing golf.

E.W. Ross made One Price Cars a full-time job after a few years and owned it for 13 years. ""It's where I cut my teeth and learned what it takes to be an entrepreneur"" he says.

The land near Capital Plaza where the dealership was tripled in value and around the late 2000s he realized that he wanted to get into being an owner-operator for McDonald's like his parents. He sold the dealership property in 2011 and used the proceeds to purchase his first restaurant.

He had to qualify to be an owner-operator and go through the same process as everyone else not as a person who had parents who owned restaurants. His parents did not give him a restaurant but he trained in their restaurants while in the training program.

""I didn't even get a first car given to me"" E.W. Ross says. ""I certainly wasn't going to get a franchise given to me.""

E.W. now has five McDonald's restaurants. Three years ago as their three children's schedules became more complicated Heather left her job as an attorney and slowly got pulled into helping out at their restaurants.

Both E.W. and his father are a ""gets stuff done"" kind of person she says. She and Winston's mother come behind them and smooth all the ruffled feathers.

""He is just a leader"" Erica Ross says of her brother. ""He's just so organized. He can do so many things.""

The next generation

All three of E.W. and Heather Ross' children have worked officially or unofficially for McDonald's.

Son Edward Winston Ross IV 19 who is also called Winston or Little Winston is going into his sophomore year at Baylor University where he's studying theatrical design technology. He's been working at McDonald's since he was in high school and received a scholarship from McDonald's to go to college.

Daughter Ryan Elizabeth 18 has worked at a couple of McDonald's locations. She will head to Savannah College of Art and Design in Georgia in the fall and is a model.

Youngest son Roman 15 has put on a Hamburglar costume and worked events at his father's stores just as E.W. used to put on a Batman costume and make appearances at his parents' stores while he was in college.

Roman who will be a sophomore at Hendrickson High School knows that soon he will be working regularly at one of his father's stores. It will be his choice he says but ""I need money.""

The Rosses have a deal that the kids need to put in the bulk of the money for their cars just as E.W. had to buy his own car and later his own McDonald's stores.

Being the boss's son or daughter doesn't give you any breaks Ryan Elizabeth and Little Winston say. Everyone else can leave their job at the job when they go home but the Rosses get to analyze the day and what they could have done differently with their dad. It's on-the-job as well as at-home training for a life of customer service management and entrepreneurship.

Both older generations believe Little Winston will be the next owner-operator. He might go off for a while and do Broadway but ""he's got ketchup in his blood"" Ann Ross says.

Heather Ross remembers when Little Winston was 5 coming into one of his grandfather's stores and giving the employees orders. ""Winston you cannot tell them what to do"" she remembers telling him.

They took a trip to the children's museum in Dallas where there was a pretend store. Before Heather Ross knew it Little Winston had organized the kids into who would work the register and who would stock and they did what he told them to do she says.

Now as a manager at their stores ""He's a real asset"" she says.

This new generation has grown up in the grandparents' and parents' restaurants.

""You would think you would get tired of it"" Ryan Elizabeth says ""but it's just food.""

Little Winston says he grew up thinking McDonald's was only about cheeseburgers. ""When I was older in high school I realized there was the rest of the menu"" he says.

They all agree there's something about those fries.

Ann says: ""We love McDonald's.""

One zone mimics various rooms within a house outfitted with Google hardware; “Discovery Boxes” lined up along windows feature 3D animations that tell stories and little-known details about various Google products. In the back “sandbox” zones let customers test out products for themselves. Anchoring the store is a 17-foot-wide room-like installation outfitted with giant LED screens that immerses visitors in artistic explorations of Google’s software like Search and Maps. For the inaugural Translate experience customers can whisper phrases and hear that same phrase whispered back in 24 languages while also displaying that text on a screen.

For the first time in Google’s 22-year history the tech giant has opened a brick-and-mortar retail store. Located at the base of the former Port Authority Building a vast Art Deco structure that also houses company’s New York headquarters the 5000-square-foot outpost will serve as a one-stop shop to explore Google’s growing suite of consumer hardware from Pixel phones and Nest smart-home gadgets to Fitbit wearables. Beyond a place to purchase and repair devices the store offers an abundance of immersive experiences so customers can see firsthand how Google forecasts its technology fitting into day-to-day life.

Ivy Ross Google’s VP of hardware design who also served as the project’s creative director opted for sustainable design details that forge a calm atmosphere. Wood veneer walls for example are made from responsibly sourced hickory. Daniel Michalik designed the furniture using renewable materials such as cork that also emanate feelings of warmth—an antidote to the antiseptic pared-down minimalism often favored by Google’s competitors. “The space is designed to be a physical expression of what Google stands for” Ross tells Fast Company. “We wanted the space to continue the design principles that radiate from our product. Our philosophy is that technology must fit into our lives not stand out. We want this space to feel human because we believe that technology is a tool to amplify our possibilities as humans.”

Ross worked closely with architect Suchi Reddy founder of local firm Reddymade to design the LEED Platinum–certified space. The two previously collaborated with Johns Hopkins University’s Arts + Mind Lab on “A Space for Being” an exhibition during Milan Design Week 2019 about the nascent field of neuroaesthetics which explores how design elements like color and texture impact our biology.

It’s unclear whether or not Google which has long hosted retail pop-ups will expand its retail footprint to other cities. Unlike Apple a hardware juggernaut with more than 500 stores worldwide the vast majority of Google parent company Alphabet’s revenue comes from digital ads which generated $147 billion last year alone. Its other major competitor Microsoft permanently closed its entire crop of retail stores during the pandemic. If anything Google is likely testing out the waters—its foray into retail will serve as a testing ground for garnering valuable customer insights and building them into upcoming products.",,,,,,

Freedom of the Seas is in Miami to begin a short test cruise which is a necessary step for revenue cruises to begin.

Royal Caribbean will have 100% of its crew members fully vaccinated on all its sailings.

Royal Caribbean announced a test cruise for Freedom of the Seas back in late May and she will sail between June 20 - 22.

Simulated voyages (also known as test cruises) are when cruise lines can operate ships with volunteer passengers in order to prove their new protocols work.

These are not cruises you can book but rather are limited voyages where a cruise line invites certain unpaid volunteers to help go through all the necessary steps and procedures to ensure cruise ships can be run safely.

If all goes to plan Freedom of the Seas is scheduled to begin revenue sailings from Miami on July 2 which would make her the first Royal Caribbean cruise ship to restart revenue sailings from the United States.

Test cruise requirements

Test cruises come with a variety of requirements that must be completed in order to demonstrate the ship can be operated in a safe manner with the new health protocols

While the ship is indeed conducting a cruise as if it were a normal cruise the CDC wants the cruise ship to test out procedures and ensure it can handle any health situation it could encounter.

Each ship must conduct at least one simulated cruise and each voyage must be between 2-7 days in length with a least one overnight stay including through embarkation disembarkation and post-disembarkation testing.

The CDC recommends a test cruise is at least 3 days with 2 overnight stays.

Passengers and crew must meet standards during the simulated voyage for hand hygiene use of face masks and social distancing for passengers and crew as well as ship sanitation.

Royal Caribbean must modify meal service and entertainment venues to facilitate social distancing during the simulated voyage.

And then there is a laundry list of activities that the CDC says the ship needs to test across one or many separate test cruises:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjA3MzkxNS9jZWxlYnJpdHktY3J1aXNlcy1jZW8tbGlzYS1sdXRvZmYtcGVybG8tY292aWQtMTktdHJhdmVsLXJlYm91bmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Celebrity Cruises's CEO Is Navigating Rebounding Travel,"(The interview below was delivered to the inbox of Leadership Brief subscribers on Sunday morning June 20. To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world’s top CEOs and business decisionmakers click here.)

Moments after two passengers on Celebrity’s Millennium cruise ship tested positive for COVID-19 in early June the phone of Celebrity’s CEO Lisa Lutoff-Perlo rang. It was her senior vice president of operations who was onboard carefully monitoring the company’s first cruise from a North American port in 15 months. “When I saw his name come up I said ‘‘This can’t be good’ says Lutoff-Perlo. “He said ‘We have two positive cases.’”

Few industries have been hit harder by COVID-19 than the cruise business. One of the first enduring images of the pandemic was of the Diamond Princess ship quarantined off Japan in early 2020 as more and more of its thousands passengers and crew got sick. (HBO just released a documentary The Last Cruise on the plight of the ship.) Cruise lines took on billions in debt to make it through the shut down. Royal Caribbean Group the parent company of Celebrity reported a net loss of $5.8 billion for 2020 and its net debt rose to $16.45 billion according to S&P Global Ratings. After suspending operations in March 2020 the company estimated it burned through $250 million to $290 million a month in cash in 2020.

Now as the nation reopens and people resume traveling the industry has been caught up in the culture war surrounding vaccines. Celebrity and other cruise lines are requiring that passengers provide proof of vaccines before boarding a vessel. The CDC issued guidelines in April that allowed cruises to sail without preliminary test cruises if the crews and passengers were largely vaccinated but Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis passed a law barring businesses from requiring proof of vaccines and the state of Florida sued the CDC and the U.S. government in federal court challenging the cruise guidelines and on June 18 a federal judge sided with Florida granting the state’s request for a preliminary injunction barring the CDC from enforcing its rules. The judge said that starting on July 18 that they will be only a nonbinding recommendation. Celebrity is planning its first departure from a U.S. port from Fort Lauderdale in Florida on June 26. After the ruling the company said that it was reviewing the order but that it continues to move forward with plans for the June 26 departure. Prior to the Friday ruling Celebrity had been asking whether booking passengers were vaccinated versus requiring proof as in the case of the St. Maarten cruise. The vast majority of customers were reporting that they had been vaccinated according to Celebrity.

Lutoff-Perlo and her team had spent much of the 15 months they were closed down planning how to reopen safely and when the positive tests came back Celebrity’s safety protocols kicked in. To start with the ship was only at 30% capacity as the company tiptoes back to sea. The positive pair who were asymptomatic were placed in an isolation cabin which was connected to a medical facility. Through interviews and reviewing onboard security camera footage Celebrity identified other passengers and crew that had been in contact with the infected pair including the other 19 people that had taken an excursion with them. No additional cases were detected and the cruise finished on schedule. Two days after our interview Royal Caribbean announced it was postponing a cruise scheduled for July after eight crew members tested positive for COVID-19 underscoring the challenges of restarting the industry.

Lutoff-Perlo who acknowledges that cruising may not be at the top of everybody’s list of reopening activities recently joined TIME for a video conversation on the pent-up urge to travel cruise resistors and the current consumer mindset. “People are just going to go for it” she says.

(This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.)

How quickly were you informed of the positive tests?

Immediately. Immediately.

What was your initial response when you got the call about the positive tests?

“Oh shit.” I was disappointed but I wasn’t freaked out or upset by it because it was bound to happen. It might have been nice if it didn’t happen on the first cruise but it did and we had done everything right.

Let’s talk a bit more about safety and perception issues: This is just my own personal focus group but when I mention this story to people the universal response has been ‘That doesn’t sound safe. Going on a cruise is the last thing I would want to do right now.’

Listen I’ve been in this business for 36 years and long before COVID people said “Oh I don’t think cruising is for me” so I’m not surprised when people say that cruising might not be at the top of their list of vacation choices. But my response to that is being on a Celebrity cruise ship is probably the safest place you can be on the planet right now. So I would take exception to that comment. If I’m traveling or if I’m going out to dinner and I’m sitting in a crowded restaurant with no social distancing and no requirements for vaccinations and I don’t know who I’m sitting next to. I would feel much safer on a cruise ship right now then I would just about anywhere else including traveling on an airplane. So I think that people that say that are mis- or ill-informed.

Is there a certain segment of the population that is just not in your total addressable market?

There have been cruise rejecters since the beginning of time. There will be cruise rejecters long after I retire from this business.

Are you highlighting your safety protocols in your marketing?

We’re not. Our message is not going to be about that. Our message is about getting back to our normal lives. People want to get back to traveling people want to get back to doing the things that they haven’t been able to do in a really long time. The vaccine for the vast majority of the people that we talk to is liberating. We are appealing to the place that the consumer is and their mindset right now is they want to get back to reconnecting with their families to reconnecting with other people to reconnecting with the planet and traveling again. Anything that they want to know about health and our protocols and our vaccination requirements is available on our website.

Does the debt that your parent has taken on inhibit your ability to operate and do everything you want to do?

It doesn’t. We need to get people back on cruise ships. That’s how we’re going to be successful in paying back our debt but our long-term strategy has not changed. We continue to build ships. We are taking delivery of Celebrity Beyond in April 2022 . Our chairman is over visiting the shipyards we’re all of our ships are being built this week.

What does a new cruise ship cost?

The ships are over a billion dollars to build.

What is your view of the protests and proposed bans by cities like Venice that object to the stresses these huge cruise ships put on a location.

Part of our opportunity is to work with all of the destinations that we visit in a more meaningful way to understand what they’re worried about. We are partners in this and we certainly want to be helpful. But the one thing that this pandemic has proven is that the cruise industry plays a very meaningful role in the financial health and economic success of so many different places around the world and those places far out number some of the places that get the most publicity around how they feel about cruise ships visiting whether it’s Venice or Havana. What I see mostly is legislation being passed so that ships can go back to Alaska because Alaska is hurting so badly because cruise ships have lost two seasons there and their economy is in really big trouble. I see how happy and how welcomed and well received we were in these Caribbean islands because we were the first cruise line to come back in North America and how happy these islands are that our guests are back. Their economy suffered so greatly because we weren’t there for 15 months. There are so many positive things that we do for economies and people. We can always focus on the ones that stand out that are the most problematic but they are the exception not the rule.

How has the pandemic changed you?

I’ve learned a lot about being grateful and appreciative for the people that I work with every day to a degree that I probably never would have had the opportunity to do if it were not for this crazy pandemic that we’ve been living through. I’m a pretty hard driver as anyone that knows me will tell you and I know I still have that in me because that’s just who I am. But I really tried to think about what’s important and what’s not important and what to emphasize and what not to worry about emphasizing. Perspective and appreciation has risen to the top of the things that I learned to accentuate that I probably didn’t accentuate enough prior to this. And so I think we’ve all come out of this differently and hopefully better.

There are a lot of predictions that travel is going to come roaring back: what is your sense?

We’re seeing levels of bookings at 2019 levels which is really really encouraging. We can see that people are booking their vacations but they’ve been putting off now really for two seasons. People have money now because they haven’t been able to do anything for so long.

It’s the return of the big spender?

We find that people are treating themselves to better accommodations. We find that they’re spending a lot of money on board because they just want to enjoy themselves. They want to go to the casino. They want to get a massage. They want to go to a specialty restaurant. So I agree with that statement that it’s going to come roaring back. People are just going to go for it because it’s been quite a long time since they’ve been able to. They’re really really having a great time and getting back to enjoying their lives. I think that goes back to what people have learned during this time—they’ve learned that they miss travel and they learn that they miss connecting with other human beings. We humans were not meant to live the way we’ve been living.

That moment came as Celebrity Apex sailed out of port at 8:30p.m. local time.

The company’s return to the Aegean is all the more poignant given Celebrity Cruises’ proud Greek heritage according to a press release.

. Founded in 1988 by the Chandris family of Greece the company later became a part of the Royal Caribbean Group. Celebrity Cruises is still rooted in its Greek origins today with 70% of marine officers across the fleet hailing from Greece with more than 40 Captains and Chief Engineers including the Captain of Celebrity Apex Dimitrios Kafetzis.

“After all this time what a dream come true for everyone onboard this exquisite ship in one of the world’s most breathtaking regions. Her sail-away today is a meaningful moment for our guests our crew and our company. I think we are all having ‘pinch me’ moments” said Celebrity Cruises President and CEO Lisa Lutoff-Perlo. “Returning to sailing in the Aegean where it all began for us and after such a long time is also very special for me and for the Celebrity Apex crew. Greece has always held a special place in our hearts and now even more so as we sail forward to experience all of its wonder once again.”

Guests traveling on the Greek Islands and Cyprus itinerary will have the chance to visit Rhodes Mykonos; Santorini and Limassol.

“Today is a very proud day for me and one I will never forget. Not only do I return to sea but I do so in my home country and with an incredible crew. I was born and raised right here in Piraeus less than a mile from our Athens homeport and grew up dreaming of sailing this coastline at the helm of a ship. I was born and raised right here in Piraeus less than a mile from our Athens homeport and grew up dreaming of sailing this coastline at the helm of a ship. It is truly an honor to captain the newest Celebrity flagship and to welcome our first guests back onboard” said Captain Dimitrios Kafetzis.

Celebrity Apex sails with a vaccinated crew and at least 95% vaccinated guests.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jcnVpc2Vjcml0aWMuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3doYXRzLWl0LWxpa2UtYmVpbmctYmFjay1vbi1yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4td2UtYW5zd2VyLXlvdXItY3J1aXNlLXF1ZXN0aW9ucy1hYm91dC1iZWluZy1iYWNrLW9uYm9hcmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's It Like Being Back on Royal Caribbean? We Answer Your Cruise Questions About Being Back Onboard,"The first Royal Caribbean cruise in North America Adventure of the Seas went off without a hitch last week returning with a weeklong sailing from Nassau in The Bahamas.

As I wrote in my live stories the line's comeback came with plenty of emotion and excitement from the passengers onboard. The initial boarding processes went well even without a real terminal in Nassau and the two days spent at Perfect Day at CocoCay represented everything that Royal is so good at.

Finally we documented the comeback of Cozumel cruise favorite Senor Frog's and sat down with Matt Hochberg of the Royal Caribbean Blog to talk about some changes.

But we realize that people still have a lot of questions about these first few Royal Caribbean cruises. With that in mind we've drawn up a Q and A where we try to answer your burning questions. Also keep in mind that cruise protocols are still in flux and things could change without a lot of advance warning.

How many passengers were on your sailing? How full was the ship?

The official count for the June 12 cruise came in at 1068 people. How you judge capacity depends on if you take the ship's double occupancy figure -- 3114 passengers- or how full the ship can be if every stateroom has a family with kids in it -- 3800.

Either way you are looking at a much lower capacity than usual – 34 percent or 28 percent. We're told that the sailing that boarded after us on June 19 has even fewer people onboard a little over 900. number of people onboard.

What was the vaccine policy and what percentage of people onboard were vaccinated?

For these sailings out of The Bahamas all eligible passengers for vaccines over the age of 16 were required to have them (that age will lower to 12 in August). The crew were fully vaccinated. Given that the cruise does accept kids with proof of a negative COVID-19 test approximately 94 percent of the ship ended up being vaccinated. For those who love math that means there were about 64 kids onboard give or take a few.

94 percent is lower than what the CDC has required for cruise ships in the U.S. that want to skip test cruises! Did it feel unsafe?

Not at all. Remember all adults onboard were fully vaccinated. The only unvaccinated passengers onboard were kids and they were required to wear masks indoors unless they were eating and drinking.

As I've written before I'm definitely in favor of fully vaccinated ships but this cruise also made me realize that I would be OK with it if a higher percentage of young kids were allowed onboard as long as they masked and followed protocols.

It's hard to get kids to wear masks! Were they really complying?

Yes for the most part. While I did see a few kids without masks near the elevator a few times I was actually pleasantly surprised at how well most seemed to adapt. Remember kids have been wearing masks to go to school and in other public places in most parts of the country for months. The parents I talked to said it wasn't an issue.

The only time I really saw kids unmasked was in the buffet when they were eating and drinking; at the splash park main pool and whirlpools in the main area; and at Perfect Day at CocoCay when we were all outdoors anyway.

Did you take a COVID-19 test before you boarded?

Yes we took a rapid antigen test at the British Colonial Hilton our de facto terminal right before boarding. One thing that's great about sailing out of The Bahamas as opposed to some other Caribbean islands such as St. Maarten is that the government does not require a test to enter the islands if you've been vaccinated (unvaccinated kids do have to present a negative COVID-19 test result before they enter the country). The test before boarding is an extra layer of precaution that Royal has implemented and makes sense.

How did you show proof of vaccination?

Royal Caribbean is asking people to bring their original vaccine card with them. It was scanned during check in at the hotel. I also uploaded my vaccine card twice before I arrived – once for The Bahamas Health Visa which you must fill out two weeks before your cruise and once on my United Airlines app. (The latter is not required I just wanted to do it so I could be entered into their contest to win a free trip).

Having the vaccine card came in handy at other points in The Bahamas. The island is currently restricting indoor dining to vaccinated people and our hostess checked our cards at the Fish Fry before seating us.

What about this Health Visa? How much does it cost? Do you really need it?

Yes The visa costs $40 and you can start the process two weeks before your trip. It's nothing to stress over honestly – once I filled it out and uploaded my vaccine card documentation it was approved within a matter of hours.

When I arrived at the United check in at Newark the attendants asked to see it and I had also uploaded it to my airline's app ahead of time. Pro tip: You can access the visa through a QR code on your phone but it's much easier to print it out because you will have to show it at various points. Some people on my flight did not do their visa ahead of time and they were directed to another line to get it processed; save yourself this hassle. The attendants put a sticker on a paper copy of your boarding pass that proves you have it (on connecting flights you might be asked to come up to the gate attendant and show it there).

You show the visa again when you go through immigration in The Bahamas. Finally we showed it again when we checked into our hotel the British Colonial Hilton. After that you don't need it.

I usually sail from Florida. Was it a huge hassle to cruise from Nassau instead? What were the flights and airport like?

Given that Nassau is a new homeport for Royal Caribbean I was expecting some hiccups -- and was pleasantly surprised when I didn't have any. Sure the flight to Nassau is an extra cost if you're used to driving to your port but if you don't live in Florida the cost of the airfare was less than I would have paid flying to Orlando.

My direct flight from Newark was smooth. There was a short 10-minute line at immigration. The Nassau airport had our bags out quickly and it was a quick $35 cab ride to our hotel. It maybe took 40 minutes.

The ship doesn't leave until 9 p.m. Does that mean I can fly in on embarkation day?

You can. There are numerous morning flights between Nassau and Miami (and at least one from Newark and New York). But we really don't recommend it. We saw many stressed-out social media posts on embarkation day about delayed and canceled flights. Save yourself the hassle and come in the day before.

Royal wants me to sign up for a certain check-in time but I'd rather just show up when I feel like it. Cool?

No. The process is more structured because there are more processes to go through such as the COVID test. The line is also trying to encourage social distancing and avoid crowds so you are required to sign up for a check in time and stick to it. Our advice is to make sure you buy your flight first so you can accurately gauge a realistic check in time and be prepared to be on time.

Ugh this all sounds like it takes a lot of time.

It sounds that way but it doesn't. Our full check in from getting our nasal swab to taking the shuttle to the ship to walking down the pier took 35 minutes. And that was the first sailing! While it could feasibly take longer as the ship allows more guests onboard the process was all very smooth.

How was E-Muster?

Easy! And a huge improvement over the pre-COVID process. You watch the safety video on your phone or in your cabin and visit your muster station to check in on your own time. So much better than having your embarkation day interrupted.

Let's talk food. What was the Windjammer buffet like?

This is one of the areas where I noticed the most changes. The buffet recommends reservations for breakfast and lunch and your SeaPass card is scanned when you enter and leave for contact tracing purposes. Everything is served by crew members from the food to the coffee and drinks. Seating is also marked off with tables given room for people to socially distancing.

Wait the servers make your coffee too?

Yep not just in Windjammer but in Café Promenade as well. An attendant also gets your soft-serve cone for you near the pool deck and mans the soda machine down in the Promenade.

How is the main dining room?

Pretty much the same as you remember. The biggest difference here is that you're encouraged to use your phone and pull up the menus with a QR code. This goes for the specialty restaurants too although you can ask for a paper menu if you'd like one.

With all of these tables blocked off what do I do if I'm traveling by myself? Where can I eat dinner if the Windjammer is closed?

Cafe Promenade is open 24/7 and has a nice mix of food during day as well as pizza (which seemed improved from the last time we were onboard Royal in Marrch 2020. At this time the main dining room is only seating people together who have their reservations linked. There aren't big tables anymore where the maitre'd will seat you with strangers.

Izumi is a specialty restaurant but it's also a nice option for solos. On Adventure it's right on the Promenade so you can see people walking by and feel like you're in the thick of things.

It sounds like you have to carry your phone with you a lot. Do you need to buy the Wi-Fi package?

You do not need to have the Wi-Fi package to access the Royal Caribbean app or use it onboard for menus or show reservations. And if you'd like a paper copy of the Compass -- we found that we wanted one -- you can get them at Guest Services or ask your cabin steward to put them out for you every night in your room.

I don't have a smart phone. What do I do instead?

You can still do everything the old fashioned way but it will likely require a few trips to Guest Services. You can sign up for your Health Visa on your laptop at home and then print it out (I recommend doing this anyway). You can watch the e-muster drill on a TV in your cabin. You likely will have to go to guest services to sign up for your COVID-19 test to return to the U.S. You can always call from your room for restaurant and show reservations.

But yeah it's a lot easier if you have a smart phone that's for sure.

Were you able to see all the shows? What was the seating like in the theaters?

The theater and Studio B were two areas where it was obvious that capacity had been reduced. Entire rows were blocked off for social distancing and you could only sit in groups of two. You are asked to reserve shows when you're onboard.

That being said the ship added more shows than usual during the week. We saw three shows in total -- the dance production a special guest musician and the ice show -- and never had a problem getting in either with or without a reservation.

Are there other areas onboard with reduced capacity and a reservation requirement?

Yes. Both the fitness center and the kids club had a 16-person limit with reservations enforced. On our sailing it was pretty easy to show up on standby for both. But once capacity goes up you're going to want to visit these venues on the first day to secure your spots.

The bars too have limited capacity simply because seats are blocked off. You can't sit at the bar at all anywhere on the ship so if you want to sit for popular events like trivia in the Schooner Bar you'll want to get there on the early side.

We noticed that the ship kept adjusting to avoid crowding -- a popular singer in the pub was moved to the larger Imperial Lounge for example.

What was the casino like?

Just like the arcades and the fitness machines the slots were shut evey other one to encourage distancing. People were also seated on every other seat at the table games and the craps table had restricted people on each side. You did not need a reservation.

**What's the elevator situation? Did you have to wait a lot?

SIgns tell you to restrict the number of people in the elevator to either four at a time or members of your own party. I didn't notice any issues or long waits mainly because there were no real times when there were huge crowds anywhere (remember the shows have reduced capacity so you don't have a ton of people pouring out of the theater at any one time).

Are the crew wearing masks? Was that weird?

Yes the crew were all wearing masks but it wasn't weird. Most restaurants and bars where I live still have servers in masks so it seems pretty in line with COVID regulations on land. Royal has all crew wear a button (or badge if you're in the UK) with a full face photo on it. It was still very easy to hear people. You'd be surprised by how much humor and personality still comes through particularly with the outgoing Activities staff.

Musicians and entertainers do not have to wear masks during their shows. Plexiglass spit screens are put up during their performances. In the Studio B ice rink and theater no one was allowed to sit in the front row.

Did you have to wear a mask in port? Could you book your own shore excursions?

Yes because we were a vaccinated sailing we could go off on our own in port. But it's important to note that other countries are way behind the U.S. in terms of their own vaccination rate so you will be subject to their protocols. In both Mexico and The Bahamas we were required to wear a mask outdoors and in public places except when eating and drinking.

Did you have to get a COVID-19 test to get back into the U.S.?

Yes and Royal Caribbean had us schedule this via a QR code. The antigen tests were given on the Thursday and Friday of our cruise. Again the process was fairly seamless and took place on the Deck 5 portion of the Dining Room. Results were sent via email (or the TrustOne app) within a few hours.

Besides seeing the results on your app Royal provided a letter with the results in your cabin the night before you left. I uploaded a copy to my United app and so I didn't have to present it at the airport. A friend of mine who didn't have the app was asked to show the paper results at the airport when she checked in.

Was debarkation a pain?

Nope! Again we had a limited number of people onboard but we put our bags out at 10 p.m. the night before just like old times and they appeared pier-side the next morning. Finding a taxi was extremely easy and The Bahamas airport was not crowded at 8:30 a.m. (we were told it would get busier as the day went on). All in all it took about 90 minutes to get from our cabin to the airport gate mostly because the Nassau airport does not have TSA pre-check (although it does have Global Entry).

Were people able to do back to back cruises? What was that like?

Yes. About 70 passengers stayed on for another round. Instead of taking the rapid antigen COVID-19 test to get back into the U.S. on the Thursday and Friday of the cruise they took theirs on that Saturday -- debarkation day -- instead. They did not have to leave the ship.

With so few people onboard did it feel like a regular cruise? Did you like it?

Hey my last cruise in April took place on a ship in Alaska with only seven people so I like having space. I loved being back at sea on a big ship again for the first time in 15 months. Highlights included playing (and occasionally winning) a bunch of trivia games seeing live music watching the sun rise -- and set -- over the ocean talking and laughing with the international crew and having a blast in port.

I'm sure you love cruising for different reasons. While the ship did lack large group events such as huge deck parties or Meet and Mingles the fun Royal Caribbean vibe is still there. And I really loved being able to always get a deck chair at the pool.

Finally the service was simply outstanding. From our steward Marlon to our main dining room server Cecilia to the Activity staff trio of Jhun Grace and Felix we had a blast laughing and talking with them all of us thrilled to be back at sea.

C'mon is there anything that you didn't like?

I do like sitting at a bar and meeting new people so not being able to do that was a bit of a bummer. I also like being able to pop into Windjammer for a quick bite at dinner so I didn't love that it was closed (but not forever we were told it will reopen for dinner once the ship is around 65 percent capacity).

But these are very small things in an industry that has gone through its roughest time. In short we were honored to be part of cruising's return -- and I think you will be too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZsaWdodGNsdWIuaXQvZW4vMjAyMS8wNi9yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tcG9zdHBvbmVzLWRlYnV0LW9keXNzZXktb2YtdGhlLXNlYXMv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZmxpZ2h0Y2x1Yi5pdC9lbi8yMDIxLzA2L3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1wb3N0cG9uZXMtZGVidXQtb2R5c3NleS1vZi10aGUtc2Vhcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean posticipa (ancora una volta) il debutto dell’Odyssey of the Seas,"Rely on the Exclusive team for your luxury hotel reservations.

The reason for the delay? Royal Caribbean announced it: Eight members of the Odyssey of the Seas crew tested positive for Covid-19 last June 10 six days after the ship arrived in the United States. Thus the departure set for July 3 was postponed. After all the entire staff (about 1400 people) received the vaccine only upon arrival on U.S. soil.

""All employees who tested positive are in good health and are being monitored by our on-board medical team. No new cases have been detected since June 10 to date"" Royal Caribbean said in a note released to the press. However the entire crew of the Odyssey of the Seas will remain in quarantine on the ship for 14 days following a strategy that the company itself called ""an abundance of caution.""

What will happen to those who had already booked their trip? These days Royal Caribbean is contacting guests and travel agents to propose different options for those who were about to leave. ""This was an unexpected but necessary decision and we will strive to do the right thing for everyone's well-being"" the company announced.

What's new at Royal Caribbean

The Odyssey of the Seas is at present one of the largest cruise ships in the world. Although it is not as large as the Symphony of the Seas (the world's largest cruise ship) is designed to offer all the opportunities and entertainment of a giant resort. It boasts numerous swimming pools a water park for children a skydiving and surfing simulator and a bumper car track. Plus the many many types of cabins. Ranging from tiny 15-square-meter windowless interior cabins to huge two-story Royal Loft Suites that are almost 10 times larger.

Odyssey of the Seas was originally given a 2020 departure from Italy. Then its first voyage was postponed because of the pandemic and re-scheduled to Israel. Finally after the resumption of shelling with the Gaza Strip she had been brought to America for security reasons where-again-she had to revise her plans.

But Royal Caribbean's expansion does not stop with the Odyssey of the Seas. On June 17 at Meyer shipyards in Turku construction began on the Icon of the Seas. Coming in 2023 the Icon series ship will be the first among the company's ships to be powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG). A decision that confirms the company's commitment to preserving the health of the oceans. ""We made a commitment to make clean energy at sea which became a reality when Icon Class was first announced in 2016. We are excited to see the construction of what will truly be a ship unlike any other"" said Royal Caribbean President and CEO Michael Bayley."

Laturnus Obituary 2024,"Peter S. (Pete) Laturnus

December 30 1934 – May 09 2024

Peter S. Laturnus 89 of Munich ND passed away on May 09 2024 at CHI St Alexius Health Devils Lake Hospital.

Mass of Christian Burial for Pete will be held on Tuesday May 14 2024 at 10:30 a.m. at St Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich ND with Father Brian Moen celebrating the Mass. Burial will be at the St Boniface Catholic Cemetery. Visitation will be at the church one hour prior to the funeral Mass.

Visitation will be at the Gilbertson Funeral Home Devils Lake on Monday May 13th from 4:00 p.m. until 7:00 p.m. with a Rosary and Prayer Service at 6:00 p.m.

Peter Sebastian was born on December 30 1934 in Wilkin Saskatchewan Canada one of 13 children of Sylvester and Gunda (Steffan) Laturnus. He was the third youngest of the family. In 1945 the family moved to a farm near Starkweather North Dakota and later to Cando North Dakota where Pete attended Metcalf County school through the 8th grade. Several years later the family moved to a farm near Clyde North Dakota. Pete obtained his U.S. citizenship in 1960.

Pete worked with his brother-in-law Elmer Mueller for many years doing plumbing and heating work. When Elmer retired Pete started his own plumbing and heating business along with farming for many years at Calio N.D. He so loved the farm and could build and fix almost anything. He also enjoyed making his rounds on the farm in his golf cart. He built a go kart for his children and it has gone through all the grandchildren and now great grandchildren. It has been one of the many highlights of the kids going to the farm. Pete enjoyed his annual fishing trips with family and his many buddies over the years as well as spending time with family at the cabin at Red Willow.

Pete and Donna met at a dance in Calio and on November 19th 1956 were married at St. Boniface Catholic Church in Calio. They attended church in Calio and later St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich. Throughout their married years they were on the dance floor often dancing to their treasured waltzes and polkas. In later years they loved listening to the Sayler’s Polka Place music every Sunday afternoon and looked forward to occasional trips to the casino.

Pete was an active member of St. Boniface and St. Mary’s Catholic Church and was a life member of the Knights of Columbus.

Pete is survived by his beloved wife of 67 years Donna their children and spouses Dean (Kim) Laturnus Munich Daryl (Sandy Hendrickson) Laturnus Munich Dennis (Lori) Laturnus Grand Forks Steve (Donna) Laturnus Grand Forks and Bonnie (Alvin) Wald Bismarck along with 11 grandchildren; Deanna (Jeff) Heidi (Troy) Kayla (Brant); Amanda (Tyler); Justin (Jessica) Rebecca (Justin) Matthew (special friend Emily); Mitchel Conner Emma Dominic and 14 great grandchildren sister-in-law Helen Laturnus and many nieces and nephews.

CRM,Salesforce,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vZXJwLnRvZGF5L3otemFocmEtYmFocm9sb2xvdW1pLWNlby11a2ktc2FsZXNmb3JjZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zahra Bahrololoumi CEO UK&I Salesforce,"A 22 year veteran of consulting giant Accenture Zahra Bahrololoumi – or Z as she is known to her friends – has made the monumental leap from consultancy to vendor and now finds herself sitting at the top table within the world’s most progressive software company – Salesforce.

In 2018 Salesforce announced it would invest heavily in the UK market – some $2.5bn – over the next five years. That commitment was backed up by the announcement of a further $2bn investment in Ireland along with a pledge to create 1500 new jobs within the same timeframe. Salesforce which had always derived the vast majority of its revenues from the US market was getting serious about the UK.

However Bahrololoumi isn’t the first person to have taken the job on. In 2019 when Salesforce first ramped up its commitment to the UK it appointed Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia as the UK CEO. Gadhia was the former CEO at Virgin Money and held a number of government advisory positions. Whilst Gadhia is one of the best-known female leaders in the UK and shares many of the same principles as Bahrololoumi in terms of advocating diversity and equality they were two very different appointments.

Gadhia arrived at Salesforce as a seasoned CEO with government-backed credentials whereas Bahrololoumi brings a much richer and more relevant toolkit in the form of front-line digital leadership customer value creation and deep technical knowledge. Gadhia was a statement signing that made sense at the time and gave Salesforce’s play some gravitas. Bahrololoumi is an entirely different proposition and provides the hands-on experience that will be needed to guide both Salesforce and its customers through the digital revolution.

22 years at the world’s biggest consulting firm (by number of employees) had seen Bahrololoumi rise up the ranks since joining the firm as Andersen Consulting in 1998 through to her departing role as UK&I technology and consulting lead. During her tenure she gained significant transformation experience with a number of blue-chip clients across several industries including retail oil and gas banking healthcare and telecoms. She pioneered a number of ‘firsts’ – from convening the UK technology ecosystem at the award-winning Kaleidoscope to patented uses of cloud technologies. She was also the driving force behind several of Accenture’s marquee acquisitions and oversaw the growth of its technology and consulting unit to become the deepest in terms of talent and expertise in the UK. She is a former vice chair of the Prince’s Trust Technology Leadership board and currently sits on the boards of techUK and Movement to Work.

A long list of accolades and achievements which I know from our time together embarrass her as much as they instil a sense of pride.

Bahrololoumi is a well-known and equally well-liked personality within the enterprise tech community. In researching for this article I couldn’t find a single person who had anything negative to say and all who know her describe a fun energetic highly articulate and capable leader. Liked by colleagues customers and partners alike – Bahrololoumi brings something to the world of enterprise tech that is noticeably lacking in many interactions – authenticity. It’s a word that is bandied around by corporate PR teams but is rarely evident and Bahrololoumi has it in spades. Her open and approachable manner is perfectly tempered by her indisputable knowledge authoritative yet calm demeanour and unmistakable passion for doing the right thing.

These are all admirable and highly desirable qualities but as I was driving through rural Northamptonshire on my way to ‘Bahrololoumi Towers’ for the interview – I couldn’t help but keep asking myself the same question: how big of a step up is this job? Sure Accenture isn’t exactly small fry and her role there was very senior – but Salesforce? In a CEO role? Knowing all the complexities that CEOs have to deal with and understanding the dramatic differences in culture between the two organisations I wondered – was she going to be up to it?

In late May as some restrictions to civil liberties were lifted I popped round for a cup of tea to ask her exactly that and to discuss her heritage responsibilities challenges and ambitions as she takes on her new role.

Zahra Bahrololoumi’s (from here on Z) ascension to the role of EVP and CEO UK&I at Salesforce is nothing short of meteoric and is some achievement for a girl who was once told by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) that she couldn’t fulfil her dream of becoming a diplomat because her skin was the wrong colour.

Born to Iranian parents Z’s family came to the UK in the early 1970s and the hostilities and hardships endured by her countrymen and women had a profound and lasting effect.

Conflict was the backdrop to much of my youth. Although I wasn’t living in it I have family there so it was a reality albeit a distant one. I felt very passionately about peace which sounds really naff but that’s how I’m wired. I think I’m a good collaborator and I can see things from lots of different angles. I talked about it quite a lot with my Dad and my dream was to make a career in diplomacy and to do my bit towards bringing peace to the world.”

Of course times have changed and the recruiting policies of most organisations have improved significantly since the days when an employer could determine your suitability for a job based on where your parents were born. But the FCO’s loss was Accenture’s (Andersen Consulting) gain and in 1998 Z started her career in technology.

However she was somewhat of a reluctant employee to begin with: having completed a degree in Management Science at Brunel University it seemed an obvious path to fall into management consulting. A high achiever throughout school and university Z had all the credentials that the blossoming consulting world was looking for. However she was adamantly not interested in a career in management consulting and insisted on being employed in a technical capacity despite having virtually no technical skills.

When I was interviewing at Andersen Consulting they offered me a job in what was then change management and is now considered management consulting. I said ‘Thanks but no. Unless I can join technology I’m not joining.’ And they said ‘Well you’ve got no technology skills.’ And I’m like ‘Yeah I know that but it’s the future and I really want to learn.’ I knew Anderson would give me a great platform so I took the job and the rest is history.”

The following is taken from our Q&A during a COVID-secure interview at her home.

Usually when a person commits two decades to an organisation they are often there for life. Z had served 22 years for Accenture so the two burning questions have to be: ‘why leave and why join Salesforce?’

ZB “Leaving Accenture wasn’t an easy decision because I was really happy. Accenture’s a wonderful place and it still is really close to my heart but the opportunity to work inside Salesforce was just too compelling to ignore. When I think about Salesforce it’s a leader in its field and it’s so purpose driven and value led. The values they’ve got – trust customer success innovation and equality – they really chime with me.

“They haven’t just pivoted to these values they were always very purposeful in their leadership and I wanted to experience it for myself. I knew this was another experience to have in my lifetime. So it was an easy choice to join Salesforce but it was less easy to say goodbye to the wonderful Accenture.”

Everyone likes a bit of gossip and I guess they’d like to know about how you actually got the job. I’m assuming that you didn’t put your CV on Indeed?

ZB “Ha! Not exactly. I was approached by a headhunter. Initially I was quite dismissive not because I was dismissive of Salesforce – I really loved the company – I was just very happy at Accenture. I started to have informal conversations with leadership at Salesforce and the only way I can describe it was a very warm embracing hug. The recruitment process was fascinating. It didn’t feel like I was being grilled through a series of interviews. It felt like there was a two-way conversation to allow me to test whether this was the right company for me. I’m extremely loyal – 22 years in one place. You don’t walk away from that easily or lightly.”

I knew this was another experience to have in my lifetime. So it was an easy choice to join Salesforce but it was less easy to say goodbye to the wonderful Accenture.”

I mentioned your experience with the FCO in my introduction which must have been an upsetting and disappointing experience. But how challenging was it to break into consulting in 1998 for an Iranian girl with dark skin and no tech skills?

ZB “My heritage wasn’t necessarily the big thing that was on my mind – it was the lack of technology skills! However I was one of only two women in my technology start group and there was no one that looked like me! I was the only dark girl in my intake and at the time Andersen Consulting didn’t have the kind of policies and outlook that we have today.”

How has your gender and heritage impacted your career? Do you think it’s helped or hindered you?

ZB “I definitely don’t feel like I was hindered. Anderson Consulting [and subsequently Accenture] have matured and now they really are world class in terms of their stance and their impact in the space of inclusion and diversity. I’ve been part of that journey and I feel really proud of what Accenture does today. Even at the start I was pleasantly surprised at how egalitarian Andersen was. You did good work you proved yourself you delivered and you were recognised for it.”

What’s been the biggest changes you have seen in the enterprise tech world during your 22 years – apart from the technology itself?

ZB “We were quite constrained in the ‘90s and we were very formal. You were in suits there was a certain polish and I think things relaxed post the dot.com boom. I think that dot.com boom paved the way for people to become more themselves.”

Yes suddenly success looked very different – how did that impact you and your career?

ZB “I still have a slide that I use when I talk to folks about my career journey. It’s from pre 2000 and everything is black and white and sepia and then literally after the dot.com boom everything was multicoloured. It’s like the tech world specifically moved into colour overnight.”

What drove you in those early days to become successful?

ZB “The main thing that fuelled my drive influenced my progression and set me apart was the influence of my parents. I remember growing up my parents always said to me ‘you have to work twice as hard as everyone else; first of all you’re a woman and secondly you’re a brown woman’. My parents sacrificed so much to stay in the UK and help me forge my career – so of course I had to succeed. They never pressured me not once but it is my life’s work to prove their decision to stay was the right one and to make them proud.”

And how did your early career at Andersen progress?

ZB “I was really fortunate that I got accelerated through pretty much every promotion point. I ask myself ‘why was that?’ I think my drive and focus I think anyone will tell you that I haven’t changed in 22 years. Some of the nicest things that friends and people have said to me that I’ve worked with over that period of time is that irrespective of your role you’ve been the same Z. And I think that is something I’ve held quite dear.”

You spent 22 years at Accenture and you were head of technology and consulting when you left. You now find yourself with a CEO title. Is this job a big step up for you?

ZB “Yes and no. If I consider the traditional dimensions of scale and the impact the roles are quite similar. It was a very large part of the business that I ran and was responsible for within Accenture. The customer accountability that I had and the customer responsibility was very similar.

“I think the thing that is different within Salesforce for me personally is the profile and the responsibility is a step up. There’s a deep sense of responsibility – the stakes that we have in powering the economic recovery – I feel an overwhelming sense of duty. As the face and the most senior individual across UK and Ireland that is very different that has a different profile for me and I love it. It weighs heavy but it’s rewarding.”

Salesforce on the other hand operates in a space where organisations can differentiate themselves by building unique relationships.”

How different is it being on the other side of the consulting vendor dynamic?

ZB “I constantly weigh this up and of course you can’t avoid the comparison. I think number one both Accenture and Salesforce are very purpose led and value driven. I think that remains the same on both sides.

“I think the key difference is within Accenture you have a customer base that sits within a specific profile. And within Salesforce what I absolutely love is that it serves so many different types of customers.”

You must be dealing with lots of companies that you wouldn’t have dealt with before; smaller SMBs right through to global enterprises.

ZB “That’s it. So that whole spectrum is a massive learning opportunity for me and you get to see different challenges across these different segments of the market. That’s been the biggest difference. The pace in each of the segments is so different and I’m finding that really mind-blowing and incredibly dynamic.”

What’s the best thing that you’ve learned about Salesforce that you didn’t know before you joined?

ZB “Oh so many things. I am blown away by the responsibility that Salesforce takes for enabling customers to be self-sufficient and successful. The whole Trailblazer programme that Salesforce runs the mentality of making sure that customers are adequately skilled and able to really get the value out of the solution sets I think has really opened my eyes. The other thing that I didn’t really count on was the heartbeat that comes from HQ. I think it is really quite strong and I’m learning so much from that. I thought we would be an outpost but everybody’s so integrated. It’s a large company yet it feels very intimate and accessible.”

How challenging has it been coming into this role during a global pandemic?

ZB “It’s a good question and of course during my first few weeks I couldn’t go and meet anyone so I did all my first meetings and customer engagements remotely. In those first couple of weeks I felt like I didn’t fully understand the context of my role in relation to everybody else. Even though I had the title you live your role by how you interact with others and how people respond to you. I could not get that sense for the first couple of weeks.

“However what really jumped out of the screen was just how alive the culture was. People were reaching out to me and I was given a really warm welcome. My onboarding was unbelievably world class. I’m a structured person but this was on another level.”

In Salesforce the mission is absolutely focussed on customer success and value and good things come from that if you focus on the greatest need.”

It hasn’t always been a priority for Salesforce has it? The investment in the UK and Ireland is fairly recent and hasn’t been a priority market until recently.

ZB “I think it’s always been an important market but the new commitment and allocation of investment is quite significant. There are lots of traditional measures that we’ll have to measure our success but I think there are three key metrics.

“Firstly customer success and that’s my number one priority. We are supporting our customers through their digitisation challenges and helping fuel the economic recovery. I think if we can do that successfully and I can see that we’re delivering the value then that is my first and actually my most important measure of success.

“The second thing is upholding and expanding the Salesforce culture. It is such a unique environment with innovation and purpose at the heart of everything it does. So upholding that ensuring that we have the right impact both internally and externally is something that I take very seriously as a priority.

“The third thing is something that is actually keeping me quite awake and that is the skilling of people that we need to do within UK and Ireland. The Salesforce ecosystem will create 143000 new jobs by 2024. You look at that and you think ‘wow that’s really amazing’. But the question is ‘who’s going to fill those jobs?’ We’re not short of people we’re short of skills and I don’t think Salesforce is unique in that. We’ve got this amazing platform called Trailhead. It’s a free platform that allows people to skill themselves and get certified. Upskilling reskilling and making sure we have the talent pipeline to fulfil our objectives is a key focus for us.”

And finally what milestones have you set yourself to measure your own performance?

ZB “As a Salesforce CEO because the chain is quite clear if we’re able to make our customers successful Salesforce will be successful. And if Salesforce is successful then personally I’m successful and my teams are successful. In my opinion that is the correct chain. In Salesforce the mission is absolutely focussed on customer success and value and good things come from that if you focus on the greatest need.

“It is the one thing I talk to customers about the most – focus on the greatest need. Solve that problem and then move to the next greatest need. It’s a common thread through my career. Every career stage or client environment I was in there was always a big need somewhere. It was either recovery get this delivered by tomorrow or sell more. If I focussed on that then the success would follow. That is the key to unlocking customer value and that is the single biggest focus for me my teams and Salesforce.”

So what did I learn from my time with Z and what are my big takeaways?

There is no doubt that Zahra is a competent gracious and technically-minded leader. In terms of her personality and character I can see the fit with Salesforce working hand in glove. She is a strong advocate for many of the values that Salesforce has been built on and the entrepreneurial environment will allow her to flourish to full potential.

The skills shortage is a concern but the main challenge will be to carve out an identity for Salesforce in the region. Salesforce is a very American company and although there is nothing wrong with that the new UK&I CEO will need to find a way to put her own stamp on this market and bring the Salesforce brand to life for UK customers.

I have no doubt that Zahra will succeed. As I said earlier she brings something to a leadership role that very few manage to execute – a combination of authenticity knowledge empathy modesty and purpose. Her relaxed personality should not be confused with being easy going or lax – but who doesn’t want to have fun while they are saving the world? Watch this space for great things from Salesforce in the UK and Ireland…

The main thing that fuelled my drive influenced my progression and set me apart was the influence of my parents”

A bit about Salesforce

So what do we need to know about Salesforce? Well pretty much everyone recognises Salesforce as a CRM vendor – that’s customer relationship management – and companies of all shapes and sizes use their products and services to manage sales opportunities and marketing activities. Unlike most other proprietary software vendors the Salesforce offering cuts across geographies industries and size of customer and boasts more than 150000 customers worldwide.

Salesforce was one of the original cloud companies set up by Marc Benioff and a small cohort of software engineers in February 1999. The firm’s base of operations was a one bedroom apartment in San Francisco and was launched with the aim of becoming ‘a world-class internet company for sales force automation’ or to bring about ‘the end of software’ depending on whether you reference Benioff’s original marketing statement or the one currently on the SFDC web site.

Salesforce.com (SFDC) business model was truly revolutionary. The proprietary software industry had been selling business applications as locally hosted products for more than 50 years but Benioff et al conceived a better way to deploy and manage business technology by extending the concept of application service providers to a fully remote provision of applications as a service.

From the outset Benioff and the other co-founders believed in an obligation to develop a company built on principles”

Not only was the technical deployment of these applications a radical shift from the norm so too was the pricing model. Benioff believed that subscription billing which goes up as customers use more and down if they use less was a far more equitable way to charge for services. Allied to this avant-garde approach to products and pricing SFDC was one of the first companies to be born out of purpose. From the outset Benioff and the other co-founders believed in an obligation to develop a company built on principles – what we call today corporate social responsibility. The founders wrote their V2MOM (Vision Values Methods Obstacles and Measures) strategic plan in late 1999 and was designed to provide employees with a clear vision for the business and align the organisation around common goals. In true start-up fashion the original draft was written on the back of an envelope and even today V2MOM remains at the core of how SFDC runs its business and continues to guide the decisions they make.

Salesforce is the number one CRM worldwide and its focus on industry specific solutions will only solidify its position as the benchmark. It currently offers 12 vertical clouds that provide purpose-built functionality data models and processes all designed by industry experts. It ranks as number one on the new Cloud Wars Industry Cloud top 10 list and boasts an impressive industry cloud run rate of more than $2bn some way ahead of its nearest rivals: Google Oracle SAP and Infor. In 2020 Salesforce significantly expanded its industry-specific product portfolio acquiring Vlocity and adding four more industry products in media communications energy & utilities as well as new public sector solutions.

Our view is that Salesforce will become more dominant and relevant in the near-term as it offers something that very few other software vendors can – differentiation. No enterprise can carve out a niche through core ERP applications – one finance module is the same as the next and core ERP (other than equally vertical-specific offerings) are soon to become commoditised solutions which add very little in the way of contrast. Salesforce on the other hand operates in a space where organisations can differentiate themselves by building unique relationships delivering personalised services and driving sales with both new and existing customers. As businesses rebound from the last 18 months the emphasis on growing sales maintaining customer relationships and delivering unique and personalised services will intensify. Creating seamless experiences and developing new and innovative ways to attract and retain customers will be the number one priority for enterprise leaders and Salesforce is uniquely positioned to capitalise on that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vc3BpZmYtcGl0Y2gtZGVjay00Ni1taWxsaW9uLWxpZ2h0c3BlZWQtdmVudHVyZS1wYXJ0bmVycy1zYWxlc2ZvcmNlLTIwMjEtNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spiff Raises $46 Million From Lightspeed Venture Partners Salesforce,"The sales commission software startup Spiff announced a $46 million Series B round on June 1.

Spiff CEO Jeron Paul is a serial founder who previously struggled with calculating sales commissions.

The tool aims to replace Excel which finance teams often otherwise use.

Jeron Paul is a successful serial founder:

Between 2003 and 2017 he founded and sold three startups for undisclosed amounts: communication portal Boardlink valuation firm Scalar and equity management startup Capshare.

While running Capshare he hit on the problem that would become the foundation for his latest venture.

The issue? How difficult it was to get salespeople paid out on their commissions which are a crucial part of their compensation. Employees relied on Microsoft Excel to track payouts but it was complicated to calculate because the percentage of the commissions could vary.

Twitter was then entertaining acquisition offers from the likes of Disney and Salesforce. To those of us in the campaign it seemed wrong that a platform of such personal and political importance attracting such love-hate devotion from its users was really just a commodity to be bought and sold. The tech press covered our campaign but mostly dismissed it as quixotic. We presented our proposal at Twitter’s annual meeting and it won only a few percentage points of the shareholder vote.

Yet soon after in 2018 Uber and Airbnb wrote letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission proposing what sounded eerily like what we had asked Twitter: to be allowed to grant company equity to their users—their drivers and hosts respectively. Regardless of whether they are (or should be) regarded by law as employees contractors or customers these are people the platforms rely on and who rely on the platforms in turn. Somehow what seemed impossibly utopian in 2017 was now the corporate strategy of the biggest gig platforms. Without much fanfare user ownership was quietly emerging as an industry trend.

Airbnb’s letter made the reasoning plain: “The increased alignment of incentives between sharing economy companies and participants would benefit both.” Platforms could get more loyalty from users who might otherwise come and go on a whim. Equity awards meanwhile could cut users into the benefits of company ownership which are usually reserved for elite employees or people who already have wealth to invest.

We are not inclined to trust these companies which have long had ambivalent relationships with the public good. But it is true that more widespread ownership in the platform economy could be game-changing. In Fulfillment Alec MacGillis’s sweeping new book on how Amazon has reshaped America he cites former US labor secretary Robert Reich’s observation that if Amazon were one-quarter owned by its workers as Sears once was an average warehouse worker in 2020 could have held more than $400000 in stock.

Equity grants might also include control rights over corporate strategy. For social media platforms for instance user-owners could demand limits on the use of their personal data more control over what appears in their feeds and a voice in shaping content moderation policies. Think of Facebook’s Oversight Board but with members elected by users and more meaningful power.

The SEC did not immediately grant the request from Airbnb and Uber to issue equity to users so each company proceeded with workarounds. Uber issued cash grants to loyal drivers with an option to buy stock in its 2019 public offering. Airbnb whose pandemic refunds hurt many hosts announced two forms of phantom ownership before going public in 2020: an “endowment” of company stock for payouts to hosts and a host advisory board to inform company decisions. It seems the companies were serious. And the SEC seems to be coming around; late last year the commission proposed allowing gig companies to pay up to 15 percent of compensation in equity.

As the behemoth platforms have been working out their equity-sharing schemes we have been studying and supporting a parallel movement: A new wave of early-stage startups that are trying to include co-ownership in their plans from the outset. Some are “platform cooperatives” like New York City’s new driver-owned ride-hailing service the Drivers Cooperative and Kinfolk a consumer co-op that features Black-owned brands. Instead of the dramatic returns that aspiring “unicorn” companies promise to wealthy investors these “zebra” startups prioritize benefits for marginalized communities. Others like the software-developer gig platform Gitcoin are using blockchain technology to share ownership through cryptographic tokens rather than old-fashioned stock.

Tech investors normally expect startups to achieve one of two kinds of “exit” IPO or acquisition. What if platform companies could instead work toward an eventual “exit to community”? What if co-ownership were what long-term users expect? Rather than the swarming chaos of the GameStop craze this approach could foster real loyalty accountability and shared wealth.

In a new article for the Georgetown Law Technology Review we have detailed several pathways for how “exit to community” could work. These strategies build on longstanding examples from the electric co-ops that power much of rural America to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan that serves around 14 million US workers today. We also explore newer possibilities raised by decentralized social media and blockchain technology.",,,,,,
SBAC,SBA Communications,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtaXN1bi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8yMC9jZWxsLXRvd2VyLXBhbmVsLWZhaWx1cmUtcmV2aXZlcy1zYWZldHktY29uY2VybnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cell tower panel failure revives safety concerns,"BRADENTON BEACH – An exterior panel fell off the cell tower in Bradenton Beach on June 15 and the tower again requires repairs and panel upgrades.

Erected in 2015 and located on property leased from the city of Bradenton Beach the cell tower is privately owned and operated by SBA Communications.

The latest panel failure again raises concerns for city officials and Bradenton Beach Marina President Mike Bazzy. On Tuesday June 15 Bazzy addressed his concerns in a letter sent to Mayor John Chappie and others. The letter contained photos of the recent and previous panel failures.

“I need your help. Today a panel of the cell phone tower fell off the structure and landed on my property. The panel landed approximately 100 feet northeast of the tower. It landed on a walkway in the boatyard. Fortunately no person was hit by the panel as it fell” Bazzy’s letter said.

“The panels are 12 feet long and 4 feet wide. That is 50% larger than a sheet of plywood. And these objects are falling from a great height. If a panel falls from the tower and strikes a person it will result in severe injury or death. This cell tower is a clear safety hazard to persons and property in the vicinity. We have had several near misses over the years. How long will we continue to accept this hazard?” Bazzy wrote.

Bazzy’s letter noted that in April 2015 a tower panel fell and landed on the Public Works property. Later that month another panel fell and landed in front of the marina office. In September 2017 four panels fell off of the tower – one landed on a boat in the marina boatyard another landed on Bazzy’s southern property line and two more landed on Church Avenue. Another past incident resulted in a tower panel landing on the roof of the Public Works building and another resulted in a panel landing on a nearby home.

Bazzy’s letter acknowledged the city doesn’t own the cell tower and is not responsible for its construction or maintenance and that SBA carries its own liability insurance and SBA’s agreement with the city includes hold harmless language that relieves the city of liability.

“If we keep ignoring the danger the cell tower presents to residents pedestrians vehicles and other property we are going to have a tragic accident on our hands at some point in the future. Please take steps to stop this from happening again and please take strong measures to force the cell phone tower company to improve public safety” Bazzy requested in his letter.

Commission discussion

The city commission discussed Bazzy’s concerns on Thursday June 17.

City Attorney Ricinda Perry said she Chappie and Public Works Director Tom Woodard already met with SBA representative Ray Bryant to discuss this ongoing safety hazard. According to Perry they were told hurricane tape and additional clips would be placed on the tower panels as a temporary measure.

“To which we said ‘You’ve had over six incidents with this. Is this you spitballing an idea or is this you consulting with an engineer and coming up with an actual solution to the problem?’ ” Perry said.

She noted a similar cell tower was constructed in Anna Maria around the same time and that tower is not experiencing panel failures. She said the Bradenton Beach tower is located in an area with significant pedestrian traffic parking tram stops the Public Works building and the marina.

“This is unacceptable. It cannot happen again” she said.

Perry said SBA plans to use a drone to examine the tower and have an engineer analyze the panels and installation methods.

“An engineer’s going to have to sign off on this. We can’t put up with these little fixes anymore” Chappie said.

“It’s dangerous” Commissioner Jake Spooner added.

Commissioner Ralph Cole said the tower components need to withstand the salt-air environment.

“There’s really no excuse for those things to fall off” he said.

Regarding the latest failure Woodard said “I can look at that panel and it’s been taped back together. It’s not right.”

Woodard requested the panel that broke loose not be reattached to the tower. Woodard said another SBA representative told him the past two panel failures were the result of “installer error” and that could have caused the latest failure too.

Perry noted the cell tower panels are supposed to be all the same color and they are not. She said SBA is willing to make that happen.

When contacted later in the week Woodard said he was told the tower will be equipped with white panels that will be secured with the same security bands installed on the Anna Maria tower in 2018 after that tower’s panel failure. Woodard expects it will be a couple of months before the repairs are completed.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I hope he doesn’t become one of those fathers.

Most fathers take a laidback minimalist approach. But a few are overly competitive about being cool outshining mom or presenting a perfect-parent image to their peers. (“Yeah I’m keeping up with the Joneses — using my Army surplus helicopter-parent helicopter. Run Joneses run!”)

Whether they feel disrespected (Americans spend only half as much on Father’s Day as on Mother’s Day) or view a “World’s Greatest Dad” mug with the attitude “I’m not accepting anything unless I earn it” they tend to be alarmingly overachieving.

Surely they’re not just wrangling for luxury Father’s Day gifts. For instance the $700 vacuum that uses a green laser to “detect all the bits of dust you might otherwise leave behind.” How does such prissiness wind up in the same sentence with “Father’s Day”? The vacuum should have an attachment to detect all the microscopic shards of the dads’ manhood that they’ve left behind! Real dads simply need a sensor that lets them know when a mass of dirty gym socks will no longer fit through the door.

Overly competitive dads even try to rig the game of “baby’s first word.” They cajole the infants with promises such as “Say ‘da-da’ instead of ‘ma-ma’ and good ol’ noncustodial Dad will say ‘Trophy wife learn to lactate.’ ”

These showoff fathers tell their offspring things like “The good news is I’ve secretly finished your new treehouse. The better news is I’m sure you’ll have no trouble making new friends at the school closest to Sequoia National Park.”

They fib “I’ve always wanted to measure the equator with my necktie collection…”

Aggressive patriarchs crave every ounce of credit they’re due. They confide in their kiddos “Don’t tell your mother but I’ve been funneling money to the North Pole so Saint Nick can afford your gifts even with his gambling habit. True the Tooth Fairy is self-funding; but remember it’s Daddy who stands guard to make sure the little perv doesn’t confiscate any still-attached teeth.”

You know a dad is trying extra hard when he beams “Someday all of this will be yours” and he’s not referring to something that will require buying out Sherwin-Williams putting a mechanic’s triplets through college or forcing Goodwill to take the junk at gunpoint.

Attention-hogging fathers are only too glad to explain “the facts of life” as long as they can mix in a few other lessons. (“OK the birds and the bees. First stand your ground with the intruder at the door. Then the bees will pollinate the flowers on his grave and the birds will decorate the monument…”)

Fathers need to acknowledge the passage of time. It’s OK to give piggyback rides to your children and their friends but when you reach the point of your heir whining “Daaad we’d rather call an Uber to take us to the Drake concert” it’s probably time to taper off.

Experts warn it’s a social faux pas when you try to turn your daughter’s moment in the spotlight into the mixed martial arts father-daughter dance.

Just love your kids dads. Spend time with them. Although…throwing in that bonus kidney could make the boxes of marching band candy sell better than the Girl Scout cookies that Helen in Accounting is trying to unload…

ICICI is among India’s leading private sector banks with strong presences in insurance asset management securities brokerage services and private equity. ICICI Bank states in marketing materials that it operates in 15 countries.

ICICI STACK for Corporates is “a comprehensive set of digital banking solutions for corporates and their entire ecosystem including promoters group companies employees dealers vendors and all other stakeholders” the news release from the bank announcing the new offerings states. “The wide range of 360-degree solutions enables corporates to seamlessly meet all banking requirements of their ecosystem in an expeditious and frictionless manner.”

Simultaneously ICICI announced it will operate branches dedicated to corporate services. Five new branches are in Mumbai and three in other areas. Four more are coming in the short-term according to bank.

The company stated in the announcement that the “four main pillars” of the new offerings are: digital banking products for businesses; digital banking products for channel partners and venders; digital banking products for employees; and tailored services for directors and other leaders.

ICICI’s offering lands in a banking sector many experts think has done more to help innovations benefit consumers than it has corporate clients. ICICI Bank’s new offerings are set up specifically for industries including: financial services IT/ITES pharmaceuticals and steel according to the recent announcement.

“When you look at retail banking there have been a couple of newcomers in the market in recent years who come in with shiny new apps” Frank Dux managing director of CoCoNet told PYMNTS for an article published in December 2020. “So far corporate banking users are always left out in the cold.”

The long-held assumption among many bankers has been that they are unlikely to lose corporate customers because of the headaches that come with switching financial institutions — but Dux said that’s beginning to change.

Vishakha Mulye executive director of ICICI Bank said in a prepared statement: “In an increasingly competitive and dynamic environment with rapid digital transformation impacting every industry corporates look towards a banking partner which can offer the breadth and depth of solutions for the entire ecosystem. With an objective to cater to the ecosystem of every corporate we have launched a digital ‘ICICI Stack for Corporates’ with many industry-first features. It offers banking solutions to corporates with backward and forward integration for their entire network of employees dealers vendors and all other stakeholders. We look forward to partnering with our customers for the banking needs of their entire ecosystem and unlock the full potential.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Kylie Jenner And Travis Scott Get Close On The Red Carpet In Nyc

Make-up guru Kylie Jenner cosied up to Travis Scott in a romantic snap as she celebrated and honoured the rapper on Father's Day

Kylie Jenner shared a romantic snap with Travis Scott to mark Father's Day.

The 23-year-old make-up mogul uploaded a snap with the rapper and their daughter Stormi three as she gushed over how ""blessed"" they are to have him in their lives.

Kylie and Travis - who have reportedly rekindled their romance after packing on the PDA at a charity event - cosied up to each other in the image with the businesswoman staring at the hunk affectionately.

The rumoured couple appeared to be enjoying a lavish boat ride together with the idyllic blue sea peeking through in the background.

Toddler Stormi's attention was elsewhere as she held onto the glass side for safety while her dad Travis clutched onto her.

In awe of her baby daddy Kylie penned: ""Happy father's day @travisscott"" she wrote. ""One day isn't enough to honor the dad you are. We are so blessed to have you..""

It comes after the couple were spotted together at a major event in recent days.

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star and Travis had a high profile romance back in 2017.

The star couple split in September 2019 – but have been surrounded in speculation of secret reconciliations and subsequent splits ever since.

But earlier this week the pair gave the strongest hint that they have officially reignited their romance after two years apart as they arrived to celebrate Travis at a charity event in New York.

According to an eye witness Kylie and Travis looked much more like lovers than supportive exes with reports now saying they engaged in public displays of affection at the event.

A source told People magazine: ""Travis and Kylie were being very sweet and cute together.

""They were holding hands and seemed fully back on.""

Travis himself will have added fuel to the fire of speculation that he and billionaire Kylie are back together – as he referred to her as “wifey” at the event.

Billboard claims that during his acceptance speech he declared: “Stormi I love you. And wifey I love you.”

While we have seen most of them before royal fans are in for a treat as the mum-of-three posted an extra snap that hasn’t previously been shared with the public.

The snap sees Prince William 39 standing on the steps of Kensington Palace holding their youngest son Louis three while George seven and Charlotte six stand at his feet.

The photo is believed to have been taken at Trooping the Colour in 2019 as the Duke of Cambridge is dressed in his military regalia from that day.

It is unclear whether Kate snapped the photo herself but as a keen photographer it is likely that she would have stepped behind the camera to capture the sweet image.

Alongside the new snap Kate also shared a throwback photo of a young William with Prince Harry with their dad Prince Charles in the grounds of Balmoral as children.

In a third snap Kate 39 can be seen with her own father Michael Middleton as he walked her down the aisle on her wedding day in 2011.

And the fourth and final snap shared was another taken by Kate herself of the Queen and Prince Philip and their great-grandchildren at Balmoral Castle which was originally released shortly after the Duke of Edinburgh’s death in April.

Georgia Power has the only nuclear plant under construction in the United States which I call “Georgia’s Shame.” It is shameful that the timeline the utility provided to regulators investors and the public – those of us paying for this plant – is now six years behind schedule. And it is shameful that the utility’s cost estimates for this plant were off by a shocking 100%: The original cost estimate for the two new units was $14 billion and 2021 costs are near or at $30 billion.

Patty Durand

This is federal level money spent in one state on one power plant.

And what are we getting for all this money? These units will produce a relatively small 2100 megawatts of electricity annually. Georgia regulators allowed Georgia Power to pursue an energy solution that is nine times more expensive than necessary. The pursuit of Plant Vogtle over the past 12 years happened at a time when renewables are at record low prices and natural gas is four times cheaper than nuclear.

When all is said and done Georgians are likely to be paying the highest electric bills in the country and we are already between fifth and eighth place in the U.S. for high bills according to different rankings.

Georgia Power and the Georgia Public Service Commission like to say that electric rates are 15% below the national average but that’s not true. Given that Georgia is the sixth-cheapest state in the United States and the cost of living in Georgia is 20% below the national average the fact that rates are no longer below the national average and will rise more sharply still due to Plant Vogtle impacts should concern everybody.

When Plant Vogtle is complete Georgia customers are likely to be paying the highest electric bills in the country rising from between 5th and 8th place in the U.S. for high bills according to different rankings. Credit: eia.gov/electricity/generatorcosts/archive/2017/

Furthermore customers pay bills not rates. Georgians’ bills continue to ratchet up relative to the rest of the country. And that was before Plant Vogtle the most expensive power plant ever built on earth.

Why has the PSC allowed the most expensive power plant ever built on earth to happen here a state in the bottom 10 in terms of wealth and income? And can anything be done about it now?

Before we answer that let’s set the table:

The PSC a state agency with five commissioners elected by voters has given Georgia Power a dream boat of profits for 12 years including the following:

A blank check on construction costs. There is no limit to how expensive this project can go;

Authorization to put Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) into rates. This means that Georgia Power customers are paying in advance for Vogtle costs prior to delivery of any electricity. If you move or die you or your family paid for something you never received;

A financial scheme that allows Georgia Power to profit handsomely from project delays. So far Georgia Power has earned over $6 billion just from the delays of their own project.

Now that we understand the setting here are three steps that should be taken if we are to prevent this from happening again. And it will happen again unless we act to stop it because why not? Building expensive things is how Georgia Power makes the most profit. These are the three steps:

Disallow Georgia Power from placing all nuclear construction costs onto our bills and share rate increases more fully between customer classes.

When the first new nuclear unit comes online likely sometime in 2022 construction costs will be placed into rates though not equally among customer classes. The majority of costs will go to residential rates. The Georgia PSC has the choice of putting 100% of these costs into rates none of the costs into rates or a portion into rates and the commission can decide how much those costs are spread between customer classes;

Voters should punish commissioners for allowing this to take place by ejecting them from their seats.

Every Georgia election includes at least one and sometimes two PSC commissioners. There are always competitors making promises to reduce our power bills. You can be sure that no one is worse for keeping rates affordable than any commissioner already in that seat. They should not be rewarded with re-election. Vote them out.

The Georgia Legislature should fully fund a separate Consumer Utility Counsel (CUC).

Most states including Georgia in the past have a separate office mandated to protect consumers. For decades the CUC a division of the Governor’s Office of Consumer Protection represented Georgians in cases before the PSC. However the CUC was defunded in 2008 during the Great Recession. Although the state is flush with tax revenues and has passed tax cuts several times since then including $140 million in cuts just this year this division was never restored.

In 2009 Georgia Power and the nuclear industry promised a new day. Because of streamlined changes in the licensing of nuclear plants new unit designs and the advent of modular construction Georgia Power said it would deliver Vogtle units Nos. 3 and 4 “on-budget and on-time.” Yet here we are again in the same place as we were when Plant Vogtle unit Nos. 1 and 2 went vastly overbudget.

This outcome was absolutely foreseeable. It is especially egregious in the Southeast where more than $50 billion in failed nuclear power plants dot the landscape and damage the wallets of citizens in one of the lowest-income areas in the country.

Georgia Power is a monopoly granted by the people of Georgia through their state Legislature. In exchange for having no competition and a guaranteed profit the utility agrees to serve the public interest with regulatory oversite. Going forward perhaps it is time to examine how a competitive market will better serve the public interest.

Some do it to commit terrorism. Some seek cheap thrills. Others extort companies into paying millions of dollars in ransom.

Eric Silagy president and CEO of Florida Power & Light acknowledges that threats of cyberattacks against FPL and other critical suppliers are likely to last “forever.”

But he says FPL’s 5.6 million customers should be confident that the utility is making every effort it can — including subjecting the company’s employees to surprise cyberattack drills — to prevent breaches that could shut down its power grid.

Recent attacks on a critical oil pipeline in the Southeast a meat processing company in Colorado and even a small city-owned water system in Pinellas County have exposed the nation’s vulnerabilities to foreign hackers prompting Congress the president and corporate leaders to announce expensive high-level initiatives to protect electric utilities across the country.

While FPL and other large utilities have built strong defenses against web-based intrusions experts warn that their connections to smaller municipal-owned or cooperative utilities that can’t devote comparable resources to defending themselves could pose a risk to large companies’ grids.

Silagy says his company has long treated the potential of a web-based attack as a serious threat. He acknowledged that connections with small less-protected utilities are a risk but he says any disruption would be minimal.

“We have a dedicated team of people that are involved with this that are cyber experts that we have hired from … mostly the federal government. These are NSA and CIA and some special operatives that come out of the military. We have a lot of IT specialists. We actually have a cyber-defense operations center that monitors everything 24 hours a day seven days a week.”

Silagy says he’s confident in the company’s ability to prevent hackers from accessing the utility’s control system. And if one gets through Silagy says the company can prevent any breach from cascading across its grid and shutting down power across its service area which stretches from Pensacola to South Florida.

Silagy answered questions about FPL’s cyber defenses in a June 1 discussion with the South Florida Sun Sentinel editorial board that covered a wide range of topics. FPL officials asked that specific aspects of the company’s strategies not be revealed to the public saying that even seemingly innocuous details could be valuable to criminals seeking to take control of the utility’s grid.

“The threat is very real and it’s serious” FPL spokesman Christopher McGrath said.

Nation wakes up to potential for disaster

The severity of threats facing the nation’s utility grid is not a secret however.

In April the Biden administration launched a coordinated effort to enhance the cybersecurity of electric utilities’ control systems by working with utilities “to implement measures or technology that enhance their detection mitigation and forensic capabilities.” The effort will be coordinated across several federal agencies including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Department of Energy.

Announcing the effort Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said: “The United States faces a well-documented and increasing cyber threat from malicious actors seeking to disrupt the electricity that Americans rely on to power our homes and businesses. It’s up to both government and industry to prevent possible harms.”

Tom Fanning CEO of Southern Company an Atlanta-based regional electricity and gas provider told a gathering of the Edison Electric Institute trade group on June 10 that utilities must start working together to ensure each can recover from a massive blackout that could shut down power to entire regions of the country according to a report by the industry trade website Utility Dive.

His remarks came on the same day that the House Energy and Commerce Committee advanced four bipartisan bills aimed at shoring up the nation’s energy cybersecurity through enhanced public-private partnerships.

A major part of the effort Fanning said would involve enlisting the U.S. Department of Defense FBI Secret Service and Cyber Command to “impose costs” for hackers. “We want to make sure the bad guys understand there will be consequences for messing with us” he said.

Security requires constant vigilance

Web-based criminals are not going to stop trying to breach the nation’s power supply anytime soon Silagy said. “We should be very honest with ourselves and say cyber is going to be an ongoing issue forever. And you have some very sophisticated state-sponsored folks engaged in foul play in the cyber area and there always are attempts to wreak some havoc.”

FPL’s email system he said receives an average of 120 million emails a month most of which are filtered out as common spam. To combat those that elude FPL’s spam filters the utility engages in extensive training exercises that involve deliberately sending phishing emails to find out which employees will click on types of links that could provide criminals a pathway into FPL’s network.

While modern technology can enhance FPL’s operations “some of it creates new doors and entry points if you’re not careful” Silagy said. “Before we deploy any new technology one of the very first things we do is we have to design in security measures to make sure that can stay secure when it’s deployed in the field.”

Cyber drills involving utility employees are taken as seriously as FPL takes its annual hurricane preparedness drills he said.

They involve conducting exercises “where our business units and our leaders don’t know what’s going to happen” he said. “Because I want to test people’s reactions. I want to understand their decision-making — what they do how they do it why they do it. And do they make decisions that actually thwart it isolate it kill it or help it spread? And I’d much rather learn those hard lessons in a drill than in the real thing.”

Large utilities such as FPL are more likely than smaller ones to have strong defenses against web-based attacks a report by Moody’s Investors Services concluded in November after studying responses of 115 utilities that took part in a survey. Smaller not-for-profit municipal-owned and cooperative electric companies by contrast are less likely to invest in the personnel and technology needed to maintain robust defenses and are more likely to rely on insurance policies to cover any damage caused by an attack Moody’s said.

A 2019 Wall Street Journal investigation found that Russian hackers were able to find back doors into some utilities’ industrial control systems in 2016 by targeting obscure contractors and subcontractors that work with the utilities. Those companies the paper said had little reason to think of themselves as targets and thus were more likely to click on email attachments that installed malware onto their computers.

That malware installed code that wormed its way past utilities’ firewalls and into poorly secured “jump boxes” connecting corporate networks to otherwise walled-off control systems. The effort targeted at least 60 utilities in 24 states managed to breach two dozen and reached industrial control systems of at least eight utilities the Journal reported.

Smaller utilities most vulnerable

Smaller utilities often lack staffing to focus on cybersecurity said Lee Simonovich vice president and global head of industrial cyber and digital security at Siemens Energy AG in a story published by E&E News in February. City-owned utilities or small electric cooperatives might have just one cybersecurity specialist in their organizations he said and a breach at a small utility could provide a pathway into a larger system.

FPL is connected to numerous small utilities throughout Florida. It has a transmission line that feeds power at peak times to customers of Gainesville Regional Utilities. It shares ownership of a Georgia coal-fired generating unit with JEA a community owned utility that serves 417000 electric customers in the Jacksonville area. And it sells electricity at wholesale prices to numerous city-owned utilities or non-profit cooperatives throughout the state.

A JEA spokeswoman contacted for this story said the utility has a “layered defense security program” conducts “ongoing training to improve our cybersecurity posture” and continually monitors external cybersecurity intelligence sources and takes appropriate measures to block known threats.

Silagy said that he couldn’t say with certainty that FPL’s grid would not be affected if a smaller utility is compromised in a cyberattack.

“But I feel pretty certain that it would be isolated” he said. “It’s a hypothetical that is hard to answer because I don’t know what the level of attack is or what it isn’t but I don’t rely on Gainesville or Jacksonville to keep the lights on. If they lost their whole system it wouldn’t cause a problem for us being able to keep our lights on.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsdG9vbmFtaXJyb3IuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wNi9ncm93aW5nLXVwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Growing up | News Sports Jobs,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.altoonamirror.com/news/local-business/2021/06/growing-up/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsdG9vbmFtaXJyb3IuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wNi9ncm93aW5nLXVwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjNy5jb20vZ3JhZHVhdGlvbi1jbGFzcy1vZi0yMDIxLXNvY2FsLWZhbWlseS1tdWx0aXBsZS1ncmFkdWF0ZXMvMTA4MDk0NzYv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmM3LmNvbS9hbXAvZ3JhZHVhdGlvbi1jbGFzcy1vZi0yMDIxLXNvY2FsLWZhbWlseS1tdWx0aXBsZS1ncmFkdWF0ZXMvMTA4MDk0NzYv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 women in same Southern California family graduate in the same year,"7 members of same Southern California family graduate in the same year

Iran’s sole nuclear power plant was temporarily shutdown because of a “technical fault” and it will take days before it is operational again.

“Following a technical fault at Bushehr power plant and after a one-day notice to the energy ministry the plant was temporarily shut down and taken off the power grid” Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said on its website early Monday.

Iran’s national electricity company in a statement on Sunday called on Iranians to minimise consumption during peak hours because of a “predicted rise in temperature” and “limitations in power generation due to ongoing repairs at [the] Bushehr plant”.

The company said the repairs may continue until the end of the week which is Friday in Iran.

An official from the state electric energy company Gholamali Rakhshanimehr said on a talk show on state-run TV that the Bushehr plant shutdown began on Saturday and would last “for three to four days”.

He added power outages could result. He did not elaborate further but this is the first time Iran has reported an emergency shutdown of the plant located in the southern port city of Bushehr.

It went online in 2011 with help from Russia. Iran is required to send spent fuel rods from the reactor back to Russia as a nuclear nonproliferation measure.

In March nuclear official Mahmoud Jafari said the plant could stop working since Iran cannot procure parts and equipment for it from Russia due to banking sanctions imposed by the United States in 2018.

Bushehr is fuelled by uranium produced in Russia not Iran and is monitored by the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

The UN agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reported shutdown.

Abas Aslani a senior researcher at the Tehran-based Center for Middle East Strategic Studies told Al Jazeera the shutdown could be a blow to an Iranian power supply already strained by cryptocurrency mining.

“This [shutdown] is more important in terms of the power outage than the nuclear aspect of the facility” Aslani said.

“Because these days we are seeing the cryptocurrency mining is consuming electricity in the country and this has caused some power outages in the past.”

Construction on Bushehr on the coast of the northern reaches of the Gulf began under Iran’s shah in the mid-1970s.

After the 1979 Islamic Revolution the plant was repeatedly targeted in the Iran-Iraq war. Russia later completed the construction of the facility.

The plant which sits near active fault lines and was built to withstand powerful quakes has been periodically shaken by temblors. There have been no significant earthquakes reported in the area in recent days."

That was the overarching theme of Southwest's party on Friday although the official messaging certainly didn't mention that.

Fifty years since Southwest used a loophole in then-heavily regulated airline industry to launch a low-cost carrier in wholly within Texas — something that arguably help it make one of the biggest contributions of any U.S. carrier toward lower fares and the related the democratization of air travel that's come since.

One year since a novel coronavirus led the globe to shut down creating the gravest existential threat in the history of the airline industry — a sector grimly familiar with existential threats.

Southwest surely had been planning its 50th birthday for years dreaming up ways to celebrate its employees its passengers its planes and the cheeky ""love"" motif that still informs the airline's stock ticker symbol.

And then the pandemic happened. Like every other airline in the United States and across the world Southwest saw demand drop to unimaginable levels — worse than what happened in the aftermath of 9/11 or the 2008 financial crash. Plans changed.

Then the vaccine came and distribution picked up and the U.S. was able to largely reopen — safely. Over three months travel boomed pent up demand surged with a vengeance and the national mood changed. A celebration was back on the table.

Was the event Southwest threw on Friday the same as what it would have had SARS-CoV-2 never made its way around the world? Maybe. Probably not. It's hard to tell and Southwest's event planners and PR staff were not inclined to discuss their best-laid plans.

What happened instead only barely overshadowed by the operational challenges earlier this week when a third-party computer system failed was a celebration of a half-century of risk-taking of accessibility of travel and in line with the official messaging of freedom.

TPG was exclusively invited to attend the celebration on Friday. In addition to interviews with leading airline executives — stay tuned for those — we were able to attend the employee event which included a recounting of the last 50 years a celebration of what is to come in the next 50 employee gifts the unveiling of a special sort-of related livery and more. Here's what happened at the event.

A Live and Live-Streamed Party

In normal times Southwest holds annual employee rallies at bases and stations around the country. Local employees get lucky and can attend without too much effort and others — the gung-ho Southwest crew — will use vacation time and employee flight benefits to attend the party.

For obvious reasons Southwest skipped the rally in 2020.

This year the rally was back and bigger than ever timed to 50 years to the day from when Southwest Airlines made its first commercial flight.

Held in a relatively new maintenance hangar at Houston Hobby Airport the event was open to employees who won a lottery to attend.

It was a 90-minute program (which ran a few minutes over) featuring presentations from executives photos and videos pulled from Southwest's extensive archives (the uniforms of the 1970s were famously wild) jokes giveaways previews of future projects and innovations and panels with employees who've been with the airline for the full half-century.

""I don't know I probably could count them on one hand"" one of the airline's first employees said in a video panel with CEO Gary Kelly answering the question ""how many people were on your first flight?""

Emceed by Whitney Eichinger Southwest's managing director of culture and engagement and Markus Lloyd a public speaker who has co-hosted a handful past employee rallies it was a fun event with a handful of surprises.

For one there was the 50000 Rapid Rewards points that Southwest announced it would gift to every employee. Sure non-rev travel benefits are great but that perk usually requires flying standby and hoping for an open seat. With the points employees can book confirmed travel with no need to wait until the last minute.

A few employees also won flight discounts hidden in the swag bags every attendee got along with the branded mask hand sanitizer lanyard and drink koozie.

Then there was the special livery which brought the crowd to its feet for a standing ovation and photos. An airplane wrapped in an American flag (aside from the tail which retained Southwest's signature yellow red and blue) the ""Freedom One"" plane was meant as a tribute to the nearly 8000 of Southwest's 56000 employees who serve or have served in the armed forces.

As a link to the airline's birthday: the theme of freedom. Honoring the employees and others who have fought for Americans' freedom and with 50 stars for the 50 states paying tribute to 50 years of the ""freedom of travel"" that came about as air travel was made relatively affordable for most.

The link may have been a bit tenuous. But judging by the standing ovation — the only other of which was given when CEO Gary Kelly took the stage — the link was solid enough and hit the right note based on the reaction from the ramp workers taking photos of the plane and conversations with employees at the event.

Southwest has certainly had its share of labor disputes — like any airline — but this was clearly a day for celebration.

As the event wrapped attendees headed outside into the Houston heat where they could celebrate and party with food trucks temporary bars and a concert with the backdrop of the Herbert D. Kelleher commemorative plane a Boeing 737-700 painted in Southwest's original colors.

An emotional and exclusive flight

Southwest took to the skies for the first time on June 18 1971 flying one of its four Boeing 737-200 jets from Dallas Love Field (DAL) to Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH) and then on to San Antonio (SAT).

On Friday it flew the first leg of that trip in tribute but in reverse. And from a different airport.

Hey a lot can change in 50 years. Although Southwest again flies to Intercontinential now known as George Bush Intercontinental Airport the airline operates into both Houston airports and maintains a major operating base at Houston Hobby (HOU).

After unveiling the Freedom One plane at Houston Hobby and breaking a few ceremonial bottles of champagne the airline pushed the plane out of the hangar to prepare it for the first passenger flight in its new paint.

The jet was to fly just under 45 minutes to Dallas Love Field Southwest's headquarters where the 50th birthday celebration would be extended to a few lucky passengers who happened to be passing through that day.

Southwest's 737-800 seats up to 175 passengers. This charter flight had about 50. Among them were CEO Kelly President Tom Nealon board members PR and marketing staffers the livery's designer and a small gaggle of in-house photographers -- and a crew made up entirely of Southwest employees who have served in the military.

There was a brief wait on a taxiway — an air traffic control delay at Dallas our pilot said. ""If you know anyone at air traffic control give them a call and ask them to get us in"" he joked. ""Actually don't your phones should be in airplane mode by now.""

The delay was short and we were airborne quickly.

It was a charter flight not a normal commercial one so not all of the normal rules applied.

(Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy)

Plenty still did however including safety presentations and prohibitions against passengers bringing their own alcohol on board and drinking it.

But this was a special occasion and airline leadership wanted to mark it with a toast. The flight attendants passed out the champagne and Kelly walked to the front of the cabin where another flight attendant helped him activate the public address system.

(Notably Southwest is not currently offering alcohol on its commercial flights due to an increase in unruly passengers).

""It is an absolute miracle that we are here today celebrating the way that we are"" Kelly said. ""More than any other year it really just hit home to me how important our people are. And so I just want to toast not just to you all not just to the folks who've been here in the past but it's all about the future.""

(Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy)

""We're going forward"" he added. ""And so let's get the right people let's hang on to them let's empower them and let's get them to fly us to the next level. I love you guys here's to you"" Kelly said before toasting and sipping.

A flight attendant the one who had passed out the champagne came on the PA system with a heartfelt recollection of her time in the military training recruits who were heading to Iraq.

""I'd sing this at the end of training and it applies today"" she said before performing an emotional rendition of ""I Believe I Can Fly.""

Just a few minutes later we dipped below 15000 feet on our descent and the captain came on to remind us that yes we had to follow the standard safety rules meaning it was time to take our seats and fasten our seatbelts.

The flight was supposed to approach DAL by way of a new navigational point named ""HERBZ"" by the FAA in honor of Southwest founder Herb Kelleher. But for reasons that were not quite clear the flight did not take that exact approach. But the nav point just a few miles away lives on as a tribute to the man who helped found and helm Southwest through its revolutionary early days.

After the jet bridge was extended and the aircraft door was open Kelly and a few others departed for the office while the rest of the passengers had a few minutes to don high-vis vests and head down to the ramp where we had a chance to see the plane again take photos and explore.

But in classic Southwest fashion the aircraft would not be idle for long; It was already entering revenue service scheduled to depart for Tulsa Okla. (TUL) just a few hours later — a bit longer than a typical Southwest turn but still a fast launch back into normal service. The catering trucks were already pulling up to load the jet with provisions for its next leg.

Birthday Presents for Customers

It was a fun event for the employees in attendance — at least judging the audience reactions and the few I had a chance to chat with. But as many presenters said throughout the day the employees are only half of what makes the airline run. The other half: customers.

So it was only fitting for the celebration to be extended to them or at least a lucky few who happened to be in the right place at the right time.

(Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy)

We walked over to baggage claim where the airline had cordoned off a belt and loaded it up with prizes in the form of wrapped presents.

(Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy)

Everyone passing through — no matter where they were coming from or heading — was invited to head through the stanchions and claim a gift.

(Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy)

Passengers clearly had no idea what was going on but were happy to participate. Announcements over the PA and signs around the baggage claim area helped explain it.

The gift boxes contained a variety of prizes ranging from airline swag to a full free vacation package. In the first few minutes passengers left with beach towels lunch boxes and more.

The event continued for more than an hour until all the gifts were gone.

Celebrating the past moving toward the future

Throughout the event even while celebrating the legacy Southwest has built an eye was continuously cast toward the future.

The United States is continuing to emerge from the pandemic lockdown with vaccination rates nearing herd immunity levels in some states and CDC guidelines implicitly endorsing a reopening.

Travel demand is booming with domestic and regional leisure demand topping pre-pandemic levels and business travel starting to return sooner than even the most bullish travel executives and analysts have predicted.

The road to recovery is not expected to be linear however. A normal seasonal dip in leisure demand is expected this fall with business travel likely not yet recovered enough to make up for the reduction in vacationers.

Still the airline industry is in a better position than it could have hoped to be a year ago. For Southwest which managed — by the skin of its teeth — to emerge from the crisis without layoffs or furloughs it seems an appropriate time to reflect on the value of its employees over the last half-century — while looking forward to the next one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlmbi5uZXdzL3Bvc3RzL3NvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTUwdGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines celebrates 50th anniversary,"On 18th June 2021 Southwest Airlines celebrated the 50th anniversary of its first flight with a celebratory event and a unique livery on one of its planes.

History

Dallas based Southwest Airlines is the worlds largest low cost carrier operating a fleet consisting solely of Boeing 737 family aircraft. The airline’s first flight took place on 18th June 1971 and operated between Dallas Love Field and Houston International. At the time the airline operated three Boeing 737-200 of which it would go on to have owned 64 by the time that variant was fully retired in 2005.

Southwest has also historically operated the -300 and -500 models of the 737. At present it operates both the 737 NG (-700 and -800 models) and MAX family of aircraft of which 67 MAX 8 airframes have been delivered so far. The first MAX 7 is due to be delivered in early 2022.

The carrier is one of Boeing’s most loyal customers having never operated anything other than a Boeing aircraft. Whilst Southwest Airlines has always operated the Boeing 737 it hasn’t been exclusive. For a seven year period between 1978 and 1985 it operated five Boeing 727 trijet aircraft; all of which were leased from Braniff International Airlines but sported Southwest’s traditional ‘desert gold’ livery.

50th Anniversary Celebration

To commemorate the milestone the airline held an event where it announced each Southwest Airlines Employee would receive 50000 Rapid Reward points (from the airline’s frequent flyer program). It also revealed a special livery on one of its aircraft (Boeing 737-800 – N500WN) named ‘Freedom One’ featuring a stylised depiction of the US flag adorned over the fuselage and engines with the tail retaining the standard Southwest design.

Southwest Airlines has a number of special State flag based liveries on its 737-700s each pertaining to a US State served by the airline and named after the corresponding state ie. California One Florida One and Lone Star One for its home state of Texas.

Starbucks' Pink Drink Reveals Some Differences,"Summertime calls for plenty of cool refreshing beverages. Although an icy cold brew from Dunkin’ or Starbucks is probably one of your go-to picks sometimes you aren’t in the mood for coffee-based sips. Enter smooth iced coconut milk refreshers which blend fruity tropical vibes with caffeine. There are similar options at Starbucks and Dunkin so if you’re unsure which drink you want to choose you may want to know how Dunkin’s Coconut Refresher versus Starbucks’ Pink Drink compares with ingredients caffeine price and flavor.

While Starbucks’ Pink Drink has been around since 2017 — and before that as a secret menu recipe — Dunkin’s Coconut Refresher made its debut in late April 2021. The different offerings have quite a few things in common firstly Coconut Refreshers and the Pink Drink come in totally Instagram-worthy colors. The odds are you’re not drinking a beverage based on its appearance but it does liven up your feed which is always fun. The second most obvious thing in common is the use of non-dairy coconut milk. Lastly they all contain some caffeine to give you a boost. However the surface-value similarities aren’t enough to make your decision between the sips.

If you’re on the fence about which drink to get on your next coffee shop run here’s how Dunkin’s Coconut Refresher and Starbucks’ Pink Drink compare.

Ingredients Inside Dunkin’s Coconut Refresher is a blend of coconut milk flavored fruit concentrate and B vitamins. The Boston-based chain’s OG Refreshers feature similar ingredients but use green tea instead of coconut milk. In comparison Starbucks’ Pink Drink combines its strawberry açai base with accents of passionfruit coconut milk and freeze-dried strawberries.

Caffeine The caffeine content between the two offerings doesn’t vary by much. Per Dunkin’ its Coconut Refresher has a green tea extract in the flavor concentrate which provides caffeine. A small Coconut Refresher delivers 46 milligrams of caffeine while there are 68 milligrams in a medium and 91 milligrams of caffeine in a large. Starbucks’ Pink Drink uses a green coffee extract in its strawberry açai base. When you sip on a Tall Starbucks’ Pink Drink you’ll get 35 milligrams of caffeine. Additionally a 16-ounce Grande provides 45 milligrams a Venti contains 70 milligrams of caffeine and a Trenta has 90 milligrams.

Price Courtesy of Dunkin' Grabbing a Coconut Refresher at Dunkin’ is slightly cheaper than a Starbucks Pink Drink. A small refresher will cost you $2.99 while a medium sells for $3.29. Lastly a large is $3.59. If you buy a medium Coconut Refresher in any flavor through May 25 you’ll get it for $3. A Starbucks Pink Drink costs $4.05 for a Tall $4.45 for a Grande and $5.05 for a Venti. You can also get a Trenta for $5.45. It’s important to note that pricing typically varies by location so you may want to check your Starbucks mobile app or your Dunkin’ app for cost near you.

Flavor Starbucks Dunkin’s Coconut Refresher comes in three flavor options — Pink Strawberry Golden Peach and Purple Pomegranate. Pink Strawberry combines strawberry and dragon fruit and is probably the closest to Starbucks’ Pink Drink flavor. Meanwhile the Golden Peach offering combines peach and passionfruit and Purple Pomegranate blends blueberry and pomegranate notes. Meanwhile Starbucks’ Pink Drink blends strawberry açaí and passionfruit flavors with coconut.

While there aren’t too many differences between Dunkin’s Coconut Refresher and Starbucks’ Pink Drink knowing where they’re similar and where they’re different can help you choose based on your preferences.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zdGFyYnVja3Mtc2VydmluZy1lbWVyZ2luZy1nbG9iYWwtZGVtYW5kLTEyMjg0NTUzNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks Serving the Re-emerging Global Demand for Coffee,"As world economies roar back to life and people return to work the demand for coffee is expected to follow. The Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) is well poised to continue capturing this market as it is emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic well ahead of its competitors in regards to cash flow and a loyal customer base. (See SBUX stock chart on TipRanks)

Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners published a report on the matter optimistically stating that he expects a “massive uptick in growth” driven by reemerging post-pandemic demand and strong business trends. Factors he highlighted included Starbucks' innovative digital investments impressive penetration into the Chinese market and a successful new loyalty rewards program.

Feinseth reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and assigned a price target of $130 suggesting a possible upside of 18.51%.

The five-star analyst wrote that Starbucks has recently made updates to its customer experience by including app and kiosk-based ordering platforms to its stores. In the background the company has streamlined inventory and supply chain processes with machine learning and predictive intelligence.

Feinseth was quick to note that Starbucks has maintained consistent dividend growth since it started paying dividends in 2010. He expects the company to make share repurchases in the future. In turn that would push the stock price upward.

Additionally Starbucks has successfully penetrated the Chinese market for coffee aided by a nascent middle class and millennial-based demand. This was a particularly impressive achievement as China’s culture had and does revolve around tea. At the moment Starbucks has 1000 stores in 15 different cities across the world’s most-populous country.

In the U.S. encouraging growth has been identified as of late. Feinseth wrote that “Q2 same-store sales in the U.S. increased 9% highlighting a full post-pandemic sales recovery.” He expects more store openings and further investments in technology for its customers. One such improvement is the Stars for Everyone loyalty rewards program which has swelled membership to record numbers and expanded the company’s extremely devoted customer base.

On TipRanks SBUX has an analyst rating consensus of Moderate Buy based on 15 Buy and 8 Hold ratings. The average analyst Starbucks price target is $125.38 reflecting a potential 12-month upside of 14.29% from Friday’s closing share price of $109.70.

Might the fact that corporate investors snapped up 15 percent of U.S. homes for sale in the first quarter of this year have something to do with it? The Wall Street Journal reported in April that an investment firm won a bidding war to purchase an entire neighborhood worth of single-family homes in Conroe Texas—part of a cycle of stories drumming up panic over Wall Street’s increasing stake in residential real estate. Then came the backlash as cool-headed analysts reassured us that big investors like BlackRock remain insignificant players in the housing market compared with regular old American families.

The truth is between the two: We can panic and acknowledge Wall Street’s small role at the same time. Although the number of houses being purchased by mega-investors is currently not enough to move the market in most parts of the country these firms’ underlying structural advantage is profound and growing.

Let’s focus on Invitation Homes a $21 billion publicly traded company that was spun off from Blackstone the world’s largest private equity company in 2017. Invitation Homes operates in 16 cities with the biggest concentration in Atlanta where it owns 12556 houses. (Though that’s not much compared with the 80000 homes sold in Atlanta each year Invitation Homes bought 90 percent of the homes for sale in some ZIP codes in Atlanta in the early 2010s.) While normal people typically pay a mortgage interest rate between 2 percent and 4 percent these days Invitation Homes can borrow money for far less: It’s getting billion-dollar loans at interest rates around 1.4 percent. In practice this means that Invitation Homes can afford to tack on an extra $5000 to $20000 to the purchase price of every home while getting the house at the same actual cost as a typical homeowner. While Invitation Homes uses a mixture of debt and cash from renters to buy houses its offers are almost always all cash which is a big leg up in a competitive market.

One way to think about Invitation Homes’ business strategy is to consider the value of the properties the firm is buying relative to the rents they charge. According to a recent SEC disclosure Invitation Homes’ portfolio of homes is worth of total of $16 billion (after renovations) and the company collects about $1.9 billion in rent per year. That means it takes only about eight years of rental payments to pay back a typical house that Invitation Homes has bought. The usual rule of thumb for evaluating a fair sale price says Kundan Kishor professor of economics at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee “is that price to rent ratios are around 20 to 1.” When price-to-rent ratios are very high it makes more sense for consumers to rent than to buy and when they are low it makes more sense to buy than to rent. That Invitation Homes is getting deals twice as good as a typical homebuyer shows that it’s not just buying any homes: It’s buying the specific houses with the greatest potential to be wealth-building for the middle class.

It’s not exactly accurate that investors are “buying every single-family house they can find” as some have suggested. If that were true their market share in the United States wouldn’t be a piddling 15 percent. They’re really buying up the stock of relatively inexpensive single-family homes built since the 1970s in growing metro areas. They mostly ignore bigger and more expensive houses especially ones that are move-in ready: Wealthy boomers and the nation’s finance and tech bros nab those properties. And they’re also ignoring cities with stable or shrinking populations like Providence and Pittsburgh.

But investors are depleting the inventory of the precise houses that might otherwise be obtainable for younger working- and middle-class households in the cities where those workers can easily find good-paying jobs like Atlanta (22 percent of home purchases according to Redfin data) Charlotte (22 percent) and Phoenix (20 percent). More importantly they’re able to scour those markets scientifically and systematically to make cash offers on the most attractively priced properties. While normal people buy houses when they actually need to move somewhere (savvy) investors buy houses several years before a bunch of people need to move to an area. Whether they’re tracking where major employers are building new offices or looking at public school enrollment data being ahead of the market gives big firms a big leg up.

And in case you were assuming that converting houses to rentals would flood the market and bring down rents don’t get your hopes up: As Invitation Homes tells its investors “We operate in markets with strong demand drivers high barriers to entry and high rent growth potential.”

While renting might make sense for some people especially people who move a lot it often sucks particularly in the United States where we don’t have especially strong protections for tenants. The business strategy of the country’s biggest landlords Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent does not seem to be “Make renting with us so delightful that if my tenants have to move cities they’ll specifically seek out another property owned by our company.” Based on reports from Reuters the New York Times and the Atlantic it appears to be closer to “Squeeze our tenants for every penny avoid making repairs let black mold and raw sewage accumulate and count on the fact that moving is a huge expensive hassle.”

Our current system of encouraging homeownership is by no means perfect and it places a lot of unnecessary risk onto the “balance sheets” of the middle class but it’s worked out financially for most of the people who have been lucky enough to own a home. The implicit and explicit subsidies the government has given to Americans buying their first homes have been the biggest handout the American middle class has ever received (a handout notably denied to Black Americans for much of the 20th century one explanation for the current size of the racial wealth gap).

Laurie Goodman vice president of housing finance policy at the Urban Institute points out that policymakers could take steps to level the playing field between investors and the rest of us. She told me that buyers who need to borrow money using Federal Housing Administration loans or those who need a rehab loan for a fixer-upper have a particularly tough time competing against Wall Street firms. FHA paperwork often gets delayed slowing down the purchase process so home sellers often don’t want to sell to FHA buyers even if their bids are competitive. That’s a solvable problem. And loans for properties that need renovations Goodman says are both cumbersome and expensive. Rethinking the processes for FHA and rehab loans could “put individuals on a more equal footing” she explained.

If you don’t want all of America’s land and housing to end up in the portfolios of the 1 percent there’s ultimately one very simple solution: Tax the rich. After all the companies buying the houses are ultimately owned by people (or in some cases universities and churches which are their own cans of tax-advantaged rich-people worms). At the same time that the working-class is going hungry rich people are doing so outstandingly well that they are running out of easy places to park their cash which is why they’re buying 2000 square-foot houses in the Phoenix suburbs via their ownership stakes in these funds.

This is all part of a long-standing trend: As inequality in the United States increases the financial elite invests less in the types of things that could create jobs like R&D or new factories and more into directly extracting wealth from the working class. One way to do that? Becoming their landlords.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW9ha2xhbmRwcmVzcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8xOS9zdC1tYXJ5cy1jb21wbGV0ZXMtcmVjb3JkLXNlYXNvbi13aXRoLTktMC13aW4taW4tZGl2aXNpb24tMi1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtMy_SAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVvYWtsYW5kcHJlc3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMTkvc3QtbWFyeXMtY29tcGxldGVzLXJlY29yZC1zZWFzb24td2l0aC05LTAtd2luLWluLWRpdmlzaW9uLTItY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLTMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Mary’s completes record season with 9-0 win in Division 2 championship,"EAST LANSING – Since the start of the 2021 baseball season the eventual Division 2 state champion seemed academic.

Orchard Lake St. Mary’s entered the start of the season the consensus No. 1 team. The Eaglets would leave the season that way on Saturday with a 9-0 win over Stevensville Lakeshore in the Division 2 state final at McLane Stadium.

“It’s the best way to end it with a state championship” OLSM senior starting pitcher Tommy Allman said. “I’m proud of my team. We battled all year and pulled it off.”

The win ends the St. Mary’s season with 43 wins which ties the all-time MHSAA record for wins in a season with four other teams most recently being Ann Arbor Gabriel Richard in 2010.

The Eaglets suffered just one loss on the year 2-1 to Saline back on April 30 but coach Matt Petry believes that was a loss the team may have needed.

“The kids are talented and they work hard. They wanted this day and they went through a one-game lull there against Saline. I think that was the best thing for us” Petry said. “Losing a game in the middle of the season we didn’t get overconfident had to refocus after that then came back and got the job done.”

The Eaglets found themselves in a pitching battle early on as Allman and Lakeshore starter Noah Chase each retired nine of the first 10 batters they faced for a scoreless tie after three innings.

St. Mary’s senior shortstop Alex Mooney seemed to turn the tide in the game to start the bottom of the fourth when he rocketed a foul ball that went to the left field wall.

Chase didn’t seem to be the same after that. Mooney would go on to walk which started a six-run rally for the Eaglets.

“I knew I was just seeing the ball well and that pitch kind of showed it” Mooney said of his foul ball. “I managed to get the walk and steal second and that seemed to get the momentum going for our team. I think with baseball once one person sees a barrel then they just keep on coming. Our guys just rode the momentum and made a lot of good swings.”

Those swings would come in the form of back-to-back two-run doubles from junior Nolan Schubart and sophomore Ryan McKay to make it 4-0. Junior Jake Dresselhouse would add a RBI single and Mooney would go on to bring in a run on his second at-bat of the inning.

“I thought we had some good swings early. We did a good job of putting the barrel on the ball and then they started falling there (in the fourth)” Petry said of the offensive outburst.

The Eaglets would threaten to end the game in the bottom of the sixth scoring three more runs while stranding the potential game-ending run. Mooney would drive in two of the runs with a single in his final at-bat as an Eaglet.

“I was swinging out of my shoes the first two at-bats so I shortened up in the last at-bat to make sure I got a hit” Mooney said. “It was pretty cool to end it with a hit.”

Allman took the mound in the top of the seventh and recorded the first out but Petry decided to pull him after just 75 pitches in order to get fellow senior Jake Keaser on the mound.

“The plan was to split the game amongst three guys and Tommy was throwing so well that we didn’t do that” Petry said. “When I went out there I was like ‘hey I wrestled with this decision to let you finish it or giving you the ovation you deserve. I chose the ovation.’ He came off and got a great ovation.”

Keaser retired the next two Lakeshore batters in order on six pitches giving St. Mary’s a successful title defense from its 2019 championship and its fifth title in program history.

Allman allowed just two hits in his start striking out seven without walking a batter. He finishes the season 11-0 on the mound.

“Heck of a performance by Tommy Allman. That was awesome” Petry said.

The Eaglets amassed some records during the win stealing a total of 12 bases as a team which topped the previous finals record of nine set by Colon back in 1989.

Both Alex Mooney and Ryan Mooney each stole three bases which ties the individual MHSAA finals record that had been matched seven previous times.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEvMDYvMTkvNC1sb2NhbC10ZWFtcy1jb21wZXRlLWNsYXNzLWFhLXN0YXRlLXRyYWNrLWFuZC1maWVsZC1maW5hbHMvNzc1NTUzNzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 local teams compete at Class AA state track and field finals,"4 local teams compete at Class AA state track and field finals

The original story continues below.





###







Although Samsung hasn't explicitly said that the foldable flagship has been discontinued that appears to be the case given that the company's website is encouraging shoppers to consider other options. The Galaxy Z Flip 5G is still available. Z Fold 2's listing has also vanished from T-Mobile and the device is out of stock on Verizon’s website.

Katie Thurston is already a pro at fending off suitors who aren’t here for the right reasons but now she can add MLB pitcher to her resume.

The Bachelorette star 30 threw out the first pitch during the Seattle Mariners home game at T-Mobile Park on Friday June 18 wearing a custom jersey with her name on the back. “Shoutout to @mariners for having me tonight!” she wrote via Instagram alongside a video of her walking to the mound. “Thanks for joining us!” the Mariners team account replied in a comment on the post.

After her pitch a batboy for the team presented the Washington native with a rose. She also posed for photos with Mariner Moose the baseball team’s mascot. She may have given her home team some good luck too because they ended up winning 5-1 vs. the Tampa Bay Rays.

In an Instagram Story the reality star revealed that Mariners pitcher Justin Dunn and first baseman Evan White gave her the ball she threw decorated with a sticky note. “Hope you enjoy the game!” they wrote. “Huge fan. Thank you for exposing the queen.”

The MLB players were seemingly referring to Victoria Larson who starred alongside Thurston on Matt James’ season of The Bachelor and claimed that her profession was “queen.” The bank marketing manager memorably spoke out against Larson’s behavior in the house.

“I feel like a lot of the girls going on were careful about what they said or they wanted to present themselves well and like I just wanted to have fun” Larson 28 said in April during an episode of the “Not Skinny Not Fat” podcast addressing the backlash against her. “Like it’s a show. I wasn’t taking it seriously.”

Kit Keenan who also appeared on season 25 of The Bachelor praised her former castmate’s pitching performance in an Instagram comment. “OMG cutie” she wrote.

Thurston also earned a compliment from Kaitlyn Bristowe who served as a guest host with Tayshia Adams for her season of The Bachelorette. “CUTE” the “Off the Vine” host 36 wrote.

Season 17 of the show premiered earlier this month but filming wrapped on April 26. Since returning home Thurston has obviously stayed quiet about how the finale will play out but has been teasing fans via social media.

“I’m looking for a mature man who can handle himself understand what he signed up for which is you’re sharing a girlfriend right now and do the best that they can” she told Us Weekly ahead of the June 7 premiere. “If the thought of being engaged scares you then you’re not ready to be with me.”

It’s a slightly upgraded version of the 4G-only 2021-edition Moto G Stylus (I’m sorry that’s really how these phones are named).

The Stylus 5G includes a few more hardware upgrades in addition to 5G connectivity including a bigger battery more storage and RAM (256GB and 6GB on the version I tested respectively) and a newer Snapdragon 480 processor. There’s a new stylus-friendly GIF creator mode which is fun. Fun is good! But it more or less feels like the same phone: the rear camera array is identical with the exception of a different macro sensor its 6.8-inch screen is the same and overall dimensions are similar.

This puts the G Stylus 5G in a kind of awkward spot. At $399 it sits between the $279 G Stylus and the $1000 Galaxy Note 20 (the next step up if you want a stylus with your phone) but it doesn’t go far enough to clearly offer more than the budget-friendlier version. Performance and battery life are a bit better but these aren’t really weak spots for the 4G version.

Not a significant upgrade over the 4G-only version $399 at Motorola$350 at Best Buy How we rate and review products

Having 5G is nice too but the value is diminished when you consider that the G Stylus 5G is only guaranteed two years of security updates. That’s about when 5G in the US will start getting good so most of us can get away with a 4G device for the next couple of years.

It all adds up to a good phone without a compelling case to recommend it.

The phone’s 1080p LCD panel lacks the nice contrast of an OLED.

Moto G Stylus 5G screen and performance

The G Stylus 5G is a big phone — big with a capital B. Its 6.8-inch display is about as large as they come at least until all of our phones start folding and expanding into weird little Transformer-style tablets. It’s a 1080p LCD panel that’s just fine — lacking the nice contrast of OLEDs but still usable in bright daylight conditions.

Battery life is very good thanks to a large 5000mAh cell. Using it on Wi-Fi I’ve gotten four hours of screen-on time out of it and it’s only down to 36 percent. You could certainly get two days’ worth of use out of it — including relatively heavy use on cellular data — and even a full day of very demanding use seems reasonable.

For $400 you really should get more than a couple of years of support for your device

Performance is good too; jumping between apps is quick and smooth and heavier tasks like zooming in and out of Google Maps shows only a bit of stuttering. There’s minimal but noticeable shutter lag in the camera app which feels like a problem this phone shouldn’t have but not enough to ruin anyone’s day.

The G Stylus 5G ships with Android 11 and will only be supported with one major OS platform update and two years of security updates. That’s an unfortunately short lifespan especially considering that Samsung’s Galaxy A-series phones are now guaranteed four years of security updates. For $400 you really should get more than a couple of years of support for your device.

The phone’s stylus features are basic but make it easier to do things like add handwriting to an Instagram story post.

A couple of side notes on the Stylus 5G’s 5G connectivity: at launch it will work on Verizon and T-Mobile’s 5G networks but will operate as 4G-only on AT&T. Motorola says AT&T 5G support will be available “in the coming months.” It’s not compatible with any of the networks’ mmWave 5G (the super fast hard-to-find variety) but that’s not a big loss. More importantly it will work with the C-band 5G frequencies Verizon and AT&T will start using at the end of the year.

The Stylus 5G’s stylus features are basic but adequate. The capacitive stylus is spring-loaded into the phone’s lower right corner and automatically brings up a quick menu of options when you remove it. If you’re on the lock screen you can jot down a note without having to unlock the device which is handy. You won’t find productivity features or neat tricks like wireless control a la the Note series but rather some handy shortcuts to grab a GIF or doodle on a screenshot. They’re useful and fair for the price.

There are standard wide ultrawide macro and depth cameras on the Stylus 5G’s rear panel.

Moto G Stylus 5G camera

The Stylus 5G offers three rear cameras — a 48-megapixel f/1.7 standard wide 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide and a 5-megapixel macro — along with a 2-megapixel depth sensor and 16-megapixel selfie camera. The 4G G Stylus has a 2-megapixel macro camera but that’s the only difference between them.

Much like the 4G version the Stylus 5G takes good photos in abundant light with a surprising level of detail thanks to the way it processes 48-megapixel images into 12-megapixel files. The ultrawide camera is nice to have though its images can be a little noisier in challenging lighting conditions and the macro camera is still underwhelming despite the modest resolution boost.

The main camera is prone to some drastic color shifts with even slightly different compositions of the same scene and subject — in one shot my orange cat is orange and in the next one taken at a slightly different position he suddenly looks blue. This happens more frequently in mixed lighting conditions which many cameras will struggle with but it popped up just often enough in my testing to annoy me.

The Moto G Stylus 5G doesn’t quite do enough to stand out.

The 4G-only G Stylus is a good deal for $279 and there’s nothing really wrong with the $399 G Stylus 5G but it’s harder to justify its higher cost. With only a couple of years of security updates guaranteed this phone will only see the beginning of truly good 5G in the US. It’s a nice step-up option if you’re inclined toward a stylus phone and the Note isn’t in your budget but for most people I’d recommend either sticking with the 4G-only model for a couple of years or looking into a 5G phone with a little more longevity.

Stylus enthusiasts on a budget have a good option in the Moto G Stylus 5G

If you’re more interested in the big screen and battery than the stylus you could save quite a bit and go with the Moto G Power (2021). Its processor isn’t as good and you miss out on the ultrawide camera but if you want to cover the basics for a couple of years it will do.

On the other hand if you can afford to spend a little more and you do want to get more than a few years out of your phone the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G is a great pick. It has a big lovely screen 5G and comes with a generous support policy. Stylus enthusiasts on a budget have a good option in the Moto G Stylus 5G but most others could do better elsewhere.

This isn’t the sly hand jive from a third-base coach. This is a wolf whistle from Jim Carrey in “The Mask.” If we blushed easily around here we’d be positively pink-cheeked.

It turns out A’s president Dave Kaval likes us really likes us as a possible new home for the team. He’s scheduled to make his second trip to Las Vegas in a month to send that message of affection. He’s practically a local.

He’s expressed enthusiasm about the community the obvious flash and 40 million-plus visitors and its emergence as a smashing success with the NHL’s Golden Knights and presumably the NFL’s Raiders along with other professional franchises. In short Las Vegas is a real prospect – not that we needed the Oakland A’s to tell us that.

The Vegas valentine comes at a time the A’s are negotiating with Oakland officials for a sparkling new waterfront stadium to replace the community’s crumbling Coliseum where the team has played since 1968. I don’t want to call the place dilapidated but at the Coliseum having a “waterfront ballpark” means another sewer pipe has backed up and the place has flooded again. Like a veterinarian trying to put the family dog down Kaval has said the Coliseum “is at the end of its useful life.”

Frankly I really liked the video Kaval posted on Twitter May 24 during a Golden Knights game at T-Mobile Arena during the Stanley Cup playoffs. The press ate it up and passed along the message he intended to send.

Not surprisingly the A’s fascination with Las Vegas has baseball fans in both cities buzzing. Like hornets in Oakland like unabashed fanboys in these parts. It all serves the interests of Kaval & Co. as they rattle the bats ahead of an Oakland City Council to decide the future of the sprawling Howard Terminal stadium and waterfront development plan in late July.

Just for the sake of a fan’s argument let’s consider the possibilities. The Howard Terminal project at approximately $1 billion would be the centerpiece of what’s advertised as a $12 billion privately funded development with $450 million in community benefits. The idea has been germinating since 2018 with a goal of opening as early as 2023. Now even a fast-tracked approval might not result in a new ballpark and waterfront stroll until at least 2027 according to published reports.

If that sounds too good to be true there are reasons for that. The proposal is already being picked to pieces by well-sourced skeptics who cackle about the need for the public to pump $855 million in infrastructure improvements into the care-worn industrial district. That’s a lot for any city in the post-COVID economy and Oakland has a lot of other areas of need. As the fieldofschemes.com website so wickedly put it “Misdirection is the cornerstone of all successful magic.”

Sleight of hand is something Las Vegas knows plenty about as it tries to get back on its feet following the pandemic. We’ve already watched millions in hotel room tax dollars diverted into the $1.9 billion Allegiant Stadium. Not to mention the substantial investment it took to create and support the Las Vegas Ballpark for the A’s-affiliated Las Vegas Aviators of the Pacific Coast League.

But Las Vegas is a burgeoning big-league market that raises the stakes just by being itself and it’s never taken much to fire up the welcome wagon here. Anyone looking to gin up support for the next billion-dollar shiny object in Las Vegas will find plenty of enablers.

Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman recently suggested the team should consider Cashman Field north of downtown which is interesting considering its location was among the reasons given for moving across town and building the sparkling new Las Vegas Ballpark.

It makes zero sense to move all the way from the Bay Area just to relocate into a marginal neighborhood but give Goodman credit for trying. When you lead a city that finds itself with two minor-league baseball stadiums you take your shots where you find them.

As they were intended Kaval’s signals have been picked up by Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf who may be a big baseball fan but clearly can also read a balance sheet. Back in April her spokesperson Justin Berton a veritable prince of understatement plucked a balanced note: ""The City is willing to bring to bear its resources to help make this vision a reality; however today’s proposal from the A’s appears to request public investment at the high end for projects of this type nationwide.""

In other words the pitch was just a bit outside.

Serious students of this game will start taking the A’s Las Vegas roadshow seriously when Aviators Executive Director Don Logan and Director of Business Development and former County Commissioner Larry Brown play a role in the discussion. Their encyclopedic knowledge of baseball and the community would add instant credibility to all the rhetorical magic.

Short of that sports fans try to wait until after the Oakland City Council’s July meeting before lining up for tickets to the first Las Vegas A’s game.

But it left me a wide-open opportunity to pick whatever chords would work with the melody and her spare accompaniment on the dulcimer. That was great fun for me. James Taylor and Joni Mitchell recording vocals for another major 1971 release: Carole King’s “Tapestry.” The engineer was Henry Lewy an old colleague of Joni’s. He was the person on the other side of the glass and if we were pitching he was catching. His ear was really important and he really had us keep it simple. Some of the songs had some percussion but basically it was two or three instruments and Joni’s voice: very few elements clouding it up. It’s a minimal kind of accompaniment that you want just to give you a sense of the song harmonically and then you can really focus on her voice and her attitude and all of those things that make this such a great Joni Mitchell album.

Rosanne Cash (musician) James Taylor’s guitar playing in those tracks he’s on — it’s got a weird sound to it. If you were recording an acoustic guitar today you would go “Well that’s too bright and it’s got no reverb or resonance on it. Let’s soften it up. Let’s make it a little darker warmer sounding.” And yet it was exactly right for what she was singing and it cut through in this way that was definitive and yet didn’t overwhelm her. And if you hear that guitar sound right now without hearing anything else you would go “Oh that’s from ‘Blue.’” She produced it herself. There weren’t women producers then. And she didn’t try a lot of different musical arrangements. So it was very singular. There are few albums that change your life. “Blue” came out when I had just turned 16 and it came at this fulcrum of going out of childhood — feeling all the passion of what I wanted to do with my life and the urgency and the fear and everything and then “Blue.” This is a weird thing to be a revelation given my childhood and my family but I understood for the first time that a woman could be a songwriter. She just laid it out in these almost journalistic lines that were still so poetic so dark and I thought “That’s what I want to do.” I probably would not be a songwriter had it not been for “Blue.”

Brandi Carlile (musician) When I was in my early 20s T Bone Burnett tried to play “Blue” for me. This is something I’ve since talked to Joni about many times and she thinks it’s hilarious. It got to the lyric “I want to talk to you I want to shampoo you” and I was so averse. I was like “Ugh turn it off that is the most sappy feminine …” At the time toughness was really important to me. I wanted to have a wide gait and electric guitar and scream and yell. For years anytime anyone asked me about Joni I would say “Yeah I’m not much of a fan.” Then I met my wife who is a Joni Mitchell mega fan. We were driving up in northern Michigan and we brought albums to play for each other. She was playing “Blue.” And I was laughing about the lyric and she got upset and insulted by that and she wanted me to go deeper and understand what it was that I was so averse to. I was like “It’s just silly it’s not tough it doesn’t mean anything.” And she was like “Do you know what ‘Little Green’ is about?” She told me and played me the album and didn’t talk to me for like two hours. She made me take all that in. It was really profound for me. Because not only was I totally falling in love properly for the first time I was having to re-evaluate what I thought “feminine” meant. And that being tough is being vulnerable and expressing yourself even things that are really hard to say.

Arlo Parks (musician) What I love so much about this song is that it is full of contradiction and conflict. There’s a real sense of exploring what it means to be present and alive in a moment. The first time I heard it I misheard that line that goes “I want to be strong I want to laugh along.” I actually heard it as “I want to laugh alone.” And for some reason this song took on the meaning to me of wanting to be free and wanting to be in love and wanting to belong to somebody. And there’s the detail in the second verse: “I want to talk to you I want to shampoo you.” That’s just such a funny sweet reference to caring about someone in the most specific ways. There’s this whole arc this whole story line — the idea of a mutually destructive relationship: “Do you see how you hurt me baby/So I hurt you too/Then we both get so blue.” There’s something about the guitar that feels like an animal just running around. I think it weirdly mirrors the way she sings “Traveling traveling traveling traveling.” It feels like she was trying to hold onto something or keep up with something and she’s journeying within herself. Her melodies are often so meandering and free and explore different parts of her range. There’s a playfulness and a real confidence and a strength to the way that she sings. Although there are moments of fragility she always seems very sure of herself.

Danielle Haim (musician Haim) [Sings] “When I think of your kisses my mind seesaws …”

Este Haim (musician Haim) I always thought it was “my mind sees stars” like in cartoons when they get knocked unconscious and there’s stars going around their head. Danielle actually corrected me.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Might the fact that corporate investors snapped up 15 percent of U.S. homes for sale in the first quarter of this year have something to do with it? The Wall Street Journal reported in April that an investment firm won a bidding war to purchase an entire neighborhood worth of single-family homes in Conroe Texas—part of a cycle of stories drumming up panic over Wall Street’s increasing stake in residential real estate. Then came the backlash as cool-headed analysts reassured us that big investors like BlackRock remain insignificant players in the housing market compared with regular old American families.

The truth is between the two: We can panic and acknowledge Wall Street’s small role at the same time. Although the number of houses being purchased by mega-investors is currently not enough to move the market in most parts of the country these firms’ underlying structural advantage is profound and growing.

Let’s focus on Invitation Homes a $21 billion publicly traded company that was spun off from Blackstone the world’s largest private equity company in 2017. Invitation Homes operates in 16 cities with the biggest concentration in Atlanta where it owns 12556 houses. (Though that’s not much compared with the 80000 homes sold in Atlanta each year Invitation Homes bought 90 percent of the homes for sale in some ZIP codes in Atlanta in the early 2010s.) While normal people typically pay a mortgage interest rate between 2 percent and 4 percent these days Invitation Homes can borrow money for far less: It’s getting billion-dollar loans at interest rates around 1.4 percent. In practice this means that Invitation Homes can afford to tack on an extra $5000 to $20000 to the purchase price of every home while getting the house at the same actual cost as a typical homeowner. While Invitation Homes uses a mixture of debt and cash from renters to buy houses its offers are almost always all cash which is a big leg up in a competitive market.

One way to think about Invitation Homes’ business strategy is to consider the value of the properties the firm is buying relative to the rents they charge. According to a recent SEC disclosure Invitation Homes’ portfolio of homes is worth of total of $16 billion (after renovations) and the company collects about $1.9 billion in rent per year. That means it takes only about eight years of rental payments to pay back a typical house that Invitation Homes has bought. The usual rule of thumb for evaluating a fair sale price says Kundan Kishor professor of economics at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee “is that price to rent ratios are around 20 to 1.” When price-to-rent ratios are very high it makes more sense for consumers to rent than to buy and when they are low it makes more sense to buy than to rent. That Invitation Homes is getting deals twice as good as a typical homebuyer shows that it’s not just buying any homes: It’s buying the specific houses with the greatest potential to be wealth-building for the middle class.

It’s not exactly accurate that investors are “buying every single-family house they can find” as some have suggested. If that were true their market share in the United States wouldn’t be a piddling 15 percent. They’re really buying up the stock of relatively inexpensive single-family homes built since the 1970s in growing metro areas. They mostly ignore bigger and more expensive houses especially ones that are move-in ready: Wealthy boomers and the nation’s finance and tech bros nab those properties. And they’re also ignoring cities with stable or shrinking populations like Providence and Pittsburgh.

But investors are depleting the inventory of the precise houses that might otherwise be obtainable for younger working- and middle-class households in the cities where those workers can easily find good-paying jobs like Atlanta (22 percent of home purchases according to Redfin data) Charlotte (22 percent) and Phoenix (20 percent). More importantly they’re able to scour those markets scientifically and systematically to make cash offers on the most attractively priced properties. While normal people buy houses when they actually need to move somewhere (savvy) investors buy houses several years before a bunch of people need to move to an area. Whether they’re tracking where major employers are building new offices or looking at public school enrollment data being ahead of the market gives big firms a big leg up.

And in case you were assuming that converting houses to rentals would flood the market and bring down rents don’t get your hopes up: As Invitation Homes tells its investors “We operate in markets with strong demand drivers high barriers to entry and high rent growth potential.”

While renting might make sense for some people especially people who move a lot it often sucks particularly in the United States where we don’t have especially strong protections for tenants. The business strategy of the country’s biggest landlords Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent does not seem to be “Make renting with us so delightful that if my tenants have to move cities they’ll specifically seek out another property owned by our company.” Based on reports from Reuters the New York Times and the Atlantic it appears to be closer to “Squeeze our tenants for every penny avoid making repairs let black mold and raw sewage accumulate and count on the fact that moving is a huge expensive hassle.”

Our current system of encouraging homeownership is by no means perfect and it places a lot of unnecessary risk onto the “balance sheets” of the middle class but it’s worked out financially for most of the people who have been lucky enough to own a home. The implicit and explicit subsidies the government has given to Americans buying their first homes have been the biggest handout the American middle class has ever received (a handout notably denied to Black Americans for much of the 20th century one explanation for the current size of the racial wealth gap).

Laurie Goodman vice president of housing finance policy at the Urban Institute points out that policymakers could take steps to level the playing field between investors and the rest of us. She told me that buyers who need to borrow money using Federal Housing Administration loans or those who need a rehab loan for a fixer-upper have a particularly tough time competing against Wall Street firms. FHA paperwork often gets delayed slowing down the purchase process so home sellers often don’t want to sell to FHA buyers even if their bids are competitive. That’s a solvable problem. And loans for properties that need renovations Goodman says are both cumbersome and expensive. Rethinking the processes for FHA and rehab loans could “put individuals on a more equal footing” she explained.

If you don’t want all of America’s land and housing to end up in the portfolios of the 1 percent there’s ultimately one very simple solution: Tax the rich. After all the companies buying the houses are ultimately owned by people (or in some cases universities and churches which are their own cans of tax-advantaged rich-people worms). At the same time that the working-class is going hungry rich people are doing so outstandingly well that they are running out of easy places to park their cash which is why they’re buying 2000 square-foot houses in the Phoenix suburbs via their ownership stakes in these funds.

This is all part of a long-standing trend: As inequality in the United States increases the financial elite invests less in the types of things that could create jobs like R&D or new factories and more into directly extracting wealth from the working class. One way to do that? Becoming their landlords.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3Rvcm9udG9vYnNlcnZlci5jYS8yMDIxLzA2LzE5L3NtYWxsLWJ1c2luZXNzLXVwcmlzaW5nLWhvdy1hLW11c2xpbS1zdHVkZW50LWJlY2FtZS1hbi1lbnRyZXByZW5ldXItZHVyaW5nLXRoZS1jb3ZpZC0xOS1wYW5kZW1pYy1ieS1zdGFydGluZy1hbi1vbmxpbmUtaGlqYWItYnVzaW5lc3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Small business uprising: How a Muslim student became an entrepreneur during the COVID-19 pandemic by starting an ...,"When the pandemic hit last March the dramatic shift to online learning in Ontario forced many students to rethink their plans. The pandemic initiated a young student to launch Azelefa Co. an online hijab business.

For Azelefa Khan 20 a University of Toronto Scarborough student the pandemic was an opportunity to reflect on her future career plans.

Currently a third-year student working toward a double major in immunology and psychology Khan was fascinated by science particularly the anatomy of the brain.

“I had an interest in what I was studying but I didn’t have the passion to pursue a career in it” Khan said. “I always knew I had a business-driven mindset because I enjoyed taking business classes and I always spoke about wanting to start my own business to my family and friends.”

When classes ended in April 2020 coinciding with Ramadan Khan went on a spiritual journey to help her figure out what to do with her time during the pandemic.

“During the quarantine I got so close to my religion Islam. When Ramadan came in 2020 I started praying and asking for guidance and one of the things I mentioned was that I wanted to have an influential role on young girls and be a positive role model for them” said Khan who is from Abbottabad Pakistan. She also lived in the United Arab Emirates before moving to Canada in 2012.

The conversation that launched the hijab business

Before Ramadan 2020 Khan had a conversation with her father about wanting to start a clothing brand. At first she was thinking she would start a line of modest dresses to sell online then the idea of launching a hijab business came to mind as it was a way to stay close to her religion.

“A hijab is simple and plain” and it was a product that was easier to manage than dresses Khan said.

The launch date for Azelefa Co. was August 14 2020. Located in North York Ont. Khan ships worldwide and orders can be placed directly through the website.

“I wanted my launch date to be on a Friday because it is a blessed day for Muslims” Khan said. “Also of course it was Pakistan’s National Day.”

Hijab business designed to solve problems

Rather than switch her major to business Khan relies on Google informational and influential videos.

“Google is your best friend when starting a business. Google everything and anything that you don’t know” Khan said. As soon as she got the idea of starting her hijab business she began researching and finding manufacturers.

She expanded her line to include hijab magnets because “I feel it solves problems about hijabis and girls who want to wear modest clothing” Khan said. It’s a popular product that keeps the hijab in place “and it doesn’t leave any holes or snag your hijab.”

Mahnoor Fatima 21 a student from the University of Toronto bought hijab magnets from Azelefa Co. to replace the hijab pins she used. “Hijab magnets don’t ruin my hijab and are very strong” Fatima said. Her hijab stays “in place all day.”

Azelefa Co. so far has sold more than 2000 pairs of the hijab magnets.

The preparation before the launch

Khan began her business working from the bedroom of her family’s apartment.

She sold her bedroom furniture and downsized her bed to make space for two sectional shelves to hold her inventory. She also got a large table to use to prepare orders for shipping. Her room was soon filled with hijabs.

“For me customer service and quality was the biggest thing and a major priority. I never want to sell something I don’t like. That’s why in the beginning I got so many hijab samples and colours” Khan said.

“I ordered and spent a lot of money on samples. If I was to give you an estimate it would be anywhere from $1000 to $1500. I wasted so much money — you should be getting samples but not too many.”

Khan worked hard to find the right supplier after she found that most of the items she received when she first launched the business were not good quality.

“I have known Azelefa since middle school. I was super excited for her — before she launched I loved helping her choose colours for her hijab business and answering any questions she had with making decisions.” Fatima said. “The quality of her hijab and stitching is phenomenal.”

Khan has since moved her inventory to storage space that is 10 x 15 but she still continues to package all her products at home.

Hijab empowerment

For many Muslim women around the world modesty and the hijab have a significant meaning. “The hijab reminds me of my faith in every decision I make” Fatima said.

“I know a lot about hijabs and it empowers me when I go outside. People recognize it as a hijab. They know I’m a Muslim” Khan said. A hijab is so much more than just a scarf on the head she said it “is a part of me and it gives me a sense of freedom.”

Azelefa Co. sells hijabs made from a variety of different materials including jersey ribbed jersey hijab chiffon and premium chiffon. She also carries tie-dye hijabs turbans and velvet hijab scrunchies.

“One of my favorite hijabs that I would recommend are the jerseys — specifically the black one (Nairobi)” Fatima said. She likes them because they are lightweight don’t slip and are perfect for any season.

Khan also recommends the jersey hijab collection because it can be dressed up or down.

“Jersey hijabs are extremely soft and lightweight…feels like a cloud on your head. Made with 95 per cent cotton and five per cent spandex which allows it to stretch without any limitations” Khan said.

Uprising of social media and advice

The two main social media apps used to promote Azelefa Co. are thriving. All the marketing is done through TikTok and Instagram. Azelefa Co. has almost 10000 followers on Instagram and more than 60000 followers on TikTok.

“TikTok has such an amazing audience and one of the richest audiences in the world. It helped my business scale. The way TikTok’s algorithm works is just so amazing” Khan said.

Khan said hashtags are really important and help target the right audience. They should match the content in the video she said. For Azelefa Co. the focus is on hijab and modest hashtags to target the right audience.

Packaging is also an important part of Khan’s business strategy.

“Packaging is so important because it really comes down to customer experience. If your packaging is good customers want to post a story on Instagram share it on Snapchat and on TikTok” Khan said.

“People have asked me to record their packages on TikTok to see behind the scenes. Sometimes that is the reason why people even order and especially being a small business I feel like I can relate to my customer” Khan said. Including little gifts in her packages such as candies or a handwritten note also helps her connect with buyers.

Fatima says she genuinely cares about her customers.

Azelefa Co. social media content is created to help anyone that is interested in getting tips tricks or interested in wanting to wear a hijab. “If I make any video with a purpose behind it or give knowledge and solve an issue for them those type of videos always do really well and I get a lot of following and orders from that” Khan said.

Build a support system

When her business started she was invited to her high school to speak to the students in the same business marketing class that inspired her.

Three pieces of advice and quotes provided by the owner Azelefa Khan.

One of the biggest motivators Khan found has been entrepreneur Gary Vee.

“Sometimes you just need that energy in your system — that good positive energy” Khan said.

Azelefa Co. does not have any employees but Khan says she receives a lot of support from friends and family. Her parents are the first ones to help her out her father helps with packaging. A friend helped Khan design the website and a friend’s father does photoshoots for her.

Recently Azelefa Co. launched its first-ever dress on the site during this year’s Ramadan and Eid. It was a satin dress in two colours and it is very modest.

Act of giving

When Azelefa Co. launched an exclusive tie-dye collection it was a huge hit. There aren’t that many tie-dye hijab collections available said Khan and the one company she came across when researching only sold tie-dye hijabs made from jerseys. To be competitive Khan launched a tie-dyed collection in chiffon.

“From the tie-dye collection I donated like 10 per cent of the proceeds. This was during Eid time and it went to buy Eid gifts for women in shelters” Khan said.

Khan also supports Islamic Relief Canada to help people in need across Palestine. She launched a fundraiser for 48 hours and 100 per cent of all sales were donated to the cause.

“I chose the most reliable source and the one I use all the time” Khan said who raised $500 from the fundraiser. It was an accomplishment she said. “I was happy.”

Khan said she will continue building a stronger community by making women feel empowered through innovative design after the pandemic ends.

With such a turnout the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) achieved the distinction of giving the highest number of vaccinations among all civic bodies within the state.

Speaking to Deccan Chronicle GVMC chief medical officer Dr. K. S. L. G. Sastry said “We were doubtful whether we will be able to vaccinate at least 50000 people. But more than one lakh of them turned up. It is a great achievement for citizens of Vizag with collective efforts made by all our staff.”

The vaccination drive started at 6 a.m. and went on till 7 p.m. at all 572 grama sachivalayams across 98 wards within the corporation limits Dr. Sastry added.

GVMC mayor Golagani Hari Venkata Kumari said she toured Allipuram and the 13th ward to check the vaccination drive. She expressed satisfaction that people have responded overwhelmingly.

Corporation commissioner G. Srijana attributed success of the drive to the hard work put in by ward volunteers and health workers during the last few days in increasing awareness among people about taking vaccination. Srijana said the maximum number of people who turned up had been above 45 years in age and mothers with children aged below five years the two target groups in Sunday’s drive."

The garnish won't be ruined over time like the ones that wrap around and rub. This is great.

They sit very low to the ground and don't come up very high.

They match the design of the car really well.

Installs with 2 new plastic press-in rivets. You can install them in less than 10 minutes.

Sit quite a bit further off the ground. Maybe 1.5"" at the lowest point. It was hard to get a good comparative measurement because no tapes I could find would stick to the RA flaps to test fit and measure. They probably won't rub over every little bump like the OEM ones..

Stick out to the side a bit further.

Look ok (with the logo removed). They're shiny instead of matte which I would have preferred but otherwise look and feel great.

Have a much more complex install with friction clips and screw-in rivets.

I'm starting to get some chips and damage to the rear fenders of my Model Y so was reading through all of the mud flap threads here. There are quite a few of them and I wanted to get an idea of which flaps to buy. My main stipulation is that they not be the moulded kind that sit over the fender garnish because I've had two vehicles in the past ruined by ones like that. Those flaps rub on the garnish if they ever touch the ground and over time damaged the finish. So I knew I wanted one of the flat ones in case I needed to take them off or switch flaps in the future.I originally bought the ZL1 Addons flaps but just as they arrived I saw a post that an owner had them and still got significant damage. This basically left two options: Tesla's OEM flaps and RallyArmor. Today I compared those two. The RallyArmor flaps are very nice but I absolutely hate the giant logo. Fortunately I found that it's simply painted on and some acetone-based nail polish remover and some aggressive rubbing takes it right off with no damage whatsoever (see pics).The Tesla flaps:The RallyArmor flaps:Given the easier install I tried out the Tesla flaps first and will leave them installed for awhile. I couldn't even get up my small driveway curb with the Tesla ones (see pics). If I can't figure out a way to make them stop scraping I'll switch to the RallyArmor flaps.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY29vbGVzdC10ZXNsYS1mZWF0dXJlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,14 coolest Tesla features that put your regular car to shame,"Tesla's reputation often precedes it. But no matter what you think of the electric car company's ""unique"" CEO — with his active Twitter presence and unorthodox methods for selling EVs (no advertising no dealerships all online) — Tesla's vehicles are not like any other.

Sure there are other electric cars out there that feature regenerative braking one-pedal driving instant acceleration and fast charging. But that still doesn't make them anything like Tesla.

And no car brand from the EVs to the gasoline-fueled options comes with as many hidden modes and settings as Tesla.

Here's a rundown of the Tesla-only features that make Tesla well Tesla.

1. Only one touchscreen

The Tesla experience is like no other. Credit: Yuriko Nakao / Getty Images

Tesla's newest cars are the Model 3 and Y; both feature the same sparse interior with a single center screen that controls everything you need to do from running the car and playing the radio to finding driving directions. No other car has such a pared-down layout. Even the button to open the glove compartment is on the one and only screen.

2. Autopilot

Available since around 2015 Autopilot started as an extra feature you could add for a hefty fee to complement your driving. The advanced driving system would auto-steer keep up with other vehicles brake for slower traffic and generally help out with highway driving as long as the driver kept eyes on the road and hands on the wheel.

Now most of those features come included as part of Tesla's basic safety system. But there's also Full Self-Driving mode for a current upgrade price of $10000 which claims to be hands-free driving that can stop at stop signs and traffic lights make automatic lane changes and eventually auto-steer on any road even off the highway. So far only a select group of beta testers are using the full FSD package. It's been a rough start with FSD mode struggling in dense urban areas.

3. Supercharging

Tesla has its own charging network exclusive to Tesla owners. Other EVs (like Rivian and Jeep) are starting to build out their own networks as well but none are as extensive as Tesla's. Supercharging is available across the U.S. and in other countries where Teslas are sold: There are more than 25000 superchargers. The fast charging adds up to 200 miles in 15 minutes. No longer free like it was in the early days of Tesla you either pay by the minute or kilowatt using a credit card loaded into the car computer.

4. Free over-the-air updates

Other car companies are catching up but Tesla was the first to treat its cars like cellphones. Just like you update your iPhone with the latest iOS via a free over-the-air software update Tesla's software connects to WiFi and can update a long list of car functions. When there was a braking problem a few years ago an OTA update even fixed that.

5. Keycard access

It's like a hotel room keycard but for your car. You don't have to take it out for it to work but if you have it out you can touch it to the door side panel to unlock the door. You can also open the car from your smartphone with the Tesla app installed.

That's your car key. Credit: Silas Stein / picture alliance via Getty Images

6. Sentry mode

Other cars have security systems but not like Sentry mode. If someone gets too close to your Tesla for too long the cameras start recording a message appears on the screen that the car is recording and classical music starts playing from the audio system. You can turn on Sentry mode to keep away any would-be intruders or vandals.

7. Dog mode

Just like it sounds like Dog mode is for dogs to chill in the car. Parked cars overheat and are unsafe for dogs but with this mode engaged the car is kept cool with the air system still on even with the car in park. Plus an on-screen message on the center console says ""My owner will be back soon"" to let passersby know your dog is safe.

8. Ludicrous and Plaid mode

Turning this on in a Model S means you need to brace for super-fast acceleration. With Plaid activated the car can go up to 200 mph and accelerates to 60 mph in under two seconds.

9. Bioweapon defense mode

This mode came in handy during the devastating Western U.S. wildfires throughout 2020. It's only available with Model S and X cars that have a HEPA filtration system that automatically turns the car into a safe breathing space.

10. Netflix Hulu YouTube streaming

You can watch all your favorite shows in your Tesla. But don't get too excited; the car has to be parked for streaming to work. You can log onto the various streaming platforms when waiting in the car most likely while charging up.

11. Caraoke

More entertainment in the car! This time it's karaoke with lyrics to popular songs appearing on the touchscreen when parked. But since it's in the car it's been appropriately renamed ""Caraoke.""

12. The frunk

Tesla paved the way with the portmanteau of ""front"" and ""trunk"" to create the concept of a ""frunk."" People put anything from presents pooches (see below) to extra charging cords in the front compartment. While most electric vehicles now feature a cargo space under the hood where an internal combustion engine used to sit Tesla did it first with the Model S.

13. Fart mode

You can make your Tesla fart or at least sound like it's farting. Officially called Emissions testing mode the setting is perfect for pranksters. You can turn on the fart sounds on-demand or when you push the turn signal. You have to be in the car to release the farts.

14. Easter eggs

Beyond all the various modes and games more surprises are sprinkled throughout the car. There's a Christmas jingle hidden within the settings along with an inside joke about cowbells. Wikipedia has a list of all the Tesla Easter eggs discovered so far. Happy egg hunting!

Bonus: Elon Musk as CEO

Elon Musk is one of a kind and eccentric as hell. On top of running Tesla he's sending rockets into space with SpaceX trying to reinvent the subway with his other company The Boring Company and trying to hack the human mind with Neuralink his brain implantation startup. And he tweets incessantly. No other car company has Musk. And maybe that's a good thing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnRocm90dGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Rlc2xhLW1vZGVsLXMtaGFzLWhpdC02MG1waC0xOTlzLXVuZGVyLXZlcnktc3BlY2lmaWMtY29uZGl0aW9uc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Tesla Model S Has Hit 60mph In 1.99s But Under Very Specific Conditions,"Zero-to-60mph times are the benchmark for acceleration figures in America as it’s very easy to grasp. You start the stopwatch when the car’s at a standstill and measure how long it takes to hit 60mph. It’s a pretty well-known system and one that has shone Tesla in a very good light previously.

But Tesla’s claim that the upcoming Model S Plaid reaches 60mph in just 1.99 seconds messes around with the formula a bit. On the Tesla website there’s a little asterisk after the 1.99 and further down the page it adds the caveat that that figure was achieved excluding the first foot of rollout.

In other words the first foot of the car accelerating isn’t taken into account and by then the Model S Plaid has got to around 6mph. That means Tesla’s quoted figure is really from 6-60mph which no-one measures to because a) that’d be silly and b) it’d be a lot harder to measure accurately. Even Tesla has only used this measurement for its Plaid versions; the standard versions are timed from 0-60mph like any other car.

Since the figure was published it’s also been revealed that Tesla achieved it on a drag strip where the surface is coated in a sticky glue-like substance to make it easier to warm your tyres and to provide more grip. Everyone else uses normal tarmac roads as that’s what drivers will tend to use to get to places in the real world.

Remote video URL

Tesla counters by saying that most of its customers will often use the Model S Plaid on a drag strip but in the video Jason from Engineering Explained shows why that probably won’t be the case.

His findings are based on MotorTrend’s test of the Tesla Model S Plaid and its unbelievable acceleration figures. MT didn’t subtract the first foot of rollout and pinned the accelerator on asphalt rather than a drag strip’s VHT glue.

We’ll leave the video to explain how fast the insane Model S Plaid actually is from 0-60mph but it’s still the fastest car MotorTrend has ever tested. Those are some bragging rights so why be misleading Tesla? Why not be cool and under promise and over deliver like Porsche does?

Elon Musk also recently announced the longer-range Plaid+ models had been cancelled as there was “no need” for them.

Raise your hand if you know Einstein Newton Maxwell and Tesla? These characters have left their mark on the history of technology and physics and I have decided to bring them together to discuss some of the issues of our time and what they think about the future.

Are you ready?

Obviously this is some kind of science fiction but not entirely. Let’s find out!

What would these scientists think of our world? If they existed today what contribution would they make to the planet to solve current problems?

For a moment let’s leave this universe behind and immerse ourselves in another parallel science fictional dimension and imagine that Einstein Newton Maxwell and Tesla get together talk to each other and express themselves as if they knew everything about our present world. Quantum mechanics and relativity have taught us that it is possible to have parallel worlds. A space-time tunnel (wormhole) opened the door to this parallel world. In 1935 Einstein and Rosen represented an electron as a black hole to give a continuity between relativity and quantum mechanics that we described earlier avoiding the contradiction of the singularity of black holes. The collective imagination changed radically. It was at this time that the concept of what is known today as a wormhole appeared i.e. the connection between two universes.

The concept from a physical point of view was later theorized in 1957 by Wheeler and Fuller who also gave it a name: this opening was possible only in the presence of a black hole on one side and a white hole on the other. However it was energetically unstable and destined to close. To date gravitational wave detectors in physics have detected gravitational wave signals from black holes. We could say that black holes exist. The problem is how to go through them.

A space-time tunnel called the Einstein-Rosen or wormhole bridge would allow us to travel and move through time and space. For now in fact it belongs only to the world of science fiction.

Isaac Newton is best known for his theory on the law of gravity but his “Principia Mathematica” (1686) with its three laws of motion greatly influenced the Enlightenment in Europe. The scientist was president of the Royal Society of London and teacher of the English Royal Mint until his death in 1727.

Isaac Newton

Albert Einstein was a German mathematician and physicist who developed the special and general theories of relativity. In 1921 he won the Nobel Prize in physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Over the next decade he emigrated to the United States after being targeted by the German Nazi party. His work also had a major impact on the development of atomic energy. In his later years Einstein focused on unified field theory. Einstein is considered to be the most influential physicist of the 20th century.

Albert Einstein

James Clerk Maxwell was one of the most influential physicists in the world along with Einstein. In particular he has made great strides in helping to understand electromagnetism and has produced a unified model of electromagnetism. His research laid the foundation for modern quantum mechanics and special relativity.

James Clerk Maxwell

Nikola Tesla was a Croatian naturalized American inventor and engineer who discovered and patented the rotating magnetic field the basis of most AC-powered equipment. In 1891 he invented the Tesla coil an induction coil widely used in radio technology.

Nikola Tesla

The encounter

We were in a UNESCO meeting room.

Tesla wasn’t sure he could get in. Einstein gave him a tap on the back and said “Come on man they can’t do anything to you they need us”. Newton smiled throwing his apple that he always had with him like a juggler. When in doubt someone thought of the alleged zero gravity. Maxwell later completed the quantum aggregation.

The UNESCO room was full of people. Einstein smiled at the audience. Testa lowered his head and went straight towards him. Meanwhile Newton stayed behind awed by the myriad of people who had come here. He did not leave the front door. An usher said: “Excuse me Sir you should sit down you cannot stay at the door.” Newton took his seat followed closely by Maxwell.

Physics has seen many scientists as protagonists such as Archimedes Fermi and many others. Each played an important role. Galileo with his studies on astronomy paved the way to the experimental method Newton introduced the concept of gravity Maxwell formulated his famous equations that allow us to communicate with the other part of the world and Einstein revolutionized the concepts of relativity and photoelectric effect for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1921. Tesla finally is famous for his studies and inventions on the electric motor alternating current applications and more.

Einstein as a true leader immediately spoke up.

“I accepted to be here to give my contribution with my teammates. I know little about this period but I already know that you are not having a good time.”

Einstein continued: “I’ll get right to the point. If we want to keep this planet alive we need to think in terms of renewable energy. Green. The force of gravity for many years was known as a mysterious force with relativity this situation has definitely improved much clearer don’t you think? I would never have said that but you succeeded. Well done to all the scientists of LIGO and Virgo! What I want to say is that nothing is impossible? and the energy of the universe that hits us every microsecond is definitely vast. We capture the energy from the sun quite well but we should do more.”

Tesla added: “The purpose of an invention is primarily to harness natural forces for human needs. Most men in our time now I am not sure you will tell me later considered the electric current as a mysterious lymph flowing along wires thanks to the intervention of a phantom hand. I wanted to master the laws of this fluid. And instinctively I was convinced that the future belonged to an alternating current system. I followed the fast alternating movement of the electric current that rustled in the switching circuits at first without success but then we know how it went. The money was not important: what mattered was the spread of my achievements. I imagine a world where everyone would receive free and unlimited energy. I cried when I saw this but it is the only thing that can save the planet in terms of energy. It was like an intuition: suddenly I realized how it is possible to transmit energy without a cable over long distances.”

Maxwell took the floor: “Electromagnetic waves have enormous potential they offer the possibility of talking to someone else at the same instant; it is not a trivial matter. Indeed you can even see each other from a great distance. From this point of view technology has made great progress but I believe that a little more can be done. I am waiting for the holy grail of physics the unification of everything the equation that will lead us to the creator. We only need to understand which creator. I admit that you were good with smartphones a mix of technology that even extraterrestrials would envy. Tell me the truth did they suggest this to you? Computers are our technological surplus to increase the potential of cars and thanks to artificial intelligence they will allow us to perform complete diagnoses/medical operations. The full development of computing will allow us to undertake interstellar journeys looking for other planets that can host life on earth.”

“Personally I don’t think there is anyone else besides us besides you” Newton said. “We are the only ones.” He added “even though technology is changing the way we discover things has remained the same. Curiosity of course. Investing in engineering and mathematics is a priority for any country to remain competitive in the globalized society. We know more or less everything on our planet not yet well let’s try not to destroy it.”

Artificial intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a great hope for the future of humanity. Without realizing it we are already using it. According to some “scientists” it can also represent a great danger as it is able to supplant man as the dominant species. For example humans cannot travel in time but somehow if artificial intelligence were able to solve some quantum nodes humans could find themselves arguing with their alter egos without imagining what might happen.

So what prevents AI which is already able to drive cars diagnose diseases and recognize objects and people in photos from taking the next step and becoming truly intelligent? Creativity and common sense can be two key factors. The goal of AI is to implement human intelligence in machines so that they can “think” and “mimic” the way a person behaves. The key feature of AI is its ability to analyze data and ensure the best chance of achieving a set goal.

Einstein said “Science fiction movies tell us that artificial intelligence is a giant computer in a secret location and it takes over the world I don’t think AI is that thing. AI searches for models recognizes them and then classifies them.”

From intellectual abilities the functioning of AI is mainly based on four different functional levels.

Comprehension: through the simulation of the cognitive abilities of correlating data and events AI is able to recognize texts images tables videos voice and extract information.

Reasoning: systems can link the multiple bits of collected information (through precise mathematical algorithms and in an automated way). Learning and interaction.

Tesla stated: “The pattern recognition aspect is actually inspired by how we think and how our brains work; the neurons of the brain are trained to recognize something and the same thing is done with the neural network.”

Should we be afraid of AI?

Newton smiled and said “If you watch too many movies then maybe yes but actually I don’t think it’s something to be afraid of. It’s just another type of algorithm. If there is anything scary that comes with it it is what people choose to do with algorithms.” Newton pursued his speech: “An important thing to keep in mind is that these things are trained for a task that comes with data and a set of expectations i.e. the expected results. So you can train anything to do the wrong thing. Is this the AI? Or is it the person? Yes in every fear scenario that comes to my mind we always end up thinking it is the person. It is not exactly the technology.”

We are experimenting with the use of AI within production flows which today are human-driven algorithms. And now we are conducting experiments in our factories to see if we can use machine learning and deep learning to improve or optimize production. It can draw a series of parallel conclusions at once and ultimately get a faster route to a better result. AI is truly a very capable pattern recognition system. If we have an IT system and a cyberattack threatens it the number one challenge is to recognize the type of attack. In general AI can be used in cyber defense to create valid “security assessment” tools. Unfortunately the same tools are also valid for the massive collection of information on victims and for planning a state-of-the-art attack.

Maxwell wanted to intervene by giving his opinion..

“The formation of an AI algorithm takes place using billions of data from structured and unstructured sources such as blogs and newsletters. Through deep learning and machine learning techniques AI improves its ability to “recognize” cyber-security threats and cyber risks”. A cyberattack is something that happens to the computer system. “An AI or machine-trained machine learning algorithm is just as likely to notice this attack and be able to alert the system so that it can then take further actions to protect itself from the cyberattack.”

The learning algorithms used for pattern recognition activities are much more widespread than we realize. Google works with machine learning. Whenever you type something into the Google search box as pretty much the world does there are machine learning algorithms behind that search and they decide which results to return. One of the reasons for Google’s success is that the results are generally correct or are generally relevant.

“Without a machine learning algorithm this couldn’t happen” Tesla commented. Among the applications of AI in our daily lives is medicine. Machine learning and AI are used to detect the potential symptoms of a disease analyze imaging tests and make diagnoses based on pathological reports. But that’s not all: properly applied AI makes it possible to find patterns in patients’ symptoms just as facial recognition technologies make an important contribution to the identification of rare genetic diseases.

The infrastructure that allows AI to operate is evolving to support an ever-wider range of business activities and processes. Processors traditional architectures and platforms often take a long time to calculate the range of options of a neural network (Deep Learning algorithm). More advanced processors and graphics processing units (known simply as GPUs) have already partially solved this problem offering superior computing power and speed; but the support of advanced AI solutions is still not enough. Newton said “To realize the full potential of AI we need to think beyond the technology itself. The key factor is to capture and acquire technical skills”. And here education must have considerable weight. “AI is one of the technologies that will change your life” Maxwell added. For this reason engineers working in this field must develop critical thinking that can make them true protagonists of the future. The use and development of the Internet of Things together with AI should support a new economic model capable of increasing people’s well-being while being also sustainable for the planet and optimizing energy consumption. Not only that the industry will see the wonders of AI realized but physics will also benefit from them. Some physics challenges such as the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity are incredibly complex.

“As the physicist Al-Khalili said” Einstein indicated “my next alter ego will not be a human being but the AI.”

AI is beginning to show innovative intuitive and creative thinking skills. One day it will be able to tackle such problems and perhaps it will be able to imagine mathematical models beyond the capabilities of the human brain.

“Maybe traveling through time?” Newton asked. “In all honesty I can say I’m not dying to see the future.”

Physics and Technology

A “character” and a dreamer who nevertheless was able to put his ideas into practice and obtain numerous patents Tesla revolutionized the use of electricity and laid the foundation for today’s IoT.

Theoretical knowledge about the electric force was already mature in 1875. Maxwell’s equations that unite and describe magnetism and electricity date back from 1873 when he published his essay on electricity and magnetism.

Maxwell said “The course Tesla was taking in Graz spanned a century of exciting progress. Static electricity studied by Cavendish and Franklin at the end of the eighteenth century electromagnetic induction discovered by Oersted in 1820 and Faraday’s experiments opened the door to the electric motor and were the main topics of that period.”

Direct or alternating current?

Tesla smiled as if he was troubled by the question but in the end he went straight to the point.

“At the time almost everyone was betting on direct current. I immediately understood its limits and so I concentrated all my efforts on alternating current which allowed me to easily build transformers capable of increasing or lowering the mains voltage.” That was a troubled period; following the scientific discoveries on electromagnetism the future of electrical industrialization had to rely on direct current or alternating current. Alternating current could be transmitted over long distances at high voltage using low electric current values thus reducing energy losses and increasing transmission efficiency. Additionally a transformer could have been used to power homes and factories. When generators transformers motors wires and lights were introduced for the alternating current system in December 1887 it was clear that alternating current would have determined the future of electricity distribution.

The “war” between Tesla and DC developer Edison was well known. Edison measured the value of a discovery in dollars earned; he was first an entrepreneur and then a scientist. Tesla prioritized discovery over money.

“If you’re a scientist you’re not doing it for money but for the sake of science” Tesla said.

“Tesla could be considered the Leopardi of engineering” Newton said. The eccentric scientist and inventor was able to attract people’s attention thanks to his genius in applied physics. At that time most people thought of electric current as something mysterious.

Einstein added “Well a bit like today with 5G.”

Newton continued “Tesla wanted to master the laws of this type of science and after his quarrel with Edison he became convinced that the future belonged to a system not yet applicable: alternating current.”

Tesla stood up “When wireless is fully implemented the whole Earth will turn into one huge brain which is already the case. I recommend however!”

Let’s talk about physics and ghosts.

“In what sense?” Tesla asked. “The standard model and thermodynamics show that the kind of ghosts we know from horror movies don’t exist. In the standard model the theory that describes both matter and the forces of the universe there is no element for such an event. It would be necessary to demonize that some kind of medium carries these ghosts or rather the “living” cells after death and demonstrate how they interact with the particles.”

Einstein said “An extension of the standard model should be considered but above all the LHC accelerator at CERN that you have masterfully created would certainly notice.” The accelerator is able to make particles collide at dizzying speeds to find new ones thus discovering a myriad of new exotic particles and testing various pending theories.

Newton and Maxwell spoke in unison. In their opinion “no measure is currently focused on the search for ghosts. If you talk to LHC physicists they will tell you that their ghosts are neutrinos because they have such a small mass and have little interest in interaction. They are in fact the only particles capable of crossing the entire Universe undisturbed bringing information from the most remote space.” Tesla added “The existence of ghosts contradicts the second law of thermodynamics according to which the total entropy of an isolated system always increases over time.” If the ghost carries out activities screams movements and other it is then impossible for it to exist for any significant period of time. Its movements would correspond to a loss of energy and therefore could not exist for centuries but only for a short period of time. Lately many physicists have speculated how we could be characters in a giant computer game just like in the movie “The Matrix”. Basically the artificial intelligence that controls us should add the “Insert ghost” button and at this point everything changes. We would be its bits but not the qubits.

Let’s talk about Ettore Majorana. Do you know him?

“Vaguely” both Newton and Maxwell said.

“Yes” Einstein and Tesla replied.

Ettore Majorana was perhaps Enrico Fermi’s brightest student and an exceptional physicist. He died on March 25 1938 at the age of 32 under mysterious circumstances and without leaving any trace. Majorana’s first works dealt with atomic spectroscopy. He started working on neutrino masses and is remembered for what is now known as the “Majorana equation”. He also went abroad and worked with Heisenberg and Niels Bohr.

“Ettore was a theoretical physicist one of those who see an object behind a mathematical formula an image that has no form. It would be nice to have him here with us” Einstein said. Every fundamental particle in the universe has an antiparticle which has the same mass but the opposite charge. If a particle ever encounters its antiparticle the two would annihilate each other in a flash of energy. The theory dates back to 1937 when the physicist Ettore Majorana highlighted a gap in the fermion family of particles. “The Majorana equation is a relativistic wave equation similar to the Dirac equation but includes the charge conjugate ψc of a spinor ψ” stated Einstein and Tesla. They continued “the appearance of ψ and ψc in the Majorana equation means that the field ψ cannot be coupled to an electromagnetic field without violating the conservation of the charge so ψ is taken to be neutrally charged. Nonetheless the quanta of the Majorana equation are two kinds of particles: a particle and its neutral antiparticle. The Majorana equation is often supplemented by the condition that ψ = ψc (in which case ψ is said to be a Majorana spinor); this results in a single neutral particle. For a Majorana spinor the Majorana equation is equivalent to that of Dirac. The particles corresponding to the Majorana spinors are rightly called Majorana particles. This particle is its antiparticle”.

Let’s talk about the meaning of sound. We all collect signals similar to sounds.

“As long as you are of a certain age and can hear them yes” Einstein said. In physics sound is a wave phenomenon in the air or in other elastic media that triggers an acoustic perception (sensation). The quantities that come into play in this process are the frequency the pitch the intensity of the sound the waveform (or equivalent spectrum) and the timbre.

“Historically Galilei began to study the nature of sound and its characteristics. In 1615 other scientists such as Benedetti and Sagredo conducted studies that showed that the means of transmission of sound was air” said Newton. Mersenne conducted the first measurement of the speed of sound. Later the nineteenth-century research of von Helmholtz and Rayleigh directed sound towards the study of different energetic aspects and the subsequent invention of the phonograph and microphone posed the problem of recording and then reproducing sound (electroacoustics).

“Sound waves are longitudinal mechanical waves; this means that they propagate through a medium in the same direction of propagation. The human ear can perceive frequencies from about 20 Hz to 20 kHz. What we label and model as “sound” is a set of particular frequencies to which our ear is tuned” Maxwell said from the depths of his knowledge of waves. The sound wave is a perturbation of the transmission space. The air particles oscillate creating areas of pressure different from the atmospheric one; in some points it is greater and in others it is less. The production of sound waves cause periodic movements of the air molecules thus forming alternating layers of compressed and rarefied air that propagate in all directions until they reach our ears. The speed of the particles should not be confused with the speed of sound which in mathematics depends on the square root of three terms: the coefficient of adiabatic expansion the universal constant of air and the temperature. In air the speed of sound is 331.2 meters per second at 0°C and 343.1 m/s at 20°C.

Technically sounds can travel through space. They can exist as electromagnetic vibrations that propagate in similar wavelengths.

“Space sounds also come from the noise of the electromagnetic field in space itself and from the interactions of charged particles of the planets their satellites and the solar wind” Maxwell noted. The sounds also come from the emission of charged particles from the rings around the planets.

“Have you received signals from extraterrestrials?” Einstein asked. A few seconds of silence. “Come on joke” added the physicist. Indeed we still don’t know if these extraterrestrials exist.

How about quantum technology? It took more than 50 years to optimize classic computer software to the point where users can build an application or website with just a few lines of code. Quantum computing has to go through a similar process over the next two to three years.

“Traditional calculus works with 0 and 1; quantum computing has qubits that can represent a 1 a 0 or both at the same time. This overlap can allow two of these qubits to behave in ways that cannot be explained by the individual components. This behavior is called entanglement” Einstein said.

Newton added: “In the next few years quantum computers of 100 or more qubits will be able to perform tasks that will exceed the capabilities of today’s classic supercomputers but noise in quantum architectures will limit performance. The first challenge is to maintain the quality of the qubits. It will also be up to researchers to develop new solutions hardware and software to make programming ‘easy’.”

New electric vehicle control systems including regenerative braking systems start&stop functionality and electric motors that drive the wheels all require accurate measurement and control of electrical inputs to optimize performance and avoid catastrophic failures. An essential part of these systems is the battery current measurement sensor which measures the charge and discharge level of the battery and its state of health.

“By simulating the chemical structure of batteries with quantum computation for example it is possible to apply these algorithms to reproduce the chemical composition inside a battery based on various criteria such as weight reduction maximum density and cell assembly” Maxwell and Tesla stated. Then we would have an optimal battery.

The future is in electric cars.

This is a preview from our weekly newsletter. Each week I go ‘Beyond the News’ and handcraft a special edition that includes my thoughts on the biggest stories why it matters and how it could impact the future.

Tesla has tapped a new type of automotive glass from supplier AGP for the Plaid Model S invoking the thought that everything even the finest details of the vehicle was considered a possible improvement for the company’s rebirth of the all-electric flagship sedan.

Many months ago Teslarati stumbled across a list of Tesla’s suppliers through international connections. These suppliers were shipping massive volumes of whatever product they were giving to Tesla on cargo ships and we noticed that there was a company called AGP that was shipping windshields and other automotive glasses to the company’s Fremont Factory.

It turns out that AGP has been providing Tesla with automotive glass for several years. Back in 2016 AGP provided glass for the Model X’s panoramic roof and windshields. However Tesla utilized AGC Automotive’s windshields for its cars according to Investopedia.

AGP is a Peru-based company that specializes in all types of automotive glass but what they’ve done for Tesla is especially interesting. The company has been in business for 50 years but just like everything else it changes and the automotive industry is no different. As electric vehicles have become more mainstream technologies surrounding the development of these new sustainable automobiles are popping up left and right. AGP’s eGlass for electric and autonomous vehicles is no different.

Now AGP says on its website that it collaborates “closely with the companies that are leading the new wave of the electric and autonomous vehicles of tomorrow.” When I first stumbled across AGP many months ago on the cargo ship list for Tesla there was no indication that there was an official partnership so I looked into it a tad further. I reached out to AGP and received a response that thanked me for my inquiry but refused to confirm or deny whether it was in any sort of professional relationship with Tesla. Ironically AGP gave the answer we needed because responding to me was all I needed to know.

Many may ask “What’s the significance of what glass Tesla is using on its cars?” There are plenty of automotive glass suppliers out there that are worth their weight in gold providing high-quality windshields and windows for vehicles on the road. Of course consumers are going to want something that is relatively high quality because nothing is worse than driving behind a tractor-trailer on the Interstate just to have a chip or small crack on your windshield from something as tiny as a pebble. While strength is undoubtedly a need for all windshields EVs require a slightly different bit of development.

One of the biggest focuses for EVs is their drag coefficient. Why is it so important? Because aerodynamics are crucial to the performance range and effectiveness of electric vehicles. As high-quality long-range batteries are hard to come by in the EV sector manufacturers look for every advantage they can get to achieve robust range ratings. While Tesla is the leader in EV range figures the company is still looking for ways to get all of its vehicles to or near the 400-mile threshold.

Aerodynamics are a great way to do that. And Tesla undoubtedly worked extremely hard to achieve the best-in-class drag coefficient of .208 beating out the Lucid Air’s impressive .21 coefficient.

We knew aerodynamics was going to be a big part of the Plaid Model S when it was spotted at the Nürburgring two years ago. The vehicle was sporting a large spoiler a huge rear diffuser and the new eGlass from AGP is just another addition to Tesla’s attempts to make the Plaid Model S the most aerodynamic vehicle in its lineup.

We finally confirmed that AGP was providing the highly aerodynamic and EV-specific automotive glass to the Model S Plaid thanks to Tesla Raj who took a picture of the manufacturer’s sticker on the window of the all-electric sedan at Tesla’s Delivery Event on June 10th. This all confirmed Teslarati’s discovery of AGP in its supplier list several months ago and also confirmed that the two companies had a partnership despite AGP’s unwillingness to provide a comment (which we understood why!)

It makes me think about what Elon Musk may have needed to work on for the final week of Plaid development. When he had announced that the event was going to be delayed a week due to “tweaks” I wondered whether it was software or hardware. While it was likely a software fix that needed to be addressed it could have been related to the drag coefficient which Tesla proudly displayed at the Plaid Event on the 10th. Nevertheless the vehicle has finally been released to pre-orderers and the fastest production car that has ever run the 1/4-mile drag is here and it’s taking down anything in its path.

A big thanks to our long-time supporters and new subscribers! Thank you.

I use this newsletter to share my thoughts on what is going on in the Tesla world. If you want to talk to me directly you can email me or reach me on Twitter. I don’t bite be sure to reach out!

In this second article exploring the history of RTK we focus mostly on the 1980s to look at what confirmed or inspired further exploration of GPS for land and marine surveying and foreshadowed an intense period of development (to come in Part 3) in the first half of the 1990s as geodesists scientists and engineers tried to build the perfect system.

Cornerstone: Using extraterrestrial systems for centimeter-level accuracy

The development of satellite geodesy would rest on the foundation of using phase differencing for high-accuracy baseline determination such as was used with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). GPS which launched its first satellite in 1978 was designed to use code-based signals for real time accuracies of 3-to-5 meters horizontal and 10-to-15 meters vertical but there was so much more potential.

Clever scientists determined they could use GPS satellites in a similar way using two receivers to interpret its non-code signals called carrier-phase signals for precise measurement to the accuracy of centimeters. This was known as carrier-phase differential GPS positioning and a host of individuals started developing software algorithms for extracting and processing that data as well as developing techniques to improve GPS surveying capabilities.

One of those individuals was Dr. Benjamin W. Remondi a GPS technologist for the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) who in the early 1980s began a long productive career in static and kinematic positioning based primarily on GPS observations. His body of work over several decades included more than 50 technical papers on methods still in use today such as the triple differencing method the antenna exchange method and the kinematic survey method. Researchers in the field would come to refer to him as “the father of Real Time Kinematic survey.”

Meter-level positioning at sea

Prior to Remondi’s research there were also technologies that routinely used broadcast radio waves for meter-level positioning of marine vessels performing engineering and construction work in the world’s ports and harbors.

One was Raydist a marine navigation system that relied on carrier signals broadcast from land-based shore stations. In the 1940s engineer Charles Hastings developed a method to measure the phase shift of a signal superimposed on radio waves transmitted between aircraft and a ground station. This led to the Raydist radio wave system for accurately measuring distance through continuous wave phase comparison.

Raydist was in use for hydrographic positioning and dredging when Steve DeLoach a civil engineer and land surveyor began working for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). “We had to run geodetic control along all the nation’s bays rivers and harbors to establish stations to locate the Raydist towers and had to set ‘spar buoys’ along the shipping channels as known points and locate these geodetically with multiple angle resections from shore” said DeLoach now retired. “These spar buoys were often many miles offshore bobbing about. The boat would pull alongside and the captain would yell ‘mark’ so the Raydist operator could enter the correct number of cycles from the two base stations.”

As a young engineer DeLoach was dumbfounded at the Raydist system’s mass of paper tape whirling analog dials massive ships’ power systems (fire hazards) and no vertical positioning. “All vertical information was from a tide station that was miles away therefore in significant error.”

But those issues aside Raydist represented the same type of solution as GPS ambiguity resolution making GPS carrier-phase positioning worth pursuing for hydrographic surveying. “The method of using a known static point to ‘resolve integers’ is exactly what the old 1960s Raydist system did in the marine environment” DeLoach said.

Comparing Raydist and other marine navigation systems was a way to prove that GPS could actually work and provide compatible results and those results also helped DeLoach make his case with USACE for funding in the late 1980s for a major project to develop a GPS carrier-phase positioning system for hydrographic surveying and dredging that would lead to RTK development.

“Raydist counts lanes of phase difference and that is exactly what geodetic GPS does” DeLoach said. “It’s the same basic math problems—just complicated by satellites orbiting versus base stations on the ground.”

Remondi would join the dredging project team in 1989 as one of its key problem-solvers but before that phase of development could begin other steppingstones on the way to RTK needed to be found.

Centimeter GPS positioning on land

The Macrometer was another predecessor technology demonstrating centimeter-level accuracy in GPS positioning. In the 1980s Charles Counselman a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) led the development of the Macrometer V-1000. According to a 2010 article on Counselman by MIT Technology Review a NASA scientist labeled Counselman’s invention as “snake oil” but would soon be proven wrong as it represented a new way to harness GPS by combining expertise in radio and astronomy.

Counselman proved his technology in a series of demonstrations in the early 1980s and was subsequently granted 36 patents. But while the Macrometer demonstrated extraordinary accuracy it had downsides for everyday civilian surveying uses. It was expensive heavy took two people to carry and had to be transported in a utility vehicle. Even so it would play an important role in research on the way to more streamlined and nimble commercial GPS systems.

“Today GPS receivers embodying Chuck’s technologies are portable inexpensive and ubiquitous” noted a 2008 article when Counselman received the Charles A. Whitten Medal from the American Geophysical Union. “Look under the hood and you’ll find many of his basic patents inside.”

GPS data simulation for precise carrier phase data

After earlier work in orbital mechanics and software development (see Part 1) Remondi was hired in 1981 by Admiral John Bossler and Dr. Clyde Goad to work at the NGS to solve “a most important problem”—using GPS for surveying at centimeter-level accuracy.

At the time there was no carrier data so Remondi’s first activity was to write a GPS data simulator for precise carrier phase data. During that time Remondi recalls being given tremendous freedom as a researcher including use of the lab’s minicomputer. The combination made developing software at NGS “amazing” he said. “I had been programming by that time probably 20 years of my life and it was always a burden. Sometimes I had to wait two or three days in the early days for a response to a program and another two to three days to get feedback. Now it was instantaneous. I could do two lines of code and ask it to compile and run two more lines of code. This was just unbelievable. This just super-charged me like you can’t believe.”

With this new computing power Remondi wrote two software programs that could process his simulated data. One used an interferometric search method he learned from Counselman and Sergei A. Gourevitch (Miniature Interferometer Terminals for Earth Surveying: Ambiguity And Multipath with Global Positioning System October 1981) while the other was a triple-difference program of his own invention. The programs were written to anticipate cycle slips and repair them if desired.

There was an obsession with cycle slips and the interferometric methods Remondi got from Gourevitch and Counselman enabled him to develop advanced computer methods to speed up the time for processing by a factor of 100000. The triple-difference method while considered naïve on the theory that there would be too little signal was faster in processing detected cycle slips and worked fine.

Collaboration and data familiarity advance RTK methods

Also to support Remondi’s initial work Bossler approved the purchase of two Macrometers at $250000 apiece. “They are usually $300000 but we got them for a Sunday Special” Remondi recalled. The receivers tracked six GPS satellites were codeless and had weak signals but with a small dataset provided by MIT “miraculously my programs worked.”

Meanwhile NGS was working with four sister government agencies to partner with Texas Instruments to develop the TI 4100 one of the first commercial GPS receivers and antennas. The TI 4100 team included excellent engineers writing simulation software Remondi said and he contributed timing software to their efforts. “They liked my contribution and good relations were established.”

After receiving the Macrometers the NGS team put them to work surveying the nation. It was no small logistical and physical effort because the receivers were heavy required large batteries and had to be time-synced. The team had to generate orbital data in the home office and send it to the field.

“I became extremely cozy with the data” Remondi said. “I noticed that a tracking channel could get confused and switch satellites when the doppler signal was the same. The receiver would then report the wrong satellite. This was easy to fix but it pointed to how close I was watching the data. MIT was unaware of this sympathetic tracking behavior.”

Goad and Remondi shared the results of this work in 1984 in “Initial Relative Positioning Results Using the Global Positioning System.”

Initialization without sitting still for hours

Also in the 1983-84 timeframe and as part of the Macrometer testing Larry D. Hothem a geodesist with the United States Geological Survey set up a test network in California with survey marks near each other. At the time it was taking three hours at each monument to establish a position and Remondi thought there had to be a more efficient way. He realized the long stays at each monument were to give time for the satellites to move and wondered if they should stay a couple of minutes at each site and return several times. “I did not experiment with this method right then” he said “but I did later.”

The jumping from site to site made him wonder: Could the antenna be moved from a known site to an unknown site while maintaining carrier tracking? “While I believed the Macrometers could not do this I thought if I rotated the antenna very slowly I could prove the point. I asked Professor Counselman if such tracking could be done. He said no but if there was an application they would consider it.”

By the spring of 1984 Remondi—inspired by a paper by Dr. Alan G. Evans at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) that proved carrier tracking could be done while moving—set up a kinematic (or motion geometry) test but it didn’t work.

He learned from Texas Instruments engineers that with an increase in bandwidth the TI 4100 could track the carrier when the antenna was in motion. Next he asked his colleagues at NSWC to modify the receiver’s software to widen the bandwidth to 8 Hz. With this change Remondi repeated his experiment with field personnel carrying an antenna around a roughly square path and sending the data to him.

Antenna swapping—an awkward dance

The experiment was successful. With that proof Remondi designed more interesting experiments to travel between known survey marks using RTK. “Those tests were not in real time yet so we called the method ‘kinematic’ and not ‘RTK’” he said. “One of those experiments added the technique of swapping antennas.”

It looked like an awkward dance. Picture two tripods each with a GPS antenna and two guys lifting the antennas carefully up over their heads so they don’t interfere with the signal and then walking around each other to set the antennas down on the other tripod and not tangling the cords in the process. “They looked silly while doing it” said DeLoach and at some point the antenna swap started being referred to as “the Remondi Foxtrot.”

The article “Performing Centimeter-Level Surveys in Seconds with GPS Carrier Phase: Initial Results” (NAVIGATION Journal of The Institute of Navigation Winter 1985-1986) describes the initial tests: “The results of this experiment show that centimeter-level relative surveys can be performed in seconds. A priori geodetic coordinates of the initial location of the ‘roving’ antenna are not required since they too can be determined within seconds.”

Surveying with kinematic GPS—stopping only for a few seconds—seemed preposterous to many of Remondi’s colleagues. Until it didn’t. One scientist eventually apologized for his skepticism and receiver manufacturers started asking for the capability. “The antenna swap was greeted with a big ‘wow’ and without skepticism” Remondi said “meaning my work was beginning to be taken seriously.”

GPS commercial development: What can we do to keep the company going?

Alongside the scientific work of GPS technologists like Remondi were efforts by commercial GPS pioneers including Charles R. Trimble who founded the company in 1978 to initially focus on Loran-C a hyperbolic radio navigation system but in 1982 began developing receivers using GPS signals.

Unlike scientists at NGS or the Department of Defense who had access to the computer systems that tracked the GPS satellites and could develop the ephemeris data for their calculations surveyors needed receivers that could download and understand the ephemeris or orbital data.

In 1984 Trimble introduced one of the first GPS positioning products called the 4000A GPS Locator a C/A code receiver intended to replace Loran. The main users for the 4000A were hydrographic survey boats locating previously drilled holes over which to build oil platforms.

Then on Jan. 28 1986 the Space Shuttle Challenger was engulfed in flames 73 seconds into flight killing all seven crew members aboard. Also lost in the explosion was a satellite to enhance coverage worldwide. It would be two more years before additional GPS satellites could be launched.

Unlike other GPS manufacturers that were able to shift to other areas of production Trimble was invested almost exclusively in GPS. “Here was Charlie with a commercial company and all of a sudden the whole GPS program came to a halt because they could no longer launch satellites” said Mark Nichols general manager at Trimble and one of the company’s early RTK development leaders. “So he turned to Ron Hyatt who also came out of HP and said ‘What can we do with GPS to keep the company going when there aren’t enough satellites in the sky?’”

They shifted the company’s focus to time transfer because it was possible to get atomic clock accuracy timing out of a GPS receiver with only one or two satellites and also to the development of GPS static carrier-phase differential positioning for geodetic surveying.

“GPS entered into the surveying industry by virtue of Trimble looking for a commercial application after the Space Shuttle disaster” Nichols added. “And it was used initially for doing control surveys over long distances.”

Lawmakers in Austin approved another $100 million for the next two years allocating roughly the same amount to the so-called deal-closing fund as in recent legislative sessions.

That’s welcome news in Dallas-Fort Worth where projects over the years have won $289 million in enterprise awards more than any region in the state.

In the most recent two-year period D-FW companies won over three-quarters of the funds awarded. That includes millions in grants for Uber Technologies in Dallas Microsoft in Irving Texas Instruments in Richardson Wesco Aircraft Hardware in Fort Worth and the Professional Golfers’ Association of America in Frisco.

The question is: How much of the money will be well-spent?

From 2019 through 2020 four companies completed their enterprise deals as advertised according to the latest report to the Legislature from the governor’s office. But 15 companies terminated their contracts presumably because some wouldn’t meet their commitments.

The terminations freed up over $23 million to be returned to the fund. The state also clawed back $4 million more in awards because participants didn’t hit hiring numbers.

Some see those refunds as evidence of a flawed program while others believe the opposite — that they show the state’s increased oversight is working.

“We certainly see improvement in our monitoring and compliance” said Adriana Cruz executive director of Economic Development and Tourism for the Office of the Governor. “A lot of those payments and liquidated damages are from prior years and as those old contracts expire they’ll be even lower. There also may be no clawbacks because they’re all performance-based now.”

The fund was created in 2003 and in the early years it provided money to companies soon after they announced expansion plans. But a 2014 state audit found that the office of then-Gov. Rick Perry did not have good controls to monitor the process and company commitments. Almost half the money especially in the early years was awarded without contracts or specific job-creation pledges.

That led to major reforms and now taxpayer money is distributed only after hiring and investments have been made — and new jobs and wages confirmed. Companies receive about $1000 to $10000 per job depending on median wages capital investments and other details.

“Every year they’ve operated the enterprise fund the due diligence has gotten better” said Bill Sproull CEO of the Richardson Chamber of Commerce. “The return the state’s seeking the clawbacks in case the investment doesn’t happen the terms of the deal negotiated on the state’s behalf — they’re all better.

“From a taxpayer perspective you have to appreciate what the governor’s office has done to really tighten up that program” Sproull said.

After the 2014 audit the amount of reclaimed money soared. For the 2015-16 biennium the governor’s office collected over $19 million in clawbacks and termination payments from companies that hadn’t produced the specified results. Over $12 million more was returned as unencumbered funds which means the companies dropped out.

Combined over $31 million was returned to the enterprise fund. In 2017-18 nearly $36 million was returned although the total from clawbacks fell sharply.

In 2019-20 over $27 million was returned representing a decline in troubled deals. As Cruz said she expects the returned awards to continue to decline as older flawed contracts are replaced with ones that pay only after jobs are delivered.

In past legislative sessions there were efforts to cut corporate incentives including the enterprise fund. Last month lawmakers failed to authorize an extension of the Chapter 313 program which allows big projects to reduce their school taxes.

The 313 program started a few years before the enterprise fund and school districts have approved $10.8 billion in tax breaks over the past two decades. But the program has been riddled with abuses primarily around projects that were coming to Texas anyway — and still got the tax breaks.

While lawmakers opted to let funding for 313 run out at the end of 2022 they approved another $100 million for the enterprise fund.

“I hope this is a sign that our state legislators and leadership are comfortable with the program and how it’s being managed and operated” said Cruz who was appointed executive director of economic development in October 2019.

The enterprise fund was created not long after Boeing Co. selected Chicago over Dallas for its corporate headquarters. Elected leaders and economic development officials argued that Texas needed an extra incentive — more than the usual tax abatements — to win relocation contests against other states.

They settled on cash positioning the grants as the last “deal-closing” piece in the recruitment process. From late 2003 through March 2021 the fund made award offers to over 180 projects.

Recipients pledged to create at least 104507 direct jobs and invest $34.1 billion according to the latest quarterly update posted online. The enterprise fund made offers totaling nearly $679 million and through March it had distributed $539 million.

“In my opinion it’s the most valuable economic development tool we’ve got — because it’s cash” Sproull said. “It gives the state the ability to come in on any project that creates a lot of jobs and make an investment that’s meaningful to the company.”

During the pandemic there’s been an increase in corporate interest in the enterprise fund Cruz said. Her agency is getting about 70 inquiries a quarter from potential prospects roughly double the number it received before the pandemic.

Kelley Rendziperis of the Site Selection Group said the Dallas-based location consulting firm is busier than ever. It has a backlog of projects delayed by the pandemic many clients that want to reduce their existing footprint and companies whose businesses soared during the past year.

“Incentives are definitely at the forefront for most of the executive teams” she said “Because of the pandemic everybody is trying to be profitable and make [sound] economic decisions — and the incentive piece folds in there.”

Nathan Jensen a government professor at the University of Texas at Austin has criticized the state’s incentive programs including the enterprise fund. But he prefers cash awards to abatements especially on school taxes.

“I know it sounds weird but if you’re going to give incentives cash is a much more efficient way” Jensen said. “It can help startups that need capital. Cash grants also are more transparent. We know exactly how much is being given and people can decide whether they think it’s worth it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vc2NpdGVjaGRhaWx5LmNvbS9uYXNhLXN0cnVnZ2xlcy10by1maXgtZmFpbHVyZS1vZi1odWJibGUtc3BhY2UtdGVsZXNjb3Blcy0xOTgwcy1jb21wdXRlci9hbXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASA Struggles to Fix Failure of Hubble Space Telescope's 1980s Computer,"NASA continues to work on resolving an issue with the payload computer on the Hubble Space Telescope. The operations team will be running tests and collecting more information on the system to further isolate the problem. The science instruments will remain in a safe mode state until the issue is resolved. The telescope itself and science instruments remain in good health.

The computer halted on Sunday June 13. An attempt to restart the computer failed on Monday June 14. Initial indications pointed to a degrading computer memory module as the source of the computer halt. When the operations team attempted to switch to a back-up memory module however the command to initiate the backup module failed to complete. Another attempt was conducted on both modules Thursday evening to obtain more diagnostic information while again trying to bring those memory modules online. However those attempts were not successful.

The payload computer is a NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer-1 (NSSC-1) system built in the 1980s that is located on the Science Instrument Command and Data Handling unit. The computer’s purpose is to control and coordinate the science instruments and monitor them for health and safety purposes. It is fully redundant in that a second computer along with its associated hardware exists on orbit that can be switched over to in the event of a problem. Both computers can access and use any of four independent memory modules which each contain 64K of Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) memory. The payload computer uses only one memory module operationally at a time with the other three serving as backups.

“You will not be a father and you won’t get married” he said describing what one of his closest friends told him when he came out as gay during graduate school.

Those words went on to shape his career and his identity.

The journey of coming out can be daunting for anyone who identifies as LGBTQ. For the leader of a luxury fashion chain it’s an intensely personal story that he’s sharing to influence others to be true to themselves especially during Pride Month.

Van Raemdonck 49 calls it being his “authentic self.” He considers it liberating to blend his identity as a gay man with his work leading the Dallas retail chain.

The fashion industry is known for its acceptance of all lifestyles. Van Raemdonck wants Neiman Marcus to become known as a leader in offering inclusive benefits to its over 9000 workers.

“When you accept who you are and you put it out there there is nothing to defend” van Raemdonck said in an interview with The Dallas Morning News. “People can decide not to accept you but that’s their problem. I am not defending who I am. What you see is the authentic self.”

Now in his fourth year at the helm van Raemdonck led Neiman Marcus into and out of one of the darkest periods in the storied company’s history: bankruptcy. It emerged after shedding $4 billion in debt that constrained the company for years.

With financial woes in his rearview mirror van Raemdonck turned his attention to matching the company’s benefits to his own identity.

“We live in a world where we need diversity of thought and backgrounds” he said.

The need for diversity

As a young professional studying for his MBA at the University of Chicago van Raemdonck describes a night in his personal journey when he met a man and spent the evening in engaging conversation. He considers it “one of the most beautiful moments of my life.”

It was the “most natural thing — that’s when I realized this is who I am and this is who I connect with” van Raemdonck told employees and other attendees at a recent Neiman Marcus Pride celebration.

In 2016 he married interior designer Alvise Orsini in New York City. The couple moved from Paris when van Raemdonck got the Neiman Marcus job.

Van Raemdonck said he spent a lot of his life defending who he is and sometimes hiding his identity. During the company’s bankruptcy he and Orsini faced a barrage of criticism when a luxury publication featured their contemporary $2.3 million home in Dallas’ Lakewood neighborhood that Orsini decorated. It’s where the couple raises their twin sons.

In the past three years van Raemdonck said Neiman Marcus has looked to give more women leadership roles. Of the company’s seven-member board of directors four are women. The company’s executive team is 48% women and 100% of Bergdorf Goodman’s leadership team are women. The company’s overall workforce is 70% women.

“It’s really a one-way street” van Raemdonck said. “We are going to commit to a journey.”

Van Raemdonck said he admires the retailer’s founders for being “inclusive” leaders during the company’s inception in 1907 when the first store opened in Dallas.

“It’s been part of the DNA” he said. “We are a company that was co-founded by a woman” — Carrie Marcus Neiman.

In 1950 the board selected Carrie Marcus Neiman as its chair alongside CEO Stanley Marcus and executive vice president Edward Marcus. Moira Cullen a colleague of Carrie’s was the company’s first buyer paving the way for more women to enter leadership roles at Neiman Marcus.

Todd Sears founder and CEO of OUT Leadership which works with companies on inclusion efforts for LGBTQ identities said developing sound recruitment and retention strategies must accompany top executives speaking out.

“The business community is the strongest force for equality” Sears said.

OUT Leadership produces a business climate index that measures state laws and attitudes on LGBTQ issues. The lowest a state can score on the index is 25% and the highest is 100%. In 2020 Texas received a 38% rating. That improved to 45% this year. Texas ranks 41st in the nation.

Adding benefits

In honor of Pride Month Neiman Marcus is launching several initiatives to support its LGBTQ employees.

One is an effort to improve the company’s score on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index an annual ranking of policies practices and benefits pertinent to LGBTQ employees. More than 1142 companies nationally took part this year.

There were 767 companies at the top of list with 100% scores giving them bragging rights as best places to work for LGBTQ equality. North Texas-based companies American Airlines McKesson Corp. Texas Instruments Inc. and others made the list. So did van Raemdonck’s former employer Ralph Lauren Corp.

Neiman Marcus estimates it will score around 85% when the index is released for 2022.

To improve its ranking the company decided to update its code of ethics to include gender identity and expression make medical and soft benefits for same-sex spouses and domestic partners equal to that of other employees offer insurance plans to workers identifying as transgender create gender transition guidelines for supportive bathrooms and dress codes and implement new associate training and recruitment efforts.

“The new benefits that roll out this month and throughout 2021 complement [Neiman Marcus Group’s] outward celebration of the LGBTQ community with meaningful internal investments in equitable access to health insurance relocation assistance associate discounts and legal protections against discrimination for LGBTQ associates and their loved ones” said Mimi Sterling the company’s vice president for environmental social and governance and belonging.

To foster dialogue among employees van Raemdonck hosted a virtual event June 9 with Andrew Gelwicks author of The Queer Advantage where they discussed their personal identity journeys and how to become an ally for LGBTQ individuals. He is also participating in a virtual event with Retail Leaders Industry Association president Brian Dodge in late June.

Most storefront windows in Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores are displaying LGBTQ pride support and in-store visuals this month. Neiman Marcus stores are also raising money for the Human Rights Campaign through point-of-sale donations and “More Colors More Pride” lapel pins online and in 10 locations.

A look forward

For van Raemdonck the world is moving fast and he said that requires everyone to adjust their thinking.

At the June 9 Zoom event he told the audience of 220 that his 85-year-old grandmother had once introduced him and an ex-boyfriend as her grandchildren.

“She basically said ‘This is my family love it or not’” van Raemdonck said.

It made him realize that if his grandmother could accept and appreciate his identity so should everyone else.

“We all need to adjust and learn. We cannot rely on one single model. We cannot rely on what was true in the past” van Raemdonck said. “When you are faced with change when you are faced with the unknown your best ability to handle it is to be able to recognize what is new and what is different and to internalize and grow.”",,,

The “Silver Circle” is a sign of longevity in television and the Philadelphia market specifically and serves as a kind of recognition for lifetime achievement. Schwartz has been with WCAU-TV since 1996 shortly after it switched from being a CBS to an NBC-owned station. In his 25 years here he could honestly claim he is the most significant weather personality of his time and possibly of all time in the market. It is doubtful any local viewer has not heard of “Hurricane” whether or not they are as familiar with the name Glenn Schwartz.

While telling Schwartz about his honor Connors and London asked him to recount how he became involved in television and acquired the nickname now part of his introduction “Hurricane.”

Schwartz said he was recruited by the Weather Channel after he appeared on television as a source from the National Weather Service in Atlanta. Though he never intended a television career Schwartz said yes to the opportunity.

Some of his first on-air spots involved him going to scenes of hurricanes. He was one the reporters blown and buffeted by high winds while strapped to a pole as waters roared and rose. Naturally Glenn who wanted to be a meteorologist ever since I knew him in high school – We graduated in the same class of Central High. The year can remain a mystery. – explained about hurricanes to his audience.

Since he has been on Philadelphia television the science of meteorology has been a part of storm and other weather coverage. Glenn led a way now practiced by his Channel 10 colleagues as well as Channel 29’s Kathy Orr and Sue Serio Channel 6’s Cecily Tynan and Adam Joseph and Channel 3’s Kate Bilo.

The “Silver Circle” is not an award. It is a society of honor that pays tribute to an individual’s contributions to broadcasting and local television in general. To qualify a television personality technician or execute must be active for 25 years in the area the Mid-Atlantic chapter serves which includes all of Pennsylvania and parts of New Jersey Delaware Maryland West Virginia Ohio and New York. The Mid-Atlantic chapter of NATAS also has a “Gold Circle” for those whose local careers span at least 50 years.

Schwartz is only the second meteorologist to be admitted to the Silver Circle. Fox 29’s Sue Serio was honored in 2018.

‘College Bowl’ feeds the trivia monster

It’s no secret I love quiz shows particular those that require genuine knowledge whether of high culture or trivia.

This “love” is lifelong and was fed in my youth by the original daytime run of “Jeopardy!” with Art James and the late Sunday afternoon competition on “College Bowl” moderated by Allen Ludden.

“College Bowl” was exciting. It pitted teams from different colleges against each other as Ludden peppered them with questions that could range from advanced math and arcane history to popular fiction and current events. Teams could consult and usually you could pick out the math and science experts from the liberal arts specialists and overall generalists.

“Jeopardy!” is the one of the few programs I make a regular appointment to watch. I tape it and view it later during seasons when I’m at the theater at 7 p.m.

Today I am excited because “College Bowl” officially called “Capital One College Bowl” because of the sponsorship of the bank and credit card company is returning to weekly air. The first showdown between two collegiate teams takes place at 10 p.m. tomorrow on NBC (Channel 10).

The format for this “College Bowl” is slightly different from what viewers saw in ’50s and ’60s when Ludden presided.

Rather than have an ongoing series of teams representing different schools the new “College Bowl” will feature 12 colleges who will compete in a bracket system. The school that wins the overall “College Bowl” competition will receive important recognition from Capital One which is investing more than $1 million in scholarships and other perks.

The schools in this season’s competition are the University of Alabama Auburn University Columbia University the University of Michigan the University of Minnesota the University of Mississippi Morehouse College the University of Tennessee UCLA USC the University of Virginia and Xavier of Louisiana.

Yep no local schools so Channel 10 viewers can choose their favorites as the teams appear.

The hosts of “College Bowl” may also be a surprise.

Allen Ludden moderated the show for two years on radio before it moved to television. Ludden one might remember from his years on “Password” was professorish is his approach and had a demeanor that made you think he knew the answers to questions and problems he was posing.

The new “College Bowl” features two brothers whose sibling rivalry looks as if it will be as intense as the battle between schools.

They are Peyton Manning one of the best football quarterbacks of all time and his older less famous brother Cooper Manning a real estate mogul who is also the host of a Fox sports program.

The Mannings are executive producers of “College Bowl” along with their younger brother Eli like Peyton a famous quarterback and Richard Reid who helped create the original show and who has kept the “College Bowl” concept alive via non-televised competitions at schools over several decades.

The Mannings bring a certain rah-rah mood to the setting but the game will be the same as it was in Ludden’s days or Dick Cavett’s who was host of “College Bowl” during a brief revival in the ’80s. It will be a test of bright students’ knowledge.

Golf a welcome break from news

An unusual event that feeds into a new addiction of mine took place on Friday both surprising and delighting me.

“Channel 10 News” at 5:30 p.m. didn’t segue as usual into “Channel 10 News” at 6. When Rosemary Connors and Jacqueline London signed off the 5:30 they were replaced by NBC coverage of the “U.S. Open.”

I wrote last week that a recent Sunday afternoon on which I was too tired to change channels found me watching a golf tournament and actually finding myself interested in a sport I could historically and gladly ignore.

While I was interested in whatever news may have been in store on the 6 I immediately got involved in the golf choosing a favorite and except for a break at 7 to watch “Jeopardy! tuned back to it and stayed with NBC to watch Olympics trials in swimming shotput and track.

The 2021 Olympics delayed a year from their original 2020 date via COVID begin in Tokyo next month with NBC and its offshoots carrying them.

I was trying to think of another time when local news was pre-empted by a network program. Except for one incident in the ’80s when CBS aired a different U.S. Open the tennis competition from Long Island in lieu of Dan Rather’s national newscast I couldn’t.

Naturally Channels 3 6 and 29 aired their news programs as scheduled. I could have roosted on one of them but I chose to return to Channel 10 and golf. On Saturday afternoon I also tuned into golf. Who knew that after decades of never thinking about golf I’d find it its strategy and its skill so fascinating? Golf genuinely entertains me and I find golf announcers go off on fewer tangents than play-by-play folks in other sports.

And to think if I hadn’t been watching Channel 10 at 5:30 I would never have known about the pre-emption or the golf.

Wilmington native is ‘Jeopardy!’ champ

Speaking of “Jeopardy!” – again! – tonight’s defending champion seen at 7 p.m. on Channel 6 is Emily White announced as a public relations specialist from Wilmington Del.

Tonight will mark White’s third consecutive time on the show. So far she has amassed more than $50000 in winnings. She is well-rounded in her knowledge calm while giving her answers and easily someone for whom we in the Delaware Valley can root.

All of White’s appearances have been with current guest host Savannah Guthrie from NBC’s “Today Show.”

Guthrie started out tentatively. Her first few shows were boring with her doing the minimum and breaking habit with iconic “Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek by making a travesty of pronouncing foreign names and places. As the week went on Guthrie became more personable kibitzing more easily with contestants and adding comments that went beyond the “yes” “you’re right” and “sorry no” that were the extent of her first two nights’ vocabulary.

Guthrie also became more attentive to accurate pronunciation and by Friday was better able than any previous guest host is copying Mr. Trebek’s trait of seeming as if he knew the answer to every clue from his personal bank of information.

So far no guest host has been perfect but my favorites have been Ken Jennings Bill Whitaker Dr. Mehmet Oz Mayim Bialik Aaron Rodgers and “Jeopardy!” producer Mike Richards. Rodgers may not have had the polish of some of the actors and broadcasters but he made up for it with a natural way of speaking to the contestants some sharp and even corny comments and a look of joy about what he was doing.

All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco ref. no. 61965) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen ref. no. 10270-106 lot no. 42G8468K) at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 .

Chemicals

Z-VAD-FMK was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (ref. no. BML-P416-0001). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Microsynth Balgach Switzerland. Cisplatin (ref. no. P4394-25MG) was acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. Propidium iodide (PI Sigma-Aldrich #81845) was stored at −20 °C after being aliquoted (400 μg/ml) in water.

Colony formation assays

After incubation with the treatments mentioned in the figures cells were trypsinized and counted as described above. The cells were then seeded in 100 mm × 20 mm plates (Corning ref. no. 430167) at a density of 500 cells/ well. Ten days later the plates were washed with 10 ml PBS dried upside down for 1 h fixed with 100% ethanol (Reactolab ref. no. 15058) for 1 h and finally dried for an additional hour. Thereupon cells were stained with 10 ml Giemsa solution (AppliChem ref. no. A0885 lot no. 5×001792) for 30 min. The Giemsa solution was removed and the background staining was eliminated by gently immersing the plates once or twice (until background removal) in an ice bucket (Bel-Art™ ref. no. M18848-4002) filled with 3 liters of water. Finally plates were dried and colonies (clusters of at least 2 cells) and single cells were counted using a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope.

CRISPR/Cas9-mediated CASP3 and CASP7 gene disruptions

The generation of the CASP3/CASP7 DKO HCT116 cell was done using a stepwise approach. CASP3 knock-out (KO) HCT116 cells were first generated and then used to knock-out CASP7. Knocking-out CASP3 was achieved following transient transfection of sgRNA[hCaspase-3] [2]. ltiCRISPRv2 in HCT116. Transient transfection was used to avoid permanent expression of Cas9 in cells. For the transfection X-tremeGENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich ref. no.: 06 365 809 001) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly 120000 cells were plated in 6 well plates (Corning ref. no. 3516) containing 2 ml of DMEM (Gibco ref. no. 61965). The following day 100 μl Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific 11058021) were added in a sterile tube together with the siRNA oligonucleotides. Then 2.5 μl of X-tremeGENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent were added and the content was mixed. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature the mixture was added dropwise in the wells containing the cells. Cells that were not transfected were eliminated by the addition 24 h post-infection of 3 μg/ml of puromycin for 72 h. Clone isolation was performed by limiting dilution in 96-wells plates. Twelve U2OS clones and nine HCT116 clones were obtained through this procedure. The presence or the absence of CASP3 and Cas9 was assessed by western blotting (Supplementary Fig. S6). The sequences in the vicinity of the region targeted by the CRISPR/Cas9 system were determined in the clones lacking CASP3 and Cas9 following PCR amplification of the regions of interest using the primers listed in Supplementary Table 5 cloning the PCR fragments into pCR®2.1 vector using TA cloning (Life technologies ref n°K202020) according to manufacturer’s instructions and sequencing of the inserts of these plasmids.

Using a validated CASP3 KO cell clone the same procedure as above was used to disrupt the CASP7 alleles. The functionality of these CASP3/CASP7 DKO HCT116 cells was performed analyzing their ability to cleave PARP-1. It was abolished (Supplementary Fig. S6).

Flow cytometry

Cells (120000 per well) were seeded in 6 well plates containing 2 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. The following day cells were treated as indicated in the figures. Cells were pelleted washed with cold PBS and resuspended in 500 µl cold PBS containing 3 μg/ml of propidium iodide to stain dead cells. Samples were transferred to cytometer tubes (Sarstedt #55.1759) and analyzed by flow cytometry (FC-500 Beckman Coulter) as described [34]. Data were analyzed with the Kaluza (Version 1.2) software (Beckman Coulter). Gating parameters are described in Supplementary Table 2.

Plasmids

Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the proteins of interest (CASP3 and CASP7) were selected from a published library made available by the Feng Zhang’s laboratory [35]. Plasmids sgRNA[hCaspase-3] [2].ltiCRISPRv2 (#1010) and sgRNA[hCaspase-7] [5].ltiCRISPRv2 (#1011) targeting CASP3 and CASP7 respectively were created according to the protocol described in ref. [36] using the oligonucleotides listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Plasmid psPAX2 (#842) (Addgene ref. no. 12260) is a second-generation lentiviral packaging vector and pMD2.G plasmid (#554 Addgene ref. no. 12259) encodes the lentivirus envelope. VC3AI.lti (#852) a lentiviral vector encoding a Venus-based caspase-3-like sensor was a gift from Binghui Li (Laboratory of Cancer Cell Biology Key Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital Tianjin 300060 China). The lentiviral lentiCRISPR v2 (#868) was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid # 52961; http://n2t.net/addgene:52961; RRID:Addgene_52961) (ref. 37).

Slice-SILAC methodology

A. SILAC labeling

VC3AI HCT116 CASP3/ CASP7DKO VC3AI HCT116 and VC3AI U2OS cells were cultured in SILAC-compatible DMEM medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific ref. n°89985) supplemented with either “light” (L) or “heavy” (H) stable isotope-labeled L-arginine and 150 mg/l of L-lysine to obtain a final concentration of 50 mg/l and 150 mg/l respectively. These amino acids were purchased from Sigma: proline 0 (ref. n° P-5607) arginine 0Footnote 1 (ref. no. A-8094) lysine 0 (ref. no. L5501) lysine+8 (ref. no. CNLM-291-H0.1) arginine +10 (ref. no. CNLM-539-H0.1). The media were supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich F0392 lot no. 16M280-A) and L-proline 0 (final concentration of 200 mg/l). The addition of L-proline 0 is to prevent the conversion of arginine to proline [38]. Cells went through 6 cell cycle of divisions before assessing by mass spectrometry the levels of labeled amino acids in actin. At this point labeling was higher than 95% and no proline conversion was detected. Two more cell divisions were allowed to proceed to enrich the labeling further. The cells were then used as indicated in the next sections. H-labeled cell extracts were used as reference while all treated samples were L-labeled.

B. Induction of stress and protein extraction and quantification

Cells were seeded at a density of 120’000 cells/well in 6 well plates (Corning ref. no. 3516). The following day cells were treated or not with 4 µM cisplatin (non-lethal stress condition) or 32 µM (apoptotic condition) for 48 h. Cells were then lysed in FASP buffer (4% of sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS] 0.1 M of DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT) and 100 mM of Tris pH 7.5). The lysates were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and sonicated for 3 cycles of 5 s followed by centrifugation at 16000 g for 10 min to pellet nuclei and cellular debris. Then the soluble cell extracts were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Proteins present in the gel were detected with Coomassie staining. Gels were imaged and protein concentrations were determined by densitometry scanning of whole lanes of SDS/PAGE gels [39].

C. Protein separation and mass spectrometry

Lysates of light and heavy amino acid-labeled cells were mixed at a quantitative ratio of 1:1. A total of 120 μg of protein from mixed lysates was migrated on a pre-cast 4–12% Novex NuPAGE Bis-Tris SDS Mini Gel (Invitrogen). Entire lanes were cut into 46 identical gel slices using GridCutter (Gelcompany). In-gel proteolytic cleavage with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) was performed as described [40]. The peptides from the digestion were dried and redissolved in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid 2% acetonitrile for analysis with liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Samples were injected on a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer interfaced via a nano EASY-Spray source to an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC system (Thermo Scientific). After loading onto a trapping microcolumn Acclaim PepMap100 C18 (20 mm×100 μm ID 5 μm Thermo Scientific) peptides were separated on a reversed-phase Easy Spray C18 column (50 cm×75 µm ID 2 µm 100 Å Thermo Scientific). A 4-76% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% formic acid (total time 65 min) was used for the separation with a flow of 250 nl/minute. Full MS survey scans were performed at 70000 resolution. In data-dependent acquisition controlled by Xcalibur 3.0.63 software (Thermo Scientific) the 10 most intense multiply charged precursor ions detected in the full MS survey scan were selected for higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD normalized collision energy NCE = 27%) and analyzed in the orbitrap at 17’500 resolution. The window for precursor isolation was of 1.5 m/z units around the precursor and selected fragments were excluded for 60 s from further analysis.

D. MS data analysis

MS data were analyzed and quantified using the MaxQuant software (version 1.5.3.3) (ref. 41) and the Andromeda search engine set to mine the human proteome in the UniProt database (UniProt proteome ID: UP000005640 version of July 2017 number of sequences: 20987). Trypsin was defined in MaxQuant as the enzyme used to digest the proteins (selected setting: “cleavage after lysine and arginine”). As complete protein digestion often does not occur [42] peptides with up to two uncut arginine/lysine (i.e. 2 missed cleavages) were taken into account. As proteins were subjected to DTT to reduce their disulfide bonds the carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification while N-terminal acetylation of protein and oxidation of methionine were specified as variable modifications. Protein identifications were filtered at 1% false discovery rate established against a reversed database according to default MaxQuant parameters. Sets of protein sequences which could not be discriminated based on identified peptides were listed together as protein groups. MaxQuant analysis used an experimental design file in which every dataset corresponding to a gel slice was quantified separately as a distinct experiment numbered as the gel slice it corresponded to. According to this previously described method [43] results from MaxQuant were then filtered and processed further with custom-built R scripts. The main MaxQuant result (proteinGroups.txt) was filtered to identify proteins present in at least two distinct gel slices with different SILAC ratios. A molecular weight (MW) scale of the gel slices was built based on a polynomial regression fit of protein theoretical weights. Proteins with an H/L ratio below 4 and probable contaminant proteins observed in more than 30% of the slices were not used for the regression fit. Just proteins present in at least two gel slices with a minimum H/L ratio of 2 in every slice and present in at least one slice with a log 2 (H/L) value higher and or lower to 0.5 were considered and displayed in the raw data.

To assign proteins as post-translationally modified they have to have for a given cell line and a given stress exposure the same log 2 (H/L) value pattern in at least two experiments. Further visual classification according to their exhibited PTM (discrete fragmentation ubiquitination tagging) was then performe. Supplementary Table 3 indicates the number of experiments performed for each condition and cell line.

Popviz interface

PopViz is a multitier web application with a backend written in PHP (v5.5) (ref. 44) using the Slim framework (v3.9) (ref. 45). The frontend is based on ReactJS (v16.0) (ref. 46) and most of the visualization is done using the D3.js library (v4.11) (ref. 47). MongoDB (v3.6) (ref. 48) is used to store and query the data. The database is populated with JSON objects that are created by processing MaxQuant result files (proteinGroups.txt and peptides.txt) using the statistical programming language R (v3.6) (ref. 49).

The first step in data processing was to remove from the proteinGroups.txt file entries marked as “Potential contaminant”. Furthermore entries matching an additional list of known contaminants were removed using an R package provided at https://github.com/UNIL-PAF/PAFcontaminants. To determine the relationship between migration distance in the SLICE-SILAC gel and the molecular masses of the migrated proteins a third-degree polynomial function was fitted to a plot of theoretical protein masses against its slice position in the gel. Normalization of the H/L ratios was done using a zero-median normalization for each slice. Slice-to-mass fitting and normalization were done for each dataset separately.

The Popviz interface also provides information on cleavage sites derived from a database [50] generated and hosted by the Melbourne University (https://sunflower.kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~sjn/Cascleave/database.html). This database uses a collection of different databases on protein cleavage such as The CASBAH [20] MEROPS [51] and CASVM [52]. It contains 370 caspase substrate sequences and 562 cleavage sites. After filtering slice-to-mass fitting normalization and adding the cleavage information a separate JSON entry for each protein group was created. Only proteins listed in “Majority protein IDs” are considered as valid proteins. For every protein the corresponding peptide information was parsed and added from the peptides.txt file.

The source code described here used to create PopViz is available on GitHub [53] and archived in Zenodo [54] (PopViz backend: DOI 10.5281/zenodo.4335268 and PopViz frontend: DOI 10.5281/zenodo.4337164).

Secernin-1 and Telo2 siRNAs

To validate the antibodies against Secernin-1 and Telo2 these proteins were downregulated with specific siRNAs (Supplementary Table 4). They were designed using the bioinformatics tool “siRNA at Whitehead” (http://sirna.wi.mit.edu/home.php) considering the Consensus CDS sequences CCDS5422.1 and CCDS32363.1 for Secernin-1 and Telo2 respectively. We verified that these siRNAs targeted all the protein isoforms using SliceCenter [55].

siRNA transfection

Cells were seeded in 2 ml of culture medium in 6-well plates at a 150000 cells/well density. Twenty-four hours later cells were transfected with 20 nM siRNAs for a period of 48 h using the X-tremeGENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich ref. no.: 06 365 809 001) as described in section “CRISPR/Cas9-mediated CASP3 and CASP7 gene disruptions”.

VC3AI HCT116 VC3AI U2OS and CASP3/CASP7 DKO VC3AI HCT116 cell line generation

Lentiviruses encoding the VC3AI executioner caspase sensor [36] were produced as described [56] with the following modification: pMD.G (#218) and pCMVΔR8.91 (#219) were replaced by pMD2.G and psPAX2 (#842) respectively and the lentiviral vector used was VC3AI.lti (#852).

HEK293T cells were co-transfected with 12.5 µg of pMD2.G (#554) 37.5 µg of psPAX2 and 50 µg of VC3AI.lti.cm3.dna using the calcium phosphate method [57]. The supernatant was collected 48 post-transfection and centrifuged at 16000 g for 5 min to harvest the virus. U2OS HCT116 and CASP3/CASP7 DKO HCT116 cell lines were infected with the viruses and selected with 3 µg/ml of puromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific A1113802 lot no. 1970741) for 48 h. Clone isolation was performed for VC3AI HCT116 and VC3AI U2OS by limiting dilution in 96-well tissue culture plates in the absence of puromycin. The VC3AI HCT116 and VC3AI U2OS clone validations and the whole cell population CASP3/CASP7 DKO VC3AI HCT116 confirmation was carried out by western blotting using an anti-GFP antibody as previously described [58] to detect the Venus-derived CASP3/7 activity sensor encoded by the VC3AI.lti plasmid (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Western blot

Following the treatments described in the figures cells were trypsinized as described in the “Cell counting” section washed with 10 ml PBS pelleted and lysed for 15 min in 50 µl NP40 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl 150 mM NaCl 1% NP40) containing phosphatase (PhosSTOP™ Sigma-Aldrich ref. no. 4906837001) and protease inhibitors (cOmplete™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Sigma-Aldrich ref no. 04693116001). Then samples were centrifuged at 15000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford procedure [59] and 40 µg of each sample were then diluted in Laemmli 5x sample buffer (312 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8 10% SDS 50% glycerol 25% β-mercaptoethanol 0.1% bromophenol blue) and boiled at 95 °C for 10 min before being loaded on 10% (for PARP1 detection) or 12% (for caspase-3 and caspase-7 detection) SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to a 0.45 µm nitrocellulose membranes (Biorad; ref. no. 1620115) and then membranes were blocked for one hour at room temperature in 5% non-fat milk diluted in TBST [130 mM NaCl 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) 18 mM HCl 0.1% Tween-20] and then they were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking with primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution in TBST 5% non-fat milk). Membranes were then washed three times for 20 min with TBST and then incubated for one hour at room temperature with the secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution in TBST 5% non-fat milk). After three additional washing with TBST western blots were imaged using the Odyssey Infrared Imager (LI-COR 9120).",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Federal Trade Commission as well as consumer groups and rental companies are warning travelers about schemes that lure them into booking phony reservations through fake customer service numbers and websites.

The problem is that rental car companies have been whipsawed in the pandemic dealing first with a sudden and extended drop in demand and now with an equally sudden increase in bookings. The result has been higher prices and more challenges in reserving cars during peak times in popular tourist areas. That may leave customers vulnerable to bogus offers that appear to provide the car not only that they want but at a seemingly more reasonable rate said Emily Wu a lawyer with the Federal Trade Commission’s division of consumer and business education.

“There’s a lot less availability of rental cars” Ms. Wu said.

Recent complaints to the AARP Fraud Watch Network and the Better Business Bureau describe similar schemes. In some cases consumers did not realize they had been duped until they showed up at the rental counter to learn there was no record of their reservation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL21pZGRsZS1lYXN0L3VhZS1zdXNwZW5kLWVudHJ5LXRyYXZlbGxlcnMtZmxpZ2h0cy1saWJlcmlhLXNpZXJyYS1sZW9uZS1uYW1pYmlhLXdhbS0yMDIxLTA2LTE5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UAE to suspend entry from three countries Dubai updates travel protocols,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uae-suspend-entry-travellers-flights-liberia-sierra-leone-namibia-wam-2021-06-19/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL21pZGRsZS1lYXN0L3VhZS1zdXNwZW5kLWVudHJ5LXRyYXZlbGxlcnMtZmxpZ2h0cy1saWJlcmlhLXNpZXJyYS1sZW9uZS1uYW1pYmlhLXdhbS0yMDIxLTA2LTE5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRldHJvaXRuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvMjAyMS8wNi8yMC90b3VyaXNtLXJldHVybnMtbWljaGlnYW4tbWlnaHQtbm90LWJlLXJlYWR5Lzc2NTM1NzUwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tourism is returning and Michigan might not be ready,"Your subscription supports:

Tokoto at UNC,"North Carolina is once again trying to keep it in the family. Class of 2022 point guard Seth Trimble has emerged as one of North Carolina's top targets for this cycle and took an official visit to UNC on Wednesday and Thursday.

A 6-foot-3 185-pound prospect from Menomonee Falls Wis. Trimble is ranked No. 54 overall in the nation and is the No. 9 ranked point guard

Trimble is the younger brother of J.P. Tokoto who accompanied the 247Sports Composite four-star on his trip to Chapel Hill. Tokoto played at UNC from 2012-2015. Multiple members of Trimble's family were also there.

Check out pictures of Trimble and Tokoto below:

On May 22 247Sports Director of Recruiting Eric Bossi noted the improvement of Trimble that would in turn boost his ranking. ""Things have really been heating up for four-star point guard Seth Trimble of Phenom U/Team Herro this spring and it is easy to see why"" Bossi wrote. ""As athletic a point guard as there is in the class of 2022 Trimble is put together quick and exploits even the slightest of openings in a defense. Lose him for a second and he’s going to dunk on you.

""Trimble is a pretty good passer on top of that and the potential and ability he shows on the defensive end thanks to his ability to move his feet is nothing to sneeze at.""

247Sports basketball recruiting analyst Jerry Meyer is impressed with Trimble's physical traits and athleticism.

""A physically well-built point guard at 6-3. Tremendous athleticism. An off-the-charts leaper off two feet. Slashes to the basket either direction with strength quickness and composure"" Meyer wrote in Trimble's profile page analysis. ""More of a penetrator but also shoots the ball well. Has a high arcing shot with a smooth release. Gets elevation on his dribble pull-up. Finds open teammates with the pass but loves to get to the rim. Rebounds his position at a high level and has tremendous potential as a multi positions defender.""

Trimble's brother J.P. Tokoto is one of the more athletic and better dunkers in UNC basketball history. Part of Carolina's 2012 signing class with Marcus Paige Brice Johnson and Joel James Tokoto played in 107 games and started 67 (33 as a sophomore and 34 as a junior) during his Carolina career. He averaged 9.3 points and 5.8 rebounds as a sophomore and 8.3 points and 5.6 rebounds as a junior.

Tokoto left UNC after his junior season to pursue a professional career. He was selected No. 58 overall by the Philadelphia 76ers. Tokoto never played in the NBA bouncing around NBA Summer Leagues and G-League teams before taking his game overseas where he has played in Australia Spain and Israel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vYW1lcmlzdXJ2LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzIwL2hpc3Rvcnktb2YtcnRrLXBhcnQtMi1ydGstcm9vdHMtcnVuLWRlZXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,History of RTK—Part 2: RTK Roots Run Deep,"When it comes to Real Time Kinematic (RTK) full appreciation of its development trajectory means never forgetting its roots especially the predecessor technologies and research steppingstones that advanced the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) for static and kinematic surveying.

In this second article exploring the history of RTK we focus mostly on the 1980s to look at what confirmed or inspired further exploration of GPS for land and marine surveying and foreshadowed an intense period of development (to come in Part 3) in the first half of the 1990s as geodesists scientists and engineers tried to build the perfect system.

Cornerstone: Using extraterrestrial systems for centimeter-level accuracy

The development of satellite geodesy would rest on the foundation of using phase differencing for high-accuracy baseline determination such as was used with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). GPS which launched its first satellite in 1978 was designed to use code-based signals for real time accuracies of 3-to-5 meters horizontal and 10-to-15 meters vertical but there was so much more potential.

Clever scientists determined they could use GPS satellites in a similar way using two receivers to interpret its non-code signals called carrier-phase signals for precise measurement to the accuracy of centimeters. This was known as carrier-phase differential GPS positioning and a host of individuals started developing software algorithms for extracting and processing that data as well as developing techniques to improve GPS surveying capabilities.

One of those individuals was Dr. Benjamin W. Remondi a GPS technologist for the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) who in the early 1980s began a long productive career in static and kinematic positioning based primarily on GPS observations. His body of work over several decades included more than 50 technical papers on methods still in use today such as the triple differencing method the antenna exchange method and the kinematic survey method. Researchers in the field would come to refer to him as “the father of Real Time Kinematic survey.”

Meter-level positioning at sea

Prior to Remondi’s research there were also technologies that routinely used broadcast radio waves for meter-level positioning of marine vessels performing engineering and construction work in the world’s ports and harbors.

One was Raydist a marine navigation system that relied on carrier signals broadcast from land-based shore stations. In the 1940s engineer Charles Hastings developed a method to measure the phase shift of a signal superimposed on radio waves transmitted between aircraft and a ground station. This led to the Raydist radio wave system for accurately measuring distance through continuous wave phase comparison.

Raydist was in use for hydrographic positioning and dredging when Steve DeLoach a civil engineer and land surveyor began working for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). “We had to run geodetic control along all the nation’s bays rivers and harbors to establish stations to locate the Raydist towers and had to set ‘spar buoys’ along the shipping channels as known points and locate these geodetically with multiple angle resections from shore” said DeLoach now retired. “These spar buoys were often many miles offshore bobbing about. The boat would pull alongside and the captain would yell ‘mark’ so the Raydist operator could enter the correct number of cycles from the two base stations.”

As a young engineer DeLoach was dumbfounded at the Raydist system’s mass of paper tape whirling analog dials massive ships’ power systems (fire hazards) and no vertical positioning. “All vertical information was from a tide station that was miles away therefore in significant error.”

But those issues aside Raydist represented the same type of solution as GPS ambiguity resolution making GPS carrier-phase positioning worth pursuing for hydrographic surveying. “The method of using a known static point to ‘resolve integers’ is exactly what the old 1960s Raydist system did in the marine environment” DeLoach said.

Comparing Raydist and other marine navigation systems was a way to prove that GPS could actually work and provide compatible results and those results also helped DeLoach make his case with USACE for funding in the late 1980s for a major project to develop a GPS carrier-phase positioning system for hydrographic surveying and dredging that would lead to RTK development.

“Raydist counts lanes of phase difference and that is exactly what geodetic GPS does” DeLoach said. “It’s the same basic math problems—just complicated by satellites orbiting versus base stations on the ground.”

Remondi would join the dredging project team in 1989 as one of its key problem-solvers but before that phase of development could begin other steppingstones on the way to RTK needed to be found.

Centimeter GPS positioning on land

The Macrometer was another predecessor technology demonstrating centimeter-level accuracy in GPS positioning. In the 1980s Charles Counselman a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) led the development of the Macrometer V-1000. According to a 2010 article on Counselman by MIT Technology Review a NASA scientist labeled Counselman’s invention as “snake oil” but would soon be proven wrong as it represented a new way to harness GPS by combining expertise in radio and astronomy.

Counselman proved his technology in a series of demonstrations in the early 1980s and was subsequently granted 36 patents. But while the Macrometer demonstrated extraordinary accuracy it had downsides for everyday civilian surveying uses. It was expensive heavy took two people to carry and had to be transported in a utility vehicle. Even so it would play an important role in research on the way to more streamlined and nimble commercial GPS systems.

“Today GPS receivers embodying Chuck’s technologies are portable inexpensive and ubiquitous” noted a 2008 article when Counselman received the Charles A. Whitten Medal from the American Geophysical Union. “Look under the hood and you’ll find many of his basic patents inside.”

GPS data simulation for precise carrier phase data

After earlier work in orbital mechanics and software development (see Part 1) Remondi was hired in 1981 by Admiral John Bossler and Dr. Clyde Goad to work at the NGS to solve “a most important problem”—using GPS for surveying at centimeter-level accuracy.

At the time there was no carrier data so Remondi’s first activity was to write a GPS data simulator for precise carrier phase data. During that time Remondi recalls being given tremendous freedom as a researcher including use of the lab’s minicomputer. The combination made developing software at NGS “amazing” he said. “I had been programming by that time probably 20 years of my life and it was always a burden. Sometimes I had to wait two or three days in the early days for a response to a program and another two to three days to get feedback. Now it was instantaneous. I could do two lines of code and ask it to compile and run two more lines of code. This was just unbelievable. This just super-charged me like you can’t believe.”

With this new computing power Remondi wrote two software programs that could process his simulated data. One used an interferometric search method he learned from Counselman and Sergei A. Gourevitch (Miniature Interferometer Terminals for Earth Surveying: Ambiguity And Multipath with Global Positioning System October 1981) while the other was a triple-difference program of his own invention. The programs were written to anticipate cycle slips and repair them if desired.

There was an obsession with cycle slips and the interferometric methods Remondi got from Gourevitch and Counselman enabled him to develop advanced computer methods to speed up the time for processing by a factor of 100000. The triple-difference method while considered naïve on the theory that there would be too little signal was faster in processing detected cycle slips and worked fine.

Collaboration and data familiarity advance RTK methods

Also to support Remondi’s initial work Bossler approved the purchase of two Macrometers at $250000 apiece. “They are usually $300000 but we got them for a Sunday Special” Remondi recalled. The receivers tracked six GPS satellites were codeless and had weak signals but with a small dataset provided by MIT “miraculously my programs worked.”

Meanwhile NGS was working with four sister government agencies to partner with Texas Instruments to develop the TI 4100 one of the first commercial GPS receivers and antennas. The TI 4100 team included excellent engineers writing simulation software Remondi said and he contributed timing software to their efforts. “They liked my contribution and good relations were established.”

After receiving the Macrometers the NGS team put them to work surveying the nation. It was no small logistical and physical effort because the receivers were heavy required large batteries and had to be time-synced. The team had to generate orbital data in the home office and send it to the field.

“I became extremely cozy with the data” Remondi said. “I noticed that a tracking channel could get confused and switch satellites when the doppler signal was the same. The receiver would then report the wrong satellite. This was easy to fix but it pointed to how close I was watching the data. MIT was unaware of this sympathetic tracking behavior.”

Goad and Remondi shared the results of this work in 1984 in “Initial Relative Positioning Results Using the Global Positioning System.”

Initialization without sitting still for hours

Also in the 1983-84 timeframe and as part of the Macrometer testing Larry D. Hothem a geodesist with the United States Geological Survey set up a test network in California with survey marks near each other. At the time it was taking three hours at each monument to establish a position and Remondi thought there had to be a more efficient way. He realized the long stays at each monument were to give time for the satellites to move and wondered if they should stay a couple of minutes at each site and return several times. “I did not experiment with this method right then” he said “but I did later.”

The jumping from site to site made him wonder: Could the antenna be moved from a known site to an unknown site while maintaining carrier tracking? “While I believed the Macrometers could not do this I thought if I rotated the antenna very slowly I could prove the point. I asked Professor Counselman if such tracking could be done. He said no but if there was an application they would consider it.”

By the spring of 1984 Remondi—inspired by a paper by Dr. Alan G. Evans at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) that proved carrier tracking could be done while moving—set up a kinematic (or motion geometry) test but it didn’t work.

He learned from Texas Instruments engineers that with an increase in bandwidth the TI 4100 could track the carrier when the antenna was in motion. Next he asked his colleagues at NSWC to modify the receiver’s software to widen the bandwidth to 8 Hz. With this change Remondi repeated his experiment with field personnel carrying an antenna around a roughly square path and sending the data to him.

Antenna swapping—an awkward dance

The experiment was successful. With that proof Remondi designed more interesting experiments to travel between known survey marks using RTK. “Those tests were not in real time yet so we called the method ‘kinematic’ and not ‘RTK’” he said. “One of those experiments added the technique of swapping antennas.”

It looked like an awkward dance. Picture two tripods each with a GPS antenna and two guys lifting the antennas carefully up over their heads so they don’t interfere with the signal and then walking around each other to set the antennas down on the other tripod and not tangling the cords in the process. “They looked silly while doing it” said DeLoach and at some point the antenna swap started being referred to as “the Remondi Foxtrot.”

The article “Performing Centimeter-Level Surveys in Seconds with GPS Carrier Phase: Initial Results” (NAVIGATION Journal of The Institute of Navigation Winter 1985-1986) describes the initial tests: “The results of this experiment show that centimeter-level relative surveys can be performed in seconds. A priori geodetic coordinates of the initial location of the ‘roving’ antenna are not required since they too can be determined within seconds.”

Surveying with kinematic GPS—stopping only for a few seconds—seemed preposterous to many of Remondi’s colleagues. Until it didn’t. One scientist eventually apologized for his skepticism and receiver manufacturers started asking for the capability. “The antenna swap was greeted with a big ‘wow’ and without skepticism” Remondi said “meaning my work was beginning to be taken seriously.”

GPS commercial development: What can we do to keep the company going?

Alongside the scientific work of GPS technologists like Remondi were efforts by commercial GPS pioneers including Charles R. Trimble who founded the company in 1978 to initially focus on Loran-C a hyperbolic radio navigation system but in 1982 began developing receivers using GPS signals.

Unlike scientists at NGS or the Department of Defense who had access to the computer systems that tracked the GPS satellites and could develop the ephemeris data for their calculations surveyors needed receivers that could download and understand the ephemeris or orbital data.

In 1984 Trimble introduced one of the first GPS positioning products called the 4000A GPS Locator a C/A code receiver intended to replace Loran. The main users for the 4000A were hydrographic survey boats locating previously drilled holes over which to build oil platforms.

Then on Jan. 28 1986 the Space Shuttle Challenger was engulfed in flames 73 seconds into flight killing all seven crew members aboard. Also lost in the explosion was a satellite to enhance coverage worldwide. It would be two more years before additional GPS satellites could be launched.

Unlike other GPS manufacturers that were able to shift to other areas of production Trimble was invested almost exclusively in GPS. “Here was Charlie with a commercial company and all of a sudden the whole GPS program came to a halt because they could no longer launch satellites” said Mark Nichols general manager at Trimble and one of the company’s early RTK development leaders. “So he turned to Ron Hyatt who also came out of HP and said ‘What can we do with GPS to keep the company going when there aren’t enough satellites in the sky?’”

They shifted the company’s focus to time transfer because it was possible to get atomic clock accuracy timing out of a GPS receiver with only one or two satellites and also to the development of GPS static carrier-phase differential positioning for geodetic surveying.

“GPS entered into the surveying industry by virtue of Trimble looking for a commercial application after the Space Shuttle disaster” Nichols added. “And it was used initially for doing control surveys over long distances.”

In the summer of 1978 I worked as a rodman/chainman for Boston Survey Consultant (now the BSC Group). My crew partnered with the engineering staff to conduct soil percolation tests for septic system design. At one point our boss informed us he had just attended a meeting at our corporate office in Boston on the status of the GPS satellite constellation. Little was known about this technology as the first GPS satellite (NAVSTAR 1) had only been launched months earlier. He told us that within a few years you would be able to put a “magic black box” on the surface of the earth and obtain XYZ coordinates. As an 18-year-old kid it was impossible for me to comprehend as we were in the process of locating the percolation test holes with a turn of the century K&E transit a handheld magnifying glass to read the vernier a Philly stadia rod for distance interpolation and a machete for cutting line. As I reflect on this story I realize how lucky I am to have witnessed all these measurement technology enhancements over the last four decades.

Entrepreneurs and innovators like Charlie Trimble Javad Ashjaee and Dr. Benjamin Remondi (the father of GPS kinematic principals) capitalized on this technology. The cost for one GPS receiver when they hit the market in the late 1980s was about $100000. Three GPS receivers software and state-of-the-art computers were needed since most of the survey applications required GPS static survey methodology creating a half million-dollar investment on equipment alone and resulting in only a handful of companies adopting this emerging technology. But those who did became pioneers and industry leaders.

Game Changer #1—Real Time Kinematic (RTK)

On December 8 1993 GPS Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was announced by a joint venture between the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation. On April 27 1995 GPS Full Operational Capability (FOC) was announced by the U.S. Air Force Space Command. This event reassured both public and private stakeholders of the validity of GPS. Real Time Kinematic systems started “trickling” into the profession.

My employer at that time was Mangini and Associates in Pueblo Colo. Having worked for the progressive thinking BSC Group I was versed enough in GPS technology to talk company management into buying an RTK system. I felt like a spaceman with my backpack Trimble 4000 GPS receiver GPS antenna whip radio antenna extension poles heavy camcorder batteries and cables. Early RTK receiver technology suffered from limitations. The most notable was range or distance from base station to rover. Most manufacturers RTK systems specified positioning performance as 1 cm + 1 ppm RMS HZ x 2 cm +2 ppm RMS VT. The parts per million (PPM) component plays an important role later in this article.

Game Changer #2—Real Time Networks (RTNs) and Virtual Reference Station (VRS) Technology

Around the year 2000 my company was a sub-consultant on a Colorado DOT project in Grand Junction Colo. The CDOT Project Manager told us that Mesa County had several UHF broadcasting base stations in the area. Having used RTK since its infancy I understood the language he gave but the workflow was foreign to me. All my RTK experience involved utilizing my base station and my rover. How was I to trust a third-party source of correction data? After observing multiple project control points with my RTK rover via corrections from one of the local Mesa County stations I was sold! These local stations became the foundation for the Mesa County Real Time Virtual Reference Network (RTVRN)—one of the longest operational VRNs in the country. As robust as GNSS network solutions have become with enhancements of correction data via internet protocol they all have limitations. For one they cover a specific geographic location that is typically geo-fenced—whether that be city county states or larger. Another limitation to RTN solutions is cellular coverage no cell = no data! Yes RTK “bridge” technology exists that incorporates cellular boosters that rebroadcast the internet-based correction via UHF. However this requires another piece of hardware cables and in most cases a designated ISP data account.

Are Satellite Based Correction Services the “Next Utility” for the 21st Century?

On several occasions during the mid to late 1990s I had the opportunity to collaborate with GIS professionals on creating survey grade GIS databases and schemas. The consultants utilized Trimble MGIS/resource-grade backpack mounted receivers and antennas with a handheld data collector. I was told that these units were OmniSTAR compliant and could receive satellite corrections from this fee structured Satellite-based Augmentation System (SBAS). Upon arrival I would setup my RTK system and get to work. The GIS team on the other hand would assemble their system and then wait for almost an hour to receive OmniSTAR “convergence.” Meanwhile I had already collected a fair amount of RTK data. When we compared observed coordinate values at best they were within a meter or so of my centimeter RTK value.

Now fast forward to March of 2011 when Trimble Navigation acquired certain assets from OmniSTAR. This initiated a campaign of “disruptive innovation” not totally realized until May 5 2020.

There exists a series of privately owned SBAS solutions from a variety of manufacturers (Novatel/TerraStar EOS/Atlas Trimble/RTX). Also publicly available SBAS systems encompass the globe—WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation System) EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) GAGAN (GPS-aided GEO Augmented Navigation) and MSAS (MTSAT Satellite Augmentation System). Although beneficial these publicly available SBAS solutions yield 1-2-meter accuracies at best. Trimble CenterPoint RTX (Real Time Extended) yields 2 cm (RMS) horizontal and 5cm (RMS) vertical accurate solutions in less than 1 minute. Automated transformations from global ITRF (2014) current values to NAD 83 (2011) are now performed real time in Trimble Access (TA) 2020. Additional enhancements are included in the December 2020 release of TA 2020.20. Most notably is the inclusion of plate motion deformation models. See: white paper “Deformation Models in Trimble Access 2020.20 and Trimble Business Center 5.40” at https://frontierprecision.com/wp-content/uploads/Trimble-Def-Models.pdf. In the U.S. (NAD83 2011) the Horizontal Time Dependent Positioning utility (HTDP v3.2.9) was incorporated. These new features resolve RTX to NAD83 (2011) legacy offset issues that required localization routines to remedy.

Briefly mentioned earlier in the article on May 5 2020 Trimble announced coast-to-coast coverage of CenterPoint RTX Fast service (less than 1 minute to convergence). All of this has happened since Q2 of 2020 which now makes RTX a “utility” that is much more than a game changer. Imagine being a large survey engineering firm with projects scattered around the U.S. or for that matter around the globe. All crews regardless of location could simultaneously work from the same correction source on the same geodetic datum with real time corrected data all with the same accuracies! Mind blowing isn’t it? This is just the beginning of an avalanche of GNSS rendered enhancements I predict will happen over the next 5 years (or less)!

How does Trimble CenterPoint RTX work?

Trimble owns and operates a network of terrestrial tracking stations strategically placed around the globe. These stations receive data broadcast by all GNSS satellites (GPS GLONASS Galileo BeiDou QZSS) and are the basis for a precise global modeling campaign including GNSS satellite orbit clock and atmospheric errors. This data is then sent to the RTX control center and processed. The RTX control center transmits the processed data to two entities. One: IP/cellular. Two: the processed data is also up-linked to geostationary L-band satellites. The L-band satellite then broadcasts correction data to the end user in the field providing real-time cm level positioning without the need for a base station UHF radio VRS/RTN connection nor internet connectivity.

Over the past decade as Trimble’s network of tracking stations has densified convergence/initialization times have been reduced dramatically. On May 5 2020 the densification of these ground-based GNSS tracking stations was sufficient for Trimble to release RTX Fast service for the U.S. and parts of Southern Canada. RTX Fast service boasts less than 1 minute to converge at 2 cm (RMS) HZ. With that said I independently tested these specifications utilizing Trimble’s R10 Model 2 GNSS receiver and TSC7 Trimble Access and no cellular connection or local base. The result of using this technology in different environments in different states and at varying times of the day was eye opening. Trimble CenterPoint RTX converged in less than a minute and met specifications. However for even better results I wait on average 5-7 minutes to obtain precisions of 0.03’/1cm HZ (DRMS) x 0.08’/2.5cm VT (1sigma). I chose these settings since DRMS (not RMS as in the specifications) has been the defaulted precision display in both legacy Trimble Survey Controller and Trimble Access for almost 25 years. Access 2020 gives users the option to select the job precision displays of legacy DRMS 1 Sigma 95% or 99% reporting. This enhancement integrates Trimble Access settings with those in Trimble Business Center as DRMS has been added to Trimble Business Center as well.

So what’s in it for me?

Trimble CenterPoint RTX yields centimeter accurate positioning. However not all applications require these accuracies. Trimble RTX offers a complete portfolio of solutions based on accuracy specifications (to see the range of RTX performance levels offered visit HERE). Regardless of the tier being used all data collected from multiple disciplines would be rendered on the same global datum. For national state county and city entities this could be huge. For the private sector surveyor the benefits are significant considering the time saved not having to setup and breakdown a RTK base station not counting the liability of leaving the station unattended. To validate the concept that a Trimble CenterPoint RTX solution will yield similar results to other legacy correction sources I conducted a very basic test on one point. Prior to the December 2020 release of Trimble Access 2020.20 I utilized ITRF 2014 (2010) values in my testing. Since the recent incorporation of displacement models in Trimble Access (previously mentioned in this article) the test was conducted in NAD 83 (2011). Another point worth mentioning as with RTK RTX observed data renders not only HZ and VT precisions values but a full covariance matrix as well (QC2 in Trimble Access settings).

The test data consists of 4 solutions as shown in the penny diagram in this article. Point “1_NA” was calculated through a least-squares network adjustment and tied to the national CORS network to create a “standard.” Point “1_RTX” is the result of a 180-epoch real time “observed control point” observation in Trimble Access with converged Trimble CenterPoint RTX. Point “1_VRS” was generated from the local Colorado-based Trimble VRS Now RTN. Point “1_OPUS” is the coordinate rendering via NGS’s OPUS RS Service incorporating a 1-hour data set. As shown all is centimeter accurate (distances are horizontal in meters). Simply amazing all falling within the diameter of a penny!

Another benefit to Trimble CenterPoint RTX as compared to traditional RTK—there is no compounding parts per million components. Depending on the specifications of the RTX receiver being used my yearlong testing reveals that somewhere around the 3-mile mark (RTK base station to RTK rover) a threshold is met where RTX accuracies surpass that of traditional RTK. I do realize that Trimble VRS (Virtual Reference Station) solutions minimize ppm error by localizing a correction packet but this is not the case with RTK. For long linear jobs (pipelines powerlines railroads) the benefit of this technology is substantial and worth investigating.

My preferred linear project workflow would be a least squares network adjusted “static” survey of primary control then supplemented with RTK secondary control. Unfortunately due to time constraints budgets and other variables many companies opt for an OPUS and/or RTK “traverse” survey. Both options are riddled with potential problems. I witnessed a situation where a surveyor was hired to survey around 70 miles of pipeline. He chose to “leapfrog” or traverse the line with RTK continuously compiling both RTK and PPM error. Unfortunately for him the pipeline had minimal design grade.

Trimble CenterPoint RTX solves most of these problems bringing seamless accurate and repeatable geodetic control to all crews throughout the continental United States and Southern Canada. Naturally if tight vertical control is required a combination of RTX and RTK or differential level analysis could be incorporated as part of the project workflow and Standard Operating Procedures.

In closing the title of this paper is a question: Are satellite-based correction services the “next utility” for surveyors and measurement professionals? After reading this article I hope you will agree the answer is yes! This technology will continue to improve with enhancements to not only the geodesic sphere of GNSS but also global terrestrial tracking networks precise modeling of the atmosphere and satellite clock and orbit algorithms. GNSS receiver and data collection hardware and firmware will continue to evolve capture our imagination increase productivity and so much more. Consider all your positioning solution options and remember “Measurement is a science not the press of a button.” #HowYouMeasureMatters

If you're driving on Mint Street during a Knights game and Gavin Sheets is at bat you might want to pay attention.

Because he might send one through your window.

The big left-handed hitter has launched several home runs over the Truist Field short porch in right field and some of them have cleared the park.

""I've had some good ones here"" he said. ""If you catch it to right it'll definitely go.""

Sheets is a former Wake Forest Demon Deacon and second-round pick of the White Sox.

This year he's batting .289 with six home runs seven doubles and 26 RBI playing outfield and first base.

In fact Chicago called him up a few weeks ago but he didn't play.

But he did get a taste of the show.

""The biggest thing is feeling like I belong there and that's how it felt"" Sheets said. ""And hopefully I get an opportunity to help that team.""

Longtime Charlotte baseball fans might remember the name Sheets.

Gavin is the son of former Charlotte O's slugger Larry Sheets who is paying a visit this weekend.

He hit 25 homers for the O's back in 1983 when the team played at Crockett Park.

He then went on to play parts of eight MLB seasons.

""This was my favorite place outside of big-league towns to play in"" Larry said. ""Just to have an opportunity to be back here and see him play is special.""

Sheets was Cal Ripken Jr's roommate during their early minor league days.",,,

It’s just the latest example of dire measures companies are being forced to take in response to a nationwide worker shortage that is plaguing the food industry. In addition to hiring workers from out of state and boarding them businesses say they’re turning to middlemen to recruit them — a costly measure that’s also helping drive up prices for consumers sources told The Post.

“Never in our wildest dreams did we imagine we’d be doing this — putting people up in hotels to work for us” said Christopher Pappas chief executive of Chefs’ Warehouse a $1 billion Bronx-based food supplier for restaurants hotels and other businesses.

Pappas said he was forced to start renting some of his workforce “from Alabama and other other states” when the economy starting bubbling up a few months ago.

The company had lost 40 percent of its drivers and warehouse workers during the pandemic a period that led to some 88300 US trucking jobs getting slashed last April the industry’s single largest cutback ever according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Unable to fill the gaps Pappas turned to Katonah NY-based Regional Supplemental Services which rents out truck drivers and other workers to large companies that need them.

It was a solution with a cost. Companies that lend out temps on an “emergency” basis charge a premium. That’s not to mention the cost of keeping the workers housed Pappas said.

The food executive who pays his own workers $20-plus an hour with benefits declined to say what he pays for the contract workers. But he acknowledged “We paid a lot whatever we had to to service our customers.”

Chefs’ Warehouse is hardly alone as US companies struggle to meet rebounding demand amid a severe worker shortage says Rich Jennings vice president of trucker outsourcing company RSS.

“I get calls from desperate Fortune 500 companies every day that need to move perishable food” Jennings said. “It’s most dire in the food industry right now.”

Business has been so brisk that the 30-year-old company posted its best year ever in 2020. And this year revenues are on track to rise by 600 percent Jennings said.

“I’ve never seen drivers get paid what they are paid today” Jennings added. “They are getting well into the six figures and they can easily make $3000 a week. A [commercial driver’s license] is like a golden ticket right now.”

Indeed a search for commercial driver’s licenses on Craigslist pulls up numerous jobs offering $2000 to $3000 a week plus signing bonuses. One recent eyepopping add for a full-time job in Illinois dangled a $15000 sign-on bonus for a candidate with at least “six months of experience and a clean driving record.”

Some warehouse workers such as those who are able to operate heavy machinery like forklifts are also commanding six-figure pay Jennings said. He declined to elaborate on how pay is determined or divvied up except to say that RSS gets a percentage of the agreed-upon wages.

The labor shortages are quickly translating into higher prices for consumers.

Average producer prices for truck transportation rose 10 percent in April from a year ago — the “strongest growth since just after the financial crisis when it briefly got into double digits” according to Mark Zandi chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.

These price increases are especially “meaningful” for food products Zandi said as transportation accounts for a larger percentage of overall costs for food than for most goods.

At Chefs’ Warehouse charges to the company’s customers rose by an average of 7 percent in the first quarter on the 55000 items it sells the company reported in April. That’s more than double the typical increase of 2 percent to 3 percent Pappas said.

The most wild price spikes include a 54 percent increase for 35-pound tubs of canola and soybean fry oil — a staple in commercial kitchens according to Chefs’ Warehouse. Meat is up by roughly 20 percent while cases of kosher salt chocolate and olive oil have spiked by 30 percent.

“Anything above 2 or 3 percent” Pappas said “is earth-shattering in this low-margin business.”

Amid the labor shortage TransForce Group of Alexandria Va. which runs truck-driving schools and rents out drivers has seen record demand for its services said Chief Executive Dennis Cooke. Even its newly minted and younger drivers — who are harder to place because of insurance liability issues — are finding jobs across the country he said. About 70 percent of TransForce Group’s students are military vets.

Of course drivers were in short supply even before the pandemic. And some of the shortage may simply be due to the grueling nature of the work which can have drivers pulling shifts of 10 to 12 hours while unloading a backbreaking amount of freight.

In the food service industry alone there is a shortfall of 15000 drivers and 17500 warehouse workers which amounts to about a 12 percent vacancy rate per company according to a recent survey by the International Foodservice Distributors Association.

A former driver for FreshDirect who asked not to be identified told The Post he lasted in the job for a year before he found a position as a janitor at Memorial Sloan Kettering hospital.

“It was my first time being a driver and most likely my last” he said. “It’s physically very demanding work lifting crates with gallons of water and cat litter.”

“These are hard jobs” Pappas agreed. It’s one reason he assumes many of his former employees opted to draw on generous pandemic unemployment benefits enhanced by weekly $300 checks from the government plus stimulus money – or that they left the industry for different jobs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0YnMuY29tL2FtYW5kYS1tb250Z29tZXJ5L2ltYWdlXzk4YWY4YjcwLWQyMWEtMTFlYi04MDAzLTQzOGM0ZDk4ZTJiYi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMANDA MONTGOMERY | | ktbs.com,Success!

This milestone should be a reminder that just because the Fed may soon start reducing or “tapering” the $120 billion a month it has been pumping into the financial system since the start of the pandemic it doesn’t mean the forces that have underpinned markets are going away anytime soon — perhaps not for years.

The situation could set the central bank up for a repeat of former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan’s “conundrum” when the central bank started tightening monetary policy in 2004 only to see long-term bond yields fall contributing to easier financial conditions and spurring equities higher. We saw a hint of that last week with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dropping to some of its lowest levels since early March.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2FtZXJpc3Vydi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8yMC9zZWxsaW5nLWFtZXJpY2EtdGhlLWdlbmVyYWwtbGFuZC1vZmZpY2UtYW5kLXRoZS1yZWN0b3ItY29ud2F5LWZhbWlseS1zdXJ2ZXlpbmctZHluYXN0eS1wYXJ0LWlpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Selling America: The General Land Office and the Rector-Conway Family Surveying Dynasty Part II,"In 1816 Rector was appointed Surveyor General of the Illinois Missouri and Arkansas Territories when the Arkansas Territory was carved out of the Missouri Territory. Rector’s position was second in importance only to the Commissioner of the General Land Office in Washington D.C. Most of the 3.5 million acres of surveyed Bounty land in Illinois were overseen by the Rector brothers. Weather conditions and the delayed finalization of an Indian treaty prevented any surveying until late summer of 1816 but the Illinois Bounty survey was finished in 1817. In the same year a former clerk in the General Land Office in Washington D.C. Nicholas Biddle Van Zandt published a booklet entitled A Full Description of the Soil Water Timber and Prairies … Between the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers.1 In this booklet are comments such as “rich farming land” “spoon River…beautiful stream navigable for larger boats” “very rough broken land” “not fit for cultivation.”

All of these comments were meant to guide the War of 1812 veterans to the best land. Van Zandt’s booklet goes on to describe the other remaining Illinois lands that had been surveyed. John Gardiner Chief Clerk in the General Land Office headquarters in Washington D.C. self-published in 1817 a map of the Illinois Bounty land surveys supervised by William Rector. It is safe to say that the Rector family were responsible for the surveys of most of Illinois by the time Illinois became a state in 1818. Their names appear on hundreds of township plats.

William relocated to his new headquarters in St. Louis after the Illinois work was essentially completed. Brothers Elias Wharton Nelson Thomas and Stephen also relocated to the Missouri Territory. The Fifth Principal Meridian was in place and surveys began. Problems arose in Missouri because of the prior land ownership claims of French settlers in these Louisiana Purchase lands. A second problem was the massive earthquake of 1812 at New Madrid Missouri; new lands were set aside for those settlers whose land had become unusable. The surveys of 2.5 million acres of Missouri Bounty land and new land to replace the land lost in the earthquake were completed in 1818 but it took three years to clear titles and confirm earthquake losses. The surveys of the 6 million acres of Military Bounty Land directed by Congress were now completed. Also in 1818 William Rector’s survey work was incorporated in a map of the western United States compiled by Isaac Roberdeau of the office of the U.S. Topographical Engineers. The map was signed by Josiah Meigs Commissioner of the General Land Office. Although never published in its original 1818 format Rector’s map was cited in reduced format in Gouverneur K. Warren’s 1859 Memoir. This report was published at the conclusion of the Pacific Railroad surveys and included a brief account of various exploring expeditions and maps that contributed data for Warren’s landmark map of the West.2

In late 1818 the major surveying efforts were now focused on the southeastern portion of the Missouri Territory. Josiah Meigs Commissioner of the General Land Office wrote to William Rector:

“The Secretary of the Treasury is desirous of having lands prepared for sale in the county of Arkansas [part of the Missouri Territory]. You will therefore please to cause to be surveyed about 60 townships and subdivided as usual. If this quantity of saleable lands cannot be found in one body the subdivided townships may be connected by surveying the intermediate lands into townships only.”3

Of the Rector brothers only Elias Wharton Stephen and Thomas were still active Deputy Surveyors. The next generation of Rectors and other related kin had begun to enter the survey business: Wharton Rector’s sons Wharton Rector Elias Rector and William Vance Rector; Elias’s son Henry Massie Rector and brother-in-law Lucius Thruston; Stephen Rector’s son Thomas Rector; Nancy Ann Rector Conway’s sons Frederick Rector Conway James Sevier Conway Elias Nelson Conway Thomas B. Conway and Henry Wharton Conway; other Rector sisters’ male in-laws: Kimber W. Barton Charles Lockhart and Enock Steen. There were also family relatives with the names Pelham Shields and Sheppard. By year end 1819 60 townships equal to nearly 1.4 million acres of land were designated and then surveyed. Between 1816 and 1823 William Rector had hired 62 Deputy Surveyors 12 of whom were Rector relatives. According to the Missouri Society of Professional Land Surveyors these particular Rector contracts covered more than 5 million acres.4 A number of the Rector Deputy Surveyors worked along the line of the important Fifth Principal Meridian the lengthy north-south line that was established before any other surveying could begin.

In the summer of 1818 the Bank of the United States changed monetary policy. They demanded payment of all outstanding land notes and refused to issue new loans. Congress now demanded cash sales on all lands sold. Many persons who had purchased land on credit could not pay when their loans became due. Notes submitted by state and local banks normally cashed by the U.S. bank were refused. The entire banking system ground to a halt. President Monroe re-appointed William as Principal Surveyor General in 1819.

Apparently Rector was not advised of the need to slow the surveying program. From 1816-1823 he presided over the largest surveying organization ever put together under one man using it to survey most of Illinois Missouri and Arkansas during his short tenure. In Missouri alone William issued 98 surveying contracts 19 to family relatives. In 1821 he proposed to survey 559 Townships at a cost of $120000. By the time the General Land Office Commissioner became aware of the program it was too far along to stop. From 1818-1822 Rector oversaw the survey of more than 98000-line miles. Three other Land Office Districts combined had surveyed only 123000-line miles during the same period. In 1822 he surveyed the location of the city of Chicago. At the time the population was fewer than 100 people. In addition to his surveying responsibilities he was elected a director of a prominent local bank in St. Louis in 1817 and was a delegate to Missouri’s constitutional convention in 1820.

General Land Office Establishes More Regulations

William Rector was due to be reappointed to his position again in 1823. Missouri Senator David Barton who chaired the Senate Committee of Public Lands and whose family were political rivals of the Rectors brought charges against William for hiring so many relatives and personal friends. He also charged William with not managing the contracts closely. It was a lucrative system for certain senior surveyors and no rules prevented it. During the 1816-1823 period Surveyor General Rector would secure a project budget from the General Land Office. He would then hire his Deputy Surveyor family members and friends with a lesser budget and the Deputy Surveyors would hire the crews with an even lower budget. Surveyors were traditionally paid by the number of acres surveyed. There were clearly some instances of shoddy work but few complaints were lodged. The practice of hiring friends and family continued and the dynasty continued to thrive and expand. The Rector-Conway families produced a total of 22 Deputy Surveyors who worked in Arkansas starting in 1815. There were almost certainly more family surveyors participating in the surveys of Missouri. President Monroe re-appointed William Rector to his Surveyor General position. But while William was still in Washington D.C. defending himself St. Louis newspapers began printing slanderous articles about the Rector dynasty. William’s brother Thomas determined that Senator Barton’s brother was the source for these articles. Thomas challenged him to a duel on Bloody Island in the Mississippi River off St. Louis and killed him. The St. Louis population was horrified. In early 1824 President Monroe then revoked William Rector’s position. William’s dismissal was probably part politics part jealousy and part oversight failures. The practice of subcontracting was ended. Rector retired and died a year later.

Missouri Arkansas And New Mexico Territories: The Dynasty Ends

Four more family members rose to senior survey positions after William’s passing. Second-generation Frederick Rector Conway began his working career as a Deputy Surveyor. He left the General Land Office organization to pursue other interests. Later on he became Recorder of French and Spanish land claims in Missouri Arkansas and Louisiana. In this capacity he was one of three Commissioners who arbitrated these claims. But he returned to surveying when appointed Surveyor General of Illinois and Missouri from 1845-1849 a senior position in the General Land Office. James Sevier Conway brother of Frederick Rector Conway began his career as a Deputy Surveyor then advanced to Surveyor General of Arkansas from 1832-1836. He was then elected the first Governor of Arkansas in 1836. Henry Massie Rector a first cousin of brothers Frederick James and Elias (See Elias below.) served as a U.S. Marshall then Arkansas State Senator 1848-51 Surveyor General of Arkansas 1853-1857 Arkansas Supreme Court Justice 1858-59 and sixth Governor of Arkansas in 1860. William Pelham brother-in-law of Fredrick Rector Conway served as Surveyor General of Arkansas from 1841-1849. He became Surveyor General of New Mexico from 1854-1860. Conway Arkansas a city of 750000 people was named for James Sevier Conway.

Other Rectors and Conways held survey positions early in their careers but most moved on to pursue other careers and political offices. The importance of surveyors made new careers and political offices possible for those eager to assume them. Elias Nelson Conway brother of Frederick Rector Conway also began his career as a Deputy Surveyor moved on to Arkansas State Auditor and became the fifth Governor of Arkansas in 1852. Henry W. Conway was a Territorial Congressman Postmaster of St. Louis and General Land Office Receiver of Public Money. William B. Conway became an Arkansas Supreme Court justice. Ambrose Sevier another first cousin of the Rectors and Conways became a U.S. Senator from Arkansas and oversaw the General Land Office Register. Of course not all family members leaving the surveying business achieved high office.

Final Observations

Americans were eager to move beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the lands of the Northwest Territory and the Louisiana Purchase. Americans were dedicated to making a better life for themselves and their families on the frontier. Surveying was a well-respected occupation in the 18th and 19th centuries because of its technical nature and the demand for new land as a new beginning for American families.

There was no doubt that the operations of the local Land Offices were manipulated for the benefit of insiders as well as providing land for the general population. Insiders included not only the employees of the Land Offices but also local politicians. They identified the best lands and they had the ability to buy these lands. They also had the ability to purchase defaulted notes from the original landowners at bargain prices. Some senior surveyors used their surveyor status to obtain high political office securing influence and status. But the Dynasty accomplished much. The states of Illinois Missouri and Arkansas comprise nearly 120 million acres. The Dynasty surveyors probably oversaw the surveys of as many as 30 million of those acres. The sheer manpower brought to the task of surveying these millions of acres was daunting. Its members helped to complete this task but anti-nepotism rules were later imposed on the Surveyors General as the land survey system matured. The Dynasty phenomenon was not likely to be duplicated in any case.

Larry Caldwell is a collector of maps showing the progression of the settlement of America. Several years ago while researching his family roots he came across the Rectors and Conways. His great-great grandmother married Frederick Rector Conway in 1859. A longer version of this article was published in the 109 Winter Issue of The Portolan—Journal of the Washington Map Society.

The Leadership Owensboro Program is run by the Greater Owensboro Chamber of Commerce and is focused on educating and engaging individuals to reach their potential and maximize their impact in the community.

The Class of 2021 commenced in September 2020 and completed a series of eight class sessions focused on different sectors of the Owensboro community. Each year individuals are selected through a competitive application process to be a part of the program.

The Leadership Owensboro Curriculum Committee comprised of regional community leaders meets regularly to build curriculum for the program with the goal of educating the class as much as possible on relevant and timely topics.

“It has been a true honor to see these 38 individuals engage our community and grow throughout this year” said Hannah Thurman Executive Director of Leadership Owensboro. “We look forward to celebrating each of them and welcoming the class into the Leadership Owensboro alumni base of more than 1000 civic business and education leaders.”

Candance Castlen Brake President and CEO of GO Chamber said this year’s graduates leave an “indelible mark on our hearts” at the Chamber.

“This group of men and women have poured themselves into each session during a time when they could not always be together in person” Brake said. “Having the opportunity to end the class year together with in person sessions has been a gift. Their community spirit and their positive energy will transform Owensboro.”

Applications for the upcoming Leadership Owensboro Class of 2022 will open in July. More details will be announced in the coming weeks.

Hailing a ride in the city after hours is nearly impossible with Boston being one of the worst cities in the US in terms of wait times for a ride. Thus begging the question: How should you get home?

Here’s a trusty list of alternatives for the next time you’re in a pinch.

1. Lace up those bad boys

How far is too far to walk with no ride in sight? Now I’m not advocating for everyone to just start hitching it back home especially if you’re alone. But if it’s a group of you in the North End say and you’re looking to make it to Back Bay well hey that’s only about 2 miles.

Plus you could stop at Bova’s 24-hour bakery and get a lobster tail to share on your 40-minute walk — which isn’t that bad when you consider it might take just as long (if not longer) to hail a ride on one of these apps.

Now if you live in East Boston you’re unfortunately out of luck.

2. Bluebikes to the rescue

So what do you do if you’re alone? Or if your home is farther from Downtown in Somerville or Dorchester? It feels like you have no options as both Lyft and Uber are giving you nothing but NO DRIVERS AVAILABLE. And then you see it. Ten-plus shiny Bluebikes sitting there just waiting for you to unlock their potential.

If you’re like Em Hadfield a 24-year-old from Somerville the Bluebikes scattered around Boston — some 400 stations comprising 4000 bikes — have been a godsend of sorts. After spending the night on Newbury Street celebrating her sister’s graduation in May she was left with no other options to get home. Hadfield had to check two bike stations but she finally found a set of wheels and proceeded to ride up to Winter Hill declaring that “it was not what I wanted to do with my evening.”

A true urbanite however will already be thinking about purchasing their own bicycle to weave in and out of the city. Cheap options exist on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist and with a good lock a bicycle can open up a slew of opportunities to explore the city late at night.

Now if you live in East Boston you’re still out of luck.

3. Do you remember those ancient things called taxis?

Yes! They still exist and you can order one practically at any time though just like Uber and Lyft the demand has been high as the city returns back to “normal.” Still taxis are a great alternative and in doing so you are also supporting what is most likely a local/small business.

“People are very anxious to get out and get moving. However the entire service industry itself is not up to speed just yet” said Joe Litvack the treasurer of Independent Taxi Operators Association a taxi service that’s been around since 1924. “There’s been an uptick––we’re open at night and we take as many calls as possible. Some nights are better than others but we do get to everybody” said Litvack.

Though there may be a wait Litvack stressed that if you need a ride Independent Taxi is a good option and at around $3.20 per mile for the metered rate it may be cheaper than some of the ride-hailing services. There are other taxi services out there that can get you home too such as Boston Cab Dispatch or Boston Taxis and Vans.

Now if you live in East Boston you’re actually in luck!

4. Ye Olde Reliable MBTA

The Red Blue Orange Green and Silver Lines can be a beacon of hope if you make it to the subway or bus station before 1 a.m. which is around the time when all of them stop running. All of these are great and cheap options — $2.40 for the subway and $1.70 for the bus — to get you back to your abode or at least closer.

They run through nearly every neighborhood in Boston are often air conditioned (an essential during the hot sweaty nights that are upon us) and are reasonably quick. The only burden is their early cutoff as Boston has yet to realize its potential for an active nightlife unlike New York City for example which has nearly 24-hour subway service.

And yes if you live in Eastie you’ve actually fared better than most as you get to ride the sleek and elusive Blue Line.

Six-vax abs?

David Hasselhoff is known for many things—Baywatch; Knight Rider; his motivational speaking; his reality show The Hasselhoffs whose debut and cancellation were virtually simultaneous. But the American actor-singer’s greatest claim to fame is that he is huge in Germany and pretty much nowhere else. “There is a museum of Hasselhoff paraphernalia in Berlin which used to own a patch of his chest hair until it was stolen by an excitable fan” noted The Times of London recently.

Now after decades of Teutonic adulation he’s giving something back: “The Hoff” is appearing on social media at the behest of the German government urging the unvaccinated to switch sides. “I found freedom with vaccination” he declares displaying a handy biceps. “You can too!”

In Novosibirsk … Burying the competition

No doubt you heard that a record fell last month at the annual grave-digging competition in Siberia. A two-man team from Omsk competing to specific dimensional requirements (i.e. coffin-size) and judged according to The Moscow Times not just for speed but also technique and accuracy out-shoveled squads from Tomsk Novosibirsk and the Altai Republic. Team Omsk dug its grave in 38 minutes shattering last year’s mark of 52 minutes and took home a purse of $400.

Meanwhile some 2500 miles due west of the frenzied spadework Vladimir Putin’s seldom-mentioned and even-less-seldom-seen daughters both made appearances at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. Katerina Tikhonova spoke (on video) about “breakthrough technologies” for boosting investments and Maria Vorontsova a genetics researcher was interviewed about rare diseases on national television said Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The women are reportedly the progeny of Putin’s marriage to Lyudmila Putina. (The couple divorced in 2014.) “Why bring these purported daughters of Putin to such an event and what was the point of them speaking publicly?” wondered one Carnegie Moscow Center analyst according to R.F.E./R.L. “Maybe this is just a little drawing back of the curtain without identifying the real functions of the president’s daughters. Maybe this is a foretaste of some sort of emergence onto the big stage.”

In parts unknown … Paint by numbers

Salvator Mundi before it was auctioned in New York in 2017.

Art scholars remain divided regarding the provenance of Salvator Mundi the controversial painting of Jesus by Leonardo da Vinci. (Or possibly not by Leonardo da Vinci or not very much anyway and certainly not entirely.) In 2005 the picture—at that point attributed to one of Leonardo’s followers—was bought by two art dealers for $1175 underwent extensive restoration and after the National Gallery in London included it as a da Vinci in a 2011–12 exhibition began trading hands as a full-blown da Vinci. It eventually brought $450 million at Christie’s in 2017 making it the most expensive painting in the world. The buyer was Prince Bader bin Abdullah reportedly bidding on behalf of Abu Dhabi’s Department of Culture and Tourism. But the picture hasn’t been seen since and many assume it’s in the possession of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.

The money aside what is Salvator Mundi really? In a new documentary by Andreas Koefoed The Lost Leonardo one da Vinci expert says “The new parts of the painting look like Leonardo but they are by the restorer. In some parts it’s a masterpiece by Dianne Modestini”—the conservator who worked on the painting. Modestini herself insists in the film that “no one except Leonardo could have painted this picture.”

In Hong Kong … Losing the thread

This city’s reputation for high-quality inexpensive suits and shirts has 19th-century roots but faces a 21st-century crisis: a drop in both tourism and demand has put Hong Kong’s renowned tailors on the endangered-species list their numbers now estimated at fewer than 500. (In tailoring’s heyday a single house in the Tsim Sha Tsui shopping district might have featured that many.) “One of the most renowned shops — Sam’s Tailor — tucked away in an arcade in Tsim Sha Tsui has crafted suits for former US president George H.W. Bush for several years” reported the South China Morning Post. “Other notables he has dressed include Bill Clinton David Bowie Russell Crowe and Bruno Mars and he even welcomed Italian designer Giorgio Armani to his shop.” Well vinyl was supposed to disappear but instead found a way to thrive; maybe hand-stitched threads will follow as it were suit.

In lieu of presents… Lifestyles of the non-rich and sort of famous

Good things don’t come in small packages now—they are small packages. “Analysis of prices on eBay reveals that empty watch boxes are the most valuable pieces of branded packaging being resold followed by designer shoe boxes paper bags and jewellery boxes” reported The Times of London. “Rolex boxes were the most expensive with an average list price of £160 [about $225] followed by Tag Heuer Breitling and Omega. Louis Vuitton shoe boxes were listed for an average of £74 [$100] while listings for the famous duck-egg blue Tiffany boxes tied with white ribbons averaged £51 [$70] according to a study by the price-comparison website Money.co.uk.”

O-kay. Curiously no mental-health professionals were quoted in the piece but a finance expert at money.co.uk told the newspaper “At times it’s for home decor. They might have seen walk-in wardrobes filled with Chanel bags and Louis Vuitton boxes proudly on show on Pinterest. Or it could be to use them as background props for Instagram posts replicating those posted by the rich and famous.”

Back in the universe where expensive retail packages contain actual goods eBay is training “footware detectives” at “sneaker authentication centers” to detect knockoffs trying to pass themselves off as real Nike Adidas or New Balance shoes. Experts “have identified 52 elements of a finished shoe — from the materials used to the box it comes in — that might yield evidence of fakery” said The Times. “The inspections examine details such as the font and quality of ink used for writing on the inside of the tongue or any small variations in the colour.” Regular glue-sniffing is also essential. The center’s authentication manager told the newspaper “Over time you get familiar with the way it should smell and you can tell almost immediately when the glue is made from cheap materials.”

In Guangzhou … Any openings at the North Pole?

A doctor at a cosmetic-surgery center here said he performs as many as six “elf ear” surgeries a day and over in Shanghai at one medical center people are lining up for them according to the South China Morning Post. “Turning their ears into those that look like an elf’s has become one of the most sought-after procedures among China’s post-2000s generation recently as it’s believed to be able to make their faces look slimmer and even younger” said the newspaper. (“It is magic!” raved one customer. “I haven’t changed anything on my face and yet all my friends said I look different the day I got it done.”) The procedure involves either adding cartilage or an artificial material behind the ear or injecting hyaluronic acid. Sure things can go wrong—infection blood clots asymmetry etc.—but let’s face it even when the procedure is a complete success you’re still left with … elf ears.

It is interesting for the bystanders as the machine is not ploughing deeper into the soil.

“What I am doing is minimum tillage and many people here are seeing this for the first time” says the 75-year-old retired agricultural researcher.

Under the method soil is minimally disturbed to minimise damage to its structure evapo-transpiration labour and general costs. A machine called a ripper is used to do the task.

Ouma had accessed the machine digitally on his smartphone from farmer Peter Ademba who is offering the service.

Ademba who hails from Dadira village in Butula in the county purchased the tractor five years ago for hiring out.

In 2019 however he registered it under “Hello Tractor” a farm mechanisation app which links farmers to tractor owners.

Uber of farm mechanisation

The app can best be described as the ‘Uber’ of farm mechanisation. The app does not only help tractor owners get clients but also tracks their machines know when the fuel is running out or is being siphoned the distance the tractor has travelled the acreage it has ploughed and one can also use it to immobilise the equipment.

To access the service one buys a gadget which is installed on the tractor’s engine. The cost of the gadget will depend on the features the farmer needs. They later pay annual subscription fee for the services rendered which include links to farmers and monitoring the tractor.

“With this app farmers have been able to reach me easily. In 2019 I ripped 40 acres mainly in Busia County. But in 2020 and the planting season this year I have been able to do some 400 acres” he says.

After buying the tractor the first service was on his three acres. “I cultivated two acres using the minimum tillage technique then one acre using the traditional intensive cultivation method for people to compare and contrast” Ademba says.

“Work on the piece under minimum tillage was much easier cheaper and the crop was healthier” he adds.

To break even for tractor owners Hello Tractor employs farmer agents who aggregate smallholder farmers in an area so that there is a reasonable cumulative work to be done to warrant the tractor owner to send his machine to the ground.

Unlocking huge benefits

Ademba is the only tractor owner with a ripper in Busia County. He is invited to offer services in Siaya Bungoma and Kakamega counties.

“Charges depend on the services being rendered such as harrowing or normal cultivation. But for ripping services we charge Sh2500 per acre.”

As demand rises Ademba has partnered with a friend to buy another tractor.

“If need be I will go for a third tractor given the growing demand for mechanisation among smallholders.”

Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa President Dr Agnes Kalibata notes that putting nature at the heart of agriculture and land management can unlock huge benefits for people health and the environment.

During the recent United Nations Food Systems Summit Agriculture CS Peter Munya said that there is need to exploit the digital platform to promote and improve food security."

Otherwise known as “forever chemicals” PFAS do not break down and accumulate over time. Whether they are raining down from the sky or popping up in food packaging the mysterious chemicals have been finding their way into our bodies and environment — sometimes at concerningly high levels.

PFAS are dangerous because consistent exposure to the chemical is associated with low infant birth rates thyroid hormone disruption and even cancer according to the EPA. Some research has even connected higher exposure to PFAS to worse COVID outcomes. PFAS have been evasive found in everyday products like drinking water and now even amid growing calls for cleaner and safer beauty products scientists have found them in makeup.

A new study in the Environmental Science & Technology Letters found that some makeup wearers are being exposed and even ingesting potentially toxic levels of PFAS.

“This is the first study to look at total fluorine or PFAS in cosmetics so we just didn’t know what we were going to find” study author Tom Bruton a senior scientist with Green Science Policy Institute told the Guardian. “This is a product that people are spreading on their skin day after day so there’s really a potential for significant exposure.”

[Related: Are ‘clean’ cosmetics better for us than other beauty products?]

The researchers investigated 231 items of commonly available makeup including lipstick foundation and mascara. Many of the items could be found at large retailers including Sephora Ulta Beauty Target and Bed Bath & Beyond. A little over 50 percent tested positive for PFAS with only eight percent labeled for the chemicals. This has made it impossible for consumers to know if their products are safe— makeup users could be exposing themselves to the chemical in a number of cosmetics they use regularly.

Waterproof mascara liquid lipsticks and foundations were the most likely offenders for undisclosed PFAS. PFAS were often detected in makeup items that are intended for long wear and are not disclosed on ingredient labels.

“There’s no way for an average consumer to read a label and understand what’s in the product they just purchased” Graham Peaslee senior author of the study and professor of physics at the University of Notre Dame told the Washington Post. “They can’t trust the label and that can be fixed.”

Because makeup is worn around our eyes around our mouths and on our lips it makes the chances of ingesting PFAS even higher.

“Lipstick wearers may inadvertently eat several pounds of lipstick in their lifetimes” Peaslee said in a press release. “But unlike food chemicals in lipstick and other makeup and personal care products are almost entirely unregulated in the U.S. and Canada. As a result millions of people are unknowingly wearing PFAS and other harmful chemicals on their faces and bodies daily.”

Researchers also found that when users wash their makeup off it contributes to the PFAS found in the water supply which can then “lead to additional human exposure” researchers pointed out.

“PFAS are not necessary for makeup. Given their large potential for harm I believe they should not be used in any personal care products” said Arlene Blum a co-author and executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute in a press release. “It’s past time to get the entire class of PFAS out of cosmetics and keep these harmful chemicals out of our bodies.”

To combat the toxic chemicals in makeup and in our water supply U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) recently introduced the No PFAS in Cosmetics Act. The bill seeks to ban the use of PFAS chemicals in cosmetics like make-up moisturizer and even in perfume. Cosigners and supporters of the bill are hoping for a total ban of forever chemicals in all care products.

[Related: Everything you need to know about the chemical one White House aide called a ‘public relations nightmare.’]

Some states like California have already taken steps to remove toxic chemicals from personal care products and cosmetic giant L’Oreal made promises to remove PFAS in their products back in 2018. Some retailers including Target and Amazon are also looking more closely for toxic products. Still the US is woefully behind places like the EU and Japan which have all taken strides to protect consumers from toxins in beauty products which oftentimes have a higher impact on people of color.

“Although it’s desirable to have mascara or lipstick or foundation that lasts a little longer I believe most consumers would rather opt for safe products that might not have the same staying power” Whitney Bowe a clinical assistant professor of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center who was not involved with the study told CNN. “They do present a legitimate public safety concern.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2FtLXNsaWdodGx5LXNpZGUtZXllaW5nLWt5bGllLTE5MDQwNzEyMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I Am Slightly Side-Eyeing Kylie Jenner Talking About How Her Lip Insecurities Led To Her Entering The Beauty Industry,"Sports Yahoo Sports

Why Trust Us?

Jennifer Garner’s go-to retinol the  is on sale for $20 on Amazon.

“It does what it needs to do without turning me red and making my skin angry” she said of the product.

Reviewers also say this retinol “actually works” and is one of the “best I’ve ever tried.”

In addition to slathering on sunscreen Jennifer Garner says there’s another skincare step she really can’t live without: retinol. While she has access to the best of the best there’s one product that’s really blown her away—and it’s on sale for $20 on Amazon right now.

Garner who’s been a Neutrogena ambassador for years swears by the brand’s . “You’ve got to find a way to introduce your retinol products” Garner previously told Prevention. “That’s tricky for women because it can make you peel it can make you red.”

Retinol works by speeding up skin cell turnover which means it can help smooth fine lines improve skin texture lighten dark spots and even help treat acne. In the process you might notice redness and peeling as your skin adjusts to the treatment.

Garner’s skin is a bit sensitive so she turns to the oil to reap all the benefits without the excessive irritation. “It’s kind of a no-brainer at night” she said. “It does what it needs to do without turning me red and making my skin angry.”

Because it’s an oil it has built in moisture-locking properties to work alongside the concentrated retinol inside. And if the thought of oil on your face sends you running know that this one is formulated to be lightweight and fast-absorbing so it sinks right in.

Don’t just take Garner’s word for it: Reviewers say this product “actually works” and is one of the “best I’ve ever tried.”

“I already had a regular skincare regimen from which I had gotten significant improvement and this gave me significantly more! It made my skin softer smoother firmer and more even toned” one reviewer raves. “For me it is non-drying even moisturizing.”

“The change has been very noticeable” another writes. “I look more youthful and less tired. There [is] a glow to my face. Love this product.”",,,,,,

Might the fact that corporate investors snapped up 15 percent of U.S. homes for sale in the first quarter of this year have something to do with it? The Wall Street Journal reported in April that an investment firm won a bidding war to purchase an entire neighborhood worth of single-family homes in Conroe Texas—part of a cycle of stories drumming up panic over Wall Street’s increasing stake in residential real estate. Then came the backlash as cool-headed analysts reassured us that big investors like BlackRock remain insignificant players in the housing market compared with regular old American families.

The truth is between the two: We can panic and acknowledge Wall Street’s small role at the same time. Although the number of houses being purchased by mega-investors is currently not enough to move the market in most parts of the country these firms’ underlying structural advantage is profound and growing.

Let’s focus on Invitation Homes a $21 billion publicly traded company that was spun off from Blackstone the world’s largest private equity company in 2017. Invitation Homes operates in 16 cities with the biggest concentration in Atlanta where it owns 12556 houses. (Though that’s not much compared with the 80000 homes sold in Atlanta each year Invitation Homes bought 90 percent of the homes for sale in some ZIP codes in Atlanta in the early 2010s.) While normal people typically pay a mortgage interest rate between 2 percent and 4 percent these days Invitation Homes can borrow money for far less: It’s getting billion-dollar loans at interest rates around 1.4 percent. In practice this means that Invitation Homes can afford to tack on an extra $5000 to $20000 to the purchase price of every home while getting the house at the same actual cost as a typical homeowner. While Invitation Homes uses a mixture of debt and cash from renters to buy houses its offers are almost always all cash which is a big leg up in a competitive market.

One way to think about Invitation Homes’ business strategy is to consider the value of the properties the firm is buying relative to the rents they charge. According to a recent SEC disclosure Invitation Homes’ portfolio of homes is worth of total of $16 billion (after renovations) and the company collects about $1.9 billion in rent per year. That means it takes only about eight years of rental payments to pay back a typical house that Invitation Homes has bought. The usual rule of thumb for evaluating a fair sale price says Kundan Kishor professor of economics at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee “is that price to rent ratios are around 20 to 1.” When price-to-rent ratios are very high it makes more sense for consumers to rent than to buy and when they are low it makes more sense to buy than to rent. That Invitation Homes is getting deals twice as good as a typical homebuyer shows that it’s not just buying any homes: It’s buying the specific houses with the greatest potential to be wealth-building for the middle class.

It’s not exactly accurate that investors are “buying every single-family house they can find” as some have suggested. If that were true their market share in the United States wouldn’t be a piddling 15 percent. They’re really buying up the stock of relatively inexpensive single-family homes built since the 1970s in growing metro areas. They mostly ignore bigger and more expensive houses especially ones that are move-in ready: Wealthy boomers and the nation’s finance and tech bros nab those properties. And they’re also ignoring cities with stable or shrinking populations like Providence and Pittsburgh.

But investors are depleting the inventory of the precise houses that might otherwise be obtainable for younger working- and middle-class households in the cities where those workers can easily find good-paying jobs like Atlanta (22 percent of home purchases according to Redfin data) Charlotte (22 percent) and Phoenix (20 percent). More importantly they’re able to scour those markets scientifically and systematically to make cash offers on the most attractively priced properties. While normal people buy houses when they actually need to move somewhere (savvy) investors buy houses several years before a bunch of people need to move to an area. Whether they’re tracking where major employers are building new offices or looking at public school enrollment data being ahead of the market gives big firms a big leg up.

And in case you were assuming that converting houses to rentals would flood the market and bring down rents don’t get your hopes up: As Invitation Homes tells its investors “We operate in markets with strong demand drivers high barriers to entry and high rent growth potential.”

While renting might make sense for some people especially people who move a lot it often sucks particularly in the United States where we don’t have especially strong protections for tenants. The business strategy of the country’s biggest landlords Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent does not seem to be “Make renting with us so delightful that if my tenants have to move cities they’ll specifically seek out another property owned by our company.” Based on reports from Reuters the New York Times and the Atlantic it appears to be closer to “Squeeze our tenants for every penny avoid making repairs let black mold and raw sewage accumulate and count on the fact that moving is a huge expensive hassle.”

Our current system of encouraging homeownership is by no means perfect and it places a lot of unnecessary risk onto the “balance sheets” of the middle class but it’s worked out financially for most of the people who have been lucky enough to own a home. The implicit and explicit subsidies the government has given to Americans buying their first homes have been the biggest handout the American middle class has ever received (a handout notably denied to Black Americans for much of the 20th century one explanation for the current size of the racial wealth gap).

Laurie Goodman vice president of housing finance policy at the Urban Institute points out that policymakers could take steps to level the playing field between investors and the rest of us. She told me that buyers who need to borrow money using Federal Housing Administration loans or those who need a rehab loan for a fixer-upper have a particularly tough time competing against Wall Street firms. FHA paperwork often gets delayed slowing down the purchase process so home sellers often don’t want to sell to FHA buyers even if their bids are competitive. That’s a solvable problem. And loans for properties that need renovations Goodman says are both cumbersome and expensive. Rethinking the processes for FHA and rehab loans could “put individuals on a more equal footing” she explained.

If you don’t want all of America’s land and housing to end up in the portfolios of the 1 percent there’s ultimately one very simple solution: Tax the rich. After all the companies buying the houses are ultimately owned by people (or in some cases universities and churches which are their own cans of tax-advantaged rich-people worms). At the same time that the working-class is going hungry rich people are doing so outstandingly well that they are running out of easy places to park their cash which is why they’re buying 2000 square-foot houses in the Phoenix suburbs via their ownership stakes in these funds.

It is the fifth most mentioned stock in the last 24hrs. Has it seen its only surge? Let’s find out.

What is CLOV?

Clover Health Investments Corp is a firm that specializes in healthcare technologies. Seniors can enroll in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans through the company. Its plans include hospitalization medical visits and prescription drugs as well as vision dental and hearing care.

Is Clov the new big deal?

As of 8:00 p.m. on Friday June 18 Clover Health Investments Corp (CLOV) was down 4.14 percent while the S&P 500 was down -1.31 percent. CLOV is $0.52 lower than its previous close of $12.56 on the volume of 611352 shares. The S&P 500 has gained 34.62 percent in the last year while CLOV has gained 26.10 percent. CLOV has lost -$0.19 per share during the last year.

Why did Clov go down?

On June 8th CLOV had a share price of $22.15. On Friday it has plunged to $12.04 which is almost 50%.

Hindenburg Research a well-known short-selling company targeted Clover in February. Clover Health and its promoter Chamath Palihapitiya were accused of misleading investors while marketing the company in a report issued by the firm. United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened an inquiry into the allegations despite Clover management’s denials.

However after being highlighted on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets the stock soared to a high of $28.85.

Should you buy Clov?

Analysts on the other hand do not believe the gains will persist. The stock’s average price objective is 25% lower than the current share price.

However Clov is trending! According to wsbsentiment.io  CLOV is the fifth most mentioned stock in the last 24 hours. And it is as a matter of fact that no analyst has predicted the meme stocks accurately. Though indicators don’t look good for CLOV for the short term. Also to make its mark it will still have to compete with healthcare behemoths like UnitedHealth Group Anthem and Cigna who all have their own Medicare programs. Though after the current sell-off the stock appears to be a decent long-term investment at this pricing. Let’s watch it out.",,,,,,,,,

""It's a great standard"" Leonard said. ""I don't know if we could have done what we did last year without trying to live up to that standard.""

A provider of technology management tools in health care Agiliti served a critical role as the U.S. stockpiled medical equipment when the pandemic hit last year.

More recently it completed a successful public offering and even managed an acquisition during its registration process.

Agiliti is the third Minnesota company to complete an IPO in 2021 and shares in all three have grown more than 50% since they started trading. Agiliti completed its IPO on April 23 just days after chipmaker SkyWater Technology also of Bloomington and a few weeks after Sun Country Airlines based at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.

Three more Minnesota companies have filed for IPOs in recent weeks: Brooklyn Park-based CVRx Inc.; Bloomington-based Bright Health; and Eden Prairie-based Miromatrix Medical.

Agiliti was founded in 1939 as the ABC Oxygen Tent Rental Service Co. by Ed Fish in his mother's Minneapolis garage. In 1969 it changed to Universal Hospital Services Inc. then to Agiliti in 2018. From 1992 until 1998 Universal Hospital Services traded on Nasdaq.

Today Agiliti serves more than 7000 health care facilities across the U.S. chiefly hospitals. About 90% of all staffed hospital beds in the U.S. are within 100 miles of one of Agiliti's 98 repair and service centers. The company services include everything from infusion pumps to respirators imaging equipment to high-end surgical instruments.

Hospitals can't afford to purchase and own all the medical equipment that they might need for every situation. Agiliti coordinates the maintenance and repair of devices to deliver them bedside and patient-ready.

""We like to say we are positioned on the right side of health care in that we help make care safer and we help hospitals be more efficient"" Leonard said.

Ventilator hunt

When the government began purchasing respirators last year for COVID-19 treatments the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services gave Agiliti a one-year contract to manage the new stockpile.

On a recent visit to one of Agiliti's dedicated facilities for the stockpile Leonard said he saw rows of flight cargo containers filled with ventilators and other specialized devices that had been returned to be processed tested and repackaged to be deployed once again. ""I was briefly overwhelmed by the magnitude of what I was seeing"" Leonard said.

Agiliti operates under a nondisclosure agreement with the government to manage the emergency stockpile so there are limits on what executives can disclose. But what is public is that the government bought more than 200000 ventilators effectively doubling the number of respirators that U.S. hospitals had before the coronavirus outbreak.

""My wife would say why don't you tell people what you guys are actually doing?"" Leonard said. ""We never took the opportunity or found the time to tell our story and what we were actually doing as a big part of our nation's response.""

That contract expires in July and reopens for bidding. Leonard feels confident they will win the contract.

""While we could not have known that was going to happen it was not a surprise that it came to us given the history we already had in managing the pre-existing stockpile"" Leonard said. ""As the one-year comes to full-term we fully expect that this will be a competitive bid process and that it will be our obligation to go out and earn the right to continue to support it.""

IPO 'already spent'

Leonard said the process for the IPO started more than 18 months ago by selecting underwriters for the offering. The process had to reflect COVID restrictions and factor in regulatory approvals for its latest deal the March acquisition of Novi Mich.-based Northfield Medical. The deal expanded capabilities in surgical instrument repair such as endoscopes power equipment and other surgical goods and more geographic coverage.

Agiliti is still a controlled company with Thomas H. Lee Partners in Boston owning more than 75% of its shares. The proceeds were used to retire debt and bring down the company's leverage ratio. ""We've already spent the $390 million; we've put it to good use and now have the dry powder we need now to drive new growth"" Leonard said.

Leonard joined the company in 2015 when it was known as Universal Hospital Services Inc. and had annual revenue of approximately $400 million. The company finished 2020 with annual revenue just under $800 million.

According to Leonard the market that Agiliti serves is about $14 billion with about $6 billion of the market actively outsourced today. Agiliti's share of the outsourced market is approximately 18% of the wallet share of the market up from about a 12% share six years ago.

Agiliti has strong organic growth opportunities and the increased use of more complicated health care services means the overall market is growing. Matt Borsch an analyst with BMO Capital Markets initiated coverage of Agiliti with an outperform/buy rating expecting growth prospects to remain strong. ""Innovation within medical technology and patient procedures drives increasing numbers of devices and added complexity which is a natural growth driver for Agiliti's business as is the increasing imperative for cost efficiency"" Borsch wrote in his initial research note.

Agiliti will also use M&A activity to augment its growth. With much of its debt retired it can attract lower interest rates on new debt for acquisitions or use the newly public shares as a chip in negotiations.

Working with amazing people

Before most knew what COVID was Agiliti was sending people into areas hardest bit by the pandemic — places other people were fleeing. Leonard credits Agiliti employees for their dedication none of whom he said abandoned their jobs.

""What we've been doing and what we are continuing to do is focus on taking really good care of those teammates who did everything that we asked of them"" he said.

As a reward they were gifted stock as part of the IPO.

""We continue to look at ways to thank our team for the work they did over the last year"" Leonard said. ""Everybody's tired of talking about COVID but we owe a huge debt of gratitude to what those folks did.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kb3dudG9lYXJ0aC5vcmcuaW4vbmV3cy9oZWFsdGgvYmVoaW5kLXRoZS1jdXJ2ZS1ob3ctY292aWQtMTktZXhwb3NlZC1pbmRpYS1zLWFwYXRoZXRpYy1ydXJhbC1oZWFsdGgtaW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUtNzczOTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Behind the curve: How COVID-19 exposed India's apathetic rural health infrastructure,"It should not have taken a pandemic for the government to realise the importance of the rural healthcare infrastructure and of universal free access to it

The SARS-CoV-2 virus which is behind the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic does not differentiate between rural and urban areas. It just looks for susceptible people who still do not have the immunity against it.

Since rural India remained largely unscathed during the first wave of the pandemic the virus has found many susceptible victims there during its second wave.

An analysis by Down To Earth shows that in April rural districts accounted for 45.4 per cent of the total COVID-19 cases in the country and 50.8 per cent of the deaths. The numbers kept growing through May when rural districts surpassed urban districts in terms of COVID-19 cases and deaths. That month rural districts accounted for 53 per cent of the total new cases in the country and 52 per cent of COVID-19 deaths.

Owing to the nature of the virus its spread was inevitable. The current problem emanates from the fact that the rural areas are ill equipped to deal with diseases even in best of times. More than 65 per cent of the country’s population lives in rural districts according to World Bank data.

Yet hospitals in rural areas have just 37 per cent of the beds available in all government hospitals across the country admits the National Health Profile of India for 2019 a report prepared by the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence.

The problem also stems from the fact that the country has failed to strengthen its rural health infrastructure despite repeated warnings and advisories.

A parliamentary committee report on ‘Management of COVID-19 Pandemic and Related Issues’ presented to the chairperson of the Rajya Sabha on December 21 2020 indicated the possibility of the disease reaching rural areas. It had advised the government to ensure testing infrastructure and upgraded health infrastructure in remote and rural areas.

Earlier on November 21 another parliamentary committee report ‘Outbreak of Pandemic COVID-19 and it’s Management’ submitted to Rajya Sabha highlighted the poor state of primary healthcare in rural areas and recommended that the government increase its spending under the National Rural Health Mission to strengthen the delivery of healthcare services in rural areas during the pandemic.

It was only in May that some action was visible at the central level. On May 16 the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare released a standard operating procedure (SOP) on ‘COVID-19 Containment and Management in Peri-urban Rural and Tribal areas’.

The SOP outlined the preparations needed in rural areas and detailed the efforts states needed to take for surveillance screening isolation and referral of patients. It proposed a three-tier structure — COVID care centres to manage mild and asymptomatic cases; dedicated COVID health centres to manage moderate cases; and dedicated COVID hospitals to manage severe cases.

Implementing the SOP should not have been difficult as India already has a three-tier healthcare system in place — primary secondary and tertiary. Then where did it falter?

Ritu Priya professor at the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health Jawaharlal Nehru University Delhi said a healthcare system that does not work in normal times is not likely to work during a pandemic and under pressure. Besides the SOP document does not reflect any sense of urgency by the Union health ministry for rural India. It begins with the line “COVID-19 outbreak in the country is still predominantly an urban phenomenon” she said.

The SOP document also notes that 80-85 per cent of the people affected by COVID-19 do not need specialised care and can be quarantined at home or at a COVID care centre. However ensuring treatment to the remaining 15-20 per cent of COVID-19 infected persons requires major upgradation in healthcare infrastructure — community health centres sub-district and district hospitals and transport facilities — in rural areas. This was unthinkable for a health system that has been strapped for funds for decades now.

India’s public health expenditure (a sum of Central and state spending) has remained between 1.2 per cent and 1.8 per cent of GDP between 2008-09 and 2019-21. This is quite low when compared with other countries such as China (3.2 per cent) US (8.5 per cent) and Germany (9.4 per cent).

The National Health Mission which envisages achievement of universal access to equitable affordable and quality healthcare services receives about 50 per cent of the budgetary allocation for health. Worse the allocations for the rural component (National Rural Health Mission) has decreased by 3 per cent since last year.

Since 2014 the government’s focus has in fact shifted to providing healthcare by roping in the private sector. The National Health Policy (2017) also envisages providing healthcare in collaboration with the private sector. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) a component of the Union government’s flagship scheme Ayushman Bharat is an insurance-based scheme which has seen the highest increase in allocation for 2020-21 at 100 per cent ( Rs 6400 crore over the revised estimates of Rs 3200 crore in 2019-20).

The futility of this dependence on private healthcare providers via government-funded insurance schemes has become apparent during the pandemic. The private sector is not active in rural areas and even the hospitals present refused to provide care to COVID patients during the pandemic.

Even state-level insurance schemes did not perform well. Chhattisgarh for instance has a universal healthcare scheme the Khoobchand Baghel Swasthya Sahayata Yojana. During the pandemic this scheme should have come to the rescue of each COVID-19 infected person whether in rural or in urban areas.

But private hospitals refused to implement it. Instead several of them found newer ways to overcharge patients by providing plasma therapy and other unscientific and unproven therapies that do no good to patients reveals Sulakshana Nandi National Joint Convener of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA) and co-chair of People’s Health Movement a global network..

The government did not demand services from the private sector though it could have legally done so under the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 (just the way Kerala has done). Experiences of the poor say provision of an insurance card is not the same as effective access to free and quality care. Instead of learning from this failure of the private sector to provide any help during the pandemic NITI Aayog India’s premier think tank brought out a report Investment Opportunities in India’s Healthcare Sector on March 31 2021 with a focus on private healthcare.

“Going forward the Centre and NITI Aayog should abandon all plans for healthcare privatisations such as PMJAY and handing over district hospitals to private medical colleges and instead invest all money and efforts into strengthening the public health system at all levels” Nandi said.

Left in shambles

The major reason public healthcare has failed to perform during the pandemic is the deficiency in infrastructure — both in terms of physical structures and human resources.

As of 2018 India faced a shortage of 2188 community health centres (CHCs) 6430 primarily health centres (PHCs) and 32900 sub-centres. The existing ones too do not have adequate infrastructure and are poorly equipped.

According to an analysis by World Bank in 2017 India had only 0.5 beds per 1000 people far below the global average of 2.9 beds. Small wonder the rural healthcare infrastructure is now stretched to the limit during the pandemic.

“In some tribal areas of Maharashtra not a single oxygen bed is available in the entire block. People here had to travel long distances to access medical facilities without any assurance of a bed. More often than not their health condition deteriorates on the way to the health facility” said Abhay Shukla co-convenor JSA.

The isolation centres which had worked well in the first wave were not revived in the second wave. “In rural areas it is important to have institutional isolation centres to ensure adherence to COVID-appropriate behaviour” he added.

It is easy to bolster health infrastructure during such times of crisis. Potentially each rural school can be converted to an isolation centre which can then be monitored by ASHAs and ANMs. This is a public health measure that has to be implemented and supervised with direction from the top authorities.

Similarly each taluka in the state has a 30-bed hospital some of which can easily converted to oxygen beds. “In Chhattisgarh a number of government facilities got upgraded during the pandemic and have been doing a very well” Nandi said.

There is also a shortfall in the number of doctors specialists and surgeons. For example as of 2018 there was a deficit of 46 per cent of doctors and 82 per cent of specialists including surgeons obste-tricians gynaecologists physicians and paediatricians needed in PHCs across India.

WHO recommends 44 health workers per 10000 population but India has only 22 health workers per 10000 population. Rural areas have lower health worker density than the national average.

The Rural Health Statistics 2019-20 brought out by the Union health ministry points out that at the national level 11 per cent of ANM (trained female health workers) posts at sub-centres were vacant as were 35 per cent of the sanctioned positions for male health workers. Similarly 37 per cent of the positions for health assistants and 20 per cent for those of doctors at PHCs were not filled.

Even nurses and AYUSH (Ayurveda Yoga Naturopathy Unani Siddha Sowa-Rigpa and Homoeopathy) practitioners were short by 13 per cent and 9 per cent respectively.

The most basic health workers are missing even in a rich state like Maharashtra where the number of sanctioned positions for ANMs at the sub-centre level was 11975 of which only 10492 posts were filled.

Poor states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar as classified by the number of people living below the poverty line under the NITI Aayog’s SDG India Index for 2019 were worse off. While in Uttar Pradesh out of the sanctioned 23656 posts only 20389 were filled in Bihar only 13425 posts out of the sanctioned 20544 were occupied.

ASHAs and other frontline workers worked well during the first wave of the pandemic but as they were not adequately protected many got COVID-19. ASHAs in Pune Maharashtra have not been paid or remunerated for the extra work they are doing Shukla said.

Mitanins (female health volunteers) in Chhattisgarh have been working non-stop in the community since the pandemic began but they have neither been remunerated nor provided adequate protective equipment Nandi said. So they are demoralised discouraged sick and scared during the second wave.

Strength in community

However these community-level workers are needed to improve India’s response to COVID-19 and improve health basics. Some states have made an effort to improve the working of rural workers. On May 17 2021 the Odisha government issued a directive to provide a one-time support of Rs 10000 to ASHA workers to purchase protective equipment to help them work safely.

“Health cannot be produced it can only be co-produced— the public health system and people have to work together. Co-production of health is imperative in time of a pandemic. Everyone has to be mobilised” Shukla said.

The non-degree holder rural doctors too need to be included in this fight Ritu Priya said. These practitioners provide healthcare to over 80 per cent people in rural areas. Some states like West Bengal have woken up to this potential.

The state government is now enlisting these healthcare providers who are being officially recognised as grameen swasthya parisevaks and being trained to contain the spread of COVID-19 in rural areas particularly to counsel the increasing number of patients in home isolation.

SATHI or Support for Advocacy and Training to Health Initiatives a Pune-based non-profit has set up 30 help desks during the second wave to guide patients on where to go for tests and vaccinations and what treatment to avail. This is of huge help as the existing staff is preoccupied with clinical care and it can be easily set up across the country.

States like Kerala that have had some experience with pandemics have fared better in COVID-19 control due to participation of civil society in outbreak control and health service delivery. Team building among frontline functionaries and community leaders was spontaneous without any political or religious barriers as people had experience through the previous outbreaks of H1N1 in 2009 Nipah in 2018 and leptospirosis in 2019.

“Mobilising volunteers who are ready to go the extra mile was a deliberate strategy adopted by Kerala since 2008 through the People’s Campaign for Decentralised Planning” said Antony KR a Kochi based public health expert and an independent monitor of the National Health Mission.

Because of this 45000 registered volunteers are now helping the Kerala government in COVID-19 control activities. They are in addition to 26310 ASHA workers 33115 anganwadi workers and 4.54 million women entrepreneurs under the banner of Kudumbashree a scheme for neighbourhood women groups. Another 21682 elected ward members from village panchayats municipal corporations or councils too have joined this army of unpaid workers to tackle the pandemic.

Over the past year these volunteers have played a crucial role in tracing and isolating the infected persons at airports railway stations inter-state borders and bus terminals; running community kitchens to feed quarantined people especially the elderly patients in isolation hospitals the poor and the homeless; and to distribute dry ration kits Antony explained.

Ritu Priya pointed out that India can fight the pandemic successfully only with a decentralised approach. The entire government and the whole society must come together and take action keeping local-level conditions in perspective. In Dharavi the government machinery worked but the community also participated actively. The private sector does not have a role in pandemic control as it is not likely to do contact tracing or go to rural areas.

As of now vaccines appear to be the only way out of the pandemic. These would be especially useful in rural areas where healthcare is patchy.

Vaccine conundrum

Ideally the COVID-19 vaccination programme should have been a success in India which is not only a global leader in vaccine development but also has an existing universal immunisation programme in place. But in its attempt to address the issue of vaccine shortage amid the second wave the government has instead introduced new strategies that have now resulted in unjust and lopsided distribution of the vaccine.

While rolling out the COVID-19 vaccination programme the Centre had sanctioned Rs 35000 crore which is enough to purchase a vaccine for every citizen above 18 years of age. On December 28 2020 it also released the COVID-19 Vaccines Operational Guidelines to ensure a smooth rollout of these vaccines.

But deadlines were not set and all that was mentioned was that everyone who is eligible for the vaccine would get it. The guidelines aim to vaccinate some 300 million people — healthcare workers frontline workers those above the age of 50 years and those who have co-morbidities — by July 2021.

The vaccination drive was then opened up for people aged 45 years and above on April 1 2021. With the second wave the demand for vaccines increased and shortages were evident on the ground. But the government did not have a plan to meet this demand.

On April 19 2021 the government unveiled the Liberalised and Accelerated Phase 3 Strategy according to which states and private hospitals could procure half of the vaccine produced in the country. The manufacturers were allowed to sell these doses at a higher price.

Now those above 45 will receive the central quota and this can be dispensed for free to the population. The states could provide vaccines to those citizens they consider vulnerable while the private industry could vaccinate all those who do not necessarily fall in the vulnerable category but have the purchasing power.

This strategy has led to chaos and confusion on the ground. Bharat Biotech has announced that it would sell its vaccine Covaxin at Rs 400 per dose to the states while Serum Institute of India (SII) has set price for its vaccine Covishield at Rs 300 per dose. While SII has set the price at Rs 600 per dose for the private players Bharat Biotech has not revealed its price. These higher prices have resulted in an increase in the price of vaccine at private centres where Covaxin is available at Rs 1250 and Covishield at Rs 900.

Since neither of these companies have enough vaccines to meet the shortages states have tried to issue global tenders to expedite the vaccination process.

Uttar Pradesh with a population of more than 200 million floated a tender for 40 million doses of the vaccines on May 7. A couple of days later the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) invited expressions of interests to supply 10 million shots.

Many other states including Delhi have also floated similar tenders. But these states have not been successful in procuring vaccines through the tenders. “Things that should have been decentralised have been centralised and vice versa” Shukla rued. “We have a decentralised system for vaccine procurement but a centralised system for vaccine administration.”

The companies and the government are now trying to increase production too. As Covaxin is indigenous and developed by the Indian Council for Medical Research it is possible to licence the technology to multiple manufacturers. Some efforts have been made regarding this and facilities at three public sector vaccine manufacturing units are being ramped up so they are able to manufacture soon. Bharat Biotech too is increasing capacity.

Taking suo motu cognisance of the development on May 31 the Supreme Court has also questioned the Centre about its vaccine procurement policy and different price mechanisms for the jab. So far all the vaccines for India’s universal immunisation program were procured by the Centre alone and administered by the states free of cost as per the established universal immunisation programme.

The pandemic is an indicator of India’s failure in providing healthcare to all in the country. Now years of incremental improvements in health indicators in rural areas are lost as routine surgeries antenatal care and immunisation coverage dialysis and care of the kidney patients routine chemotherapy and radiotherapy of cancer patients are adversely affected.

It is a wake-up call and experts hope that some good would come out of this chaos too. For example this is the first time that all of adult population is reaching health centres for vaccination. These people can be screened for blood pressure and blood sugar and counselled for hypertension and diabetes. These are integral to comprehensive primary care proposed in the National Health Policy 2017.

Afirman que a pesar de poder dar servicios nuevamente el día lunes no les será posible el reutilizar la mercancía que ya tenían para tan esperada fecha en el sector comerciante en la ciudad.

De acuerdo con la información de JATO Dynamics -que incluyen 45 mercados a nivel mundial- las ventas de vehículos eléctricos alcanzaron 727000 unidades con el potencial de llegar a 750000 unidades si se incluyen los países restantes.

El volumen total también aumentó en un 142% en comparación con los primeros tres meses de 2020 cuando la pandemia comenzó a extenderse por los mercados.

En comparación con el primer trimestre de 2019 el volumen se ha más que duplicado.

Aproximadamente el 95% del volumen global se encuentra en China Europa y EE. UU.-Canadá.

El año pasado estas tres regiones representaron el 71% de todas las ventas de vehículos ligeros -incluyendo todos los tipos de combustible-.

Crecimiento en China

Por su parte China recuperó la primera posición en ventas de vehículos eléctricos después de perderla en el primer trimestre de 2020 debido a la pandemia.

Actualmente el 53% de todos los vehículos eléctricos de pasajeros vendidos se encuentran en China esto se debe a la implementación de fuertes paquetes de incentivos por parte de los gobiernos central y regional lo que explica la aceleración observada en el desarrollo y lanzamiento de autos más competitivos ofrecidos por marcas más recientes como NIO Xpeng Voyah y Byton.

Auge en Europa

Con casi 200000 unidades registradas entre enero y marzo de 2021 Europa se ha convertido en un actor importante que contribuye al rápido desarrollo de los vehículos eléctricos.

A diferencia de Japón y EE. UU. que decidieron centrarse en híbridos y grandes camiones / SUV respectivamente Europa decidió competir contra China gracias a sus decisiones fuertemente respaldadas por los gobiernos locales otorgando grandes paquetes de incentivos para impulsar la demanda.

Los vehículos eléctricos y los SUV han sido las únicas fuentes de crecimiento durante la pandemia. En estos primeros tres meses de 2021 los automóviles eléctricos puros representaron el 6.4% del mercado total imponiendo un nuevo récord. Al contrario de lo que sucedió en 2019 y 2020 el crecimiento ahora está impulsado por las armadoras locales que introducen más automóviles a precios competitivos.

La importancia de Tesla en EE.UU.

En EE.UU. los consumidores demandan camiones grandes y SUV lo que dificulta el cambio a automóviles eléctricos. A pesar de esto Tesla es el mayor vendedor de vehículos eléctricos del mundo gracias en parte a la demanda interna. Sus resultados han animado a otras marcas a sumarse a la carrera de vehículos eléctricos como Ford con el Mach-E y F-150 Lightning o GM trabajando en la línea electrificada de Hummer.

1 de cada 4 automóviles eléctricos de pasajeros vendidos en el primer trimestre es Tesla.

Aunque su participación de mercado ha disminuido en comparación con períodos anteriores debido a que existe una mayor competencia en la industria si tomamos en cuenta que es una marca relativamente nueva que solo tiene 4 modelos disponibles dos de los cuales tienen más de 6 años. Su crecimiento está impulsado por el Model 3 a nivel mundial y el Model Y en América del Norte (son los primeros y terceros vehículos eléctricos más vendidos en el primer trimestre de 2021).

Futuro eléctrico

Se prevé que el liderazgo de los vehículos eléctricos continúe a medida que se continúen lanzando nuevos autos eléctricos; Volkswagen Group tiene 11 modelos diferentes los cuales están ayudando a compensar las pérdidas registradas por sus autos de combustión interna -Golf Jetta Passat y Polo-. La línea ID de Volkswagen se posiciona bien en Europa con el ID.4 liderando el ranking europeo BEV en abril.

El Wuling Hongguang Mini EV es el eléctrico más vendido del país por delante del Model 3.

General Motors está creciendo a buen ritmo gracias a sus empresas conjuntas en China -Baojun y Wuling- las cuales están experimentando una gran demanda de sus vehículos eléctricos debido a sus bajos precios y atractivos paquetes.

Desafío internacional

A pesar del prometedor panorama los vehículos eléctricos aún no se adoptan por completo en la industria y no lo serán hasta que sus precios caigan a niveles que los consumidores puedan pagar así que si la industria no actúa rápidamente existe el riesgo de no acceder a una gran base de clientes lo que tiene el potencial de impactar negativamente la ocupación de la fábrica y los niveles de empleo.

El papel de los gobiernos será clave para esta adopción ya sea con mayores incentivos o reduciendo los impuestos sobre estos automóviles.

La legislación está obligando a los gobiernos a asegurar sus planes para reducir las emisiones de carbono por lo que se deben desarrollar estrategias de acuerdo con las expectativas del gobierno y del mercado.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVsdGltYWhvcmEuY29tL2VsLWNpcC1lc3RpbWEtcXVlLWVsLWNvbnRyYWJhbmRvLXByb2R1Y2UtY2FpZGEtZGVsLTIwLXZlbnRhcy1uMjk0Njc3NdIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVsdGltYWhvcmEuY29tL2VsLWNpcC1lc3RpbWEtcXVlLWVsLWNvbnRyYWJhbmRvLXByb2R1Y2UtY2FpZGEtZGVsLTIwLXZlbnRhcy1uMjk0Njc3NT9fYW1wPXRydWU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,El CIP estima que el contrabando produce caída del 20% en ventas,"El presidente del Centro de Importadores del Paraguay (CIP) Elzear Salemma dijo que en el gremio estiman que el aumento del contrabando está generando la caída de más del 20% de las ventas en el comercio formal.

En su análisis sobre cómo está afectando el contrabando a la economía formal en este momento Salemma expresó que esto se da por sectores. Por ejemplo apuntó que la importación y venta de vehículos y maquinarias agrícolas están bien pero no así los importadores formales de café aceite vinos y otros productos alimenticios. “También los productos como champú crema dental jabón en polvo y otros productos están muy afectados por el ingreso masivo de contrabando” recalcó.

Salemma manifestó que no sabe cuál es la diferencia en este momento en cuanto a competitividad de precios con Argentina y Brasil pero sí hay una diferencia en el cambio teniendo en cuenta que aquí sube mientras en estos países baja. Dijo que esto plantea una encrucijada con las importaciones y exportaciones de nuestro país para el BCP.

“La diferencia de precios de los productos de contrabando es sustancial. Pero hay que recordar que estos no ingresan tampoco de forma gratuita al país porque deben hacer pagos elevadísimos para ingresar al país y aún así tienen buen precio” recalcó.

Exportación en pesos. Salemma consideró que la diferencia de precios obedece al tipo de cambio. Explicó: “El importador formal importa en dólares y el importador informal compra en pesos y hay muchos productos que están subsidiados en la Argentina. Entonces no es que el importador está ganando mucho más que el informal y que por eso es más caro sino la diferencia se inicia y está en el medio de pago”.

Sobre el punto a partir de este aspecto planteó negociar con Argentina para que permita la exportación en pesos. “Ahí el importador formal estaría más cerca y casi en igualdad de condiciones con el informal” indicó.

Respecto a la caída en las ventas por ejemplo en los supermercados refirió que está en el orden del 20%. Incluso apuntó que algunos pueden estar en el orden del 25 o 28%. “Vamos a ver después del Día del Padre cómo termina junio” subrayó.

Control debe ser en varios frentes

La responsabilidad del combate al contrabando no puede recaer exclusivamente sobre la Aduana destacó también Elzear Salemma porque los productos ilegales no precisamente pasan por los puestos de fiscalización. “Es por Aduanas donde menos pasa el contrabando. Para eso tienen una gran extensión del río y también la frontera seca. Entonces para detener el ingreso siempre hubo problemas” dijo.

El importador añadió que el control se debe hacer internamente y es triste ver que debido a la desidia los productos ilegales se exhiben y venden con alevosía frente a los supermercados y los ministerios. “Es una cosa que venimos repitiendo hace añares. No hay una autoridad que reaccione y exija de dónde se traen esas mercaderías. A esto hay que sumarle la evasión impositiva teniendo en cuenta que la economía informal está estimada que es un 40%” remarcó Salemma.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vaGlzdG9yaWNvLmVsc2FsdmFkb3IuY29tL2hpc3Rvcmljby84NTAwMDUvdmVudGFzLWxsdXZpYS1jZW50cm8tc2FuLXNhbHZhZG9yLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sombrillas y capas entre los artículos que venden en la capital para protegerse de las lluvias | Noticias de El Salvador ...,"Sombrillas y capas entre los art�culos que venden en la capital para protegerse de las lluvias

Name: Ali Jahangiri

Birthplace: Tehran Iran

Place of residence: Vantaa Finland (in the Greater Helsinki Metropolitan Area of Finland)

Fun fact about yourself: I meditate in cold water and constantly battle iPhone Siri.

BSc and MSc programmes:

Bachelor’s programme in Business Administration; MSc Economics and Business Administration

Can you tell us a little bit about your life and career before studying for a business degree?

I moved to Finland with my parents and brother at the age of 10. Grew up in a poor suburb of Vantaa Finland. Started working at the age of 13 to help my parents cover living expenses. Played basketball for the local team until 17. Applied for High School and got accepted to the Helsinki English School. It was a private school where I thought break dancing to cover my tuition. After high school went to the army and got accepted to the Finnish military academy but my parents did not allow me to enter because they did not flee one war to see their son join another military.

(Please note that in Finland every male citizen has a duty to serve the country as conscript. Women have a possibility for voluntary service.)

Talk us through your decision to seek refuge and move and the journey this involved?

I did not have much saying in the matter. My parents woke me and my brother up in the middle of the night and we left.

What did you find most difficult when arriving in a completely new country?

I was 10 at the time. Learning the language and finding new friends was the most difficult in the beginning. Also becoming the family caretaker as I was the first to learn the language left its marks. I had to translate my parent’s doctor appointments social care meetings and other events that a normal 10-year-old would not have to face.

Why did you decide to apply for the Helsinki School of Economics (today Aalto University School of Business) and a degree in Business?

Since I could not accept my place in the Military Academy I took a year off to figure out what I wanted. Medical School and Law School were good options but I was more eager to become an entrepreneur. Some of my friends had applied and got accepted to the school so I chose the same path.

How was your experience and what did you find most challenging?

I had a very good experience. It took me about 10 years to finally graduate from Aalto University School of Business since in my final year I got a job in a prestigious consulting company. I climbed the ranks fast and my studies became secondary. But finally in 2012 I graduated shortly after resigning from my position in the company and founding my venture.

Story continues

Can you talk us through your life and career post-graduation?

I graduated in 2012. I had already built a career in consulting and it was time to set up my own company. I had started performing stand up comedy in 2007. And by 2013 I had built a brand around my comedy that needed my full-time attention. In 2016 I relived my refugee tail while filming a documentary about the refugees entering Europe. Hamy Ramezans and my movie The Refugee Unknown won the best movie title at the Tampere Film Festival.

What skills have you utilized from the program in your career?

Overall knowledge of marketing and the essence of management has helped me build my current status.

What advice would you give to other refugees looking to leave their countries and considering studying for a business degree?

Don’t give up. It’s a lot of work but you will make it. I became an established comedian and an entrepreneur and my brother studied to become a medical doctor and he has also started his own company.

Where do you see yourself in the next five years?

I have a plan for my future but I can only live this moment

It’s a securities fraud case stemming from – in the dramatic terms typically used in these cases – “defendants’ misrepresentation and concealment of Mylan’s systemic and egregious violations of FDA regulations governing pharmaceutical product quality and safety.”

Named in the suit are Mylan President Rajiv Malik now Viatris president; Mylan CEO Heather Bresch now retired; Mylan Chief Commercial Officer Anthony Mauro now Viatris president for developed markets; and Mylan Chief Financial Officer Ken Parks who did not join Viatris.

The suit spans the time period of Feb. 16 2016 through May 7 2019. It says that under Malik’s direction Mylan began to systematically disregard current good manufacturing practices in order to increase production and profits.

The suit combines FDA records statements by former Mylan employees and accounts from a book called “Bottle of Lies” that describes alleged corruption across the entire generics industry including at Mylan.

The complaint says that Mylan employees under Malik’s direction shredded documents altered drug tests manipulated testing data and did what’s called “testing into compliance” which is repeating a test until the sample passes.

And while experiencing problems at Morgantown the complaint alleges Malik Bresch and Parks gave misleading statements regarding quality assurance and data integrity compliance the extend of the FDA findings from inspections in 2016 and 2018 and at other Mylan facilities on other dates and the scope and impact of the remediation at Morgantown.

The suit notes that the Morgantown plant produced about 85% of all Mylan’s tablets and capsules during the period I question. At the beginning of the period Mylan sought to increase production to offset competition from low-cost overseas manufacturers.

“With the need for increased production Mr. Malik purposefully under-budgeted quality control functions including by gutting Morgantown’s quality assurance teams” the suit says.

Stemming from whistleblower complaints the suit says the FDA conducted inspections at Morgantown and in Nashik India and issued Form 483s documenting safety and data failures in 2016. One page of the report for Nashik notes 150 messages indicating “possible data corruption or modification of file” in a span of seven days in a message center log.

In Morgantown “the FDA “found thousands of random computer files containing what appeared to be forbidden exploratory tests and bins full of shredded documents including quality control records in areas where such documentation was to be preserved.”

That was followed by a warning letter. Mylan corrected the problems the FDA addressed but following another whistleblower report the FDA returned to Morgantown in August 2018 and found a variety of record-keeping quality-control and cleaning issues.

After that inspection Mylan temporarily halted plant production reduced production volume by about two thirds and undertook remediation measures including “right sizing” plant staff from 3500 to 3000 (the current figure to be laid off or separated is 1431).

The suit alleges that Mylan leaders misled investors by saying that the remediation was planned before the 2018 inspection though the inspection played a role.

From June 2018 through May 2019 Mylan’s stock share price fell from $37.45 to $21.53. The latter price followed a May report that Mylan suffered a first-quarter loss due in part to Morgantown remediation. “The news shocked market analysts.” (Viatris’ closing price Friday was $14.26 per share.)

Defendants moved in January to dismiss the suit and in April further expanded on their arguments.

They say Form 483s are not findings of violations but interim FDA observations expressly intended to prompt discussion and voluntary improvements. The 2016 and 2018 inspections were surprise inspections not because of wrongdoing but because all FDA inspections are surprise. By law they are not material.

Company leaders did not conceal or mischaracterize anything the defendants say because they are not obliged to disclose Form 483 reports. And their positive statements about compliance and quality control are not legally actionable. “Given Mylan’s cautionary warnings no reasonable investor could have been misled to believe that Mylan was in compliance with all regulatory requirements or that it had not received Form 483s. … Despite its commitment to compliance its efforts might not always satisfy regulatory standards.”

Regarding the whistleblower reports the defendants say they could not have disclosed that because they didn’t know of any – the FDA would likely never tell them.

The defendants also question the credibility of the former employees saying they lacked sufficient knowledge and “Bottle of Lies” saying by court standards it wasn’t adequately sourced.

The case is in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.

It might be the last thing you want to hear but it's the truth: A stock market crash is inevitable.

Since the March 23 2020 bottom investors have enjoyed a historically strong bounce-back rally -- the widely followed S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.51%) has gained an impressive 90%. But both history and valuation metrics unequivocally suggest that a big drop is upcoming for the stock market.

History is pretty clear that trouble lies ahead

For example there have been one or two double-digit percentage declines within the three years following a bottom in each of the previous eight bear markets prior to the coronavirus crash (i.e. dating back to 1960). Although bull markets tend to last years rebounds from a bear market are never this smooth. We're nearly 15 months past the March 2020 bear-market bottom in the S&P 500 and have yet to see anything close to a double-digit correction.

To add to this point data from market analytics firm Yardeni Research shows that there have been 38 double-digit declines in the S&P 500 over the past 71 years. That's a crash or correction on average every 1.87 years. Though the market doesn't adhere to averages it does give a general sense of when to expect these hiccups.

On a valuation basis the S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a waving red flag. The S&P 500's Shiller P/E -- a measure of inflation-adjusted earnings over the previous 10 years -- almost hit 38 earlier this week. That more than doubles its 151-year average and it's the highest level in nearly two decades. The previous four times the Shiller P/E surpassed and held above 30 during a bull market rally the index subsequently declined by a minimum of 20%.

Make no mistake about it -- a stock market crash is coming.

Every crash or correction is an opportunity for patient investors to make money

However a crash is no reason to duck and cover. While history may signal trouble ahead it also tells us that each and every double-digit decline has been a buying opportunity. Eventually every big drop in the major indexes is erased by a bull-market rally. When the next crash does occur the following five high-conviction stocks can be confidently bought hand over fist.

CrowdStrike Holdings

Cybersecurity is projected to be one of the safest double-digit growth trends this decade. No matter the size of the business or the state of the U.S./global economy protecting enterprise and consumer data is paramount. This means cloud-based cybersecurity stock CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD 1.33%) can thrive in any environment.

CrowdStrike's success derives from its cloud-native Falcon security platform. Because it's built in the cloud and relies on artificial intelligence it's growing smarter at identifying and responding to threats all the time. It's currently overseeing 6 trillion events on a weekly basis and it's far more cost-effective at protecting data than on-premise solutions.

We can also look to the company's income statements to see clear-cut evidence that businesses favor CrowdStrike's cybersecurity platform. It's been retaining 98% of its clients has seen existing clients spend 23% to 47% more on a year-over-year basis for the past 12 quarters and recently reported that 64% of its customers have purchased at least four cloud module subscriptions. Scaling with its customers is CrowdStrike's ticket to big-time cash flow expansion.

Facebook

Brand-name businesses can make patient investors a fortune and social media giant Facebook (META 0.60%) is the perfect example.

When the curtain closed on March Facebook tallied 2.85 billion monthly active users (MAU) visiting its namesake site and an additional 600 million unique MAUs visiting WhatsApp or Instagram which it also owns. All told this equates to 44% of the global population interacting with its owned sites each month. There's simply no social media platform businesses can go to get their message to a broader (or potentially targeted) audience which is why Facebook ad-pricing power is so strong.

But here's the kicker: Facebook hasn't even put the pedal to the metal. Although it's on track to generate more than $100 billion in advertising revenue in 2021 nearly all of these ad sales are coming from its namesake site and Instagram. WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger which are two of the six most-visited social sites in the world aren't being meaningfully monetized as of yet. Further the company's Oculus virtual reality devices are still in the early stage of their growth. Suffice it to say Facebook offers ample upside as its other operating segments are monetized and mature.

NextEra Energy

Another high-conviction stock to buy hand over fist the next time a crash or steep correction strikes is electric utility stock NextEra Energy (NEE 2.38%).

Did I put you to sleep when I said ""electric utility stock?"" Electric utilities are traditionally known for their market-topping dividend yields and persistently low growth rates. But this doesn't describe NextEra Energy. NextEra has aggressively invested in renewable energy projects and is leading the country in solar and wind capacity. As a result of these investments its electric generation costs have declined and its compound annual growth rate has consistently been in the high single digits for more than a decade. It also doesn't hurt that NextEra is front-running any potential green-energy legislation that might come out of Washington.

In addition to growth rates that are well above the sector average NextEra still benefits from the predictability of energy demand. For instance its regulated utilities (i.e. those not powered by renewable energy) require approval from state utility commissions before price hikes can be passed along to households. This might sound like an inconvenience but it's actually great news. It means NextEra won't be exposed to potentially volatile wholesale pricing.

Visa

When the next stock market crash arrives payment processing kingpin Visa (V 0.49%) is a winning company to confidently buy hand over fist. It's also another brand-name company that can still make its shareholders a fortune.

Buying into the Visa growth story is a simple numbers game. Visa grows its revenue and profits when consumers and businesses are spending more. This happens when the U.S. and global economy are expanding. Although contractions and recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle they tend to be short-lived. Meanwhile periods of economic expansion are almost always measured in years. Buying into Visa during these short-lived crashes or corrections should allow long-term investors to be handsomely rewarded by this numbers game.

The other interesting thing about Visa is that it's shunned becoming a lender. You'd think that Visa could generate big bucks from interest income and fees by lending during these long-lived periods of expansion. But lending would also expose Visa to the credit delinquencies that arise during recessions. Operating solely as a payment processor means not having to set aside cash to cover delinquencies. It's why Visa rebounds so much faster than most financial stocks following a recession.

Amazon

Lastly (and who couldn't see this coming?) investors should take any discount they can get during a crash on e-commerce behemoth Amazon (AMZN 0.80%).

Amazon's online marketplace has proved virtually unstoppable for well over a decade. An April 2021 report from eMarketer pegged the company's share of U.S. online sales at 40.4%. That more than quintuples its next-closest competitor and effectively solidifies Amazon as the go-to source for online shopping in the U.S.

What about those pesky low retail margins you ask? Amazon has signed up more than 200 million people globally to a Prime membership. The fees collected from Prime members help to offset some of the company's retail-based margin weakness. Prime members are extremely loyal to the Amazon ecosystem and spend far more than non-members too.

But it's Amazon's cloud infrastructure segment that's the superstar. Amazon Web Services (AWS) brings in around one-eighth of the company's total sales but accounts for well over half its operating income. Since cloud margins are superior to retail and advertising margins AWS is the company's key to explosive cash flow growth this decade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnphd3lhLmNvbS9lbi9sZWdhbC9yZW5ld2FsLW9mLW9ubGluZS1yZXNpZGVuY2UtYW5kLXZpc2EtdmFsaWRpdHktZm9yLWV4cGF0cy1vdXRzaWRlLWt1d2FpdC1nejBrNWZoZdIBdWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnphd3lhLmNvbS9lbi9sZWdhbC9yZW5ld2FsLW9mLW9ubGluZS1yZXNpZGVuY2UtYW5kLXZpc2EtdmFsaWRpdHktZm9yLWV4cGF0cy1vdXRzaWRlLWt1d2FpdC1nejBrNWZoZT9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Renewal of online residence and visa validity for expats outside Kuwait,"KUWAIT CITY: The General Administration of Residency Affairs stated that online renewal of residence from MOI website will continue for all kinds of visas even if expats are not in the country for Government sector article 17 for Private company employees article 18 for domestic workers article 20 and for family/dependents article 22 provided their passport is valid for more than one year ahead and if the companies have no legal obstacles.

What is being circulated in social media about expats who are outside Kuwait and their residence will not be renewed is not true at all.

Absence in Kuwait for above 6 months rule was suspended and expats can enter Kuwait as long as their residence is valid hence those outside Kuwait have no pressure to return reports Al Anba.

Most likely as long as there is a ban implemented on expats to enter this will continue until further instructions.

Currently there are more than 200000 expats who are staying illegally in Kuwait without renewing their residence and new decision will be implemented within two months.

Deadline for residence law violators (illegals) is looming and they will need to rectify their residence status as restrictions for the non vaccinated have been implemented to enter major complexes malls restaurants event halls.",,,,,,

Special Master David Cohen appointed by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio Eastern District said in his ruling that the plaintiffs showed that McMillon may have ""personal knowledge of and involvement in"" matters relevant to the case.

The plaintiffs want to depose McMillon as part of the discovery process in the suit.

The wide-ranging multidistrict litigation involves lawsuits filed by more than 3300 municipal and tribal entities battling the opioid epidemic in the U.S. The cases target pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors as well as pharmacies that fill prescriptions for opioids.

Walmart is among the pharmacy chains named in the lawsuit. The Bentonville-based retailer has more than 5000 pharmacies in its stores and clubs nationwide.

In objecting to the plaintiffs' request Walmart said in court documents that ""high-level executives are vulnerable to numerous repetitive harassing and abusive depositions"" especially in multidistrict litigation.

""Because the ... request for Mr. McMillon's deposition is harassing on its face Walmart requests that the Special Master deny it outright"" Walmart said according to court records.

""Should the Special Master need additional information from Walmart on this issue Walmart requests that the opportunity to fully brief a motion for a protective order"" the company said in court documents.

The deposition is limited to 90 minutes and can cover only subject matter contained in a previous sanctions order. It will be conducted by videoconference with Cohen presiding.

Cohen said in his ruling that the plaintiffs presented ""evidence and colorable argument"" that McMillon was aware of and involved in Walmart's adoption and use of its pharmacy policies called Blanket Refusals to Fill and a Blocked Prescribers list.

Cohen also agreed with the plaintiffs that McMillon may have relevant information about these policies that no one else in the company has.

The ruling describes Blanket Refusals to Fill as Walmart's national list of doctors whose opioid prescriptions an individual Walmart pharmacist decided not to fill.

The Blocked Prescribers list is described as a national list identifying doctors whose opioid prescriptions Walmart has prohibited all its pharmacists from filling.

Is the Echelon Connect Sport a good exercise bike?

Though it may not have as many bells and whistles as say the Peloton Bike+ or NordicTrack's S22i the Connect Sport is a great entry-level exercise bike that delivers an effective cardio workout. There's no touchscreen display or automatically adjusting resistance (even the original Peloton didn't have this) but the rest of the Connect Sport like its design ride experience and durability put in on par with many higher-end bikes.

And don't let the lack of that touchscreen sway you; the Connect Sport's handlebars feature dedicated space for you to use a screen of your own be it a smartphone or tablet.

The fact this bike's on sale for under $500 while also coming with a free month of unlimited access to streaming classes makes it that much more of an attractive deal.

Can I stream Peloton classes with this bike?

Since the Connect Sport doesn't have its own onboard touchscreen you're able to freely stream any fitness class or service you like so long as you have something to stream it on (e.g. a smartphone tablet computer or streaming device). This includes Peloton's Digital Membership NordicTrack's iFit or any other brand that offers on-demand classes.

Do keep in mind that Walmart's Deals for Days discount does come with a free 30-day membership to Echelon United the brand's streaming library of live and on-demand classes. This means that you'll have at least one free month of unlimited content before needing to pay for access (which is $40 per month).

A prime example: the 2019 iPad Mini. As of June 20 you can pick one up at Walmart for $70 off the original price; just $329 (that's less than Amazon's lowest price ever).

DISNEYLAND WON'T REQUIRE VACCINATED GUESTS TO WEAR FACE MASKS

A recent poll of over 1000 respondents conducted by Insider in May found that 222 respondents with a yearly income of $75000 or less said they either ""definitely would"" or ""probably would"" take a Disney vacation compared to 109 respondents making more than $75000 per year saying the same though the poll did not distinguish between the Orlando and California theme parks.

Over 32% of participants with children said they would like to visit a Disney property but can't afford to while about 23% of individuals without children said the same. More than 50% of respondents both with and without children said Disney vacations are too expensive ""in general"" to warrant a trip.

Insider previously reported that a five-day Disney trip for the average family of four now costs about $6033 including $2613 for tickets a four-night stay in a family suite at one of the park's budget hotels for $2617 and the lowest cost dining plan at $1100. The breakdown does not include add-on experiences air travel or transport costs parking fees merchandise or any other extras.

In February Disney CEO Bob Chapek said the company was taking a ""more aggressive"" financial strategy ""particularly at Disneyland."" Disneyland's newest offerings include a $100 super-sized sandwich at Pym's Test Kitchen in the Marvel-themed Land Avengers Campus as well as a $60 ""web slinger"" accessory for the new area's Spiderman ride.

The price of one adult Disneyland ticket currently starts at $104 for a single day compared to a starting price of $109 at Walt Disney World. However Disneyland tickets at that price point have not been available since the park reopened in April. Meanwhile the most expensive ticket a one-day Park Hopper is about $209 at Disneyland and $201 at Disney World.

As for hotel rooms San Francisco Gate reports the least expensive room available for a night in July at Walt Disney World is currently at Disney's All-Star Movies for $163 and the least expensive room for the same time at Disneyland is the Paradise Pier Hotel at $463. On the higher end the Disneyland Hotel hovers in the $500 range for a standard room and both Disney World's Grand Floridian Resort and Spa and Disney’s Grand Californian Hotel can charge as high as nearly $800 for a standard room.

Disney World’s Magic Kingdom bills itself as “the most magical place on Earth” which is only true if you buy in completely. There the pretzels are shaped like Mickey Mouse the air on “Main Street USA” circulates the scent of fresh-baked cookies and Cinderella herself might blow you a kiss from a parade float.

Reality has no bearing at a Disney theme park – which is part of the parks’ appeal to many LGBTQ fans. A trip to a Disney park promises an escape from life as you knew it permission to experience unfettered childlike wonder and pose for photos with both Mary Poppins and Sadness the perpetual downer from “Inside Out.”

Many queer and trans Disney fans are aware of the spell they’re under which typically fizzles out somewhere in the parks’ prodigious parking lots or on the drive back. But they buy in anyway because at the parks they feel at home.

“The feeling of escaping reality and the harsh impact of society seems to just disappear once you walk into the park gates” said Franky Dalog a transmasculine park employee.

Disney’s brand of manufactured Americana feels real to the queer and trans people who’ve dedicated their personal and professional lives to the brand. The parks have convinced them that magic exists within its walls – that there’s a toothless candy-coated world where no one questions whether they belong.

Disney parks take them back to childhood

For many LGBTQ Disney fans coughing up the cash for a Disney park ticket is worth the nostalgia trip. Disneyland Disney World and their international sister parks capitalize on guests’ childhoods which for adults of all ages are likely tied to the popular Disney films they grew up with.

“Growing up and watching ‘Snow White’ or watching ‘Cinderella’ as a queer little boy just having this fantasy of Disney … it always felt like love” said Joél Morales director of operations at the LGBTQ+ Center in Orlando.

Morales said Orlando’s proximity to Disney World’s four parks is partially what drove him to move to the area which is one of the most vibrant and populous LGBTQ communities in the country.

Disney was America to a young Uriel Diaz whose parents emigrated from Mexico and raised him in Texas. Though his parents couldn’t afford to take their four children to Orlando to visit the parks in person the films were the soundtrack to his life.

Uriel Diaz pictured in front of Ariel's grotto went to Disney World for the first time when he was 30. Courtesy Uriel Diaz

“To them giving their kids ‘the best’ was the American dream and in their eyes that was Disney” he said of his parents. “They filled my entire childhood with magic.”

He finally made the trip to Magic Kingdom when he was 30 when the park was decorated for Christmas. The magic was “amped up to 1000” Diaz said. It was just as perfect as he’d always imagined.

Queer fans identify with characters

Despite the parks’ queer appeal Disney films had up until recently largely ignored LGBTQ characters. LGBTQ characters in newer films often appear in comparatively minor roles or experience more subtle romantic moments onscreen.

But queer fans who spoke to CNN said they see phases of their own stories reflected in protagonists who often begin their hero’s journeys as outsiders.

“I think it’s something a lot of gay people connect with to be honest even though there was zero representation in the movies themselves” said Gregory Gaige a Disney blogger from the UK. “It’s the whole sense of getting a ‘happily ever after’ in the end that we all yearn for.”

Gregory Gaige and his fiancé got engaged at Disney World. Cast members helped organize the surprise proposal. Courtesy Gregory Gaige

Gaige saw parallels to homophobia and coming out in “The Little Mermaid” in which Ariel is told she can’t be the version of herself she dreams of being so she must leave her underwater home to transform. He loves Hercules and Belle of “Beauty and the Beast” for the same reason – their greatness what makes them special is unappreciated and unnoticed by those around them until they find the place where they belong. Hercules sings quite plainly about it in the song “Go the Distance.”

Elsa the snow queen of “Frozen” is widely speculated to be a queer-coded Disney hero (though she is portrayed as violent and unstable at times). She’s made to suppress her unique powers from the rest of the world which inhibits her ability to connect with people – a subtext that culture scholar Angel Daniel Matos quickly identified as one of the queerest stories in Disney’s canon in a 2014 essay.

“After Elsa discovers and unleashes her ‘queer’ identity she is able to collapse the binaries that have regulated and haunted her life” wrote Matos an associate professor of gender sexuality and women’s studies at Bowdoin College.

“Conceal don’t feel don’t let them know” Elsa sings in the inescapable anthem “Let it Go.” She ends the song by literally letting her hair down and testing out her powers for the first time. She’s liberated.

“I don’t have to explain to anyone why my favorite Disney princess is Queen Elsa” Dalog said.

Disney is starting to improve inclusion efforts

Long before Disney made conscious efforts for wider inclusion queer fans of one Mickey Mouse had already established their own communities within the fandom. Gay Days a weeklong vacation that encourages same-sex couples and their families to spend some time at the parks and in Orlando’s gay scene came about in 1991.

The event was controversial when it began to boom in popularity. But today the “controversy… has disappeared” according to the history section of its website.

“The protesters and the warning signs at the Magic Kingdom entrance have been replaced by smiling cast members” the site says.

Many LGBTQ fans have made careers out of their Disney fandom and their experiences at the parks as queer people.

Diaz is known for “bounding” – that’s the term among Disney devotees for stylishly and subtly dressing up as a favorite Disney character to circumvent the park’s restrictions against adult costumes. He’s recently posted photos as Cruella mimicking her two-toned hair (which he extended to his beard and brows) and Cinderella’s Fairy Godmother designed to inspire his fellow queer Disney bounders.

Megan O’Kane based in Northern Ireland runs a successful Disney blog and Instagram account where she documents her travels to Disneyland Paris with her girlfriend. She said her love for Disney has “completely changed [her] life.”

“We have never felt anything but welcome safe and comfortable in the parks” O’Kane told CNN.

The fans told CNN they think Disney is improving its inclusion of LGBTQ fans and employees. In recent years the Paris theme park has hosted Pride parties throughout June. The company when reached by CNN for comment pointed to recent changes to its employee dress code and new Pride-themed products as examples of newer inclusive measures. In April Disney expanded its strict employee dress code to include “gender-inclusive hairstyles jewelry nail styles and costume choices” even going so far as to approve “appropriate visible tattoos.”

Even material tokens of inclusion like pins designed with the colors of the transgender or bisexual flags and the rest of this year’ Rainbow Collection can feel meaningful to fans said Dalog.

He said he feels “safe and supported” at the parks because he knows how many of his fellow cast members are LGBTQ too. He noted that while the company doesn’t go “out of [its] way” to include trans folks he feels tiny bursts of joy when he sees a cast member use their preferred name on their nametag.

Sometimes the fantasy falters. Dalog said he’s seen guests harass LGBTQ visitors which requires cast member intervention. But guests will always have an employee who’s been on the receiving end of harassment too and will stand up for them if needed he said.

To some LGBTQ fans the magic never fades

Disney parks don’t always live up to the fantasies they promised young queer people like Morales.

“It’s a whole other thing when you’re in there – the reality of it” he said.

Despite greater efforts to be inclusive in recent years Walt Disney Company which seems to have fingers in every pot in media and beyond has in the past been far from an exemplary ally to its many queer and trans employees and guests. Holding fast to its family-friendly image was a priority for much of its history and during some points it “took a high-profile stand against open homosexuality in its parks” like banning same-sex dancing according to an Orlando Weekly oral history of Disney and Gay Days.

Disney fans told CNN they were pleased with Disney’s progress since those days but they also said that the company should do more to make all LGBTQ fans feel supported in their parks. All of them opined that they want to see an LGBTQ protagonist in a major Disney film and many of the fans told CNN they want to see a queer person of color onscreen. But ultimately their love for Disney lies not in its representation or its capitalistic efforts at inclusion – it’s just the euphoria they feel when they’re in the alternate world of the theme parks.

Elijah Stewart works as a Magic Kingdom cast member singing and working at a storefront. The crown jewel of Disney’s Florida parks was the first place where he felt overcome with joy and wonder. He “grew up rough” he said and waltzing down the street holding Snow White’s hand as a child was freeing.

“Making people happy and making magic for others is something I love to do” he told CNN. “Now look at me performing and selling merchandise at the most magical place on Earth!”

The glamor of Disney is imperfect in that it often requires work to maintain. But for the queer folks who loved Disney World before it loved them back that magic is real – and it’s that magic that’s shaped their lives."

The anime adaptation of Record of Ragnarok just hit Netflix but there’s no English-language release of the original manga! That situation will soon be rectified however. Viz Media just announced that it’s picked up the manga by Shinya Umemura Ajichika and Takumi Fukui.

It’ll start hitting the interwebs in fall 2021 with a physical release in spring 2022.

Meanwhile you can see what all the fuss is about by streaming the anime adaptation over on the ‘flix.

Here’s how Warner Bros. Japan describes said anime:

7 million Years of Human Civilization is coming to an end…

Every 1000 years all the Gods of the world gather in heaven to attend the “Conference of Mankind Survival”.

All the Gods agree to bring an ultimate end to the mankind due to their past foolish acts but before the final verdict is made Brunhild the eldest of the 13 Valkyrie sisters make and objection.

“To spice things up why donʼt you test humans?”

Her proposal was to have God vs Humanityʼs final struggle also known as the “Ragnarok” where all the Gods from the world and champions from the entire human history enters 1 on 1 battle. The first team to win 7 battles out of 13 will be the winner.

It seems almost impossible for the humans to win against the Gods.

Although Gods sneer at them Brunhild makes further provocation;

“Are you chickening out?”

That touches Godsʼ nerves and they accept her proposal in anger.

Therefore Brunhild and her sisters must choose 13 of the strongest champions throughout the human history.

Will humans surpass Gods and make an stop to the ultimate end?

The eschatological battles between heaven and earth finally begin!

His plans suffered a major setback earlier this month when an eighth-place finish at the European 10000m Cup in Birmingham left him 22 seconds short of the 27:28 standard required to qualify for Tokyo.

Manchester's British Athletics Championships at the end of June offer Farah another chance to book his seat on the plane and three-time Olympic heptathlete Lewis reckons he will already be harbouring ambitions beyond squad selection.

""When you've produced what Mo has done over the last decade or so I think he'd be very disappointed not to make it"" said Lewis.

""Everyone loves to see the names you're familiar with getting onto the plane representing the country.

""When you've done it as many times as Mo has anything less is a disappointment. You can't lie you can't mask it. But I think people do take things for granted after a while if you're a champion and a winner it takes a lot to be that person again.

Mo is determined and does want to get back to those heights. He will be working hard to do that and that's all you can expect and ask for from an athlete. They will give their all.

The Olympic prospects of world heptathlon champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson are similarly unclear with the Liverpudlian having been granted a medical exemption to miss the British Olympic trials due to an Achilles problem.

But Lewis - who romped to gold in Australia following an interrupted preparation period herself - believes Johnson-Thompson can mirror her own journey from injury despair to Games glory.

""Her score suggests she is one of the best heptathletes in the world. If she's able to get onto the track relatively healthy then she can do well"" she said.

I know what the lack of preparation is like - I remember not really doing much before Sydney. That just requires a different type of mental strength and attitude and I think Kat has proved she can do that.

One British athlete likely to be challenging for medals is 200m world champion Dina Asher-Smith who signalled her intentions with a win over the distance in a season's-best time of 22.06s at the Diamond League meeting in Florence after winning twice in the 100m earlier in the season.

Lewis added: ""Dina always impresses - it always seems like she's in great form.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlZW5nYW1lci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZmVhdHVyZXMvb3Bpbmlvbi1waWVjZXMvc21hc2gtdWx0aW1hdGUtNS1vZi10aGUtYmVzdC1kZXNpZ25lZC1jaGFyYWN0ZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Smash Bros Ultimate: 5 of the Best Designed Characters,"Super Smash Bros Ultimate has perhaps the most varied roster in fighting game history. This list will analyze 5 of the best character designs in the game based on a variety of factors such as fun balance moveset variety and skill cap.

Not all of the 80 playable characters in Super Smash Bros Ultimate are created equal. With this many characters it’s a wonder that the roster is as balanced and varied as it is; however some fighters are definitely better than others in terms of design. To compile this list I painstakingly analyzed every fighter in the game based on a set of factors to assess how well they are designed. This list is comprised of 5 characters within the “top tier” of design in Ultimate.

They are not ranked in any particular order and are far from the only top tier designs in the game. I considered the following factors during my analysis:

Factors

Balance – Is the character generally overpowered or underpowered compared to the rest of the roster to an extent that feels unfair? Visual Design – How interesting or appealing is the character design? Does it adequately convey their traits? How visually appealing are their moves and particle effects? Audio Design – How satisfying and well made is the audio design for the character’s moveset? Moveset Variety – Does their gameplan rely too much on a particular move? How well does their moveset coalesce? Matchups – Do they have dynamic and diverse matchups against the rest of the roster? Skill Cap and Ease of Play – Ideally a character would be fun and easy to learn but difficult and rewarding to master. Fun – How fun are they to play as? How fun are they to play against?

#1 – Captain Falcon

In Ultimate Captain Falcon follows the same glass cannon formula he has always followed. He is combo heavy explosive quick and has iconic meme status; essentially he exists for the purpose of hype. Despite how little this formula has changed it is still as great as ever. One must constantly be wary of Falcon’s quick burst options the most notable of which are Raptor Boost and dash grab. His high ground speed makes this a difficult and engaging task though.

The hype nature of his moveset gives him high marks in the fun category. For example his iconic forward air the “Knee” is hard to land but its power and satisfying visual effect make it more than worth attempting. Another iconic example is his down air the “Stomp”. The Stomp serves as both a combo tool and a spike.

Captain Falcon is well balanced; he possesses great offensive firepower at the expense of significant defensive. His recovery is very exploitable although proficient players can make it look better than it is. Additionally the straightforward nature of his game plan can be exploited and his fastfalling physics leave him susceptible to combos.

#2 – Greninja

Greninja is one of the most well rounded and balanced high tier characters in Smash Ultimate. None of his buttons seem unfair or unreasonably good which can’t be said for almost any other kit in the game. Instead his strength comes from a player’s ability to use his excellent speed mobility and combo game to get the most out of his buttons. This makes him one of the harder characters to master.

Greninja roughly follows the “jack of all trades master of none” formula. His combo game is above average his recovery is really great his movement is great and his kill power is above average. His weak out of shield game and weight are the only glaring flaws. This balancing style as well as Greninja’s high skill cap make every match fun and rewarding for both players.

Greninja’s design is also great from a spectator perspective; fast agile and combo oriented characters always provide flashy-looking gameplay. Additionally his side special far reaching recovery and unique aimable counter allow for very dynamic and exciting offstage situations.

#3 – Shulk

Shulk is defined by his neutral special Monado Arts. Each of his 5 Arts strengthens a particular attribute at the expense of another one. For example the Smash Art gives his moves insane knockback but in exchange it reduces his durability and damage output.

Shulk’s ability to change his attributes in the heat of battle is wholly unique and makes any match with him feel somewhat removed from the typical Smash Ultimate experience. Both the Shulk player and his opponent must continuously change their gameplan according to what Art is active at the time. When Smash Art is active and both players are within kill percent it becomes a tense game of hit and run. When the mobility-buffing Speed Art is active Shulk’s opponent must avoid getting blitzed by his speedy aerials and find an opportunity to punish his short hops.

The dynamic nature of Shulk‘s matchups and his uniquely strategic gameplay gives him high marks in terms of design. He also excels in the skill cap category. The simple ability to alter his attributes gives him insane depth and complexity despite his relatively straightforward buttons.

The only reason he is not higher on the list is that a couple of his Monado Arts can feel cheap and exploitable at times. The ability to jump huge heights with Jump Art gives him the ability to camp while it is active by staying out of his opponent’s reach. The other problem is the aforementioned Shield Art; this Art is essentially a Shulk player’s get out of jail free card whenever they start getting combo-ed.

#4 – Fox

Smash Ultimate‘s iteration of Fox McCloud is perhaps his best showing since Melee. Given that Melee‘s Fox is arguably the most iconic fighting game character in history this is very high praise. Fox’s moveset has remained largely unchanged throughout Smash Bros but Ultimate‘s faster pace of play allows for his style to flourish much more than it did in Brawl and SSB4.

Matches against Fox are fast paced reaction based duels. Fox’s ludicrous dash speed (the fastest in the game) and his many reliable combo starters and burst options allow him to effortlessly overwhelm opponents. His speed allows him to lurk just outside of an enemy’s range weaving in and punishing any mistake they make. This forces a high level of attentiveness and careful spacing from them as well as a solid understanding of how to predict Fox’s punishable dash attacks and short hop neutral airs.

Fox is among the most fun characters in the game but also quite challenging to master. His kill power mostly comes from his up smash and back air but mostly the up smash. This is a quick and devastating anti air attack and his neutral air can combo into it if done correctly. The looming threat of this move creates tense and challenging end-game situations for both players. The Fox player must be hopping around fishing for a neutral air and scanning for an opportunity to dash in and deliver the killing blow. Meanwhile the opponent must be wary of hitting Fox’s shield or getting snagged by a back air mix-up. These matchups always test the skill and knowledge of both players which is a mark of great design.

#5 – Zero Suit Samus

Zero Suit Samus (shortened to ZSS) is a flashy and fun combination of mobility and kill power. Her lightweight physics and hit-and-run gameplan are both similar to Fox except her electric whip allows her to stay at a comfortable distance while throwing out attacks. Between her air speed ranged whip aerials and Flip Jump trying to hit her can feel like a nightmare sometimes.

Despite ZSS’s propensity for campy gameplay her high skill cap makes up for it. Good spacing and proper utilization of her air mobility are crucial for safely pressuring an opponent. Although her aerials have low lag her ground options are not great and the good ones are generally burst options. Thus rushing her down and scrapping up close can lead to good results.

Speedy combo characters are generally very fun to use in Smash Ultimate; ZSS’s flexiblity of movement only adds to this. Flip Jump her jump height and z-air allow for countless recovery options and unlimited offstage play.

Her kill power and ledge pressure contribute greatly to her hype factor. Despite being hard to land Flip Jump spikes offstage killing the opponent at virtually any percent. This leads to a variety of incredible looking edgeguard kills. It also can be combo-ed into with neutral air giving ZSS insane pressure at ledge. Another powerful tool is her up special Boost Kick a frame 3 move that kills at around 90 percent at ledge. It is often used as the finishing blow of ZSS’s flashy ladder combos. Additionally Flip Jump buries opponents and her neutral special paralyzes them leaving them open for attack. Her moveset coalesces very well resulting in a kit with much potential for combos and creative kills.

Both Dow and Braskem are greening their operations including incorporating rail into their supply chains to reduce their carbon footprint.

Whether we consciously realize it or not plastics are an inextricable part of our daily lives. Stop for a moment to think of some of the common items you use every day that are made of plastic: a water bottle a grocery bag the container you store leftovers in. And then there are the less obvious but still common uses like parts for computers and cars and hospital equipment or your glasses your cell phone and even your clothing. While it’s clear plastics play an important role in our everyday lives what people might not know is that plastics actually play a role in improving sustainability — as do the companies that produce them. To demonstrate how two plastics producers Dow and Braskem share how they’re envisioning — and creating — a more sustainable future for the planet.

The Role of Plastics in Sustainability

How do plastics play a role in creating a greener world? Geoffrey Inch Circular Economy & Sustainability Director North America for Braskem the largest petrochemical company in the Americas and the world's leading biopolymer producer explains it as such: “Innovations in plastics are essential for enabling society to raise living standards and to advance sustainability through products that avoid waste and increase efficiency. For this reason plastics are widely recognized as playing a crucial role in delivering a more sustainable future” he said. “Along with innovation our Circular Economy Strategy will continue to aggressively progress projects in mechanical and advanced molecular recycling and we are working with our recycling partners to address the issue of plastic waste.”

Jacqueline Faseler Global Director Supply Chain Sustainability and Compliance at materials science company Dow one of the three largest materials science companies in the world says there is a careful balance between using plastic to make the world a better place and keeping a close eye on harmful plastic waste.

“We strongly believe that plastic is an indispensable material for the world’s consumers and a vital part of our journey toward a low-carbon future. Lightweight plastic provides growing populations around the world with greater access to fresh foods safe drinking water and medicines. It dramatically reduces food spoilage and waste while also providing hygienic materials for the health care industry. That translates directly into approximately four times lower environmental cost in the supply chain plus a better more affordable and healthier quality of life for billions of people” she said. “At the same time we are facing an unacceptable consequence: Too much plastic is lost to waste and is entering our oceans clogging up our rivers and polluting our natural environment. This cannot continue. At Dow we’re working with our partners to eliminate this plastic waste.”

Setting Sustainability Goals

While Dow and Braskem are creating innovative materials that promote sustainability they have also set some ambitious sustainability goals and are making solid strides toward accomplishing them.

For both companies sustainability goals fall under three overarching categories: reducing emissions and working toward carbon neutrality reducing plastic waste and creating a circular economy.

At Dow setting sustainability goals isn’t new. The company launched its first set of decade-long sustainability-related goals in 1995 and the second followed in 2005. Together these first two generations of goals delivered $6 billion in combined economic savings. In April of 2015 the company launched the third era of sustainability goals which they aim to achieve by 2025. These include:

“At Dow we have long been — and remain — committed to applying science expertise to create sustainable solutions to some of the world’s greatest challenges. We have made significant advancements since launching our first set of decade-long sustainability-related goals in 1995” Faseler said. “Dow’s seven 2025 Sustainability Goals seek to advance the well-being of humanity by helping lead the transition to a sustainable planet and society — maximizing economic environmental and societal value.”

On top of the seven sustainability goals in June 2020 Dow announced new long-term targets that are intended to help the company lead its industry toward carbon neutrality and a world without plastic waste. These include:

Protect the Climate: By 2030 Dow will reduce its net annual carbon emissions by 5 million metric tons or 15% from the 2020 baseline.

By 2030 Dow will reduce its net annual carbon emissions by 5 million metric tons or 15% from the 2020 baseline. Stop the Waste: By 2030 Dow will enable 1 million metric tons of plastic to be collected reused or recycled through direct actions and partnerships.

By 2030 Dow will enable 1 million metric tons of plastic to be collected reused or recycled through direct actions and partnerships. Close the Loop: By 2035 Dow will enable 100% of Dow products sold into packaging applications will be reusable or recyclable.

“Climate change and plastic waste are among the greatest technical social and economic issues the world has ever faced. Dow products and technology are critical to addressing both” Faseler said. “We recognize the goals we’ve laid out are ambitious. Our efforts start and end with our people. Cross-functional cross-geography and cross-business teams are working on our sustainability goals and targets. We leverage our unique technology capabilities and expertise innovation mindset and commitment to building a sustainable planet and society — then apply the passion of our employees — to help promote relevant long-term change for communities and address global challenges.”

Braskem has also set impactful sustainability goals. In 2009 the company launched its long-term sustainability goals for 2020 which emphasized Braskem's commitment to providing solutions that address climate change. The following year Braskem introduced its portfolio of I'm greenTM products which are sourced from renewable sources and recycled content. Because these products are made from renewable resources the production process captures carbon dioxide helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. During that same period the company reduced the intensity of carbon emissions from its operations by 20 percent.

In 2018 Braskem further committed to 100% of plastic packaging being reused recycled or recovered by 2040 and in 2020 Braskem announced additional commitments to mitigate climate change eliminate plastic waste and provide solutions for recycled products in its markets. These goals include:

By 2025 expand the I'm green TM portfolio to include sales of 300000 tons of recycled content products per year.

portfolio to include sales of 300000 tons of recycled content products per year. By 2030 continue to expand the I'm green TM portfolio to include sales of 1 million tons of recycled content products per year

portfolio to include sales of 1 million tons of recycled content products per year By 2030 work to divert 1.5 million tons of plastic waste away from incineration landfill or the environment.

By 2030 deliver a 15 percent reduction in carbon emissions from Braskem operations.

By 2050 achieve carbon neutrality for Braskem's global operations.

“Sustainability has been part of Braskem’s DNA since its inception in 2002” Inch said. “Braskem has always been committed to the betterment of the world around us and we are dedicated to finding industry leading solutions that drive us towards a more sustainable future.”

Taking Action

It’s one thing to set goals but without action those targets don’t mean much. Dow and Braskem aren’t just talking the talk — they are blazing a trail toward being more environmentally responsible companies.

Specific actions Dow is taking to address climate protection include:

Taking a comprehensive approach. “One way we do this is by building on the progress we’ve made to date by optimizing current manufacturing assets” Faseler explained.

“One way we do this is by building on the progress we’ve made to date by optimizing current manufacturing assets” Faseler explained. Increasing renewables in the company’s purchased power mix. Doing so has already contributed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent in the past 15 years. Dow is also the leading purchaser of renewable energy in its industry and is in the top 15 among global companies.

Doing so has already contributed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent in the past 15 years. Dow is also the leading purchaser of renewable energy in its industry and is in the top 15 among global companies. Implementing transitional technologies like the installation of FCDh to produce on-purpose propylene. “This technology is reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20% in a mixed-feed cracker in Louisiana” Faseler said.

Dow is also taking steps to keep plastic out of the environment including:

Investing in key technologies. Faseler said this includes advanced recycling technologies that will help the world recycle far more than we do today and to use more recycled materials. “We are participating in infrastructure projects that enable global plastic recycling such as working with partners to construct polymer-modified asphalt roads with post-consumer recycled plastic” Faseler said. “This includes actions such as our partnership with Mura Technology to scale new advanced recycling technologies in which we expect will add an additional 1 million metric tonnes of recycling capacity by 2025. Additionally we are investing in mechanical recycling and offering recycled plastics as part of our product portfolio globally.”

Additionally we are investing in mechanical recycling and offering recycled plastics as part of our product portfolio globally.” Focusing on creating a circular world. Dow is working with customers and partners to demonstrate that a circular world is not that far out of reach. Using its RecycleReady materials and expertise Dow has helped brands like Kellogg’s Kashi Bear Naked Granola transform the packaging of their products to make them fully recyclable.

Dow is working with customers and partners to demonstrate that a circular world is not that far out of reach. Using its RecycleReady materials and expertise Dow has helped brands like Kellogg’s Kashi Bear Naked Granola transform the packaging of their products to make them fully recyclable. Global collaboration. Dow brings together customers brand owners governments waste management companies and environmental organizations to collaborate on solutions to keep plastic out of the environment. For instance Dow is a founding member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (as is Braskem) a partnership that in only two years has already committed to more than 20 infrastructure innovation and clean-up projects in 13 countries across the regions of Asia Africa and Latin America.

Faseler said continuing to effect change will require a collaborative forward-thinking approach. “To achieve carbon neutrality we’ll also need solutions that haven’t been designed yet. We need not just step-change technology — we need step-change thinking” she said. “It will take all of us coming to the table with an open mind to find the solutions we need to address a complex value chain. However creating solutions to navigate these generational challenges is what Dow does best.”

Braskem’s strategy for achieving carbon neutrality focuses on three pillars:

Reducing emissions. Braskem’s efforts to reduce emissions concentrate on improving energy efficiency in the company’s existing operations as well as the increased use of low-carbon and renewable energy in its current operations. Braskem is also placing a continued focus on exploring and investing in new low-carbon intensity process technologies.

In the area of offsetting emissions Braskem plans to focus on accelerating the company’s investments in renewable chemicals and polymers.

In the area of offsetting emissions Braskem plans to focus on accelerating the company’s investments in renewable chemicals and polymers. Capturing emissions. Braskem's efforts to capture emissions are being supported through the research and development of opportunities in using CO2 emissions as feedstock for conversion to value-added chemicals.

Like Dow Braskem is also placing a focus on transitioning to a circular economy. The company's Circular Economy Strategy will continue to aggressively progress projects in mechanical and advanced molecular recycling. Braskem also plans to continue leveraging its market leadership polymer expertise and strong track record of growth in sustainability to develop a robust portfolio of recycled products for its clients.

Inch agrees with Faseler that changing the plastics recycling landscape requires teamwork. “In order to transform the recycling system Braskem is working collaboratively with others to increase recycling access develop innovative technologies and scale the recycling infrastructure needed to increase collection and recovery of post-use plastic” he said. “Together we must educate communities on the value of recycling plastics develop robust end markets to secure demand for recycled materials and promote technologies that allow for higher-quality recycled materials. Braskem’s founding membership in organizations such as The Recycling Partnership’s Polypropylene Recycling Coalition the Alliance to End Plastic Waste and Cyclyx are only a few examples of how we are working together with others to address these challenges.”

Leveraging Environmentally Responsible Transportation

Dow and Braskem’s transportation choices are environmentally minded as well. By shipping plastics via rail they are utilizing the most environmentally responsible way to ship freight by land.

“Rail is a safe reliable and sustainable mode that we take advantage of as much as possible” Faseler said. “Each shipping mode has its function/purpose in the order fulfillment process. Rail has an advantage over other modes where we see larger order volumes and longer distances. It has proven to be a highly reliable mode of transportation to destinations having the capability of receiving rail. Rail is an important part of Dow sustainability efforts due to the low emissions and positive carbon impact.”

On average railroads are three to four times more fuel efficient than trucks on a ton-mile basis. Railroads can move one ton of freight more than 480 miles on a single gallon of fuel generating a carbon footprint up to 75% less than trucks.

This difference adds up. According to Union Pacific Railroad’s Carbon Emission Estimator if a company shipped 50000 truckloads of plastics from Dallas Texas to Los Angeles California by train instead it would reduce that company’s carbon footprint by 79330 metric tonnes.

This reduction in the carbon footprint would be equivalent to:

The carbon removed by 16897 acres of U.S. forests

The carbon removed by 2030848 tree seedlings grown for 10 years

Greenhouse gas emissions avoided by recycling 27607 tons of waste instead of sending it to the landfill.

According to the Association of American Railroads (AAR) Freight Railroads & Climate Change Report:

Railroads account for 40% of U.S. freight but only 2.1% of U.S. transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions

On a gross ton-miles per gallon basis rail fuel efficiency in 2019 was up 82% since 1980 and up 17% since 2000.

If 10% of the freight shipped by the largest trucks were moved by rail instead greenhouse gas emissions would fall by more than 17 million tons annually. That’s the equivalent of removing 3.35 million cars from our highways or planting 260 million trees.

Railroads are doing their part to support sustainability too and are committed to addressing climate change. All seven Class I Railroads in North America are participating in the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) an international collaboration focused on limiting global warming to less than two degrees Celsius and continue to invest in sustainable technology. For instance Union Pacific is improving freight car designs and leveraging fuel-efficient locomotives that reduce energy consumption pollution and greenhouse gas emissions which means they’re green and getting greener.

“Many of our clients receive material by rail. While the current recycled material market is smaller than virgin production the market for recycled materials is growing” Inch said. “Many of our clients have recycled content goals and with Braskem’s growth in recycled materials we intend to scale up volumes over the next few years. Recyclers and producers with access to rail will allow for the efficient delivery of recycled materials as the transition to a circular economy continues.”

As the volume of recycled plastic resin increases it will be important for plastics producers to use an environmentally responsible way to ship it in order to effectively meet their sustainability targets. In order to scale up the recycling process transporting by rail throughout the circular economy — from waste collecting to recycling manufacturing and consumer buying — will be essential to achieve the economies of scale. Currently the global demand for recycled plastic resin is projected to be 77mm tons by 2030. That’s the equivalent of 902900 rail cars or 3.6 million trucks. Because rail magnifies carbon emission savings by up to 4 times shipping these products by rail instead of truck presents a sizeable opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Building a Culture of Sustainability

On top of making progress toward their respective sustainability goals Dow and Braskem also actively work toward building a culture of sustainability both within and outside of their organizations.

“Sustainability is infused throughout our company culture in how we make decisions run our businesses and operations and innovate new products” Faseler said. For example Dow has sustainability leaders embedded within each business and function to proactively identify market- and customer-specific opportunities. Grassroot communities of practice have been formed around the world — groups that connect on Recycling Sustainable Innovation Circular Economy Valuing Nature and more. And Dow’s #PullingOurWeight environmental cleanups which engage employees customers suppliers and communities in addressing plastic pollution are the largest volunteer effort in Dow’s history. “We are doing our part to help keep plastic waste out of the environment and support the transition to a circular economy for a cleaner environment and a better world” Faseler said.

Braskem is also doing its part to build a culture of sustainability. The company engages with the community through the company’s Private Social Investment strategy which is guided by four pillars: STEM Education Circular Economy and Sustainability (CE&S) Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) and Health Environment and Safety (HES).

One such program is the Philadelphia Eagles Sustainability Partnership. This partnership includes the development of a recycling program for bottle caps and other plastic products as well as an online education platform for 30 schools in Philadelphia to teach students about career opportunities in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) that’s inspiring the next generation of STEM leaders.

“Our Private Social Investments seek to maximize the positive social impact resulting from our performance contributing to the sustainable development of the communities where we operate and society as a whole” Inch said. “We understand our role in society and seek to act as agents of transformation. We believe it is our duty to contribute to the development of regions where we operate generating shared value and well-being to all. In this way we seek to strengthen the relationship with the communities around our operations through dialogue and transparency.”

Envisioning a Sustainable Future

Thanks to the work Dow and Braskem have done and will continue to do a more sustainable future is possible even in the face of what may seem like uphill battles.

“Challenges such as climate change environmental waste water scarcity and loss of biodiversity continue to worsen and businesses are realizing that we need to do more to address them. In fact sustainability promises to be the business disrupter of this decade” Faseler said. “We believe a sustainable future is attainable but only if we all come together to drive forward science- and technology-based solutions to address global challenges.”

Chandigarh June 19

City residents got a shock when they received water bills with huge waste collection charges today. Some of the residents got bills ranging from Rs 3000 to 4000.

The residents who used to pay around Rs 100 per house per month for waste collection were left bemused by the huge bills.

The MC has started clubbing waste collection charges with water bills in a phased manner in different sectors.

Jagdish Walia a resident of Sector 21 received a waste collection bill of Rs 3375.

“I have a three-floor house. We live on ground floor and have rented out the first and second floor. Earlier each of us used to pay Rs 100 per month for garbage collection. We are in a shock and fail to understand how come they have send such a hefty bill. If they have conducted any survey it should be right” said Walia.

“Rehris are used to collect the waste and the MC which has failed to use its two-bin waste vehicles is sending hefty bills to residents” said Sector 21 resident Mohinder Paul Gupta who got Rs 1575 garbage collection bill today.

“Money is not the issue but the waste management is. We are sick and tired of this new system. Waste collectors do not come for many days. The MC should let the RWAs to do the job” Gupta added.

Baljinder Singh Bittu chairman of the Federation of Sectors Welfare Association Chandigarh (FOSWAC) said “People are already suffering due to the bad policies of the Municipal Corporation and today it has lend another blow to the residents. We strongly object to the move and will hold a press conference to highlight the issue. We will also meet the MC officials in this regard.”

The latest bill mentions the charges up to June 15 with arrears but the residents are confused over its duration. Just two months back the MC had issued a public notice asking people not to pay garbage collection charges to the old collectors.

Joint Commissioner Sorabh Arora was unavailable for comments.

The civic body which claimed to have started the waste collection through its 490 newly bought two-bin waste vehicles has failed to implement the idea in most of the Sectors.

In a random check it was found that in many areas of Sectors 21 22 45 47 48 and 38 the waste collection was done through carts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdmlldG5hbW5ldC52bi9lbi9ub3J3YXktcHJvdmlkZXMtdXMxMy1taWxsaW9uLWZvci13YXN0ZS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXByb2plY3QtaW4tdmlldG5hbS03NDc0ODMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Norway provides US$1.3 million for waste management project in Vietnam,

They fell to a 103-96 Game 7 loss to the Hawks on Sunday at Wells Fargo Center missing out on a chance to advance to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2001.

Joel Embiid had 31 points and 11 rebounds. Tobias Harris scored 24 points on 8-for-24 shooting and pulled down 14 rebounds.

Stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Philadelphia sports teams! Sign up here for our All Access Daily newsletter.

Sixers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey now enters an offseason that will feature some high-stakes questions.

Embiid is eligible for a four-year supermax extension. Dwight Howard Danny Green Furkan Korkmaz and Mike Scott will become unrestricted free agents. The Sixers have the 28th and 50th pick in this year’s NBA draft.

Before all of that though here are three observations on the Sixers’ Game 7 loss:

Embiid gives everything he’s got has turnover problems

Playing his seventh consecutive game on a small lateral meniscus tear in his right knee Embiid scored the Sixers’ first six points with two pull-up jumpers and two free throws. He also guarded Trae Young on a switch and forced an air ball a play the home fans especially appreciated.

Harris was the first non-Embiid Sixer to get on the board doing so on a coast-to-coast drive. As usual the Sixers looked far more fluid and dangerous in transition than in half-court offense.

Embiid drew the second foul on Clint Capela with 30.7 seconds to go in the first quarter. That forced Atlanta to bring in 20-year-old Onyeka Okongwu who Embiid powered through to score on the final possession of the opening period putting the Sixers up 28-25. The only notable blemish of Embiid’s first quarter was three missed foul shots but his determination to create contact and carry the Sixers offensively was exactly what the team needed.

Okongwu held up fine on Embiid. In fact the Hawks began the second period on an 8-0 run highlighted by two Danilo Gallinari threes.

The Sixers were incredulous at the officiating on several occasions early in the second. It seemed their fury had reached a peak when it looked like Ben Simmons had been called for his second foul as Young was about to take a timeout. However the Sixers caught a break with the officials ultimately ruling Young’s timeout came before any foul and then assessing the Hawks' star point guard a technical foul for his vehement disagreement.

Embiid erased the Sixers’ five-point deficit entering the fourth quarter with a foul-line jumper and trailing three-ball but he couldn't save the day down the stretch.

Turnovers were again an issue for Embiid who had eight. The Sixers had 17 giveaways as a team while the Hawks only had 10.

Trying to buy rest for the big man

Tyrese Maxey was the first Sixer off the bench followed by George Hill Dwight Howard and Matisse Thybulle. Shake Milton played five fourth-quarter minutes too.

Harris was 0 for 3 with two points in his first stint with Howard. The Sixers still initially managed to avoid a nose dive in the Embiid-less minutes though. Howard missed a layup but also grabbed an offensive rebound giving the Sixers another possession that eventually resulted in a Thybulle three-pointer.

Embiid ended up playing 41 minutes including the entire fourth. Harris went 45.

In the third quarter Howard cost the Sixers a possession with a moving screen but then snuffed out an Atlanta trip with a block on Okongwu. Soon after he left John Collins open under the rim and committed a flagrant foul. If Howard’s minutes were anything they were eventful.

Though Howard is an upgrade over Greg Monroe the backup center the last time the Sixers played a Game 7 the team had to feel somewhat uneasy whenever he was on the court and Embiid was resting. In Howard’s seven minutes the Sixers were outscored by five points.

Before the series Rivers had said he thought Simmons and Harris were capable of guarding centers. He still used Howard in every game however instead of employing small-ball options.

Sixers can't capitalize on Young's off night

Young recorded 21 points on 5-for-23 shooting. Simmons and Thybulle did well on the ball the Sixers varied their looks on him and Harris was solid on switches. The Sixers were also lucky with a few open misses.

Young was bound to make an important shot at some point though. He nailed a long three-pointer with 2:31 left to give Atlanta a 93-87 lead.

After an opening half in which he recorded eight assists but rarely considered seeking his own shot Simmons picked up his fourth foul early in the third with perhaps his most aggressive play of the game offensively. He plowed through John Collins on a full-steam fast break. Rivers kept Simmons in the game for another five minutes or so valuing his defense and transition playmaking.

Young continued creating positive plays despite his shooting struggles. He posed problems for the Sixers all series when he got downhill either kicking the ball out to open shooters or hooking up with Capela on alley-oops.

The Furkan Korkmaz vs. Kevin Huerter matchup was a troublesome one early for the Sixers as Huerter started 4 for 4 from the floor. The Sixers switched things up putting Korkmaz on Bogdan Bogdanovic who played through right knee soreness and scored four points on 2-for-8 shooting.

Seth Curry took Huerter who finished with 27 points and was impressive regardless of the man guarding him. Thybulle committed a very costly foul on Huerter with 54.0 seconds left bumping him on a three-point try. Huerter made all three attempts putting the Hawks up 96-92.

For the game Simmons had five points on 2-for-4 shooting 13 assists and eight rebounds.

The Hawks intentionally fouled him to stop a potential fast break with 1:48 left and he split the free throws.

Scoring isn't everything of course but we'll note Simmons had 19 points over the series' final three games.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2RrbmV0d29yay5kcmFmdGtpbmdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzYvMjAvMjI1NDI4NjIvbmJhLXBsYXlvZmYtcGlja3MtMjAyMS1zaXhlcnMtdnMtaGF3a3MtZ2FtZS03LXBsYXllci1wcm9wLWJldHMtc2V0aC1jdXJyeS1qb2huLWNvbGxpbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best player prop bets for Sixers vs. Hawks Game 7 of NBA Playoffs,"Sunday’s final NBA game between the Atlanta Hawks and Philadelphia 76ers will tip-off at 8:00 p.m. ET. The winner of the game will secure a spot in the Eastern Conference Finals and take on the Milwaukee Bucks in the third round. This Game 7 matchup seems bound to go down to the wire and we’ve identified some of the best prop bets worth considering at DraftKings Sportsbook.

Kevin Huerter O2.5 assists (-105)

Huerter springboarded into a prominent role once DeAndre Hunter was ruled out for the season and led all players in minutes with 44 in Game 6. Bogdan Bogdanovic’s injured knee could lead to more playing time for Hurter who is a secondary playmaker for the Hawks at times and averaged more than four assists per game per 36 minutes over the last two seasons.

Seth Curry O3.5 3-pointers (+105)

Curry has played like Philly’s second-best player for most of this series and has been especially dynamic at home. The 3-point specialist is averaging 26 points per game at the Wells Fargo Center in the second round while making his threes at a 63% clip. Nearly 32% of Curry’s shots have been wide open at home against the Hawks and he’s knocked down 57% of these looks. It’s hard to pass on this prop given how consistent Curry has been in Philly

John Collins to record a double-double (+155)

Collins’s point assist and rebound reached at least 27 in three straight games before he busted in Game 6 but he’s in a great position to get back on track in Game 7. He’s grabbed at least 10 boards four times in the second round and is averaging more than 15 points per game against Philly. Collins is still shooting 52% from the field following his latest 2-for-8 performance and shouldn’t attempt fewer than 10 shots in a closeout game. Joel Embiid and Clint Capela are the only players who are more likely to record a double-double.

But what have we learned from meeting this emergency? Players throughout the ecosystem from drug developers to regulators are considering how we can apply real-world lessons to benefit patients in the future.

While drug developers succeeded in rapid development of safe effective vaccines a lot of time and resources were wasted on projects that duplicated effort or disregarded existing science. Acting on lessons learned and repurposing tools effectively used during this pandemic will be critical in meeting the next one. Future drug discovery and development programs must take fuller use of these three strategies:

Rethink clinical trials

The average cost of bringing a drug to market is about $2 billion of which more than half goes to clinical trials. Traditionally researchers recruited patients whose main virtue was their availability and thus many drugs were developed without ethnically economically or geographically diverse clinical trial populations. The pandemic pushed researchers to telehealth- and technology-fueled decentralized trials which took place even with the pandemic raging. With more people available for trials drugs and dosing can be more effectively and accurately developed for more kinds of patients than ever before.

But before conducting clinical trials many researchers employed biosimulation which uses in-silico computer-based modeling with virtual patients. Fast and relatively inexpensive biosimulation reveals rich information about how a drug would perform and how to best design a trial before the drug is ever tested in patients. The demand for speed pushed biosimulation to the forefront advancing mindset and practice toward computer-based trials. I’m proud that the organization I lead has partnered with Covid-19 vaccine and therapeutic developers to optimize trial design and dosing for different populations through biosimulation.

Collaborate to accelerate action

Sponsored Post A Personalized Approach to Medication Nonadherence At the Abarca Forward conference earlier this year George Van Antwerp managing director at Deloitte discussed how social determinants of health and a personalized member experience can improve medication adherence and health outcomes.

During Covid-19 the scale and effectiveness of collaboration was unprecedented with results evident in the amazing speed of vaccine development and approvals. And yet based on pitfalls witnessed in 2020 there is much scope for improvement.

Collaborative clinical trials took too long to establish. When they did start there was wasteful duplication of effort: 218 clinical trials tested hydroxychloroquine; many open-source projects were more ‘closed’ than ‘open;’ and poorly designed repetitive trials for Covid-19 treatments yielded little insight as to what worked and what didn’t. In an emergency time and resources are limited; we could have used both better.

The UK excelled at collaboration with their national trials. One large trial of dexamethasone proved that the cheap widely available steroid reduced recovery time significantly in severe Covid-19 cases. This trial succeeded because the UK’s NHS was able to conduct efficient randomized trials coordinated across more than 176 hospitals with a central data repository.

Proactively prepare for the next pandemics

Early in the pandemic we again learned the lesson in the Scout Motto: “be prepared.” The U.S. government has so far reactively spent or committed a staggering $8 trillion+ on the pandemic which doesn’t begin to include the enormous toll in human suffering.

Preparing for future pandemics is worth serious investment today and it means securing supply lines and stocks of critical materials planning control and communication and ensuring drug development systems remain capable of creating needed vaccines and treatments. We can also prepare by actively tracking known and emerging threats modeling their likely spread and running scenarios of potential cures and treatments. Public-private partnerships should be encouraged; NGOs like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation played an important role by working with drug developers to accelerate treatments and vaccines through collaborative action and data coordination.

After Covid-19

Covid-19 is teaching us many lessons the hard way. Sector-wide innovative approaches such as virtual trials and expedited regulatory pathways were embraced out of necessity and hard-won learnings led to vaccines and treatments developed in record time. This pandemic has shown that collaboration biosimulation and decentralized trials and active preparedness programs lead to fast effective drug development when we really need it.

These successes will change future drug development. Not only must we incorporate these lessons in our planning for the next pandemic we must also apply them to every drug development effort we undertake so that we can accelerate the creation of new medicines for people in need.

Image - NOAA Public Domain

The American West has been blasted with sweltering heat this week as a high-pressure dome combines with the worst drought in modern history to launch temperatures into the triple digits breaking hundreds of temperature records.



According to the Associated Press record high daily temperatures have been seen in parts of Arizona California New Mexico Montana Wyoming and Utah with Phoenix Arizona hitting a record-breaking 118 degrees (48 Celsius) on Thursday.

“Very dangerous record-breaking heat should continue today across the deserts with well above normal highs” the National Weather Service’s Phoenix staff wrote on Facebook on Saturday. “A very good day to stay indoors.”

Summer officially is set to start on Sunday yet climatologists and meteorologists say the heatwave is unusual because it arrived earlier and is staying longer than in most years.

June last year things seemed pretty normal” noted Park Williams a University of California Los Angeles climate and fire scientist. “The record-breaking heatwaves came in August and September.”

But like many climate scientists today Williams also realizes that what is happening now was predictable based on climate models. And with such an early heatwave this year “this could be the tip of the iceberg” Williams said.

Simon Wang a professor of climate dynamics at Utah State University spoke with The Guardian this week. Commenting on the extreme heat and drought Wang said “As a meteorologist of course this isn’t a surprise.”

“The warming climate is making these dry hot periods even drier and hotter. Since we’re in a drought we don’t really have much moisture in the soil.

And without that moisture the sun really heats up the ground and the air much faster. So really what we’re seeing in the southwest is the ground is burning like a hotplate. And we’re standing on it.”

The role of drought and climate change

The heat we are seeing in the West is coming from a high-pressure system actually a buckle in the Jet Stream winds that are moving across the U.S. sucking up huge amounts of moisture drying out the soil.

And with the western part of the country suffering wi9th a two-decades-long “megadrought” researchers said in a study published last year in the journal Science that man-made climate change tied to the emission of greenhouse gases can be blamed for about half of the historic drought.

In the study the researchers wrote that the drought now covering nine states started in 2000 and further research found that only one other drought was slightly larger.

That drought started in 1575 a decade after St. Augustine Florida was founded and before the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock in 1620.

The exceptional drought in the American West has lowered the water level in Lake Mead to just 37 percent capacity. Image -WildfireTigress CC SA 4.0

So what are the role of drought and climate change in making things so bad right now? First – the drought is drying out the soil all across the landscape.

The sun normally would be absorbing some moisture from the soil but there is no moisture left. Scientists say the Western soil is so dry that instead the sun’s energy makes the air even warmer.

“When the soil is wet heat waves aren’t so bad” said Williams who has calculated that soil in the western half of the nation is the driest it has been since 1895. “But if it’s dry we are under extreme risk.”

We now find ourselves in a vicious cycle. This week’s extreme events in the American West illustrate the compounding effects of climate change: boosted evaporation from rising temperatures worsens drought and drier landscapes are more vulnerable to wildfire.",,,,,,,,,

""We're very excited that Weyerhaeuser was able to help us with this project. It was a combination of several grants that we received so that we could completely renovate all of our outdoor seating areas"" Nicole Herndon executive director of the NPC Foundation said.

""We have park benches we have picnic tables both regular and ADA compliant and umbrellas because in a time when social distancing is imperative we wanted to make sure that our students can safely be outside and safely social distance"" she said.

Herndon said the college receiving this grant helped along with another $2500 grant NPC received through the Elisabeth Wagner Foundation.

""It was a project that took several stages as we worked to refurbish"" she said.

Herndon said many businesses and organizations realized the college was facing the challenges of having to social distance noting ""I think we were the recipients of this grant simply because they knew the need; they knew that our students needed to safely social distance.

""(This grant) provides an outdoor seating area that will be used for the future as well. It's not just for the COVID-related term it's for the future. This provides a place for our students to come outside to be in its natural habitat.""

Another reason for an outdoor seating area was that the picnic tables and park benches at the college were older and not in great condition.

""We saw the need to replace those. ... Our faculty and staff needed a place to go outside and enjoy our beautiful state of Arkansas"" Herndon said.

""This was a way for us to work together to get a better seating area for all of our community members for our faculty our staff our students but also to provide that social distancing atmosphere"" she said.

NPC reached out to Weyerhaeuser and asked them if they could apply for one of their grants. The college had a local representative who was more than willing to help them go through the proper channels.

""We filled out the form and we were able to receive the grant"" Herndon said.

NPC purchased all of the benches picnic tables and umbrellas which they have refurbished across campus she said. The college had a lot of wooden park benches and picnic tables and the new ones are a metal type of material that will last a lot longer.

""We've put them on our south side (of campus) where a lot of our high school students are. We've put them throughout the campus where all of our faculty and staff and our students and adult ed (are located)"" Herndon said.

There is a special protective coating on top of all of the benches and tables that will sustain them for a long time so NPC will not have to replace them any time in the near future.

NPC's campus is always open she said so anyone can come and sit and enjoy the outdoors and enjoy the area.

""We have our commons market that's open throughout the summer as well so anyone's invited to come to get lunch come sit outside enjoy our beautiful campus and all that we have to offer"" Herndon said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Lee has been fighting for — or rather marching toward — this moment since 2016 when Biden was vice president in the outgoing Obama Administration and she’d first set off on her 1400 mile walking campaign to Washington called “Opal Lee’s Walk 2 D.C.”

As he signed the document Lee clutched the hand of the new VP Kamala Harris the first Black woman to hold the office.

Biden and Harris have known Lee for some time with one of their most memorable meetings coming while they were on the campaign trail. “I was up in their faces giving them Juneteenth material down in Houston” Lee told Variety. “And when [Biden] came to Las Vegas I was there at some affair that they had invited him to at a church.”

“And when he hit the door I got his hand bless the poor man” she recalled. “He only had one hand to shake hands with the others cause I wouldn’t turn him a-loose; I kept telling him about Juneteenth.”

From then Lee had known the administration was in her corner; Harris was among the senators to champion an earlier bill supporting the creation of a federal Juneteenth holiday but that measure failed by just one vote. That bill was one of the many false starts Lee endured on the road to getting June 19 marked as an official holiday. For Variety’s Changemakers summit Lee recounted the journey she took to finally see the date — which commemorates the end of slavery in the United States — officially recognized.

Despite her great efforts Lee still describes herself as “just a little old lady in tennis shoes getting in everybody else’s business.”

Joining Lee for the keynote conversation was Pharrell Williams the 13-time Grammy-winning producer and musician who has used his considerable platform as a superstar entertainer to join the fight for Juneteenth. Though the two have been fighting parallel battles to get Juneteenth recognized nationwide the virtual conversation marked the first time the two powerhouse philanthropists had met.

“When you look at Juneteenth there is the history and then there is the soldier” Williams said. “We call Ms. Opal ‘the grandmother of Juneteenth’ — grand meaning in the largest way and the mother of it meaning her spirit of this generation has given a rebirth people’s attention for it.”

“So when I heard about her story and saw what it is that she was doing I’m going to do my best to support as much as I can” he added. “Because this is not just about us this is about our generations to come.”

For his part last year Williams successfully petitioned the governor of Virginia to make Juneteenth a state holiday emphasizing the need for people of all races to know the true history of America.

“The significance of Juneteenth is very important. Not only just because of the idea and the concept that when my ancestors were fighting in the war for the independence of this nation they were not free themselves as a culture.” Williams explained. “But the other part is where it starts to peel back the layers of historical whitewashing that happened in this nation and in our education so people could really understand what Juneteenth is and why we need it.”

Juneteenth commemorates June 19 1865 which marked the official end of slavery in the U.S. On this date the enslaved Black people of Texas learned that they had been freed by President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation nearly two-and-a-half years earlier.

“There’s a lot of things in our nation and concepts that we’ve been taught that weren’t really historically accurate nor were they fair. And caused all kinds of issues in our country” he added. “[Black people] are truly owed not only reparations but we’re also owed the truth. And not just us as the people but all Americans are owed the truth of what actually really happened in this nation.”

That’s why Williams co-founded Juneteenth Pledge which was started to encourage companies to commit to making Juneteenth a paid holiday for their employees in the U.S. and identifying a relevant day in their international offices that recognizes the emancipation of enslaved people as well. The commitment also encourages companies to consider the why behind the holiday.

To date more than two-dozen top corporations — including Adidas Airbnb Converse Global Citizen HP Nike Participant Spotify Starbucks Universal Music Group Under Armour and ViacomCBS — have signed their commitment.

“There’s been a lot of companies that really understand it” Williams said of the pledge. “The the good thing about today is that the consumer is much more educated and they’re much more opinionated than they ever were before.”

“Before you just believed every advertisement that you saw and every politically-slanted news report. It’s no longer the case” he explained. “People vote with their remote controls and they vote with their wallet their credit cards. That’s one of the reasons why I attribute the swift change in a lot of these big corporations to acknowledge it because they know that their consumers are looking at them like ‘What are you saying?’”

Lee and Williams also discussed what gives them the strength and drive to continue their mission.

“There’s nothing grandiose about walking two and a half miles I’ll guarantee you there’s nothing grandiose about it” Lee said. “But it has to be done to make people aware that the enslaved in Texas didn’t know they were free for two and a half years after the emancipation.”

Williams explained that he’s always encouraged by three things: the opportunity and the blessing to be able to learn the opportunity to serve; and the opportunity to share what it is that he knows. “Not only what it is that I know and the things that I’ve learned” he explains. “But to share my contacts to share my resources to the people that I know that can help further the education of some of these corporations. That’s what it’s all about for me. That’s my goal and that’s what keeps me going.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMTgvc3BvcnRzL25pa2UtdHJhY2stZmllbGQtb2x5bXBpYy10cmlhbHMtZnV0dXJlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike's Shifts in Track and Field Are Top of Mind as Trials Begin (Published 2021),"EUGENE Ore. — As the top 500 American track and field athletes gather this weekend for the Olympic trials a question that has consumed videoconferencing calls and text chains throughout the sport over the past year will finally be discussed in person.

How is Nike rethinking its financial support of track and field in the United States a sport that has been sustained by its largess for decades?

Nike is notoriously secretive and as a result a mystery leading into the Tokyo Olympics has blossomed from the company’s smaller maneuvers: canceled or reduced sponsorship agreements executive shuffling and its internal responses to scandals in the sport.

The company won’t say whether its moves are connected with a broader strategy. A spokeswoman declined to make any executives available for interviews and said in a statement that Nike had been “a long standing supporter of the sport and remain extremely proud of our commitment.” The statement added that “like many brands we continue to deal with new dynamics around our business but Nike remains passionate about and committed to Track and Field.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzbC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS81MDE4OTY0My9jYW1lcm9uLXdpbGxpYW1zLWNoYWlyLW9mLXV0YWgtY291bnR5LWJsYWNrLWNoYW1iZXItb2YtY29tbWVyY2UtaGFzLWRpZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cameron Williams chair of Utah County Black Chamber of Commerce has died,"Estimated read time: 3-4 minutes

Much more than their Las Vegas workers

Editor’s Note: This story has been updated with additional information about tenant Nancy Williams.

The coronavirus wasn’t the only threat Nancy Williams had to fend off during the pandemic.

She and her adult son have received four eviction notices since September despite their landlord receiving millions of dollars in federal rental assistance to continue housing tenants like the Williamses — and despite state and federal eviction moratoriums in place.

It has been a nerve-racking experience for the family who spent about three months sleeping outdoors in a downtown Las Vegas alley before moving into a Siegel Suites near The Strat hotel-casino in November 2019. The two were unemployed for several months after Nevada’s economy shuttered and Nancy Williams said an eviction probably would have put them back on the streets or into a crowded shelter.

“It’s like living on pins and needles” said Williams 54 whose chronic lung disease put her at heightened risk of severe illness from COVID-19. “I lived in fear every day that the constable was going to come and knock on our door and tell us we had to leave.”

Her family dodged the eviction attempts with the help of a legal aid attorney. Many other Siegel Suites residents weren’t as fortunate.

Law enforcement agencies received some 450 eviction orders to carry out at Siegel Suites and Siegel Select properties last year compared with about 550 in 2019 according to a joint analysis of government records by the Review-Journal and Eric Seymour an assistant professor at Rutgers University’s Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy. The company’s year-over-year decline was much smaller than the Las Vegas Valley at large where annual evictions fell by more than half down to about 11000 from 23500.

Meanwhile Siegel Suites collected over $2 million in federal rental assistance from Clark County one of the largest amounts received by any landlord in the program’s first round of allocations. Las Vegas-based real estate firm The Siegel Group which operates Siegel Suites also received more than $3 million in federal Paycheck Protection Program loans.

The Siegel Group declined to be interviewed for this story.

Consumer rights attorney Jim Berchtold decried the company’s actions.

“It’s a travesty” said Berchtold whose nonprofit law firm Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada represents Williams and other Siegel Suites residents facing eviction. “With that (rental assistance) benefit I think comes some responsibility to adhere to the idea that it is dangerous to evict people during the course of a pandemic.”

The company’s portfolio includes more than two dozen Siegel Suites and Siegel Select locations in the Las Vegas Valley with about 4000 rental units combined property records show.

The chain of hotel-apartment hybrids — which allows tenants to forgo annual leases and pay by the week for furnished accommodations — can be one of the few options available to low-income renters who struggle to obtain traditional rental housing Nevada Housing Coalition Executive Director Christine Hess said.

Many of those cash-strapped tenants struggle to build savings or pay for other essential needs like quality health care Hess said. An eviction probably would send them into overcrowded living situations such as a homeless shelter where the increased risk of contracting COVID-19 could be compounded by unmanaged health problems.

“For those in weeklies homeless is knocking loudly” she said. “When you’re in crisis taking care of yourself is not always first on your mind.”

Changing eviction ban

Williams and son Joshua were months behind on their rent when Siegel Suites served them an eviction notice in early September.

The construction jobs they started shortly after moving dried up at the beginning of the pandemic and they were waiting to find out if Nevada’s overwhelmed state unemployment office would award them benefits.

In early summer Williams declined to enter a repayment plan that would require her to pay an additional $151 on top of her regular rent of $285-per-week through the end of the year. She said she simply couldn’t afford it.

Now the company wanted her out but not for unpaid rent. Instead the company said it could remove Williams and her son because they didn’t have an active lease.

Similar notices for “no-cause” eviction were taped to doors of neighboring apartments she said. Williams contacted the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada as her neighbors began to move out — some voluntarily and others after a constable arrived to change their locks.

“A lot of them didn’t fight it” she said. “Everyone assumed that because there was an eviction moratorium that they couldn’t be evicted and I think Siegel took advantage of that.”

As Nevada faced the nation’s highest unemployment rate in spring 2020 Gov. Steve Sisolak temporarily banned most residential evictions. But he amended the moratorium multiple times last year leaving some tenants confused about protections.

Days before Williams received her eviction notice Sisolak had made another change.

This latest directive still banned evictions over missed rent but it no longer included language that explicitly forbade using no-cause evictions as a workaround.

Governor’s office spokeswoman Meghin Delaney wrote in a statement Friday that the removed language had never actually extended “the scope or reach” of the governor’s eviction moratorium.

“The rules are the rules” Delaney wrote. “That language was aimed at warning people from trying to dishonestly skirt the rules — not explicitly repeating the line in subsequent directives did not have any bearing on the legal scope of the directives.”

In October Sisolak lifted the entire statewide moratorium. Renters were left to rely on a new federal eviction ban.

That moratorium penned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered no direct guidance about how to handle no-cause cases. And while it prohibited nonpayment evictions tenants needed to opt-in to protections by submitting a declaration form to their landlords.

The ambiguities meant trouble for Siegel Suites residents.

State law allows landlords to evict a tenant for no cause at any point after their lease has expired. Nevada also gives weekly renters less time after receiving a no-cause notice — seven business days instead of 30 — to vacate their home before their landlord can initiate an eviction against them.

Having never entered into long-term leases and paying weekly rent large numbers of Siegel Suites tenants were vulnerable to expedited no-cause evictions according to legal aid attorneys.

“It was definitely an abused loophole” said Bailey Bortolin policy director for the Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers. “I don’t think anyone intended for the most vulnerable tenants to be left out of protections but that’s how it played out.”

No-cause evictions increase

In an October court filing a Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada attorney accused Siegel Suites of trying to circumvent bans on nonpayment evictions.

The tenant in the case Suzy Niffenegger told the Review-Journal she felt harassed after refusing to sign a repayment agreement she couldn’t afford. Employees at her property were constantly asking to inspect her apartment and she lost access to the building’s wireless internet.

“They were constantly knocking on my door for something” said Niffenegger 51. “I just felt picked on. I felt unfairly treated; I still do.”

The Siegel Group Senior Vice President Michael Crandall declined an interview with the Review-Journal this week but he previously has said that Siegel Suites has not targeted tenants who owed money during the pandemic.

Crandall told the Nevada Current in September that “we aren’t evicting anyone for any nonpayment of rent.”

In December he wrote in a statement to The New York Times that Siegel Suites was filing evictions “when necessary because of unregistered guests illegal squatters property damage criminal activity and other conditions causing an unsafe environment.”

But public records paint a different picture. The Review-Journal analyzed eviction notices for all 452 court-ordered lockouts that law enforcement officials received for Siegel Suites properties last year except for 14 cases that had since been sealed.

The company had only eight nuisance-based evictions in 2020.

Instead Siegel Suites overwhelmingly evicted tenants for nonpayment of rent in January February and March 2020. It carried out fewer than 10 no-cause evictions during these months before the state and federal bans on nonpayment cases were enacted.

After a summer with relatively few evictions Siegel Suites began removing large numbers of tenants in the fall. None was a nonpayment-of-rent case.

After Sisolak’s September directive the company pursued primarily no-cause evictions. Local courts approved at least 300 before the year’s end many because of tenants not responding in time or failing to opt-in to CDC protections.

In Williams’ case Siegel Suites backed off after she was approved for more than $10000 in federal rental assistance in early October. The money covered her back rent and made her payments through the end of November.

The reprieve didn’t last long. Williams found another no-cause eviction notice taped to her door in early December.

“All they want is their rent” she said. “They don’t care about anything else.”

Police records show that on the same day Williams was cited with a misdemeanor battery charge for allegedly pushing her son’s ex-girlfriend at the apartment. In July 2020 about two months before Williams received her no-cause eviction notice in September police gave her a misdemeanor citation for resisting an officer “in the area” of her Siegel Suites according to court records.

Later in December Sisolak reinstated the statewide moratorium. This time it suspended all ongoing no-cause eviction cases for tenants who owed rent.

In late November 2020 the executive director of the Nevada State Apartment Association told the Review-Journal landlords were primarily filing notices on residents who refused to communicate or respond to the notices.

Susy Vasquez said 13 percent of the association’s 120000 units in Clark County weren’t paying rent at the time. “We have a lot of landlords that are hurting and hurting bad” Vasquez said.

Assembly Bill 141

As Nevada’s biennial Legislature came to an end last month state lawmakers rushed to offer some forgiveness to renters evicted during the pandemic.

But Siegel Suites tenants will largely be excluded from the measures.

Assembly Bill 141 requires courts to automatically seal all nonpayment evictions granted during Nevada’s declared state of emergency for COVID-19 which has been in effect since March 2020. It does not cover no-cause evictions.

Berchtold said the law’s passage was an important but bittersweet victory for tenants. Having a recent eviction can severely diminish a renter’s chances of finding new housing.

“It’s better than nothing” he said. “Frankly the number of actual nonpayment evictions that were issued during the course of the moratorium was fairly small in comparison to the other types of evictions that were granted.”

With Nevada’s statewide moratorium concluded housing advocates fear a massive wave of evictions will arrive when the CDC moratorium expires at the end of June. Census survey data indicates roughly 40000 households here believe they could be evicted sometime within the next two months Guinn Center Executive Director Nancy Brune said.

Williams said she hopes to move out of Siegel Suites by then. She and her son have both found work again and are saving to afford a security deposit at a traditional apartment.

“We’re looking more toward the future now” she said. “For a while it was bleak. Now it’s starting to turn around.”

NORTH WALES Pennsylvania (WPVI) -- Police have issued an arrest warrant for a contractor who is allegedly targeting senior citizens through a popular app.

Authorities say 34-year-old Ronald Williams has scammed roughly a dozen victims - and counting - for thousands of dollars.

Suzanne Roth is among them.

""I am so devastated by this"" said Roth.

She lives on just Social Security so when she shelled out more than $3000 for what she calls substandard and incomplete work on her deck her heart sank.

""He destroyed my deck that's what he did and I feel like he destroyed part of my home"" she tells Action News.

She met Ronald Willaims on the app Nextdoor in April.

It's an application that allows people to get tips recommendations and buys and sell things from people in their neighborhood.

She put an ad for power washing and deck repair. She says Ronald Williams quickly began messaging her.

Roth says he showed up at her house and said for $2700 he'd rebuild her deck. She paid him in full a mistake she now admits.

""Then he told me he needed another $400 another $300"" Roth says.

After a little work he was gone. Roth's daughter began searching for other victims on the Nextdoor app.

She says she learned Ronald Williams uses various aliases but his construction company was the same Constructionize LLC.

A fact confirmed by police.

Investigation: Dance troupe leader detained in Dominican Republic for possible child trafficking

ACTION NEWS INVESTIGATION: A half dozen people from Philly including a dance troupe leader are stuck in the Dominican Republic as a criminal investigation in child trafficking unfolds.

""I am getting emails from New Jersey Bucks Montco Philadelphia from people he has scammed out of money"" said North Wales Police Chief Mike Eves.

North Wales police have an arrest warrant for Williams after he allegedly scammed another victim there.

Chief Eves says the method of operation is the same.

Court documents reveal Willaims has a long list of arrests for forgery drugs and assault.

""The fact that he's scamming elderly people out of their hard-earned money is why we want to bring him in"" Chief Eves added.

Police say Williams drives a gray Dodge Ram pickup with Constructionize LLC on the back. It also has a thin blue line flag sticker and a police FOP emblem on its license plate.

Anyone with information can call their local police or North Wales Police.

W celu zapewnienia jak największej obiektywności otrzymanych opinii komitet wymagał od zleceniobiorców aby przygotowane raporty były w pełni niezależne. W ocenie HSBC oba przedsiębiorstwa spełniły te wymagania a honorarium Deloitte i Willis Towers Watson wyniosło odpowiednio 173 900 funtów i 68 289 funtów. Podczas analizy sytuacji spółki i tworzenia strategii płacowej pod uwagę wzięto także sprawozdania przygotowane specjalnie dla komitetu przez m.in.: dyrektora generalnego dyrektora działu HR czy dyrektora ds. zarządzania ryzykiem.

Nadzwyczajna sytuacja wymusiła na decydentach skupienie większej uwagi na pracownikach niższego szczebla w celu zapewnienia im należytej ochrony. Pomimo swojej istotności pandemia nie była oczywiście jedynym czynnikiem wpływającym na kształt polityki wynagrodzeń. Podczas spotkań komitetu dokonano przeglądu ankiet i sondaży przeprowadzonych wśród pracowników którzy mieli wypowiedzieć się na temat wprowadzanych zmian. Według HSBC wyniki badań pokazują poprawę opinii o polityce płacowej a większość zatrudnionych uważa że ich roczna ocena dobrze odzwierciedla ich efektywność.

Wśród wskaźników wpływających na ocenę menadżerów wymieniono:

· miary finansowe np.: zysk brutto lub wzrost przychodów

· miary strategiczne np.: udane przekształcenie obszarów działalności o niskiej rentowności poprawa jakości obsługi klienta czy wzmocnienie powiązań z podmiotami zewnętrznymi

· miary ryzyka i zgodności np. skuteczne zarządzanie ryzykiem operacyjnym w celu realizacji założeń strategicznych.

Udział w akcjonariacie

Dyrektor generalny i dyrektor finansowy są zobligowani do posiadania odpowiedniej ilości udziałów HSBC – CEO musi mieć w portfelu akcje o równowartości 400% swojej podstawowej pensji a CFO o równowartości 300%. Obowiązkiem każdego członka rady nadzorczej jest natomiast zgromadzenie 15 000 akcji HSBC w ciągu 5 lat od powołania na stanowisko.

Jak podaje instytucja na dzień 31 grudnia 2020 roku wymaganego progu nie osiągnął ani dyrektor generalny ani finansowy. Noel Quinn (CEO) zgromadził dotychczas niewiele ponad połowę wymaganej ilości (221% rocznego wynagrodzenia) czyli 778 958 akcji wartych niespełna 3 miliony funtów. Bliżej wywiązania się ze zobowiązania był Ewen Stevenson (CFO) który miał w swoim portfelu większość potrzebnych akcji (265% rocznego wynagrodzenia) co oznacza 545 731 akcji o łącznej wartości ponad 2 milionów funtów. Spośród obecnych członków rady nadzorczej tylko jednej osobie nie udało się zebrać 15 000 akcji do końca 2020 roku.

Jakie korzyści przewidziano dla menadżerów HSBC?

Wynagrodzenie podstawowe dyrektorów w największym banku notowanym na LSE jest wypłacane co miesiąc w gotówce a maksymalna podwyżka na jaką mogą liczyć w okresie obowiązywania aktualnej strategii (2019 – 2022) wynosi 15%. Oprócz tego honorarium powiększone jest o stały dodatek wypłacany cztery razy w roku w akcjach firmy. Jeżeli nie wystąpią żadne nadzwyczajne okoliczności to bonus może wynosić do 150% podstawowego wynagrodzenia. Dodatkowo dyrektorzy są uprawnieni do korzystania z szerokiego wachlarza benefitów wśród których spółka wymienia: zapewnienie ubezpieczenia medycznego zakwaterowania samochodu członkostwa w klubach niezależnej porady prawnej w sprawach związanych z wykonywaniem obowiązków pracowniczych na rzecz HSBC pomoc w przygotowaniu zeznania podatkowego dofinansowanie podróży oraz ubezpieczenie na życie.

Kierownictwo jest także uprawnione do uczestniczenia w planach kapitałowych skierowanych do wszystkich pracowników gdzie maksymalny miesięczny wkład wynosi 500 funtów. Okres korzystania z planu wynosi jednorazowo maksymalnie 5 lat co ustawia maksymalny próg wpłaty na 30 000 funtów. Poza stałą pensją menadżerowie najwyższego szczebla mogą liczyć na premie których maksymalna wysokość może wynieść 215% podstawy. W tym przypadku co najmniej połowa wartości bonusu musi zostać wypłacona w formie akcji spółki.

Sytuacja wygląda podobnie kiedy mówimy o członkach rady nadzorczej. Oprócz podstawowej pensji przysługuje im zwrot wszystkich kosztów związanych z działalnością w radzie i jej komitetach a także dodatek w wysokości 4 000 funtów na poczet wydatków związanych z podróżami.

Nie jest zaskoczeniem fakt że w 2020 roku najwyższą pensję podstawową otrzymywał dyrektor generalny spółki Noel Quinn który otrzymał 1 266 000 funtów. Na drugim miejscu pod względem wielkości wynagrodzenia uplasował się dyrektor finansowy Ewen Stevenson który pobierał 738 000 funtów rocznie. Zgodnie z tym co zostało powiedziane powyżej na obu pracowników czekało wiele dodatków. Po zsumowaniu wszystkich benefitów udzielonych w 2020 roku okazuje się że Noel Quinn otrzymał od HSBC łącznie 4 154 000 funtów a Ewen Stevenson 3 687 000 funtów. Stosunek honorarium CEO największego banku na świecie do mediany zarobków w Zjednoczonym Królestwie w 2020 roku wynosił 85 do 1. Jest to wyraźny spadek w stosunku do 2019 roku kiedy to omawiana proporcja wyniosła 105 do 1. Spośród osób wchodzących w skład rady nadzorczej największą pensję otrzymuje jej przewodniczący Mark Tucker. Jego stałe wynagrodzenie w 2020 roku osiągnęło 1 500 000 funtów.

Las Vegas may be known for its boulevard of massive casinos but it also boasts a long history of developers drawing up grandiose plans and never following through.

And in the past several years one spot in particular has seen a parade of big plans come and go or just stall: the north Strip.

Coming out of the Great Recession various plans to build huge hotels complete an unfinished skyscraper and construct an arena have produced hardly any visible results. But in a break from the north Strip’s seemingly cursed past a newly built hotel-casino is about to open.

Resorts World Las Vegas a $4.3 billion project by Malaysia’s Genting Group is set to debut next Thursday. It will feature 3500 rooms more than 40 food and beverage spots and plenty of star power with a lineup of scheduled shows from the likes of Miley Cyrus Katy Perry and Celine Dion.

Resorts World was initially supposed to debut five years ago and it’s unclear how or if its long-planned entry will influence neighboring developers. But its opening could spark a boost of foot traffic to a stretch of the Strip that has long needed it and more tourism overall to Las Vegas something new resorts have done in the past.

Genting bought the abandoned Echelon resort site in March 2013 with plans for its own lavish project. The economy was in rough shape though it wasn’t long before other big proposals or deals came about sparking hopes for a turnaround in the area.

Ex-NBA player Jackie Robinson announced plans in late 2013 to build an arena and a luxury hotel on the former Wet ’n’ Wild water park site. In 2014 Australian billionaire James Packer acquired the vacant former New Frontier site and in 2017 developer Steve Witkoff acquired the long-stalled Fontainebleau tower.

Robinson started excavating his site in 2017 and received approvals that year for a major expansion of his plans. But the $3 billion venture hasn’t shown progress beyond the initial construction work leaving a giant hole in the ground.

In April after a Clark County Commission vote kept his long-stalled plans alive he said he was looking to resume excavating the site in late summer.

Packer’s group set out to build the 1100-room Alon Las Vegas but he reportedly had trouble raising project funds and the land went up for sale. Wynn Resorts reached a deal in late 2017 to buy the site.

Wynn founder Steve Wynn told analysts in early 2018 that he wanted to move quickly on a project there with talk of building 2000 to 3000 rooms.

Days later The Wall Street Journal reported that Wynn had a decadeslong pattern of sexual misconduct. Wynn who called the allegations “preposterous” soon resigned as chairman and CEO of his casino company citing “an avalanche of negative publicity.”

Its land remains empty.

Wynn Resorts spokesman Michael Weaver said Friday that projects such as Resorts World “benefit all current and future resorts” on the north Strip and that his company has “not announced a development timeline” for its land.

Meanwhile Witkoff renamed his property Drew Las Vegas and set out to finish the 60-plus-story megaresort. But he shelved construction after the coronavirus pandemic hit and the Fontainebleau’s original developer Jeffrey Soffer reacquired the property early this year through a process that lets people avoid foreclosure with no word on when construction would resume.

In a statement last week that did not provide any updates on the tower’s timeline Brett Mufson president of Soffer’s firm Fontainebleau Development said that Resorts World’s opening and the Las Vegas Convention Center’s recently finished $1 billion expansion just off the north Strip help further “solidify the location of our property as the future epicenter of Las Vegas.”

To be sure other projects have opened in the area. After a major renovation the former Sahara reopened in 2014 as the SLS Las Vegas. But its performance quickly spiraled downward and the resort traded hands in 2018. The new owner launched a $150 million overhaul and renamed the property Sahara Las Vegas.

Also the Las Vegas Convention Center this month hosted the first major trade show in the U.S. since the pandemic hit World of Concrete in its new West Hall.

The north Strip still faces plenty of questions but Resorts World’s debut is a long-awaited win for the area. But how will it perform and what will it do for that part of the boulevard?

Sit tight.

Posted on: June 19 2021 12:03h.

Last updated on: June 18 2021 12:20h.

The Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (DICJ) will have considerably more casino inspectors to regulate the world’s richest gaming hub in the coming months and years.

This week the Macau Executive Council which supports Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat Seng passed an amendment that allocates DICJ funding and its operational structure. The change GGRAsia reports will take effect within the next several weeks.

The revision more than doubles the number of DICJ gaming inspectors the agency is to have rising from 192 currently to 459 positions. There is no official word as to when the positions for 459 inspectors will be fulfilled only that the hiring will be conducted in a gradual manner.

The DICJ has the tall task of regulating Macau’s six licensed commercial casino operators. While there are only six operators they operate more than 40 casinos and/or VIP rooms.

The responsibilities of the DICJ include to examine supervise and monitor the activities of the concessionaires especially on their compliance with the legal statutory and contractual obligations” the agency’s website reads.

Macau is the richest casino market on the planet. The Chinese Special Administrative Region hit its all-time high gross gaming revenue mark in 2013 when enclave casinos won more than $45 billion from gamblers.

Annual win has since declined due to stricter regulations regarding mainland high rollers moving money to Macau which is a tax haven free of China’s substantial taxes. In 2019 Macau casinos won $36.5 billion.

Macau Seeks Tighter Controls

The gaming licenses for Las Vegas Sands MGM Resorts Wynn Resorts Melco Resorts Galaxy Entertainment and SJM Holdings are all set to expire next year in this month.

For the past several years Macau officials have pledged to review all aspects of its gaming industry and issue new tenders to the gaming giants but under new regulatory terms.

Macau unlike Hong Kong — the other SAR in China — remains in the good graces of the People’s Republic. Macau and Hong Kong both have a great deal of government autonomy under China’s “one country two systems” arrangement.

China provides defense and foreign affairs for Macau and Hong Kong. But the regions are otherwise free of Beijing rule. China President Xi Jinping has been greatly concerned with the cross-border flow of money for gaming purposes since that $45 billion number was realized eight years ago.

Xi’s administration and subsequent law enforcement have since greatly scrutinized VIP junket groups. Macau says its DICJ expansion is to enhance “the strength of regulation.”

Deputy Director Added

The DICJ has been headed by Adriano Marques Ho since June of 2020. His tenure was recently extended by 24 months to at least June of 2023.

Ho holds a law degree from Macau’s University of Science and Technology and was an advisor to the Macau Secretary for Security before taking the helm of the DICJ. Ho’s resume also includes a stint at the Macau Judiciary Police where he led the force’s gaming-related crimes unit.

Ho’s DICJ right-hand man is Deputy Director Lio Chi Chong a former criminal investigator. Under the DICJ expansion Chong is set to receive a partner by way of a second deputy director — a position sometimes referred to as the DICJ “subdirector.”",,,,,,,,,

The stadium at Brooklyn Center High School is home to multiple sports teams. But for the past three years it’s lacked one key amenity: a functional lighting system.

“We’ve been playing day games for football soccer anything that happens out here has to be worked around when we have daylight” said Nate Gautsch Brooklyn Center’s athletic director.

In 2018 the lights shut off during a Centaurs’ football game. When Gautsch called Xcel Energy to fix the problem he got bad news about the 30-year-old lights.

“They looked and they said this is not a safe system to use anymore and we cannot allow you to use it” Gautsch said.

So for three years the silver sentinels have stood high above the football field disconnected from a power source.

“Since then we’ve been working with how do we bring lights back” Gautsch said.

Help from an NFL star

Bringing the lights back is a goal that’s not easy for a small school district to accomplish on its own. But now Brooklyn Center has some help thanks to Minnesota Vikings’ star receiver Adam Thielen.

“When Adam and Cate learned that the lights were red-tagged and there were no Friday night lights it really spoke to them. and they said we’re going to take care of that” said Amy Sinclair executive director of the Thielen Foundation.

The organization recently launched a campaign to raise $275000 to help bring the stadium lights back to Brooklyn Center High School.

It’s an amenity that would put Brooklyn Center on par with the larger schools.

“So we feel like if [the athletes] are successful on the field and feel good about themselves that’s going to spill over into the classroom and also into a future career” Sinclair said. “So we really like to support them in that way.”

Stadium lights may not directly impact wins and losses but a little support can go a long way to helping Brooklyn Center’s student-athletes reach their full potential.

“It’s a feeling that these kids deserve to have” Gautsch said.

Officials from the Thielen Foundation hope to have a dedication ceremony in the fall under the new stadium lights when they make their long-awaited debut.

It’s been a week for the Flyers and their fans. From news of being in on nearly every name thats come across the ticker to top-dog on the market Dougie Hamilton not being their first priority the Flyers have been playing marionette with our hearts all week long. Gut feeling says that this won’t be the worst of it as we are still a month away from the draft and even longer from the start of free agency.

The best part about this time in the year is the rumors. Let’s be honest. If it wasn’t for rumors the content would be boring. The what-if’s and hypotheticals are always the most fun to dive into because everyone has an idea of what the Flyers should be looking to do to improve before the 2021/22 season. Right or wrong it’s still fun to guess what they’re going to do in order to improve.

While it appears the Flyers may not bring in Dougie Hamilton there are still a few options out there that could be an immediate improvement on the blueline. Quite frankly bringing in a middle-of-the-road defenseman would be an improvement considering the year we just witnessed. Regardless one name that may be the most affordable to the Flyers would be Matt Dumba of the Minnesota Wild. His $6 million cap hit would be substantially less than what Hamilton will inevitably sign for. While Seth Jones is over half a million dollars cheaper he’s on record saying that he wants to test free agency when his current deal expires.

Obviously Jones and Hamilton are the two biggest fish available at the moment. With the Flyers needing much more than just a top-pairing defenseman opposite of Ivan Provorov striking a deal with Minnesota for Dumba may be the most logical route that Chuck Fletcher could go.

What Matt Dumba Brings to the Flyers

Matt Dumba would likely be the guy to solidify the first pair with Ivan Provorov. Again it’s worth reiterating that Dougie Hamilton and Seth Jones should be considered here before Matt Dumba. With that being said this might be the easiest route to go if Chuck Fletcher is looking to be a bit more fiscally responsible and give up less than he would for Hamilton or Jones.

While he doesn’t bring quite what the aforementioned two bring he would bring a physical presence that this team has lacked for quite some time. Say what you will about that being a valuable attribute but it speaks volumes when you have a guy like that patrolling the blueline. His career-high in points came during the 2017/18 season where he posted 50 (14g 36a) in his only complete 82 game season to-date. Since then his point production has fallen off a bit. However the Flyers shouldn’t be looking for a guy who can pitch in 50+ points per season from the blueline. Bringing in a guy who can prevent a guy like Mika Zibanejad from totalling six points in one night against the Flyers should take precedence.

Why Minnesota would Deal Matt Dumba

Minnesota is in a precarious position with the upcoming expansion draft. They have two forwards and three defenseman that they are obligation to protect due to no-movement clauses. Zach Parise and Mats Zuccarello are the two forwards followed by Jared Spurgeon Ryan Suter and Jonas Brodin on the back end. Matt Dumba’s modified no-movement clause doesn’t kick in until the beginning of the 2021/22 season so the Wild aren’t mandated to protect him in the upcoming expansion draft.

If Minnesota goes the 7-3-1 route and protects only three defenseman Dumba is the odd man out. If they go the eight players one goalie route that leaves three protection spots open while having to protect guys like Victor Rask Marcus Foligno Joel Eriksson Ek Jordan Greenway and Kevin Fiala. Bill Guerin may see more value in offloading Dumba this offseason to get something in return before potentially losing him for nothing if Seattle decides to pluck him.

Minnesota could use some depth at the center position which isn’t necessarily the Flyers’ forte at the moment. However the Flyers do have some prospects a la Morgan Frost who they could include in a package that may pique Guerin’s attention. There would be more moving parts to a deal for Dumba but offering up at least one center would get the conversation off on the right foot.

Why Philadelphia would Want Matt Dumba

The Flyers are in desperate need of an upgrade on the blueline. Aside from Nolan Patrick that’s been the main discussion ever since the Flyers season wrapped up. Whoever they turn their attention to there is likely going to be a bidding war to obtain their services. While other clubs lay their cards on the table for guys like Dougie Hamilton and Seth Jones the Flyers could put their chips towards acquiring Dumba. While there will surely be other suitors the Flyers should stop at nothing to upgrade their defensive core.

All that jargon aside here are the facts:

The Flyers were dead last in goals against and subsequently goals against per game. They had the second-worst penalty killing unit in the NHL. Their powerplay was just under middle-of-the-road territory at 17th. Their team save percentage was the lowest in the league as well. That’s the long-ish form way of saying that the Flyers defense needs help. Dumba would provide the Flyers with the capability to eat some big minutes and play on either special teams unit. While not a certified stud on either the penalty kill or powerplay he has the ability to play both and lessen the load on Provorov.

Thrilla in Phila?

While Chuck is on the phone about Dumba it’s worth kicking the tires on one of their younger forwards as well. Friday night it was reported by Kevin Weekes that Calder finalist Kirill Kaprizov was spotted in Moscow Russia.

As of now talks with likely Rookie of the yr Kaprizov & @mnwild have gone cold. My understanding is he’s in Moscow and it’s believed CSKA is interested in signing him for KHL & Olympics. @NHL @NHLNetwork #HockeyTwitter — Kevin Weekes (@KevinWeekes) June 18 2021

While spicy it was later made clear as to why Kaprizov was in Moscow for the weekend by Michael Russo of The Athletic.

#mnwild & Kirill Kaprizov’s agent say Kaprizov is at a buddy’s wedding in Moscow. His agent gave the team a heads up.



As for CSKA rumors that’s his only option besides signing with the Wild and they’ll offer him a ton of $ so expect those rumors as long as he’s unsigned here — Michael Russo (@RussoHockey) June 18 2021

Russo went on to mention in the second tweet of this thread that Kaprizov’s only two options are signing with Minnesota or his former KHL team CSKA Moscow. He also mentioned that as part of contract negotiations Minnesota has offered only long-term deals while Kirill is looking for a short-term deal. If Kaprizov were to make the jump back to Russia Minnesota would retain his rights until he decides to come back. That is unless he comes back after the age of 27 therefore becoming an unrestricted free agent.

Let’s say negotiations take a turn and go south. If Minnesota is convinced that Kaprizov isn’t going to sign with them maybe they look at the trade market to get some sort of return on investment. What better team than the Flyers and the guy who drafted Kaprizov to turn to and discuss a deal?

While there’s little-to-no substance to this Fletcher is no stranger to trading for the rights to sign a player. Flyers fans saw it happen when he traded a fifth round pick to get the rights to exclusively negotiate with Kevin Hayes. While looking at acquiring Dumba it may be worth seeing what Minnesota would want in return for Kaprizov’s negotiating rights. Not to mention Fletcher did draft Kaprizov…

As fantastic as it all sounds there’s really no sense in making this deal if you’re Minnesota. Kaprizov would fit in nicely with the Flyers but it’s all just wishful thinking at this point.

Over the next few weeks we’re set to hear how the Flyers are or should be in on damn-near every defenseman that could hit the market via free agency or trade. Rightfully so. The blueline’s performance this past season was abysmal and an upgrade should be the number one priority for Fletcher. Matt Dumba may not be at the top of the list but that shouldn’t discount the Flyers from seeing what it would take to get him in orange and black.

Depending on where their priorities lie in terms of acquiring help on the back-end Dumba would be a solid get. He could bring a physical presence to this team that has been lacking for the better part of a decade. He could eat minutes contribute on the powerplay if need be and spell Provorov of some special teams duties to keep him from playing an absurd amount of time per night. Signed for $6 million per season for the next two he would also be attractive from a financial standpoint. That type of figure could allow for the Flyers to address more needs seeing as that laundry list never seems to end.

So it’s been well over a year and we were anxious and nervous to seeat the 7th Street Entry in Minneapolis last night.Before you ask masks were not required. We brought masks just in case but looking around no one (except for some First Avenue staffs) were wearing face coverings.7th Street Entry now has a metal detector right at the door. This might be a permanent fixture… so going forward it may take much longer to get inside the venue due to false positives or random issues.The stage and room is exactly as we last saw it. If you’ve ever attended a show here it’s one of the most intimate venue in town… and it’s a great place to see a band big or small.Starting off thissponsored show was local band. The five-piece is really new only releasing their single “Yesterday Is Gone” in July 2021… which the band happily played near the end of their set.Other songs on their set included “Too Many Sides (of the Same Coin)” and a song about something like “Rainbow Trout” (a “fake country song”).Next up was. We’ve seen the Minneapolis group four times including with The Coathangers in Sep 2015  and have described them as “it’s like Kurt Cobain fronting X covering the B-52s.”We also mentioned that they used to be a duo (Travis Franklin and Crystal Stockert) then trio (added Kristin Kosieracki) and eventually a quartet (added Matthew ‘Gravey’ Graves). Their latest evolution is that they’ve enlisted Danielle Cusack to replace Kristin. If you’re at all a fan ofor you know who Danielle is.Since the pandemic hit the band spent the year writing and ended up recording over 15 new songs at the end of 2020… so they were eager to show off the new songs such as “Bork Bork” in their set.So the funny thing is that this was an 18+ show meaning that members of Chicago’scould not legally attend the show on their own. However as performers it’s perfectly fine.This was Horsegirl’s first tour but you wouldn’t know seeing as how seasoned they seem on stage. We’ve seen old established bands screwing up and goofing around so it was nice to see such a young band taking their shows seriously.Since the trio (Penelope Lowenstein Nora Cheng and Gigi Reece) is practically brand new they basically played every songs they’ve ever recorded including “Ballroom Dance Scene” and “Forecast”. Between each song they would created these interlude jams/noise as the stage lights turn blood red probably inspired from being in acover band.Some of the new songs heard was “Emma”… described as “a love song”. In a past interviews they’ve mentioned they wouldn’t write about love or personal heartbreak so it was a rare thing to see them write a love song.It should be interesting to see where the band lands as the trio continues to grow and attend college later this year. We’re also curious to see a debut album with their recent signing with,,,

In the three decades since it's been handed off from one parent company to another and is still struggling to find its footing in the modern fast-food landscape.

Long John Silver's fall from grace was gradual. The company's heyday was a ten-year period from about 1979 to 1989 during which it grew from a footprint of one thousand units to an all-time high of 1500 locations. Today the seafood chain claims a little under half of that amount with about 701 units to its name.

This Beloved Southern Chain Has Launched Two New Fast-Food Brands

In terms of sales the company has watched its hold on the quick-service seafood market steadily weaken. In its prime Long John Silver's owned about two thirds of the entire market—an incredible feat (for comparison a recent estimate puts McDonald's market share at just over 60%). Since then its share has decreased to about a third.

Currently the chain is in a gentle sales nose-dive having taken in about $70 million less this year than it did in 2017 according to Restaurant Business. Likewise its year-over-year sales change jumped from -5.6% four years ago to -17% today—not quite the Red Lobster territory but getting there.

It's no secret that Long John Silver's is in decline and has been for a while. What remains unclear and open to interpretation is how the once-promising chain entered its current downward trend. According to Youtuber industry analyst Company Man Long John Silver's current industry position is best understood in terms of a few key moments in the company's history as well as some inherent qualities of the company itself.

The chain's first major blow came in 1989 when it was acquired by a group of private investors in a $620 million buyout. Although the company reached its footprint peak in that year its unit count belied deeper financial difficulties. Having already begun to lose its prized two-thirds market share due to gradual encroachment from larger fast-food companies and struggling with the mounting cost of fish the chain decided to take itself private.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

In the grand scheme of things that original buyout set Long John Silver's on an unending course of acquisitions and re-sales. Its ownership by the private investment group did not significantly alter the chain's mounting debt and when Long John Silver's declared bankruptcy in 1998 it was promptly handed off to another parent company.

Private ownership generally has not been good to Long John Silver's. Since its original buyout the chain has been re-sold no fewer than three times by the likes of A&W Restaurants and Yum! Brands—before passing back into the hands of Long John Silver's Partners LLC (who themselves tried to sell the brand to Texas-based company KeyCorp in 2015). Long John Silver's time with Yum! Brands was particularly disastrous with the conglomerate yoking the seafood chain with then–sister companies A&W and Taco Bell. The co-branding effort proved mostly unsuccessful and inspired a franchisee lawsuit in 2010.

Besides its unhappy history of private ownership Long John Silver's decline might also be attributable to something inherent in the company: its menu. From fried fish and fried chicken to hush puppies (fried balls of cornmeal) the chain's menu has always prioritized comfort and taste over health. Unsurprisingly then the seafood chain suffered a PR nightmare in 2013 when the Center for Science in the Public Interest named ""The Big Catch"" one of their core menu items ""The Worst Meal in America."" As American fast-food tastes have evolved Long John Silver's has struggled to reconcile its tradition of fried comfort food with an increasing demand for healthy eats.

That's not to say the chain hasn't managed some course corrections though. Long John Silver's now offers numerous grilled and baked options and is careful to note on its website its compliance with sustainability practices in its purchase of fish. Pair that with the recent rebranding efforts including store and uniform redesigns the addition of drive-thru services and a doubling down on online ordering and Long John Silver's looks like it might just right its ship.

You may be a true Taco Bell enthusiast if you can say you've gone through the drive-thru at 2 a.m. Or perhaps you pick up boxes of tacos for every sporting event you and your friends get together to watch at your house. Taco Bell has been an ever-growing staple on the fast food scene since the first location opened in 1962. So how has a fast food chain lasted so long without ever serving a single fry? We honestly have no idea.

Taco Bell enthusiasts had been clamoring for a Tex-Mex inspired version of fast food french fries for years and the company finally delivered them to eager eaters in 2018. It was the year that Taco Bell's Nacho Fries hit the market and quite frankly Taco Bell lovers did a bit more than rejoice — they went crazy for the things.

They were only around for a limited run but they reappeared a few times over the next couple of years. Taco Bell announced in January 2020 that the famed Nacho Fries were again returning to menus and again followers began flocking to restaurants for the seasoned fries with a cult-like following. But what exactly is the craze all about? We decided to take a deeper look. This is the untold truth of Taco Bell's Nacho Fries.",,,,,,,,,
