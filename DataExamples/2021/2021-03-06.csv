Two men have gone under knife for a bizarre boob job after making a daring bet on social media.

Social media influencer Yeferson Cossio from Colombia challenged his brother-in-law Jhoan Lopez to get the breast implants if he reaches three million followers on Instagram.

""We made a bet that if he (Cossio) reached 3 million followers I would have to get breast implants"" he told his fans.

He announced the challenge on his account two weeks ago and soon amassed more than 3.5 million fans.

Despite winning the bet he decided to go with Jhoan and undergo the surgery together ""just for fun"".

Video shared on his Instagram account shows the tattooed influencer lying on the operating table inside the clinic as the staff prepared for the implant surgery.

The doctor tucks two silicone gel implants into his boobs and stitches him up after.

In another clip he teasers his fans and puts on a pink bra before revealing his new chest.

Yeferson told his followers before undergoing surgery: ""I honestly think this could be an interesting idea just imagine when I'm old and I'll be able to tell people that 'one time I lost a bet and got enormous breast implants'.

""I'm not worried. I've already spoken to @equipomurcia and they explained how we can do this procedure without damaging my pectoral muscles.""

Ron Gittins' endeavours were only discovered after his death as he rarely welcomed visitors into his ground-floor flat.

When his niece Jan Williams entered the Oxton semi-detached house she found he had painted murals inspired by Ancient Rome Greece and Egypt on the walls floors and ceiling and had built gigantic fireplaces in the shape of a lion and a bull.

His other creations included a life-size papier mache model of Egyptian queen Cleopatra a series of papier mache heads and cardboard Roman armour.

An artist herself Jan was determined to save her Uncle Ron's work and open it as a space to inspire others.

Now the ex-Pulp frontman has signed up as patron of 'Ron's Place' to help it gain worldwide recognition as a unique example of 'outsider art'.

Meanwhile Jan and her partner Chris Teasdale have launched a Patreon appeal to which people can sign up to donate a small amount of money every month to help fund its restoration.

Jarvis said: ""Art from the usual channels has become so entwined with commerce. The rush that you get from creativity has kind of got a bit obscured.

""That's one of the things that attracted me to Outsider Art it feels like it was seeing it in a purer form.

""They are 100% committed to whatever vision they have got because they are in it - they are sleeping in it they are eating in it. And that's quite a thing to behold.""

Ron died in September 2019 a month away from his 80th birthday. Although he had always displayed unusual behaviour he had become more eccentric in his later years.

He was a familiar sight in Oxton Village where he would walk along the streets dressed in a series of homemade military costumes pushing an old-fashioned pram filled with the bags of cement he used to build his enormous fireplaces.

Jarvis Cocker was introduced to Jan and Chris by award-winning Liverpool-based filmmaker Martin Wallace who describes Ron's Place as the only example of Outsider Art of its kind in the UK.

In 2016 they created a series of three one-hour documentaries Journey's into the Outside with Jarvis Cocker which explored the artistic concept across the globe. Martin is now working on a film about Ron's life.

So-called 'outsider artists' usually work outside the mainstream art world and often unlike Ron who studied at the Laird School of Art in Birkenhead have no formal training. Their work is very rarely preserved as those who discover it don't understand the value of what they are seeing.

Martin said: ""Jarvis' involvement will make a massive difference because it brings a national and international credibility to the place.

""Otherwise there's a risk it can be seen as parochial when it's something really important.

""We went all over the world looking at these sorts of places and there's nothing like it in the UK. It's a rare thing generally to find such an alternative environment that's been built in secret.""

Jan and Chris who work together as the Caravan Gallery are keen for Ron's Place to become an inspiration to other artists and visitors. But first they need to ensure Ron's art work is preserved.

An advisory board has been appointed from Merseyside's arts and higher education sectors to oversee the vision for the space.

Work is also being done to document and archive all artwork written material and other items found in the flat.

An eight-year-old Calamvale house built by Australian boxing legend Jeff Horn’s Sunnybank builder Scott Mack Constructions broke the suburb record for a house on 4000 sqm or less by more than $1 million at the auction.

The house at 38 Fatima Place attracted 11 bidders and was $1.175 million more than the $1.825 million paid for 46 Ayesha Place Calamvale in 2016.

The lead bidder increased her bid from $2.2 million to $2.6 million $2.8 million and then $3 million to secure the sale.

“There were no vendor bids” LJ Hooker Sunnybank Hills agent Karl Gillespie said. “This buyer thought it was worth more and she really wanted an unconditional sale. They live locally in Calamvale and I’ll be selling their place shortly.

“People don’t even know where Calamvale is but this is going to kick our median house price up.”

Abbott announces ""Operation Lone Star"" to combat drug people smuggling at the border","Governor Greg Abbott and the Texas Department of Public Safety launched on Saturday Operation Lone Star to combat the smuggling of people and drugs into Texas.

The Operation integrates DPS with the Texas National Guard and deploys air ground marine and tactical border security assets to high threat areas to deny Mexican Cartels and other smugglers the ability to move drugs and people into Texas.



The crisis at our southern border continues to escalate because of Biden Administration policies that refuse to secure the border and invite illegal immigration” said Governor Abbott. “Texas supports legal immigration but will not be an accomplice to the open border policies that cause rather than prevent a humanitarian crisis in our state and endanger the lives of Texans. We will surge the resources and law enforcement personnel needed to confront this crisis.

This decision follows a meeting last month between Governor Abbott and DPS Director Colonel Steve McCraw where they discussed strategies to enhance safety and security along the border.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)

HOUSTON – During a press conference Sunday with local health officials where he urged the public to wear masks Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott didn’t mention rescending the statewide mask order when President Joe Biden was in town a little more than a week ago.

On Feb. 26 Biden met with Turner Abbott Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo and congressional members in Houston to discuss the state’s response to the winter storm which left millions of Texans without water and power for days and the COVID-19 response which heavily depends on the ramping up distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Turner said that during the meeting the president told the group: “We will have to keep on our masks on for quite some time.”

“The governor said nothing” said Turner.

Turner said the governor took no public issue with the mask mandate at that time.

“No one took issue with him then” Turner said. “Quite frankly we shouldn’t take issue with him.”

Since Abbott announced his plan to lift the mask order and all capacity limits starting Wednesday Turner and other local officials have called the move premature and against science.

“This is the wrong direction for the state of Texas and this decision needs to be criticized and condemned in every part of the state” Turner said earlier this week. “We are still in the midst of dealing with this coronavirus. The variants are still out there. Less than 10 to 15% of the people in the state of Texas have been vaccinated.”

Turner said that until more people get the vaccine masks represent one of the best ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

“This is the wrong policy decision for the people in the state of Texas on multiple levels” he said.

In an exclusive interview with KPRC 2 last week Abbott noted that the state is setting an all-time record of vaccines administered.

“All the numbers are going in the right direction” Abbott said. “Today we had the lowest number of hospitalizations that we’ve had and the lowest positivity rate that we’ve had in more than four months the most number of people have been vaccinated.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vcmlvZ3JhbmRlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2NvdmlkLTE5LXRyZXZpbm8td291bGQtZG8tdGhpbmdzLWRpZmZlcmVudGx5LXRvLWFiYm90dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID-19: Treviño would do things differently to Abbott – Rio Grande Guardian,"The Council for South Texas Economic Progress wants local manufacturers to interact with the site selectors to tell them what it is like to do…

Peter Bergman plays Jack Abbott on ‘The Young and the Restless’

Bergman is most known for his role on The Young and the Restless but playing Jack on the show isn’t his first role in daytime television. The actor previously played Dr. Cliff Warner on All My Children starting in 1989. He was on the show for about 10 years before the series parted ways with him. However all worked out for his good as the same year The Young and the Restless tapped him to be the new after Terry Lester left the show.

As Jack Bergman has played him for years and in turn has become one of the longest-serving cast members on the show. The character is not only one of the most important ones in The Young in the Restless history but is one of the most iconic characters in all of daytime television and soap opera history.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k75M1b61aA8&t=1s

He is most known for being the son of John Abbott and later the patriarch of the Abbott family. However the biggest parts of Jack’s storylines have been centered on his longtime feud with Victor Newman. The character has been married to Patty Williams Lindsey Wells Nikki Newman Luan Volien Phyllis Summers and Sharon Newman. Additionally he has two children Keemo Volien Abbott and Kyle Abbott.

‘The Young and the Restless’ star Peter Bergman on the experience of being the new recast on the block

In a 2019 interview with Michael Fairman TV Bergman reflected on playing Jack for over 30 years on The Young and the Restless. He also talked about his relationship with other cast members who have taken over characters that were played by other people before.

“I am their best friend” he said. “I make sure I find anyone who finds themselves in that situation and I have a conversation with them; for instance: Mark Grossman [Adam] just the other day. I said “Mark you’ve been here long enough. You’ve now established Adam. You don’t have to look back at what anyone else did with this character. Now we have to tell Mark Grossman’s version of Adam” and he did welcome that advice because yeah it’s a hard thing to do. It’s a hard thing to step into a role that’s been played by someone else before.”

“I’m telling you every prop person every set decorator every lighting person knew more about Jack Abbott than I did” he continued. “It was daunting. It was really daunting. I’d try something ‘Eh I’m going to try this’ and they’d cut it short and go ‘No no’ and they were right! They were helping to guide me toward making this my own but we do this in baby steps. I’m just amazingly grateful. This has been a time of gratitude and it has surprised me.”

The Young and the Restless airs weekdays at CBS."

PwC

Accenture

The race to win the federal government’s overhaul of its ageing visa infrastructure has been trimmed down to a set of three consortia.

Late 2020 the Department of Home Affairs launched a public tender for a “qualified and experienced provider to work with the Commonwealth” to design deliver and support its new so-called ‘Permissions Capability’ platform. This platform will revamp and digitise the way Australians and visitors access government services such as permits accreditations licences and registrations.

According to AFR consultancies PwC and Accenture are once again among the finalists for the mega contract alongside IBM which is seeking to design and build the platform on its own. Accenture has again teamed up with Australia Post and Pega to pitch for the 10-year contract while PwC is partnering with Oracle and new kid on the block Sayers.

Sayers however was indirectly involved in the previous tender as the firm’s CEO (Luke Sayers) and a number of its partners were at the time at the helm of PwC’s bid. That time round PwC was part of the Australian Visa Processing (AVP) consortium headed by former Foxtel boss Peter Tonagh and further made up of Ellerston Capital Oracle Qantas NAB and Pacific Blue Capital.

The tender’s predecessor was abandoned in March last year embarrassing the Morrison government which had already spent to the tune of $100 million of taxpayers’ money on the initial phases. The plug was pulled due to political concerns around outsourcing of the sensitive visa function and the data of people.

In the new setup the Permissions Capability platform has been designed to have much less of an outsourcing model at its core. The platform is expected to operate as a separate entity with the processing to stay under control of the government.

The tender document stipulates that the platform will “handle the digitisation of incoming passenger declaration cards” and host “digital visa applications.” Initially used by Home Affairs the platform will be scaled to be reused across the Commonwealth not just for visas.

It is understood that the winner of the highly anticipated tender will be announced within the next week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vZWFybmluZ3MtY2FsZW5kYXItZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrLW9mLW1hcmNoLTgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings calendar for the week of March 8,"On the heels of lawmakers moving closer to passing the stimulus bill inflation concerns gripped the market after Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell at a meeting said the reopening would put pressure on prices.

After starting the week on a positive note benchmark indexes S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average withdrew and slipped to a one-month low before ending the last session. They were down 1.34% and 1.11% respectively early Friday. Earlier sentiment had improved after jobless claims came in below economists’ forecast.

After a relatively quiet period consolidations seem to be making a comeback. Continuing its acquisition spree Accenture clinched at least four deals this week with the buyout of UK-based talent consultancy Cirrus Logic topping the list.

The professional services firm also agreed to buy Brazil-based robotics solutions provider Pollux and Australian logistics consultancy GRA. The other business that joined the Accenture fold is technology solutions provider REPL Group.

Agilent Technologies agreed to acquire Resolution Bioscience for $695 million while Taco Bell owner Yum! Brands bought artificial intelligence provider Kvantum. The other key deals include Digital Turbine’s purchase of Israel-based mobile advertising company Triapodi Ltd and the $1.45-billion acquisition of UK-based Capco by Indian software giant Wipro.

Once again retailers dominated the earnings scene with department store operators Kohl’s and Target Corp. publishing their latest statistics on Tuesday followed by discount chain Dollar Tree on Wednesday. The next day Kroger Company and warehouse giant Costco Corp. delivered mixed results for their most recent quarters amid tough-year-over comparison.

Chipmaker Broadcom’s first-quarter report was the other major announcement of the week. As Wall Street approaches the fag end of the earnings season Oracle’s third-quarter financial report is probably the most-awaited announcement next week — scheduled for March 10.

With the new funding Tyto Care has raised $100 million in the last 10 months. The company has raised $155 million to date.

Insight Partners led the funding of the at-home medical kit maker. Insight Partners has been active with investments in the healthcare space. It has also recently announced investments in Eden Health a concierge provider that delivers healthcare services to employers and commercial real estate building landlords. Insight Partners also recently led a round of series C funding for RapidSOS which offers software for emergency response and disaster management.

For this round Tyto Care lined up new investors that include Tiger Global Management and Qumra Capital along with new funding from existing investors Qualcomm Ventures Olive Tree Ventures and Shenzhen Capital Group Co.

Dedi Gilad co-founder and CEO of Tyto Care believes the company was able to attract investments from these partners because of its full-stack telehealth solution and artificial intelligence capabilities.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant growth in telehealth and 60% of patients who responded to a recent Accenture survey indicate they plan to continue using it when the health crisis is over.

Tyto Care has experienced strong adoption during the pandemic and sees growth in telehealth among hospitals insurers and health systems. The company's revenue more than doubled in 2020. Last year Tyto Care performed 650000 telehealth examinations globally the company said.

The round of funding is a continuation of the company’s series D round which began in April 2020 when it raised $50 million Gilad told Fierce Healthcare.

With the funding Tyto Care plans to make its telehealth and remote examination platform available to more customers in the U.S. Europe and Asia. It also will continue to introduce diagnostic solutions powered by AI and machine learning.

The funding will also enable Tyto Care to make inroads in the healthcare payer market according to Gilad.

Tyto Care differs from many other telehealth solutions by going beyond audio and video to incorporate a full physical exam. The Tyto Care product comprises an app and a mobile device with modular attachments for exams such as an otoscope for the ears stethoscope for heart and lungs and a tongue depressor for the throat. In January Tyto Care expanded its platform with a pulse oximeter to monitor patients’ blood oxygen saturation levels and heart rate.

These modular components deliver important data to help physicians evaluate patients Gilad noted.

“They provide physicians with the clinical data they require to remotely monitor diagnose and treat more conditions accurately by fully replicating an in-person visit from any location at any time” Gilad said.

Jeff Horing co-founder and managing director for Insight Partners cited the end-to-end capabilities of the Tyto Care platform as a reason for investing.

“Tyto Care sets itself apart in the telehealth market by providing patients clinicians and healthcare organizations worldwide with a unique end-to-end solution that goes far beyond the average video visit with clinic-quality examinations and AI-powered diagnostic capabilities” Horing said in a statement.

During the HLTH 2020 virtual conference in October Tyto Care introduced AI-powered features that detect abnormalities in lung and throat exams and sends alerts to clinicians. Tyto Care is also developing ML algorithms for decision support the company reported at the time. AI will make virtual care more personalized and reach a wider population Gilad noted.

In 2019 Time named Tyto Care one of the 100 best inventions. Gilad and Ofer Tzadik formed the company in 2012.

Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic telehealth providers will continue to attract strong investment industry stakeholders say.

“Investments in telehealth are an investment in the future of global healthcare” Gilad said. “The on-demand era has long arrived to the health industry but telehealth has still yet to maximize its market potential.”

Gilad says telehealth is part of new modalities of care that include virtual primary care remote monitoring asynchronous services and healthcare backed by data.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzcG9zdC5pZS90ZWNoL2NoYWxsZW5nZS1ub3ctaXMtdG8tcmV2ZXJzZS10aGUtZGVjbGluZS1vZi13b21lbi1pbi10ZWNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Challenge now is to reverse the decline of women in tech,"The pandemic hasn‘t helped but the expected recovery process could be seen as an opportunity to encourage cultural change and draw more women into Stem-related careers

The more difficult the selection the more disliked it is but there may be an easier way you aren't using.

Bill Gates said ""I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it."" This is a sentiment I've always agreed with and whether out of laziness or respect for my own time I always look for better ways to complete tasks. Generally speaking when it comes to Photoshop if what you're doing is taking a long time there's probably an easier way. Every time I've encountered any new task that is taking more time or is more intricate a task than I think it needs to be I start looking for alternative methods.

However one of the key offenders for this is one that I've never truly overcome: making selections. I have to make selections often in my work for a variety of reasons. While I've improved the speed at which I make them automation is rarely possible and so it just takes time. If there are intricate and difficult selections to be made I have to grin and bear it. That said there are undoubtedly better ways to do most things. This video shows one of them.

Although I haven't used this technique a great deal the times I have used it I've been impressed. With the right narrowing of parameters channels in Photoshop can be a fantastic way to make complex selections easily.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vaG93LXRvLXVwbG9hZC12aWRlb3Mtc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhLXVzaW5nLWFkb2JlLW1lZGlhLWVuY29kZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Upload Your Videos to Social Media Using Adobe Media Encoder,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vaG93LXRvLXVwbG9hZC12aWRlb3Mtc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhLXVzaW5nLWFkb2JlLW1lZGlhLWVuY29kZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ybXVsYXJhcGlkYS5uZXQvZW4vZjEtMjAyMS1saXN0LW9mLXBhcnRuZXJzLXNwb25zb3JzLWZvci1lYWNoLW9mLXRoZS0xMC10ZWFtcy_SAVxodHRwczovL2Zvcm11bGFyYXBpZGEubmV0L2VuL2YxLTIwMjEtbGlzdC1vZi1wYXJ0bmVycy1zcG9uc29ycy1mb3ItZWFjaC1vZi10aGUtMTAtdGVhbXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,F1 2021: List of partners/sponsors for each of the 10 teams,"The sport is incomplete without of partners and sponsors and all the F1 teams have found good support all these years with the list growing always.

On Sunday in Atlanta Curry added a memorable piece of evidence for the argument in his favor by winning the 2021 NBA All-Star 3-Point Contest. Having previously won the 2015 NBA All-Star 3-Point Contest Curry becomes the first player to win the event multiple times since Jason Kapono won in back-to-back years in 2007 and 2008.

Warriors star Klay Thompson won the NBA All-Star 3-Point Contest in 2016. Curry’s father Dell won the 1989 NBA All-Star 3-Point Contest in Houston as a member of the Seattle SuperSonics.

Stephen Curry is the seventh player to win the 3-Point Contest more than once since the event’s inception in 1986. The other multiple winners are Larry Bird (three times) Craig Hodges (three) Mark Price (twice) Jeff Hornacek (twice) Peja Stojakovic (twice) and Kapono (twice).

Let’s get one thing straight: When it comes to the best cereals Cinnamon Toast Crunch will always make our list. Over the years General Mills has released varieties like Sugar Cookie and Chocolate Churros. Soon we’ll have Dulce de Leche Toast Crunch according to Instagram account @cereallife.

Classic dulce de leche is a thick confection that’s made by slowly heating sweetened milk. The color changes and it becomes a sauce with a caramel flavor so it’s super versatile to use with a range of desserts. And now apparently it’ll be used in cereal.

Although we don’t have much detail on the new cereal based off of the packaging it’s fair to assume that the square cereal pieces swap the usual sweet cinnamon flavor for a sweet caramel-like flavor. If that’s not enough to pique your interest we don’t know what is!

Since the news broke on Instagram there’s no official information on when it’ll be hitting stores. As you can see on the box it notes that it’s a “sales sample” and “not for retail sale.” We’ll keep you updated as we learn more info on this already must-try cereal.

Jennifer Lopez’s hairstylist Chris Appleton shared the hair mask he uses to achieve J.Lo-level shine and volume.

The new Color Wow Money Masque creates “hold texture and bounce.”

Appleton says the mask was designed to “make every woman feel like J.Lo—to feel their best.”

If you’ve ever wanted to know the secret behind Jennifer Lopez’s shiny voluminous hair we’ve got it: the Color Wow Money Masque. J.Lo’s longtime hairstylist Chris Appleton opened up to People about his latest collaboration with Color Wow and he said the new Money Masque was designed to “make every woman feel like J.Lo—to feel their best.”

“There are so many masks out there but a lot contain ingredients that don’t wash off the hair which make it feel weighed down and look heavy” Appleton said also adding that there’s a misconception that masks should make your hair soft. “Because then realistically when you style it hair can get flat and you get greasy quick.”



Appleton ensures that the Money Masque—infused with blue sea kale a sea kelp and algae blend and a vegetable protein complex—elevates your locks resulting in volume and shine. “It creates great hold texture and bounce. I wanted it to perform when you styled your hair so you could see a difference in your hair. It will have that ‘swish’ to it and have some hold” he said.

The mask has already garnered positive reviews on Sephora. “I just tried this mask on my fine thin frizzy hair. “I can’t believe the shine body and fullness!!!” one reviewer raved. “I’ve tried other masks and I always had to rewash my hair due my hair feeling too greasy or heavy in this beach climate. Highly recommend.”

“I just got this mask and it helped bring my hair back to life! I use a lot of heat only hair and this helped to restore some of the moisture” another wrote. “I would definitely recommend this product if you have dry brittle hair from using styling tools.”



Appleton suggests using it once a week (or every three shampoos). Next you might as well add some J.Lo-inspired curls to your shiny strands. You can achieve that with the BaBylissPro Curling Iron which Appleton used to create Lopez’s 2020 People’s Choice Awards look.

“I wanted Jennifer’s hair to be as iconic as she is” Appleton previously told InStyle about the look. “We snatched the front to show off her face and let the hair in the back do all the talking to complement her overall look.”

First he applied Color Wow’s Dream Coat Supernatural Spray to prep her hair (which he also used to create her Super Bowl look!). Then he blow-dried her hair with a round brush for added volume and finished by using the curling iron to achieve voluminous waves.

After a relatively quiet period consolidations seem to be making a comeback. Continuing its acquisition spree Accenture clinched at least four deals this week with the buyout of UK-based talent consultancy Cirrus Logic topping the list.

The professional services firm also agreed to buy Brazil-based robotics solutions provider Pollux and Australian logistics consultancy GRA. The other business that joined the Accenture fold is technology solutions provider REPL Group.

Agilent Technologies agreed to acquire Resolution Bioscience for $695 million while Taco Bell owner Yum! Brands bought artificial intelligence provider Kvantum. The other key deals include Digital Turbine’s purchase of Israel-based mobile advertising company Triapodi Ltd and the $1.45-billion acquisition of UK-based Capco by Indian software giant Wipro.

Once again retailers dominated the earnings scene with department store operators Kohl’s and Target Corp. publishing their latest statistics on Tuesday followed by discount chain Dollar Tree on Wednesday. The next day Kroger Company and warehouse giant Costco Corp. delivered mixed results for their most recent quarters amid tough-year-over comparison.

Chipmaker Broadcom’s first-quarter report was the other major announcement of the week. As Wall Street approaches the fag end of the earnings season Oracle’s third-quarter financial report is probably the most-awaited announcement next week — scheduled for March 10.

Prior to that H&R Block and Dick’s Sporting Goods are expected to report on March 9. As the week progresses Ulta Beauty will be unveiling fourth-quarter numbers on March 11.

Those who choose to travel are strongly encouraged to check local government restrictions rules and safety measures related to COVID-19 and take personal comfort levels and health conditions into consideration before departure.

If you rent it they will come. That's Kevin Costner's surprise gambit when it comes to his beloved Colorado home Dunbar Ranch. And that means the rest of us now have a golden opportunity to vacation like a Hollywood A-lister.

Costner's 160-acre ranch just a 10-minute drive from downtown Aspen boasts three standalone properties — a main house a lake house and a river house — and can accommodate up to 34 guests. You'll have plenty to keep you occupied during your visit too with a private ice rink tubing track and dog sledding not to mention world-class skiing in nearby Aspen Snowmass of course.

During the warmer months the lengthy list of activities includes horseback riding hiking and fishing as well as pursuits that channel some of Costner's famous roles such as archery lessons (for the ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" fans) and hitting balls on the actor's personal baseball field (for ""Field of Dreams"" aficionados). There's even a selection of kayaks and paddleboards on hand for those interested in recreating the ""Waterworld"" denouement on Costner's private lake.

The houses themselves ooze old-fashioned warmth and deep cozy rustic comfort. They're the kind of places where you imagine a fire is always snapping a delicious-smelling pot is permanently simmering (the team of private chefs will handle that) and one of the old wardrobes might just lead to a magical snowy realm — other than Aspen.

The star of the show is the six-bedroom six-bathroom main house which has a disguised trapdoor in the master suite that leads down a flight of stone steps to an enormous hidden jacuzzi straddling the Continental Divide. The views out over Independence Pass and Aspen Mountain are spectacular throughout the property but this has to be the pick of the bunch.

Courtesy of Dunbar Ranch

Costner named the ranch in honor of his ""Dances With Wolves"" character Lieutenant John Dunbar and the pack of stone wolf busts guarding the nightstands and mantelpieces around the property further hint at that influence.

Costner still frequently uses Dunbar Ranch but the filming schedule for his new TV show Yellowstone means he's spending a large chunk of time on other people's ranches in Montana — hence the recent decision to rent out Dunbar for the princely sum of $36000 a night.

The price might seem somewhat daunting but as realtor Amy Mottier points out as she shows me around that's a little over $1000 per head if you fill it with friends for a special event. It's comparable to block booking the best rooms at Aspen's five-star hotel The Little Nell.

Dunbar Ranch is precisely the kind of place you'd build if you love the great outdoors and money was no issue. And that's exactly what Costner did some 20 years ago eagerly rolling up his sleeves like Ray Kinsella to help build his forever home. Now you can buy a piece of that dream on this wedge of private wilderness too. Just don't break any crockery or block any toilets — this is one landlord you don't want to mess with.

In the video he explains: “So I stayed in an Airbnb and the people that owned it thought I was gonna be female.

“They were really shocked I was a male and when I was asleep in the middle of the night I kept hearing noise from here and felt like I was being watched.

“Then I looked and saw this the next morning. A whole other room hidden.”

In the clip he films himself walking from the bed to the small air vent which is located on the lower part of the wall in the bedroom.

The TikTok user @hebobadass explains in the video that the people who owned the Airbnb “thought [he] was going to be female” and that they were surprised when he arrived on the property and found out he was male.

The guest explains that during his stay he heard noises coming from the vent in the middle of the night while he was trying to sleep. He also says he felt like was “being watched” so he follows the noise to investigate.

As he approaches the vent and looks closely through the slats on its cover the TikToker finds that the “vent” was actually disguising a hole into a room beyond.

Holding his camera to the “vent” the TikToker wrote: “A whole nother room hidden.”

The video has been viewed 1.6 million times since being posted on Friday.

Although there’s no evidence the TikToker was actually being watched or that anyone had been in the room the revelation was enough to set the user and his viewers on edge. “Y’all be careful out here!” he warns his followers.

“You just gave me the creeps” one said with another urging him to “please post that Airbnb so no one will go to it.”

He added in the comments that he didn’t hear anything until the middle of the night. “I was asleep and it was dark” he wrote. “I thought I was just hearing things until I looked the next morning.”

AKAM,Akamai,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9yYWNrc3BhY2UtY2Ru0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rackspace CDN review,"Rackspace CDN doesn't have the features we'd expect for this price but it's simple to set up and the Akamai network is fast and reliable.

Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.

Rackspace CDN is a speedy content delivery network (CDN) from the US cloud computing giant Rackspace Technology.

The service doesn't use Rackspace's own servers and instead is based on 230 Akamai edge nodes spread around the world. But we've no problem with that - Akamai is one of the biggest providers around and testing shows it's faster than most (more on that later.

Rackspace CDN doesn't have all the features you'll see with the top competition. There's no push CDN option for instance; it's pull only (push means you're able to choose which content populates the CDN servers while with pull the CDN fetches content as it's requested.) That makes the service easier to set up but it's also less flexible.

Want to try Rackspace CDN? Check out the website here

There's also no web application firewall no smart bot blocking no Fastly-like image optimization Brotli compression or... You get the idea.

This does at least keep the service relatively easy to set up. You don't have to plough through some huge support site as you might with Google Cloud CDN because just about everything you're able to do is managed by creating custom edge rules.

(Image credit: Rackspace)

Caching rules set expiry times for content for instance; Restriction rules allow or block access by referer client IP or region; Origin rules support pulling content from multiple sources to serve a single domain. There's not a lot to learn but wildcard support and the ability to combine multiple rules together mean there's a little more control than you might expect.

If you do need support it's available 24/7 via phone and email at no extra charge.

There's a service level guarantee too which promises 100% uptime (subject to the usual exclusions 'emergency maintenance' and so on) and gets you a credit on your fees if the CDN is unavailable for more than 12 minutes on one day. As you'd expect there's plenty of small print but it's still good to see any company make this kind of public commitment.

Pricing

Rackspace CDN pricing is based on traffic used and requests with charges varying between regions.

Traffic charges start at $0.10 per GB for North America Europe the Middle East and Africa. Australia Asia-Pacific countries and Japan are priced at $0.16 India is $0.19 and South America peaks at $0.27.

These figures apply for the first 10TB but fall as you use more and can be as low as $0.02 per GB for traffic above 5PB.

Rackspace charges for requests too but these won't add much to your bill (a million North American requests costs from $0.815) and free shared SSL also helps keep costs down.

These prices are broadly similar to big-name providers like Microsoft Azure CDN Amazon CloudFront and Google Cloud CDN but although Rackspace uses the enterprise-level Akamai network it only has a fraction of the features you'll get with the top competition.

If you're more interested in price than power there are savings to be had elsewhere. KeyCDN is priced from $0.04 per GB for traffic in North America and Europe for instance and Bunny starts at a tiny $0.01.

Still Rackspace does offer $100 of free credit to get you started. That's not quite as generous as some - Google hands over $300 just for signing up - but it's enough to begin exploring the system and to run some basic tests.

Setup

Signing up with Rackspace begins by handing over your email address name physical address phone number and more.

The company asks for credit card details but won't bill you until 30 days after you've set up the service. And as you get $100 credit for free you may still not pay anything until later.

Rackspace enables two-factor authentication by default requiring us to use an authentication app or use a code sent via SMS before we could log in for the first time. That's good news for security but might be a hassle for some. (And although there's an option to disable it from your account dashboard if you try this Rackspace simply enables it again when you next log in.)

The Rackspace dashboard launched with an overview of our account which as we'd just signed up was almost entirely blank. It didn't give us a direct link to the CDN console but after scanning the menus this was easy to find and we were there in a couple of clicks. (If you get lost just go to mycdn.rackspace.com.)

(Image credit: Rackspace)

Creating your CDN setup starts by providing a domain name origin and traffic type (HTTP or HTTPS.) Choose HTTPS and you can add a shared SAN ($36 a month) or Rackspace domain (xxxx.secure.raxcdn.com) certificate. There's no Let's Encrypt option though and the interface doesn't provide a way to use your own certificate.

(Image credit: Rackspace)

Update your domain's DNS with a CNAME record pointing to the CDN and there's not much more to do beyond set up a few custom rules.

This could be as simple as editing the default caching rule. By default this gives all cached objects a Time To Live (TTL) of one day but you can change this to any number of seconds minutes hours or days. Or for extra control add multiple rules and you're able to use paths and wildcards to set different TTLs (\support\*.jpg

ew\*.pdf.)

(Image credit: Rackspace)

A basic access control system enables restricting your content according to IP referer or geography. It's well mostly very limited. The Geography feature controls access by region rather than country for instance so you must either block all of Europe Middle East and Africa or allow it. But there's a small plus in that these restrictions also support paths and wildcards which means you can have multiple rules to block some content types and allow others.

If you need to know more check out the documentation. It's surprisingly basic for a company the size of Rackspace and occasional notes like 'Last updated on: 2016-01-17' make us wonder how accurate some pages might be but it's still a simple way to get a flavor of the service.

Performance

If you're curious about CDN performance then CDNPerf is an excellent place to start looking. The site collects more than 300 million CDN response times daily calculates worldwide and regional averages for 20 top companies and presents the results to everyone for free.

Rackspace CDN isn't currently included on CDNPerf's list unfortunately but Akamai is and as Rackspace uses Akamai's network its results are certainly worth a look.

The figures look reasonable too with Akamai rating 7th place out of 20 with a worldwide response time of 31ms. That beat Fastly JsDelivr G-Core Cloudflare StackPath and many others and was within milliseconds of the leaders (CloudFront and Azure CDN made equal third but were only fractionally faster at 28ms.)

The results you'll see could vary though (better or worse) depending on several factors: the geographic spread of your visitors your CMS or site design the Rackspace features you use and exactly what you do with them. If you really want to know what's possible there's no substitute for using the free credit to run some detailed tests of your own.

Final verdict

Rackspace offers an easy way to access Akamai's fast CDN network but it's short on features and far from cheap. Might be useful for simple sites which need an enterprise-level network but alternatives like CloudFront and Google Cloud CDN offer you far more power for a similar price.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Or follow us on Google News

2020 US electricity generation data are in from the US Energy Information Administration. Crunching the numbers renewable energy accounted for 20.6% of US electricity generation last year.

That was led by wind power which accounted for 8.3% of US electricity generation followed by hydropower at 7.2% and solar power at 3.3%.

As reported last month 77–80% of new US power capacity came from solar and wind power in 2020. However power plants typically last decades and it takes a long time for significant changes in electricity generation to show capacity trends.

If we look a little bit further back in the electricity generation data we can see that renewables are indeed growing their share of the electricity generation pie. In 2018 17.5% of electricity generation came from renewables — 6.5% from wind power 6.9% from hydropower and 2.2% from solar power.

If you did a simple extrapolation using that 2018–2020 timeframe and extending the trend to 2030 renewables would rise to 36.1% of US electricity generation by 2030 with wind rising to 17.3% hydropower to 8.7% and solar power to 8.8%. However that ignores the fact that solar power capacity has been growing increasingly faster in recent times. It’s more likely solar power would grow faster and the others perhaps slower. In fact it was just a few months ago that the International Energy Agency declared solar power the cheapest electricity in history and it was not long before that that Tesla rolled out record-low rooftop solar power prices. There is certainly an enormous amount of potential for greater solar power growth in the US in the coming decade.

Getting to the other side of the table the biggest loser from 2018 to 2020 in the electricity sector was coal which dropped from 27.3% of US electricity to 19.1% of US electricity. Actually coal was the only source with a notable drop in US electricity generation. Natural gas saw its share rise from 34.9% to 39.9% and nuclear saw its share rise slightly from 19.2% to 19.5%.

Chip in a few dollars a month to help support independent cleantech coverage that helps to accelerate the cleantech revolution!

If you follow climate science and air pollution news closely then you are probably already grumbling and grunting that 36.1% renewable energy share of US electricity generation in 2030 just doesn’t cut it. Indeed the transition to clean electricity needs to speed up. Perhaps the more significant renewable energy domination of new power capacity will help. Renewables grew from 18.3% in 2019 to 20.6% in 2020. A 2.3% increase in renewable energy share each year would at least lead to 43.6% renewable energy share by 2030.

We’ll see and CleanTechnica will certainly be tracking it as we have been for the past decade.

Regarding the month of December that is typically not the best month for renewables and in 2020 the share came to 20.1% a bit below the full-year total of 20.6%. Though wind and solar accounted for 11.6% in December just as they did for the year as a whole. And the year-over-year increases in the month of December were as follows:

Source December 2018 December 2019 December 2020 Renewables 17.0% 17.5% 20.1% Solar + Wind 8.5% 9.4% 11.6% Solar 1.4% 1.6% 2.3%

Do you have any additional thoughts on the December or 2020 electricity generation split in the United States or in the trends from 2018 through 2020? If you have any forecasts to share for the coming decade feel free to chime in down in the comments with those as well.

In the meantime if you don’t have solar power and can get it do so now! There are still great federal incentives as well as record-low prices.

If you’d like to install small-scale wind power or hydropower on your property sorry I can’t help you with that. 😀

To close this report here are interactive versions of the electricity generation charts:

As an addendum here’s our latest US power capacity report referenced above:

According to new data from the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) — data derived from Velocity Suite ABB Inc. and The C Three Group LLC — solar power and wind power accounted for 77.1% of new utility-scale power capacity in the United States in 2020 (chart above). Adding in a CleanTechnica estimate for rooftop solar power capacity that percentage rises to 80.1% (chart below).

Using the first group of figures (excluding rooftop or small-scale solar power) another 1% of power capacity came from other renewable energy sources and 21.8% came from natural gas.

Using the second group of figures (with a CleanTechnica estimate for rooftop/small-scale solar power) natural gas accounted for 18.9% of new US power capacity in 2020.

In the month of December 99% of new power capacity came from solar and wind power while natural gas contributed 1% of new power capacity across the country.

Considering politics for a moment recall that Donald Trump said he’d revive the coal industry. In actuality there was no stopping market forces and the coal industry continually collapsed under Trump including in the last year of his presidency. I will return to the long-term collapse of coal in another article. However while coal did continue to decline and renewable energy — most notably solar and wind — rose the growth of solar and wind power slowed under the Trump administration which had several fossil fuel industry insiders running major US departments — Department of Energy Environmental Protection Agency Department of Interior. Under President Biden solar and wind power are expected to grow faster again. The point is not to beat 80% of new power capacity coming from solar and wind as much as it is to increasingly retire fossil fuel power plants while using more and more electricity from renewable energy sources.

For a closer look at the power capacity additions that were connected to the grid at the end of 2020 these are the utility-scale power projects that went online in December 2020:

It's open to all Alphabet employees in the US and Canada including the temporary workers vendors and contractors who make up more than half the company's workforce.

With a membership of over 800 people the union represents less than 1% of Alphabet's current employees but the union's relatively small size hasn't stopped it from taking action and achieving results.

The AWU filed its first complaint with the National Labor Relations Board in early February on behalf of contractor Shannon Wait who was briefly suspended after complaining about conditions in the data center where she works. Less than a week after she filed the complaint Wait posted on Twitter that she'd been invited back to work and cited the incident as evidence that the Alphabet Workers Union has ""legitimate power.""

The union is the result of a lengthy struggle between activist employees and Alphabet leadership over how conflicts within the company are resolved and how Google's powerful technology is deployed. The disagreements stretch back to 2018 with the reveal of two secretive projects that some employees say conflicted with the company's ""don't be evil"" motto.

Project Maven had Google developing AI for drones that could have been weaponized and Project Dragonfly involved the development of a search engine for the Chinese market that would allow government censorship and tracking.

Watch this: The Alphabet Workers Union explained 09:31

""The biggest thing that concerned us was that people on that project [Dragonfly] had no idea they were on that project until the information about it got leaked"" said Chewy Shaw executive vice chair of the Alphabet Workers Union. ""It was similar with Project Maven.""

In both cases employees organized campaigns against the secretive projects. Later Google reportedly decided not to renew or launch either project.

Lessons from those struggles have found their way into the seven guiding values of the Alphabet Workers Union. One of those is transparency and another is the nourishing of a ""welcoming environment ... free from harassment bigotry discrimination and retaliation.""

Google has a policy against harassment and retaliation which it has publicly shared. ""To make sure that no complaint raised goes unheard at Google we give employees multiple channels to report concerns including anonymously and investigate all allegations of retaliation"" a Google spokesperson told CNET. ""Still some employees over the years have said that these policies don't always live up to their intended purpose.""

A key example concerns Google's handling of sexual misconduct claims against Andy Rubin a former Google executive and the creator of the Android mobile operating system. In October 2018 The New York Times reported that Google paid Rubin $90 million as part of his exit package when he left the company in 2014.

The revelation sparked the Google Walkout for Real Change during which about 20000 Google employees took to the streets in protest in November 2018. One of the organizers of that walkout former Google employee Meredith Whittaker told CNET in the above video that she believes it's ""the largest labor action in tech to date.""

Shaw said that the firing and departures of several outspoken employees including walkout organizers like Whittaker and the Thanksgiving Four (sometimes called the Fired Five) led some workers to conclude that forming a union was the best way to continue the ongoing struggles inside the company.

For now Shaw said the union is focused primarily on talking to the workers and isn't in a rush to get into regular sit-down meetings with company leadership. Shaw added however that the union would be happy to collaborate with company leadership to ""carve out space for workers to have a voice.""

Kara Silverstein director of people operations at Google told CNET that the company has worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for its workforce. ""Of course our employees have protected labor rights that we support"" she said. ""But as we've always done we'll continue engaging directly with all our employees.""

Alphabet isn't the only tech giant facing a growing labor movement. In Bessemer Alabama a group of Amazon workers are pursuing union ambitions of their own. Workers have until the end of March to cast their votes on whether the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union should represent them. The vote count is set begin on March 30.

""We need to organize tech because its power over our core social institutions is profound"" Whittaker said. ""I think the job now is to build [the Alphabet Workers Union] into something that's bold and capacious enough to fight for both the social justice demands and the bread-and-butter issues and to recognize that they're inseparable.""

A more popular way to snap up a bit of historic Baltimore is to spend nearly a quarter of that at Room & Board a furniture chain based in Minneapolis on a McKean media cabinet fashioned from roof-decking planks from the city’s razed houses.

The planks come from the Baltimore Wood Project which was established by the us Forest Service as a joint venture with local non-profits and the city to show how discarded wood can be kept out of landfill. A lot of wood waste which releases carbon dioxide and methane as it rots has little sale value but old buildings can yield precious salvage. The yellow pine that was used to build Baltimore’s rowhouses came from old-growth forests and is more dense and rot-resistant than faster-growing new lumber; a century of oxidation has given it a handsome dark patina. Furniture-makers and interior designers play up its provenance designing items around its joist- and plank-shaped pieces some of them pocked with nail holes and saw marks. They also advertise the fact that the venture trains formerly unemployed Baltimoreans many of them former prisoners in deconstruction and salvaging techniques.

Maryland’s biggest city once a booming factory and port town is fertile ground for such a project. Its rowhouses constructed in sprawling grids and quickly filled by immigrants from Europe during the brisk industrial growth of the late 19th and early 20th centuries began to empty in the second half of the 20th century as its shipping and steel industries declined. Since 1950 when Baltimore was America’s sixth-biggest city a third of its residents have left; today it is the 30th-biggest. In the poorest neighbourhoods more than half of adults are unemployed. Some 16000 buildings are officially designated empty; the true number may be twice that. Entire streets of still-handsome houses are boarded up. The city is planning to demolish thousands of them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY2hyb21lLXZzLWZpcmVmb3gtd2hpY2gtaW50ZXJuZXQtYnJvd3Nlci1pcy1iZXR0ZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chrome vs. Firefox: Which internet browser is better?,"Web browsers are our windows into the internet and yet many people just stick with the one they know. They rarely if ever try out alternatives that might make their lives easier. You may think Google Chrome is the only browser you'll ever need but Firefox might have something to say about that.

In one corner we've got Chrome — by far the most popular browser in the world and controlled by one of the planet's biggest tech companies since its launch in 2008. In the other corner is Firefox an open-source option run by the non-profit Mozilla since its inception in 2002. One browser only needed less than a decade to take over the world; the other has been your nerdiest friend's favorite for nearly 20 years.

Despite a Grand Canyon-esque gap in overall popularity between the two Chrome vs. Firefox is a more compelling fight than you may think. They're both excellent browsers but one of them narrowly comes out on top according to a few important metrics.

Performance and Usability

Firefox's overflow menu is a nifty little feature. Credit: mozilla

Chrome was able to overtake default browser options like Internet Explorer and Safari in just a few years partly because it's clean easy to use and overall pretty fast. It's got all the basic options we expect from browsers in 2021 from a straightforward bookmarks toolbar to the ability to open and even group way more tabs than you'll ever realistically get to before you decide to purge them and start over.

One thing you'll hear as a common criticism for Chrome is that it's a resource hog. Specifically Chrome can use a high amount of RAM (or memory) slowing your machine down if you have too many tabs open. Firefox is generally considered more ""lightweight"" in this regard though testing doesn't always bear that out. For instance Tom's Guide found that Firefox actually used up slightly more memory under stress testing earlier this year.

While that performance may vary from device to device and from situation to situation in my experience over the years Firefox is still a faster browser overall. Simple acts like opening webpages scrolling up and down and opening several new tabs at once can be performed without much (if any) noticeable slowdown. The same isn't always true of Chrome which can make it feel like your computer is mired in molasses from time to time.

Firefox has many of the same basic features as Chrome but it's more customizable in a way that puts it over the top in this category. One of my favorite UI features is the ""overflow menu"" which can house as few or as many extraneous buttons (like print or fullscreen) as you want without them cluttering up the basic toolbars. You can even choose which buttons will appear on a MacBook Pro's Touch Bar in case you're one of the roughly 27 people who likes the Touch Bar.

The winner: Firefox

Security

Back in the day I was a very dorky kid who cared way more about web browsers than a young teen should. The eternal struggle was convincing Internet Explorer users to switch to Firefox because at the time IE was notoriously akin to a screen door on a submarine when it came to keeping viruses out. A lot has changed since then but Firefox's positive security reputation hasn't.

Modern Firefox has something it calls Enhanced Tracking Protection which is a security setting enabled by default when you install the browser. This automatically blocks things like social media trackers which follow you around from website to website to serve you targeted ads on your favorite social networks. Firefox also makes it very easy to see which trackers and cookies are present on any website by clicking a shield icon next to the URL.

Chrome on the other hand lets you send a ""Do Not Track"" signal as you browse and it gives you some easy ways to check things like trackers and cookies just like Firefox. It's updated frequently and is almost certainly better from a security standpoint than IE was when it was still the market leader.

That said Chrome is made by Google. And Google's parent company Alphabet rakes in dozens of billions of dollars in online ad revenue every fiscal quarter. Put simply Google makes money by tracking your online movements and consequently that makes Chrome inherently less trustworthy than a browser run by a non-profit. Also since Firefox is open source it's not really possible for developers to hide nasty things in the code without someone eventually noticing. It's clear which one is the better bet on privacy and security even if neither of them are bad.

The winner: Firefox

Bonus Features

Chrome wins in terms of extra bells and whistles because it was built to take full advantage of Google's vast ecosystem of services. Simply log in with the Gmail account you almost certainly have and you get easy browser-wide access to Photos Drive Sheets Meet and anything else Google makes.

Even if I do prefer many aspects of Firefox I still have to use all of those Google services for work. So Chrome makes more sense as my day-to-day browser and it might for you too.

Aside from that Chrome's browser extension marketplace is well extensive. Whether you want to increase your kid's productivity or just watch Netflix with friends there's an extension for just about everything. Firefox is not exactly a slouch in this department either with a large extension marketplace of its own. It's just not quite as comprehensive.

It almost feels like cheating because Chrome's main advantage here is that Google has wormed its way into every aspect of our lives. Naturally a browser that unifies all of those services is going to be useful. And while you can sync things like browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome to Firefox the fact that you have to make a Firefox account and sync it to multiple devices before doing so means it's not nearly as seamless as Chrome's setup process.

The winner: Chrome

The Verdict

Firefox won two out of the three categories that matter most (to me at least) meaning it's hard to call it anything other than a winner in this competition. And yet as I said earlier I don't use it on a daily basis because Chrome's advantages are extremely convenient.

That said if I wasn't held hostage by Google's ecosystem I'd go all in on Firefox in a heartbeat. It's just cleaner and quicker because it isn't bogged down by the need to be everything for everyone. It's also not run by a megacorporation with creepy tendencies which is always a plus. At the end of the day though Chrome is going to be just fine for most people.

I totally understand if you opt to stick with it. Just give something else a try every now and then.

The winner: Firefox (but just barely)

It's got all the basic options we expect from browsers in 2021 from a straightforward bookmarks toolbar to the ability to open and even group way more tabs than you'll ever realistically get to before you decide to purge them and start over.

One thing you'll hear as a common criticism for Chrome is that it's a resource hog. Specifically Chrome can use a high amount of RAM (or memory) slowing your machine down if you have too many tabs open. Firefox is generally considered more ""lightweight"" in this regard though testing doesn't always bear that out. For instance Tom's Guide found that Firefox actually used up slightly more memory under stress testing earlier this year.

While that performance may vary from device to device and from situation to situation in my experience over the years Firefox is still a faster browser overall. Simple acts like opening webpages scrolling up and down and opening several new tabs at once can be performed without much (if any) noticeable slowdown. The same isn't always true of Chrome which can make it feel like your computer is mired in molasses from time to time.

Firefox has many of the same basic features as Chrome but it's more customizable in a way that puts it over the top in this category. One of my favorite UI features is the ""overflow menu"" which can house as few or as many extraneous buttons (like print or fullscreen) as you want without them cluttering up the basic toolbars. You can even choose which buttons will appear on a MacBook Pro's Touch Bar in case you're one of the roughly 27 people who likes the Touch Bar.

The winner: Firefox

Security

Back in the day I was a very dorky kid who cared way more about web browsers than a young teen should. The eternal struggle was convincing Internet Explorer users to switch to Firefox because at the time IE was notoriously akin to a screen door on a submarine when it came to keeping viruses out. A lot has changed since then but Firefox's positive security reputation hasn't.

Modern Firefox has something it calls Enhanced Tracking Protection which is a security setting enabled by default when you install the browser. This automatically blocks things like social media trackers which follow you around from website to website to serve you targeted ads on your favorite social networks. Firefox also makes it very easy to see which trackers and cookies are present on any website by clicking a shield icon next to the URL.

Chrome on the other hand lets you send a ""Do Not Track"" signal as you browse and it gives you some easy ways to check things like trackers and cookies just like Firefox. It's updated frequently and is almost certainly better from a security standpoint than IE was when it was still the market leader.

That said Chrome is made by Google. And Google's parent company Alphabet rakes in dozens of billions of dollars in online ad revenue every fiscal quarter. Put simply Google makes money by tracking your online movements and consequently that makes Chrome inherently less trustworthy than a browser run by a non-profit. Also since Firefox is open source it's not really possible for developers to hide nasty things in the code without someone eventually noticing. It's clear which one is the better bet on privacy and security even if neither of them are bad.

The winner: Firefox

Bonus Features

Chrome wins in terms of extra bells and whistles because it was built to take full advantage of Google's vast ecosystem of services. Simply log in with the Gmail account you almost certainly have and you get easy browser-wide access to Photos Drive Sheets Meet and anything else Google makes.

Even if I do prefer many aspects of Firefox I still have to use all of those Google services for work. So Chrome makes more sense as my day-to-day browser and it might for you too.

Aside from that Chrome's browser extension marketplace is well extensive. Whether you want to increase your kid's productivity or just watch Netflix with friends there's an extension for just about everything. Firefox is not exactly a slouch in this department either with a large extension marketplace of its own. It's just not quite as comprehensive.

It almost feels like cheating because Chrome's main advantage here is that Google has wormed its way into every aspect of our lives. Naturally a browser that unifies all of those services is going to be useful. And while you can sync things like browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome to Firefox the fact that you have to make a Firefox account and sync it to multiple devices before doing so means it's not nearly as seamless as Chrome's setup process.

The winner: Chrome

The Verdict

Firefox won two out of the three categories that matter most (to me at least) meaning it's hard to call it anything other than a winner in this competition. And yet as I said earlier I don't use it on a daily basis because Chrome's advantages are extremely convenient.

That said if I wasn't held hostage by Google's ecosystem I'd go all in on Firefox in a heartbeat. It's just cleaner and quicker because it isn't bogged down by the need to be everything for everyone. It's also not run by a megacorporation with creepy tendencies which is always a plus. At the end of the day though Chrome is going to be just fine for most people.

I totally understand if you opt to stick with it. Just give something else a try every now and then.

The winner: Firefox (but just barely)

UNOX an international company headquartered in Italy designs and manufactures professional ovens for food service operators. It uses IoT technologies to provide customers with data information and artificial intelligence–generated ideas. Before it migrated to AWS UNOX’s technology infrastructure was all on premises or on other cloud providers which gave rise to several issues. Its on-premises contact center didn’t provide adequate data or transparency and didn’t provide local phone numbers for businesses operating in other countries. UNOX also wanted to innovate faster to become a leader in data-driven cooking technology but its cloud infrastructure didn’t provide the scalability or insight into customer needs necessary to achieve this goal. In 2018 Ballarin realized AWS could provide the key to solving these challenges when he saw a presentation about how to establish a contact center in hours using Amazon Connect. “It really impressed me and gave UNOX the motivation to pursue AWS” he says.



Planning the Future of Cooking on AWS

In 2019 UNOX used AWS solutions to revamp its customer service call center. It needed a scalable solution that didn’t require agents to constantly manage phones. Amazon Connect—which provides tools for task management real-time and historical analytics and skills-based routing all with pay-as-you-go pricing—fit the bill. UNOX launched a pilot program in France creating the contact flows in a few weeks. When it saw immediate benefits it expanded the program to its sales and after-sales teams and then to other European branches. Soon it began to use the Salesforce integration provided by AWS along with the free integration managed by AWS developers enabling classic computer telephony integration workflows like pop-up screens. After experiencing the benefits of Amazon Connect UNOX saw the potential in expanding its use of AWS. It decided to migrate its business-critical SAP HANA infrastructure which was entirely on premises to the AWS Europe (Milan) Region. UNOX completed the configuration of its SAP HANA infrastructure in just 6 hours using AWS Launch Wizard which offers a guided way of sizing configuring and deploying AWS resources for third-party applications. It finished the migration in 1 week.

Training: The Key to High Performance

UNOX then used Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)—an object storage service built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere—to migrate its corporate website and product configurator. “AWS helped train our developers which impacted their performance because they can now deliver more on each project faster” says Ballarin. UNOX quickly built up steam as a leader in data-driven cooking and smart ovens by using AWS IoT services. “IoT cooking brings a lot of economic value to the customer: the intelligent technologies save energy while delivering a reliable and predictable cooking result and the ovens don’t have to be supervised” says Matteo Lora digital experience team leader at UNOX. The company used AWS IoT services and AWS Lambda a serverless compute service that lets users run code without provisioning or managing servers to develop a new web application for domestic kitchen ovens within a matter of weeks. UNOX also used IoT services to develop three apps that help customers take advantage of more oven features monitor and remotely program ovens from anywhere and set up cooking programs to drastically streamline production. UNOX is currently deploying a new streaming application built on multiple AWS services including Amazon Interactive Video Service (Amazon IVS) a managed live streaming solution that is quick and simple to set up and ideal for creating interactive video experiences and Amazon CloudFront a fast content delivery network service that securely delivers data videos applications and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds. The application will deliver content to UNOX sales associates and business partners as well as cooking courses to customers worldwide. Going all in on AWS has helped UNOX celebrate multiple successes including increased scalability internal cost savings increased cost efficiency for its customers time optimization and agility. In terms of its original goal—improving its contact center—UNOX has dramatically improved its service level which it defines as the number of calls it can remove from the queue within 90 seconds. On AWS UNOX now meets 95 percent of service-level requests from customers whereas it previously met 67 percent.

Developing New Ideas Faster

UNOX has many plans to use AWS services further and integrate new AWS technologies into its products. It’s in research and development for progressive machine learning that incorporates Amazon SageMaker a comprehensive machine learning service. UNOX is considering moving its fluid dynamic tests of cooking effectiveness within ovens onto AWS infrastructure for faster performance simulation. Ballarin suggests other business leaders seeking faster innovation may also benefit from AWS services. “You don’t have to spend a lot of money before testing the reliability and effectiveness of the solution” he says. “You can adapt to a style of workflow and research and development to create more effective products and faster interactions that lead to more effective business results.” Looking back on UNOX’s list of innovations in 2019 and 2020 Ballarin gives AWS credit for helping his company stay ahead of today’s customers’ needs. “Using AWS has been a real game changer for us in terms of product innovation and process digitalization enabling us to shorten our time to market and increase operational efficiency while maintaining a data-driven focus” he says. “The wide spectrum of AWS technologies that are constantly improving and pushing customer success to new levels plays a central role in our mission to expand our business at scale.” To learn more visit aws.amazon.com/connect.

A campaign against a union is an assault on individuals and a war on the truth. The only way to bust a union is to lie distort manipulate threaten and always attack.” Amazon’s ongoing anti-union campaign in Bessemer Alabama where 5800 workers are voting by mail on whether or not to join the Retail Wholesale and Department Store (RWDSU) union provides a stark illustration of Levitt’s statement.

After hiring one of the country’s largest and most expensive union-avoidance law firms Morgan Lewis Amazon is now paying almost $10000 per day plus expenses to three anti-union consultants: Russell Brown Rebecca Smith and Bill Monroe. Among other campaigns Brown and Smith have previously run controversial high-profile anti-union drives at Mission Hospital in Asheville North Carolina in 2020 at which nurses preparing for the COVID-19 pandemic were subjected to a “relentless” anti-union campaign; and in 2017 at Kumho Tires in Macon Georgia where the National Labor Relations Board found that the company committed “numerous and egregious” unlawful anti-union actions. When Amazon’s anti-union campaign is over the e-commerce behemoth will almost certainly have paid millions of dollars to its union avoidance consultants and law firm in order to prevent its Alabama-based employees from choosing a union.

The PRO Act Would Rein in Anti-Union Consultants

The relentless consultant-driven anti-union campaign at Amazon provides a compelling case demonstrating the need for the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act the labor movement’s main legislative priority for the Biden administration which was passed by the House of Representatives in February 2020. The PRO Act would almost certainly pass again in the House and President Biden supports it but in common with most previous efforts to strengthen the nation’s labor laws it remains a longshot in the Senate. Several provisions of the PRO Act would restrict corporations’ ability to conduct no-holds-barred anti-union campaigns: It would prohibit mandatory “captive audience” anti-union meetings; it would limit employers’ ability to delay the union certification process (and thus extend the anti-union campaign); and it would require that employers and consultants report their financial arrangement to the Department of Labor even if the consultants avoid face-to-face contact with employees.

In 2019 while writing for the right-wing Competitive Enterprise Institute in opposition to the PRO Act Amazon’s main consultant Russell Brown offered a detailed insight into what he does during the course of his anti-union campaigns. Brown’s campaign description mirrors closely his anti-union actions at the Amazon facility in Bessemer. Moreover he shows how the principle role of anti-union consultants is to mislead and confuse employees not as he claims to educate and enlighten them.

Captivating Workers

Adopting a standard anti-union talking point Brown begins by complaining that by limiting the role of anti-union consultants like himself the PRO Act would “make it more difficult for workers to make an informed decision regarding unionization.” He blames unions seeking to “demonize consultants” by calling them “union busters” and making it “sound like companies are denying employees free will by having meetings to educate employees on union representation referring to them as ‘captive audience meetings.’” Brown complains that under the PRO Act’s prohibition of captive meetings “consultants educating employees will be unlawful.” In response to the question of what anti-union consultants tell employees Brown says “the answer is a lot.”

Brown has written against state-level bills in Connecticut and Oregon that sought to prohibit captive audience anti-union meetings calling them “an end run to squelch employers from educating their employees on what it means to be in a union and how collective bargaining really works.” In reality captive audience meetings and similar “forced listening sessions” are outlawed in most developed democracies and have repeatedly been criticized by leading human rights organizations including Human Rights Watch.

Brown says that a “typical curriculum” during an anti-union campaign includes captive meetings on the topics below remarkably similar to the playbook he is using at Amazon and which is documented on Amazon’s slick anti-union website DoItWithoutDues.com. Several press reports cite Brown and Smith stressing similar themes in captive audience meetings — so-called worker “education sessions” — during the anti-union campaign at Bessemer.

Brown’s first meetings are with frontline managers and supervisors because he claims U.S. labor law “greatly restricts” what employers can say or do. For decades consultants have used supervisors and frontline managers to spearhead their anti-union campaigns. Brown complains that managers are not allowed to say that the business “may have to shut down” if the union comes in. In reality the National Labor Relations Act provides employers much greater freedom to oppose unions than does labor law in almost any other advanced democracy.

Second Brown meets with bargaining unit employees and discusses “strikes and the difficult procedures required to decertify a union.” Consultant anti-union campaigns always highlight strikes — which are increasingly rare in the U.S. in recent decades with just seven major work stoppages in 2020 — and the alleged difficulty of getting rid of an unwanted union even though survey evidence indicates that the overwhelming majority of union workers approve of their unions. Both themes are also highlighted on Amazon’s anti-union website. Moreover a majority of workers nationally — the highest level of non-union workers in over four decades — would choose unions if given a free and fair choice while 65 percent of the public approve of unions the highest levels in almost two decades. Thus the main problem facing U.S. workers is not as Brown suggests getting rid of unwanted unions but an inability to get unions that employees want but cannot get in the face of intense employer opposition and weak legal protections.

Third Brown holds captive meetings on collective bargaining telling workers that employees “are not signatories to the contract” which is an agreement between management and the union. Consultants tell employees that unions are external “third-parties” pursuing their own self-interest rather than organizations that represent the workers. Amazon’s anti-union website also portrays the union as an outside “business” that workers “don’t know” despite the fact RWDSU has a long and deep history of representing Black workers in the South — predominantly Black poultry workers in Alabama among others — and supporting civil rights and racial justice causes.

Fourth Brown holds captive meetings that bash unions as “top-down organizations” which have “exorbitant salaries and lavish expenses” even though union financial reports are publicly and easily available through the website of the Department of Labor — as demonstrated on Amazon’s own anti-union website; and he tells employees that unions support political causes that they “may not agree with” even though conservative organizations have long stressed that employees can opt out of political contributions. Moreover in right-to-work (RTW) states such as Alabama — which has been a RTW state since 1953 — no employee can ever be required to pay union dues. The anti-union campaign at Bessemer — including Amazon’s anti-union website — has repeatedly stressed that employees would pay union dues even though these could never be compulsory.

Fifth Brown holds captive meetings on unions and job security which stress how layoffs in unionized workplaces are generally done according to seniority — “great if you have been there the longest bad if not” — at which “the point is there is no consideration of merit.” In reality unionized workers generally enjoy much greater job security than their non-union counterparts as reflected in job losses during the COVID-19 pandemic; they also enjoy higher pay and significantly superior health and pension benefits including access to paid sick leave.

Brown concludes that employers “know that a union representation election involves a major business decision that will forever impact” their companies. “For that reason” he argues “we submit that it is not only the right for employers to educate the employees it is their duty.” In recent years strident anti-union advocates have increasingly argued this point — that employers not only have a right to oppose unionization but a duty to speak out against unions and collective bargaining. Amazon apparently agrees with this extreme position.

President Biden Condemns Amazon’s Anti-Unionism

Recently President Biden released a video stating that

Workers in Alabama — and all across America — are voting on whether to organize a union in their workplace. It’s a vitally important choice — one that should be made without intimidation or threats by employers. Every worker should have a free and fair choice to join a union.

This statement is hugely significant. Prior to this Biden had assiduously avoided any direct comment on the Amazon dispute. He had already spoken out strongly in favor of unions and collective bargaining generally and recently a White House spokesperson had stated that “President Biden has urged employers not to run anti-union campaigns or interfere with organizing and bargaining.” It is understandable that Biden is reluctant to “take sides” in an ongoing union campaign that his National Labor Relations Board may ultimately be asked to adjudicate. But it’s an enormous deal that Biden spoke out unambiguously against Amazon’s relentless and disingenuous anti-union campaign. Indeed it may be the most pro-union statement ever by a sitting president. To find anything comparable one really needs to go back to the 1930s when John L. Lewis president of the newly formed Congress of Industrial Organizations adopted the slogan “The President Wants You to Join a Union” to help organize the auto and steel industries. The difference is FDR never actually said this; it was apocryphal though believable whereas Biden actually said it. What a difference an election makes!

Expensive and aggressive corporate anti-union campaigns such as Amazon’s at Bessemer are in the words of Marty Levitt built on deceit and run by bullies. The battle between the RWDSU and Amazon at Bessemer is a real “David vs. Goliath” fight. But as in the original Biblical story David sometimes wins.

Amazon plans to set up more delivery stations in New York City to power the last-mile of its order process and provide faster deliveries to customers the company said.

The tech giant will launch ten delivery stations in the Big Apple throughout 2021 and beyond two of which are now operational an Amazon spokesperson confirmed to Insider in an email this week.

The new sites will be located in the Bronx Brooklyn and Queens.

Amazon has five operational delivery stations across the five boroughs including two in the Bronx one in Brooklyn one on Staten Island and one in Queens according to the spokesperson. It also has two operational delivery stations on Long Island and a sortation center and a fulfillment center on Staten Island.

As online shopping surged during the pandemic with people staying home to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus Amazon went looking for warehouse space to expand its footprint in New York City the country's biggest market the New York Times reported this week. None of Amazon's competitors including Walmart and Target have a warehouse in the city the Times said.

It is at least 22% more cost-effective to deliver to New Yorkers from a city-based facility than from a facility located in New Jersey where packages typically came from according to a report by Deloitte.

Amazon has had a fraught history trying to set up in New York City. In 2018 Amazon announced it would build part of its second headquarter in New York saying the project would provide 25000 full-time jobs and a $2.5 billion investment in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens. The company would have received an estimated $3 billion in tax incentives.

However the tech company faced backlash from local politicians New Yorkers and labor union representatives who argued that the project could increase rents overcrowd schools and congest the subway system.

Amazon canceled plans to build the HQ2 in February 2019 citing local opposition.

Later in 2019 Amazon confirmed to Insider that it signed a lease for a new 335000-foot office in New York City that is set to open in 2021. Located in the Hudson Yards area the new office will employ over 1500 people Amazon said.

Dallas will actually have flights to more international destinations this month than it did two years ago (56 vs. 52) thanks to American Airlines destinations that have been added to Mexico and Central America offsetting losses in long haul.

But the flight that’s most striking to me is the addition of Dallas – Fort Worth to Nagoya Japan. It’s striking to see a new destination in Asia a previously unflown route and while Japan is closed to most U.S. visitors. And it’s surprising to see the flight so full:

Now it only operates twice from Dallas to Nagoya and operates just one time from Nagoya to Dallas according to Cirium Diio Mi data. And it doesn’t operate at all come April.

The only time I can remember a mainland U.S. – Nagoya flight is United’s old San Francisco – Nagoya flight which was driven by Toyota cargo. If you couldn’t find award space between the U.S. and Asia you could always book half the passenger cabin in business or first class on points on this flight which was generally empty in the passenger cabin full in the cargo hold.

So my first thought was that the DFW – Nagoya flight was driven by cargo but the flights look to be fairly full with passengers which leads me to think this is driven more by a specific group of passengers and event though I do not know who or what.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN1cmFjYW9jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL3Bvc3QvbWFpbi9jYXAtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy01MHRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LW9mLWFtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWNvbm5lY3RpbmctY3VyYWNhby13aXRoLXRoZS11cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CAP celebrates 50th Anniversary of American Airlines connecting Curaçao with the US!,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.curacaochronicle.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The Electric Highway Coalition – made up of Southern Company American Electric Power Dominion Energy Duke Energy Entergy Corporation and the Tennessee Valley Authority – wants to collaborate on a network of DC fast chargers from the Atlantic Coast through the Midwest and South and into the Gulf Coast and Central Plains regions.

Southern Company and the others are each taking steps to provide EV charging solutions within their system service territories. The announcement represents an unprecedented combined effort to offer EV drivers convenient charging across different utility footprints and allow uninterrupted travel.

The Edison Electric Institute estimates 18 million EVs will be on U.S. roads by 2030. While many drivers recognize the benefits of driving an EV such as the ease of low-cost home charging some have expressed concern with the availability of charging stations during long road trips. With collaborative efforts like the Electric Highway Coalition energy companies demonstrate to customers that EVs are a smart choice regardless of distance.

The coalition will provide drivers with effective efficient and convenient charging options to enable long-distance electric travel. Sites along major highways with easy access and amenities for travelers are being considered as coalition members work to determine final charging station locations. DC fast chargers can get drivers back on the road in 20-30 minutes.

“At Southern Company we are committed to being a leader in building a clean and sustainable energy future for our customers and that includes continuing to increase the reach of electric transportation for more and more drivers” said Chris Cummiskey executive vice president chief commercial officer and customer solutions officer at Southern Company. “By increasing the number of EV fast-charging stations across our footprint we are providing drivers with additional transportation options that are reliable efficient and more convenient while helping reduce carbon emissions for the benefit of our communities we serve.”

Being a founding member of the Electric Highway Coalition is another part of Southern Company’s larger focus on electrification of the transportation industry and commitment to sustainability and clean energy. Along with the systemwide goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 last year Southern Company announced an internal fleet electrification goal where the company plans by 2030 to convert to electric 50% of its electric companies’ fleet vehicles in the auto/SUV/minivan forklift and ATV/cart/miscellaneous equipment segments.

The Electric Highway Coalition welcomes interested utilities to join as it seeks to extend the reach of network. Additionally its members support and look forward to working with other regional utility transportation corridor electrification initiatives.

As the temperature dropped below freezing Texas' power sources — largely reliant on fossil fuels like natural gas and coal — failed and left millions without power. The fallout was devastating with people resorting to burning their furniture and running their cars in their garages just to stay warm. At least 80 people died as a result of the storm.

It's easy to write Texas off as an outlier. The state went out of its way to almost entirely isolate itself from the rest of the country largely choosing not to participate in the national energy grid in order to avoid federal regulation — the same regulation that very well may have mandated the type of weatherization requirements that could have kept Texas' power plants operational through those unexpectedly harsh winter weeks. For years state officials ignored warnings from experts that predicted its grid would grind to a halt if hit with extreme weather. In the lead-up and the immediate aftermath of the natural disaster Texas’ leaders leaned into advice from fringe figures and spouted falsehoods blaming renewable energy to cover up for their own failings.

The truth is despite some unique circumstances Texas is far from unique when it comes to its insufficient energy infrastructure. The United States as a whole has largely failed to keep its grid up to date. For two decades now the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) has given the country a D+ grade for its energy infrastructure (though it just recently ticked up to a C-) stemming largely from the fact that the grid is old and languishing and very little is being done to update it. Most of the country's ""modern"" grid — including many of its transmission and distribution lines and many power plants — was built in the 1950s and 1960s with a 35- to 80-year life expectancy. That means much of it should have been retired and replaced by now. Instead we're relying on that infrastructure even more than we were when the grid was originally built. The country's population has increased since then and most people use more energy especially in a society that’s increasingly reliant on electricity-fueled technology.

The breakdown of the critical infrastructure has been bad though it often goes unnoticed or unconsidered because the failures rarely happen in as massive and sustained a way as they just did in Texas. It’s common for Americans to experience blackouts. According to 2019 U.S. Energy Information Administration data the average energy customer loses power at least once a year adding up to about five hours of interruptions. While this is normal in America these types of outages don’t happen everywhere. According to data collected by the Galvin Electricity Initiative U.S. residents spent more time per year with the lights out due to grid failure than people in any other industrial nation experiencing anywhere from two-to-ten times as many minutes without power.

Certainly part of the outdated nature of the grid comes from reliance on natural gas and other dirty-burning fuel. “Texas failed to prepare for the extreme weather we all know is coming as a result of our changing climate"" Colin Leyden director of legislative and regulatory affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund tells Mic noting that ""freezing natural gas and coal plants were the major problems"" responsible for the state’s failures. While Republican politicians tried pointing to frozen wind turbines as the issue (despite the fact that those failures only accounted for 13% of outages) the reality is that natural gas pipelines which were not sufficiently weatherized shut down in Texas when faced with the cold. More than two-thirds of all energy generated in Texas comes from fossil fuels; and the rest of the country is just as reliant on these dirty-burning fuel sources. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration more than 62 percent of all electricity generation in the country comes from natural gas coal and oil.

Michael Lee CEO of Octopus Energy US a sustainable energy firm says overreliance on natural gas puts the grid at risk. ""Fossil-fuel generators are even more susceptible to extremely cold temperatures than renewable generators"" he tells Mic. ""Coal piles freeze natural gas wellheads freeze natural gas is diverted to space heating and thermal power plant equipment fails.""

By contrast he says a diverse mix of clean energy sources and reliable energy storage would have stood a better chance of weathering the storm. ""These resources have fewer mechanical parts to freeze or fail if properly weatherized"" he explains. ""They also don’t rely on delivered fuels that can freeze or become inaccessible during a crisis. In fact if there’s one thing we can count on every day it’s that somewhere the sun will be shining and the wind will be blowing.""

While continuing to use fossil fuels puts the grid at risk it's the burning of those fuel sources over the last century and the resulting emissions hanging around in our atmosphere that have created the biggest threat to our energy infrastructure in the first place. We know that climate change has led to a significant increase in extreme weather events and devastating natural disasters. Those disasters in turn have put a massive strain on the country’s power grid. A 2014 analysis by Massoud Amin director of the Technological Leadership Institute at the University of Minnesota found that blackouts were becoming an increasingly common occurrence across the country with extreme weather events among the leading causes. Amin found that while weather once accounted for 17-to-21 percent of major outages that increased to between 68 and 73 percent at the start of the last decade. A study published by Climate Central reported similar findings noting that blackouts were 10 times more common in 2014 than they were in 1980 and weather-related outages more than doubled over the course of the last decade.

More recently we’ve seen this play out in the aftermath of disasters like the devastating wildfires in California the powerful hurricanes that pummeled the east coast and yes the snowstorm in Texas — all of which resulted in power outages or shortages.

William Hogan Raymond Plank Research Professor of Global Energy Policy at Harvard University tells Mic that the Texas cold front ""has been described as a one-in-100 year event"" or a storm that theoretically has a one-in-100 chance of happening in any given year. He noted that if that’s the case it may have been too significant an event for any planning to completely withstand. He explains that most industry planning accounts for “ten-year” events which typically result in outages of just hours not several days.

The problem though is the possibility that these so-called one-in-100 storms (also referred to as 100-year storms) may now occur more often thanks to climate change. Multiple studies have suggested that this will be the case. If extreme weather conditions continue to worsen the U.S. energy infrastructure will require even more weatherization and greater efforts to keep systems operational. ""If we don’t systematically address these challenges they’re going to continue to bloom into events like we’ve just seen"" Ted Kury Director of Energy Studies at University of Florida's Public Utility Research Center tells Mic.

The Biden administration has promised a massive overhaul to the country's energy infrastructure: The proposed $2 trillion investment over the course of four years is focused on the goal of ending all carbon emissions from power plants by 2035 and rebuilding the nation's grid in a way that will insulate it from extreme weather. If successful this would be a long-overdue initiative that would not only address the crumbling state of the dated infrastructure but also upend the reliance on fuel sources that are actively harming the planet. It should have been done years ago but better late than never.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAzLzA3L25ldy1lcmNvdC1ib2FyZC1tZW1iZXItc2F5cy1oZS13YW50cy1hc2stcXVlc3Rpb25zLW5vdC1wbGFjZS1ibGFtZS80NjIyMjUxMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ex-ERCOT CEO rejoins agency as board member says he wants to ask questions not place blame,"A former chief executive of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas which manages most of the state's power grid is rejoining the agency as it tries to restore its reputation after one of the state's worst weather disasters.

Bob Kahn who has been selected to serve on the council's board said his goal is to ask questions about the widespread power outages that crippled Texas in February during a record-setting freeze across the state.

""I think we need to gather as many facts as we can to figure out what happened; my goal is not to place blame on anyone"" Kahn said.

""My goal is to find out what plants ran what didn't run and why they didn't run"" he said.

The position on the board is unpaid said Kahn 68 who is currently the general manager of the Texas Municipal Power Agency. He is also a board member with the Texas Public Power Association which represents 72 municipal utilities in the state.

Kahn who has been TMPA general manager since 2012 declined to say what his salary is at the agency.

He will replace Austin Energy General Manager Jackie Sargent on the ERCOT board as a representative of municipal utilities. Sargent has resigned from the board.

The historic widespread freeze in mid-February fueled high demand for power straining the grid and prompted ERCOT to order utilities to initiate outages. The move paralyzed the state's power supply and left more than 4 million people without power.

State grid operators also reported that generators and natural gas pipelines froze. Some people went days without power including Kahn who lives in Austin.

Kahn said he and his wife had no power for 58 hours.

""It got down to 40 degrees in our house"" he said. To keep warm he and his wife put on extra clothes and burned wood in their fireplace.

Kahn said he wants to reduce the risk of the massive power outages ever happening again.

""The big question is how much will it cost and who will pay for it?"" he said.

Kahn was the ERCOT chief executive officer from 2007 to 2009 and previously served on the ERCOT board from 2002 to 2006. He said the winterization of power plants never came up as an issue while he was ERCOT CEO.

People have asked why the power plants in the northern part of the United States don't shut down during extreme winter weather as the power plants did in Texas he said.

""It's because they build plants inside a building; they are enclosed because it gets really cold"" Kahn said. ""Here it gets hot and we don’t want enclosed buildings when it's hot because then we have to take walls down so the unit will run efficiently.""

Kahn said he has been working in the energy industry since 1983 including at the Public Utility Commission at Austin Energy and in private practice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJlc3RpbmdlbmdpbmVlcmluZy5jb20vdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24vY2hpbmVzZS1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXJzLXBvaXNlZC10by10YWtlLW92ZXItdGhlLW1hcmtldNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Beware Chinese Electric Cars Are Poised to Take Over the Market,"Back in the 1970s and 1980s Japanese-made cars such as those from Honda and Nissan disrupted the American auto market.

American Express opened a new Centurion Lounge at Denver International Airport in February the latest in the financial services company's growing network of 14 airport lounges that will soon include locations in London and Washington DC.

The Denver location covers more than 14000 square feet above the airport's Concourse C and is Amex's second-largest lounge behind the newly-opened John F. Kennedy International Airport outpost. Its opening comes as increased spring and summer travel appears more likely thanks to a faster than anticipated vaccine rollout.

A physicist’s financial experiment netted him $300000 From Credit-Card Rewards now the IRS wants its cut.

Konstantin Anikeev an experimental physicist assembled everything he needed for an inquiry far outside his field. His materials included American Express cards the government’s view that credit-card rewards aren’t income and his own willingness to spend time buying gift cards and money orders. He pulled the concept from personal-finance websites: Exploit the difference between unlimited 5% rewards and lower fees on gift cards and money orders.

Methodology

American Express card offered unlimited 5% rewards at grocery stores and pharmacies after he had spent $6500.

Use reward cards to buy $1 coins from the US Mint. The transaction has no shipping charges.

Used gift cards to buy money orders then used the money orders to make deposits in his bank account then used that money to pay his credit-card bill.

In a $500 transaction the 5% rewards would yield $25—more than enough to cover gift-card fees of about $5 and the $1 fee on the money order.

The IRS got interested in millions of these transactions by one person. The IRS took Anikeev to court where he was largely vindicated.

Tax Court vs Konstantin Anikeev

In US Tax Court vs Konstantin Anikeev the court issued a split decision.

The court affirmed that credit-card rewards are usually nontaxable rebates. Buying anything for $100 and getting $5 back is akin to paying $95 in the first place.

Most of Anikeev’s transactions were of that nature.

Then it gets murky. The judge also ruled rewards earned on purchases of money orders or reloading debit cards are taxable.

Anikeev will owe some back taxes on a portion of that $300000.

New Rules from American Express

American Express has rules on cash equivalents and will undoubtedly strengthen them.

The IRS will likely make rules changes as well.

For now I cheer Anikeev for his ingenuity.

His lawyer said “He’s a very mathematical brilliant person. And this was just something he thought was fun.“

It also happens to be the name of a Mexican restaurant in Denver International Airport. My bottom line: friendly service but avoid the tacos.

Cantina Grill Denver Airport (DEN) Review

I was hungry and the pre-packaged snack selections in the United Club simply were not enough to satisfy my hunger. My visit was last month just after the American Express Centurion Lounge opened up. Why didn’t I go there? The lounge closes at 3:00PM.

Cantina Grill has two locations at Denver Airport one in the Jeppesen Terminal prior to security and the other on the mezzanine level of the B Gates (United terminal). I tried the latter location at abound 5:30pm. It had been a long time since I dined indoors (still not allowed in California) and I quite enjoyed sitting down inside to eat. The restaurant also has a to-go area. Since I was alone I sat at the bar.

You can review the full menu here. I ordered three “street” tacos for $12.50 opting to try one pork one chicken and one beef.

The waitress was very friendly and attentive. She came over to take my order moments after sitting down and checked on me often even though I just ordered water to drink.

It took only five minutes for the tacos to arrive…oh how anemic they looked. They were on corn tortillas which was fine but only one was used…proper street tacos use two tortillas precisely for what happened next: they break when you pick them up if you use just one.

I ended up eating them with my fork and knife which was not such a bad thing. What was bad was the beef and chicken lacked flavor…I did not taste spices of any kind. The pork taco was the best one but still a far cry from what you can expect from an authentic taqueria.

And these were tiny. I was left still very hungry and wishing that I had gone downstairs for some falafel instead at the Mediterranean restaurant in the food court.

CONCLUSION

Well it was worth a try….

Cantina Grill is probably best used as an actual cantina and not as a restaurant. Service was friendly but the tacos are not recommended.

In line with the government’s plans all clubs are hopeful of being able to open stadia at full capacity from the start of the 2021/22 season and if this is the case Albion fans will benefit from more ticket availability at the Amex from August when a newly increased capacity of 31800 seats will be available.

The latest Amex stadium expansion plans which include permission being granted for an exciting new external fan zone area including kiosks external toilets and a giant screen on Station Approach further underlines chairman Tony Bloom’s commitment to the club.

The works some of which are already completed and others of which will be phased over the short to medium term are also set to include an extra stairway leading from the external concourse to the coach park and a new gatehouse on Village Way.

Chief executive and deputy chairman Paul Barber said “This is a really positive move and fans will benefit from an even better matchday experience at the Amex in the future.

“We pride ourselves on delivering the best experience for fans and this is yet another significant investment from Tony Bloom to help us further our facilities and open the stadium up to even more Albion supporters hopefully from next August and also further in the future.

“These plans have been in place for some time and initially we would have hoped to have seen supporters benefitting from them much sooner.

“Additional stadium seating was our priority and the majority of this is now in place taking our capacity to just under 32000 but the pandemic means we will phase other parts of our planned stadium work over time.

“We are now looking ahead with cautious optimism to next season when we hope we can welcome back fans and begin to enjoy the Amex experience again.”"

Preview: 470 World Championship 2021

VILAMOURA PORTUGAL- After a long and unplanned delay in action the 470 Class is eager and primed for the 2021 World Championship which kicks off racing in Vilamoura Portugal on Monday March 8. A year has passed since the 2020 Worlds in Palma de Mallorca Spain were cancelled in response to COVID-19’s global escalation. Nikki Barnes (St. Thomas USVI) 470 women’s skipper of Perfect Vision Sailing (USA 1810) recalled hearing murmurs throughout the boat park as news headlines made their way to the public. After travel restrictions were abruptly announced on March 12 2020 all 470s were packed up the venue emptied and competitors booked the first flight home.

The 2020 Worlds were to serve as the final Olympic qualification event for the USA Women’s 470 fleet. The three women’s teams – each team separated by mere points in their quest to qualify for Tokyo – quickly reevaluated the next year adjusted their plans and mentally prepared for another year of training.

Finally the highly anticipated World Championship event is here where all three teams will have a chance to reengage with the international fleet and return to a familiar racecourse. The 2021 470 World Championship taking place March 5-13 is a welcome return to competition. Additionally as the last event of the Women’s 470 Olympic Trials the regatta results will determine which team will represent Team USA in Japan this summer. The three US teams Atlantic and Nora Brugman (Winthrop Mass.) Carmen and Emma Cowles (Larchmont NY) and Nikki Barnes and Lara Dallman-Weiss (Hugo Minn.) separated by mere points in the Trials standings are preparing in Vilamoura after dedicating an extra year to their campaigns eager to secure their spot to Tokyo.

Over the past year the three teams took varying approaches to their extended campaigns capitalizing on their environments and finding advantages where they could. Emma and Carmen Cowles remained stateside training in Buzzards Bay in one-on-one sparring sessions with fellow USST members Stu McNay and Dave Hughes and traveling sparingly to small regattas as Covid restrictions allowed. Nikki Barnes and Lara Dallman-Weiss split their time between the States and Lanzarote Spain where they trained with the men’s and women’s teams from other countries who made Lanzarote their training hub for the pandemic. Dual citizens Atlantic and Nora Brugman remained in Europe training locally out of their family home in Spain. Like Barnes/Dallman-Weiss the Brugmans also leveraged the European circuit training with and competing against French and Spanish teams in Barcelona Plougueeneau and Marseille.

“We have created a really strong bond with the 470 Women’s fleet” said Nora Brugman about their year in Europe. “We never thought we’d grow so close to our rivals. We spend so much time traveling and away from home that these girls have become our family. We share everything we support each other we care for each other and we push each other to be better on and off the water. It’s interesting because we are the best of friends but as soon as we hit the water we become rivals and push each other to be better. We have a lot of respect for all of them and are so lucky to have them in our lives.”

Across the board all USA teams are feeling confident in the year of preparation that has led them to Vilamoura.

“We feel really good. We’ve used the year to our advantage” said Barnes. “It definitely wasn’t easy to extend for another year and continue the training but we changed our plans and adapted and I think we’ve prepared really well. Now we just need to get out there and deliver.”

When asked about their mental strategy heading into Worlds the Cowles team detailed their approach to events throughout their campaign and how their deliberate thought routine helps them maintain a healthy perspective.

“We feel confident going into Worlds. Our mindset for big events is simply treating them as any other regatta” said Emma Cowles. “It takes a lot of stress off the event and minimizes any outside pressure we may put on ourselves. Our strategy is to go race by race and day by day keep our head down and work hard.”

The men’s 470 team Stu McNay (Providence RI) and Dave Hughes (Ithaca NY) will also be racing in Vilamoura. The team has already secured their spot for the Tokyo Games but they revel in the opportunity to compete in an international championship again hoping to prove their training efforts over the last year as they return to a course of familiar rivals and fellow 2020 Games competitors. Remaining opportunities to race against the fleet they will see in Enoshima are sparse so time on the water with their competitors is precious.

“Our focus this past year has been to get the most out of the hours days weeks and months that we’ve put on the water during 2020. We’re also finding confidence in our own skin knowing we’ve put in the time needed while also acknowledging there are a great many unknowns having not sailed against our international competition in quite some time” said Dave Hughes. “We’re working to ensure each day is productive and efficient and that we’re biting off the correct amount to chew on any given practice or race day.”

The Olympic Development group will also be on the starting line in Vilamoura. Lousia Nordstrom (Sarasota Fla.) and Trevor Bornarth (Martin County Fla.) will race in the new Mixed 470 discipline and Shawn Harvey (Miami Fla.) and Augie Dale (Pewaukee Wis.) in the Men’s 470 discipline. All four have their sights set on the Mixed 470 fleet for Paris 2024. Harvey and Dale plan to eventually find female counterparts for their campaigns but in the meantime are focused on learning as much as they can in the men’s fleet stacked as it is with veterans.

“We’re well aware that the fleet will be stiff competition because everyone in the men’s division has been sailing these boats for years and years so we’re just hoping to learn a lot on the racecourse” said Dale. “I’m very excited; it’s going to be fun sparring against everyone. We were recently training with the Russians and it was great to see their technique how they trim and how they steer through the waves.”

Nordstrom agreed with Dale about the ripe opportunities for improvement saying “I’m looking forward to seeing how much progress we make this month because after just one week of sailing in these conditions it’s crazy to see how much we’ve grown. I’m excited to see what a month of sailing here will do for our growth.”

The Mixed 470 fleet is a new feature on the Olympic stage debuting at the Paris 2024 Games. Nordstrom and Bornarth noted how the mixed pairs are all fresh so there is truly a clean slate for who will wind up as the top teams. This is an exciting refresh that doesn’t come along very often in Olympic sailing and the ODP group has a strong appetite to become tomorrow’s legends.

“Campaigning has been a huge team effort and we have been so lucky to have a huge support system behind us” shared Nora Brugman “Every single person who has come into our campaign has been a part of our success and is the reason why we are still here fighting for our goals. We would like to especially thank the Shelter Island Community our family our coaches and our friends from all over who have helped us get to where we are today. The generosity and support we have experiences from so many people has always given us the strength and motivation to keep pushing and has also been a very humbling experience. We know one day we will give it back to the younger generations by helping future athletes achieve their own goals.”

Team Perfect Vision Sailing (Barnes/Dallman-Weiss) would like to especially thank the U.S. Coast Guard for their support in their endeavors. “Without Coast Guard approval I wouldn’t even be able to get into a 470 – let alone compete full time – while remaining active duty in the Coast Guard so we’re very grateful” said Barnes. They’d also like to thank their personal sponsors and donors and all who helped them get to where they are.

The Cowles team would like to emphasize that while the public may see just the two of them on the water there is an entire team behind them making it happen. Their parents and sister Margaux have been travel companions as frequently as possible and video calling when apart and their coach Steve Keen has pushed their development since their days in 420s. The US Sailing Team management staff physical fitness and therapy staff and mentors they’ve found along the way have been crucial components of their campaign.

Team McNay/Hughes is grateful for everyone who has made it possible for them to compete in Europe corporate and private sponsors and especially their coach Thomas Barrows who has put in a considerable amount of time to helping them perform as well as possible. They’d like to acknowledge the sacrifices of others in order to give their campaign the best chance.

In Kansas City farmers are struggling to ship soybeans to buyers in Asia. In China furniture destined for North America piles up on factory floors.

Around the planet the pandemic has disrupted trade to an extraordinary degree driving up the cost of shipping goods and adding a fresh challenge to the global economic recovery. The virus has thrown off the choreography of moving cargo from one continent to another.

At the center of the storm is the shipping container the workhorse of globalization.

Americans stuck in their homes have set off a surge of orders from factories in China much of it carried across the Pacific in containers — the metal boxes that move goods in towering stacks atop enormous vessels. As households in the United States have filled bedrooms with office furniture and basements with treadmills the demand for shipping has outstripped the availability of containers in Asia yielding shortages there just as the boxes pile up at American ports.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvc2hvdy9pbi1hcml6b25hLWEtc3RydWdnbGUtb3Zlci1hLXNhY3JlZC1zaXRlLW9mLXRoZS1hcGFjaGUtdHJpYmXSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYnMub3JnL25ld3Nob3VyL2FtcC9zaG93L2luLWFyaXpvbmEtYS1zdHJ1Z2dsZS1vdmVyLWEtc2FjcmVkLXNpdGUtb2YtdGhlLWFwYWNoZS10cmliZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In Arizona a struggle over a sacred site of the Apache tribe,"Hari Sreenivasan:

Last week the Biden administration paused a land transfer in Arizona that could have led to a massive copper mine.

Oak Flat Arizona about an hour east of Phoenix sits above one of the largest untapped copper reserves in North America likely worth billions of dollars. But the land is also a sacred site for the San Carlos Apache and many other Native American tribes. The transfer if approved would allow a private international company to use a controversial technique that even it admits would destroy the area.

Now as Special Correspondent Benedict Moran reports a group of Apaches is hoping that the delay will help their lawsuit against the government to go forward in an effort to stop the mine altogether.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIxLzAzLzA2L2FmdGVyLWtoYXNob2dnaS1tdXJkZXItc2F1ZGktYXJhYmlhLXNoaWZ0cy1sb2JieWluZy1taWRkbGUtYW1lcmljYS80NDk3NDQ5MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After Khashoggi murder Saudi Arabia shifts lobbying to middle America,"WASHINGTON – On Nov. 19 Saudi Arabia's glamorous ambassador to the United States – Princess Reema bint Bandar – held a private Zoom session with an unusual audience.

No members of Congress or White House officials. No State Department officials. No reporters.

Instead the kingdom's ambassador spoke to a group of Philadelphia business leaders students educators and other local residents interested in foreign affairs. It was billed as a ""candid discussion"" with Saudi Arabia's first female ambassador and hosted by Philadelphia's World Affairs Council a nonprofit educational group.

""There was a huge message of change and progress"" said Lauren Swartz president of the council who led the Zoom session with Reema. ""That is ... not much reported in the newspapers here.""

The Philadelphia meeting appears to be part of a new Saudi government lobbying strategy – launched in the wake of Jamal Khashoggi's murder inside a Saudi consulate in 2018 – focused on reaching out to state and local officials from New Orleans to Anchorage.

Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide

The pitch: Saudi Arabia is a pivotal global player in the midst of a transformation on women's rights.

""They've made a calculated decision that says 'You know we're really losing the battle here (in Washington). We've got to take this battle out into America'"" said Ben Freeman director of the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative at the Center for International Policy a nonprofit foreign policy research group.

Before Khashoggi's murder Saudi Arabia was known in Washington for its lobbying firepower fueled by an expensive roster of politically wired consultants and public relations operatives. But as the gruesome details of the Washington Post columnist's slaying emerged marque lobbyists who had collected millions from the Saudi government quickly nixed their lucrative contracts.

As the kingdom's influence on Capitol Hill began to evaporate it pivoted and hired a consulting firm based in Iowa.

""I can't recall any country ever launching such a pervasive campaign to garner influence in middle America the way the Saudis are"" Freeman said. ""It kind of seems like what they're doing is 'astroturf'"" he added referring to the tactic of making a campaign appear to stem from grassroots activists when in fact it's orchestrated by well-heeled consultants.

Critics say the Saudi's strategy is savvy.

Outside Washington's foreign policy circles few Americans are likely following the horrors of the war in Yemen where a Saudi-led bombing campaign has killed civilians and contributed to the world's worst humanitarian crisis. And they might have missed the details of Khashoggi's murder including reports that his Saudi executors used a bone saw to dismember him.

""If you present (Saudi's pitch) to an audience that doesn't otherwise know about the reality of Saudi Arabia ... then you might be hoodwinked into going along and saying 'Well it's a transformation in Saudi Arabia'"" said Sarah Leah Whitson executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN) a human rights group Khashoggi helped found.

In an emailed statement a spokesman for the Saudi embassy Fahad Nazer said the kingdom maintains ""healthy and constructive engagements with senior US administration officials as well as congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle.""

At the same time he said ""we recognize that Americans outside Washington are interested in developments in Saudi Arabia and many including the business community academic institutions and various civil society groups are keen on maintaining long-standing relations with the kingdom or cultivating new ones.""

In one of the federal disclosure reports the country's Iowa lobbyists wrote that their work was aimed at informing ""the public government officials and the media about the importance of fostering and promoting strong relations between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.""

Khashoggi murder 'destroyed' Saudi political capital in DC

After Khashoggi's killing lawmakers denounced Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman as ""a wrecking ball"" who had ""tainted"" his country by ordering an American resident's slaying.

""The scandal of Jamal Khashoggi's murder really just destroyed any of the social capital and PR capital that Mohammed Bin Salman had been trying to build up"" Whitson said. ""And the Saudis just dug in and made it worse with every passing day when they would offer up new lies and denials.""

Now the Khashoggi case is again in the spotlight with last week's release of a U.S. intelligence report that directly links the crown prince to the journalist's death. The report released by the Biden administration's director of national intelligence quickly renewed a fierce debate over the U.S.-Saudi alliance.

President Joe Biden has vowed to ""recalibrate"" the relationship but he has resisted calls from Democrats in Congress and human rights groups to target the crown prince directly with sanctions or other penalties.

""Our objective is to recalibrate the relationship prevent this from ever happening again and find ways ... to work together with Saudi leadership” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Monday. She noted that the U.S. doesn't typically sanction the leaders of other countries with which it has diplomatic relations.

So far Biden has taken incremental steps to distance the U.S. from Saudi Arabia a key American ally in the Middle East. He paused certain arms sales to the kingdom and halted U.S. support for offensive military operations in the Yemen war where a Saudi-led coalition has used American-made munitions in a deadly bombing campaign.

'Real people who tackle real issues'

If the kingdom's lobbying activity is any indication Saudi officials have decided on a new tactic for weathering any further rebukes from the White House. Although the government's spending on lobbying has ticked down from a high of $34 million in 2018 the year Khashoggi was killed the kingdom still doles out millions: approximately $17 million in 2019 and about $6 million last year according to the Center for Responsive Politics which tracks money in politics.

That does not include spending by Saudi-related entities such as the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation a chemical manufacturing company and subsidiary of the state-owned petroleum and gas company.

Records show that the Saudi government has not abandoned its Washington-focused lobbying. Their consultants reported more than 650 contacts with the House and Senate and another 123 with D.C.-based think tanks according to the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative's analysis. However there's been a remarkable shift in focus said Freeman: more than 1000 of the country's nearly 2000 reported lobbying contacts in 2020 were to individuals and groups outside the Beltway.

""We're seeing them reach out to local Chambers of Commerce"" along with Jewish organizations and synagogues Freeman said.

The Saudi influence campaign has also targeted smaller media outlets outside Washington. Freeman said for example that Saudi foreign agents contacted Shale Magazine a Texas-based outlet devoted to promoting the energy industry seven times – matching the number of times they contacted the Washington Post (4) and USA TODAY (3) combined.

The main lobbying firm behind the new strategy is the LS2group based in Des Moines Iowa which the Saudi government paid more than $1 million in lobbying fees in 2020 according to the Center for Responsive Politics. ""We are real people who tackle real issues"" the firm's website says.

That firm in turn has brought on other consultants in Maine North Carolina and Georgia among other states records show. A partner at the firm did not respond to email messages seeking comment.

Some of the ""real issues"" the LS2group has focused on are women's rights in Saudi Arabia an Islamic country that until recently did not allow women to play in sports or to drive among other banned activities.

Under federal law lobbyists for foreign governments must filed detailed reports about their influence operations. One filing from the LS2group is a glossy pamphlet touting ""great progress in the area of women and sports"" with colorful images of women running cycling and stretching in mandatory headscarves.

The brochure states that since 2017 the government has granted licenses to women’s gyms (previously forbidden) and created a physical education requirement for girls in public schools among other steps.

""They have a bottomless bag of money to spend (and) the PR firms are obviously always coming up with new ways for them to spend it"" said Whitson.

She notes that prior to 2015 women were banned from playing sports. ""Girls found to be playing basketball were attacked"" and threatened with arrest she said.

Indeed at the same time the Saudi government was touting these reforms in the U.S. it was jailing some prominent women's rights activists including Loujain al-Hathloul who pushed to end a ban on women driving in Saudi Arabia. In December a Saudi court sentenced her to almost six years in prison under a broad counterterrorism law.

Al-Hathloul was released on Feb. 10 after a judge suspended part of her sentence and gave her credit for time already served. She and other women said they were tortured and sexually assaulted during their detention.

When the diplomat is a princess

If the LS2group is the Saudi's behind-the-scenes conduit to average Americans Reema is the kingdom's public face.

The American-educated Saudi princess became the country's first female ambassador in 2019 as the royal family scrambled to contain the fallout from Khashoggi's killing. She had lived in the U.S. for 22 years from 1983 to 2005 when her father served as the kingdom's ambassador to Washington.

Lise Falskow president and CEO of Alaska's World Affairs Council said she was thrilled when she heard Reema would be willing to speak to her group. She had invited Saudi Arabia's previous ambassador to visit Alaska but never got a response.

""Being an oil country and Alaska being an oil state it’s interesting to hear their perspective on gas and world markets and living in the neighborhood they do – and her being a woman"" Falskow said.

Only one member of her council objected a Syrian woman who said Reema's privileged background would not give Alaskans a true picture.

""She felt like the story of Saudi needed to be told but by somebody else"" Falskow recounted. But Reema impressed the 70 people who dialed in for the October Zoom including the woman who had initially objected said Falskow.

She said the LS2 representatives asked her not to record the session and she couldn't recall details of the conversation. But she said it's no wonder if Reema offered a rosy vision of her home country – that's what all diplomats are supposed to do.

""They’re trying to promote peace and cooperation and talk about the positives and (Reema) did a very good job of that"" Falskow said.

Swartz head of the Philadelphia World Affairs Council said there was ""no hesitancy on our part"" to host Reema when the opportunity arose because Saudi Arabia had been in the news ""for so many things.""

Reema was very adept at parrying questions about the status of women in Saudi Arabia and a host of other issues though no one pressed her about Khashoggi's murder.

""She had all her data points about Saudi Arabia's impact opportunity and connections to Pennsylvania"" Swartz said including ties to the state's energy industry.

""The biggest takeaway I had was that Princess Reema Ambassador Reema is an incredible diplomat and politician and spokesperson"" she said.

But the Saudi pitch has not been welcomed everywhere.

Kelley Ponder of the New Orleans Citizen Diplomacy Council said her group decided against hosting Reema.

""We didn't want to you know get into anything too political"" she said adding that other citizen-based diplomacy groups have made the same decision. It was a matter of ""not knowing what we were getting into"" Ponder said.

It’s the latest and potentially most serious proposal by a public entity to take on the approximately 125000 Nassau customers from Lynbrook to Sea Cliff who are currently served by Merrick-based New York American Water which is attempting to sell itself.

The state Public Service Commission even as it considers that potential $607 million sale to Liberty Utilities has requested proposals from authorities and districts about a possible public takeover of the assets.

Suffolk County Water Authority’s six-page filing with the state Department of Public Service suggests the creation of a new Nassau County Water Authority with a separate board and its own debt issued to pay for the acquisition. It proposes acquiring portions of American Water's Nassau system that other entities do not or the entire Nassau system.

Other areas of Nassau are served by municipal water districts that generally offer lower rates than investor-owned New York American Water's.

At present the Massapequa Water District has proposed taking on some 4500 customers in the East Massapequa area and Sea Cliff and Hempstead have both found an acquisition of customers in their regions ""feasible"" though Hempstead Town has balked at taking on the additional debt load.

Suffolk water officials weren’t available to discuss their proposal but in a statement SCWA chief executive Jeff Szabo said state officials had asked the authority to submit comments on the study ""and we did so.""

The new Nassau entity would enter a management/operating agreement with SCWA to manage the new territory much as it does with some districts in Suffolk. If a price for the system can’t be agreed upon the acquisition could involve an eminent domain filing with the value of New York American Water assets ultimately determined in court.

Touting possible savings

The Suffolk authority ""strongly suggested"" that the new Nassau entity be exempt from paying property and other taxes which would address issues of high customer bills that New York American Water had long complained about. Still the Suffolk authority said customers could see savings even if there were a so-called payment in lieu of taxes for a ""transition"" period included in customer bills.

But Suffolk’s water authority itself has been the subject of bitter complaints about soaring bills and frustrations that the authority limits avenues to appeal its findings about those complaints. High-bill complaints jumped 35% last year over 2019.

New York American Water a frequent target of ratepayers and lawmakers over high rates and water quality has in the past said the Liberty acquisition is ""in the best interest of our customers.""

In a statement New York American Water president Lynda DiMenna said eliminating the state franchise tax the company now pays would provide customers ""real and immediate"" relief compared with ""any speculative savings from a very costly and long eminent domain process"" suggested in the SCWA proposal which ""will also take years and costs hundreds of millions of dollars.""

State Sen. John Brooks (D-Seaford) who was among the first to propose a SCWA takeover of some sort on Saturday called the possible takeover ""an easy way out of all of this.""

""Certainly Suffolk County Water Authority has the track record"" Brooks said. ""They can do the job and that could allow for a fast transition. I’m very optimistic we may be able to move in that direction. It’s the best of both worlds; we have an agency that’s exceptionally capable of doing the work.""

The Suffolk authority’s filing said if it entered a management agreement with the new Nassau authority it could operate the Nassau system with an annual fee that could be in the range of $450 to $500 per customer per year.

State lawmakers would have to act

The State Legislature would have to enact a new law to facilitate creation of the Nassau authority. In the past the Suffolk authority has said the legislature may also need to expand the authority’s service area to include Nassau.

Agatha Nadel a Glen Head resident who has led a coalition of North Shore residents against New York American Water's proposed takeover and high rates said she was in a ""state of shock"" Saturday after hearing about the Suffolk authority's proposal.

""What Suffolk County Water Authority proposed is so exciting as it is another avenue for all the American Water ratepayers to escape from privatization and receive affordable public water"" she wrote in an email. ""Remember we are talking about providing water to such a small percentage of Nassau County residents who have suffered under this private water dictatorship for way too long. Helping us achieve this goal is the right thing to do — morally and ethically.""

The SCWA with more than $200 million in annual revenue and $1.7 billion in assets has 400000 active accounts serving some 1.2 million people. It pumped 73.2 billion gallons of water in 2019 has its own drinking water testing lab and 585 full-time employees 360 of them unionized. It has grown through the acquisition of more than 40 public and private water systems.

At the time the holy grail of cancer biology was discovering so-called oncogenes – genetic switches that can turn a normal cell into a cancer cell – in the genomes of tumours. But while teams of scientists had thrown everything at it for the best part of a decade their efforts had proved fruitless. One by one they were beginning to accept that it might be a dead end.

Der found himself assigned to test 20 different genes that had been identified as possible oncogene candidates. His question was simple: did any of them actually exist in tumours in a form that was different from normal cells?

“People thought it wasn’t going to work” he remembers. “I began and certainly for five months the chances of success seemed to be pretty slim. I was ready to just wrap this up and move on to something else that might be more productive when I made the discovery which changed the course of my professional career.”

The first 18 of the genes Der tested turned out to be normal. But the final two members of a gene family called RAS were found to be uniquely mutated in cancer cells. “Being fairly new to the field at that point I didn’t fully understand the ramifications of what this meant” he laughs. “I was working in the lab of a professor named Geoffrey Cooper and when I showed him the results he paused for what seemed like minutes. So I asked if he was OK and he replied: ‘This could be one of the most significant discoveries in cancer biology in decades.’”

We like to call KRAS the Death Star. It’s spherical and impenetrable. Drugs would essentially bounce off it David Reese Amgen

We now know that about 20% of all cancers harbour a mutation in one of three RAS genes; KRAS HRAS and NRAS. Each of these genes directs the production of a protein that naturally flexes and relaxes on and off thousands of times a second. In the “on” position it allows cells to grow and then in the “off” setting it stops the growth. However when the RAS genes are mutated the protein remains stuck in its on state and the cell is forced to proliferate out of control becoming a tumour. Of the three genes KRAS is the most notorious as its mutant forms are commonly found in some of the deadliest cancers. KRAS mutations occur in up to 96% of pancreatic cancers and 54% of colorectal cancers.

Over the past 40 years the pharmaceutical industry has repeatedly tried to find a way to switch RAS proteins off in cancer cells. It has been a long journey checkered with abandoned hopes and hundreds of millions lost in failed trials. But over the past eight years a breakthrough has breathed new light into the field. At least eight companies now have drugs in clinical development that appear to successfully target a KRAS mutant. If all goes to plan in 2021 they could soon be approved by regulators paving the way for a whole new class of cancer medicines.

Back in the 1980s it was not long before the early optimism surrounding RAS began to fade. “Virtually every major pharma company put their hat in the ring and said ‘We’re going after this’” says Der. “With time more ideas came up more ideas were tried and more ideas failed. It was the best of times and then it became the worst of times for RAS drug discovery.”

Scientists wanted to find drugs that could attach to RAS proteins and hold them permanently in the off state but they swiftly realised this was far from easy. The proteins were often likened to tennis balls and it was seemingly impossible to find anything that could bind to them. “We like to call KRAS the Death Star” says David Reese executive vice-president for research and development at Amgen who has been involved in RAS drug discovery since the 1990s. “It’s spherical and impenetrable. Proteins usually have nooks and crannies which you use to latch on to. This was a huge challenge for chemists because drugs would essentially bounce off.”

However in the early 1990s scientists thought they had cracked the problem. All RAS proteins have a fatty tail created by an enzyme called farnesyl transferase with which they latch on to the cancer cell membrane. Blocking this enzyme seemed like a surefire way of stopping RAS proteins from working.

Initially it seemed like a perfect strategy especially when the drugs successfully halted cancer growth in mice. Der recalls that six major pharmaceutical companies were sufficiently convinced to then gamble vast sums on clinical trials. But one by one the drugs failed. It transpired that human cancer cells have a contingency plan. RAS proteins it turns out contain an enzyme that can create a new fatty tail if farnesyl transferase isn’t functioning. It rendered the experimental drugs useless.

Wounded by the failure many scientists walked away from the field and RAS proteins soon came to be seen as undruggable. “People certainly became disillusioned” says Der. “At that point I saw many pharma companies simply say: ‘This is too tough let’s go look for something else.’”

But 20 years later the field would be suddenly revitalised thanks to the determination of one academic chemist.

In 1999 Kevan Shokat arrived in San Francisco to begin collaborating with a cancer researcher called Frank McCormick. Despite Shokat’s initial misgivings McCormick urged him to look for a new method of drugging the KRAS protein that was behind so many lethal cancers.

“Even though I told him I couldn’t think of a way to do that he kept encouraging me and inviting RAS experts from all over the world to give talks” says Shokat. “As drug discovery evolved things fell in place for us to take a stab at it.”

By the late 2000s Shokat had become interested in one particular KRAS mutant called G12C. This is found in 13% of patients with non-small cell cancer the most common form of lung cancer as well as 3% of colorectal cancer patients. Over the next five years Shokat and colleagues would screen around 500 different molecules to see if any could latch on to G12C.

In 2013 their persistence paid off. To Shokat’s amazement one particular drug had achieved the seemingly impossible. It had created a tiny groove in the protein’s surface and used it to hold G12C steady. “The drug was sitting in a beautiful pocket that no one had ever seen on the protein” he remembers.

It was the biggest breakthrough in RAS biology in years. For the first time in almost two decades the pharmaceutical industry began to take note again. “A lot of us started thinking maybe this groove in G12C is like a little hook that a mountain climber would use somewhere to put your fingertips and grasp on to” says Reese.

Inspired by Shokat’s breakthrough more than eight companies around the world from Amgen to Johnson & Johnson began to design and test their own inhibitors against G12C. In 2019 the watershed moment came when Amgen scientists presented the first human trial results of their inhibitor sotorasib in advanced lung cancer patients.

“There were 40000 oncologists from around the world gathering in Chicago to review the latest data” recalls Reese. “Usually the new drug development session is a sleepy backwater of this conference but this time the room was overflowing with people and you could feel the electricity when the data was presented.”

The excitement was justified. In those early readouts sotorasib was found to be capable of both shrinking solid tumours and delaying disease progression after six weeks of treatment. Last month Amgen released the data from a much larger patient cohort after following them for a year. It was found that 37% had either complete or partial tumour shrinkage while 81% saw their condition stabilise.

Der points out that the tumour shrinkage is a key result. “If the tumour mass is too large you can’t operate” he said. “If you can shrink the tumour that patient might now be a candidate for surgery and at the end of the day our best treatment for cancer is still surgical resection of the tumour. That is what cures people.”

Amgen is not the only company to report promising clinical trial data. Last October Mirati Therapeutics released data from early stage trials of their G12C inhibitor adagrasib which helped shrink tumours in 45% of advanced lung cancer patients. However both Amgen and Mirati have had less success when using their inhibitor against colorectal cancer patients with the G12C mutation.

One of the characteristics of cancer cells is that they seem to overcome everything we throw at them Channing Der

In December 2020 Amgen asked the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency to review sotorasib leading to anticipation that it could be approved later this year as a new therapy for certain lung cancer patients. In the eyes of many oncologists this would be a welcome weapon against a disease that remains notoriously difficult to treat.

“Lung cancer is still extremely challenging clinically and affects a very large number of patients being the commonest cause of cancer deaths worldwide” says Julian Downward a cancer researcher at the Francis Crick Institute. “Improvements in therapies in the past decade have come from two areas. One is the development of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors which are effective in some 10% or so of lung cancer patients. The other has been the development of immunotherapies. These can work very well in some patients but unfortunately it is only a minority. So there is still a huge unmet need in the treatment of lung cancer and it is to be hoped that at least part of that might be met by these new KRAS drugs.”

However neither sotorasib nor any of the other G12C inhibitors in development are miracle cures. In many patients the best prognosis will be that they prolong life by months or increase quality of life even though patients remain terminally ill. Cancer is a versatile foe quick to adapt to anything thrown at it. Even the most optimistic researchers agree that the benefits offered by G12C inhibitors will only be fleeting and tumours will quickly develop workarounds.

“We’ve learned from past experiences that virtually every cancer treatment will be limited by resistance” says Der. “The cancer cell is rather an amazing beast in that it is built to survive and one of the characteristics of cancer cells is that they seem to overcome everything we throw at them. So these G12C inhibitors are not an exception. The cancer cells will find some way of overcoming the drug and growing again.”

Still the development of G12C inhibitors has reignited commercial and academic interest in a field that was long considered hopeless. Amgen and others are investigating whether pairing their inhibitors with immunotherapies can make them more effective while Moderna is exploring whether a cancer vaccine targeting multiple KRAS mutations simultaneously could address the problem of tumour resistance. Interest is also turning towards designing inhibitors against another KRAS mutant called G12D which is the most prevalent KRAS mutant in cancer.

“People are now saying if we could do this trick with G12C mutations why can’t we do it with other RAS mutations” says Der. “Inhibiting G12D would be even bigger. Having developed these inhibitors is a groundbreaking moment in cancer biology.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

These additions join the existing eight Fullscreen clock background for those who don’t want to set a photo album.

Update 3/6: Google today officially announced the new clock faces following their rollout earlier this week. There are now 11 Fullscreen clocks on Assistant devices. While only first-party devices were mentioned in this morning’s tweet other Smart Display owners can also set.

It’s about time we added some new Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max clock faces. Choose the one that fits your style by saying “Hey Google set photo frame.”

Original 3/2: “Timeless” is an analog clock with circular indented markers at the 3 6 9 and 12 o’clock positions. Thick oblong minute and hour hands are joined by a very thin needle for seconds. The “Dark” variant has a dark red background while “Light” is more pink.

“Weather” is the biggest addition and features a background that reflects the current state just like the forecast card. For example a blue gradient appears on a clear day while you’ll see stars at night. The time is displayed digitally with the current condition — as an icon and in words — flanking the temperature.

These three faces first appeared on the Lenovo Smart Clock in 2019 but have been tweaked and better spaced for the Nest Hub’s larger 7- or 10-inch display.

To access open the Google Home app and select your device. Tap the settings gear icon in the top-right corner and then Photo Frame > Fullscreen clock. These three new clocks are available at the very bottom of this list. Saying “Hey Google set photo frame” also works on your Smart Display with these additions located at the right of the carousel.

As of this evening they are widely rolled out for all users running Cast firmware 1.52. You do not have to be on the Preview channel to set on your device.

""The Federal Office for Safety in Health Care (BASG) has received two reports in a temporal connection with a vaccination from the same batch of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the district clinic of Zwettl"" in Lower Austria province it said.

One 49-year-old woman died as a result of severe coagulation disorders while a 35-year-old woman developed a pulmonary embolism and is recovering it said. A pulmonary embolism is an acute lung disease caused by a dislodged blood clot.

""Currently there is no evidence of a causal relationship with the vaccination"" BASG said.

Swiss newspaper Niederoesterreichische Nachrichten as well as broadcaster ORF and the APA news agency reported that the women were both nurses who worked at the Zwettl clinic.

BASG said blood clotting was not among the known side effects of the vaccine. It was pursuing its investigation vigorously to completely rule out any possible link.

""As a precautionary measure the remaining stocks of the affected vaccine batch are no longer being issued or vaccinated"" it added.

AstraZeneca had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.

The APA news agency quoted AstraZeneca as saying the company was in contact with Austrian authorities and would fully support the investigation.

It noted the vaccine had been approved by the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization based on a global clinical program involving 23000 participants.

""All of these evaluations have concluded that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective"" APA quoted the company as saying.

European Union regulators on Jan. 30 approved the product saying it was effective and safe to use. Adverse reactions seen in trials were short-lived for the most part and blood clotting issues were not reported.

TARGET TO OPEN MINI APPLE STORES IN SELECT LOCATIONS

The setting known as Item Safety Alerts appears to be an attempt to prevent stalking with AirTags according to iOS developer and Apple blogger Benjamin Mayo.

""If someone secretly hides a tag in your possessions your phone will notice and warn you about it"" Mayo tweeted. ""The setting is on by default which makes sense but the fact you can turn it off at all probably means that this fires false positive alerts in some circumstances.""

Users who choose to turn the setting off will be given a warning that the owner of an unknown item will be able to see their location and that they will no longer receive notifications when an unkown item is found moving with them.

Though not yet officially released AirTags have been rumored to be in development by Apple since at least April 2019 when Mac Rumors released screenshots of the potential project. According to the report AirTags codenamed ""B389"" are small keychain-sized devices that could be attached to everyday items. The items were originally set to debut with iOS 13.

If an item with an AirTag attached is misplaced Apple users can reportedly place the tag in ""Lost Mode."" Then if another ‌iPhone‌ user comes across the lost item they will be able to view contact information for the item's owner and contact them by phone or text message.

AirTags would rival Samsung's Galaxy SmartTag and Tile's upcoming ultrawideband tracker according to the Verge. Tile devices have previously been misused for stalking in the past. ABC 13 reported that a Houston woman was repeatedly stalked by her ex using a Tile device in July 2018. In addition a former beauty queen told ABC News in April 2016 that a stalker was allegedly able to hack into her phone using a similar Tile device.

A spokesperson for Apple did not immediately return FOX Business request for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZ2VuZXJhbC9hcHBsZS1jb2RhLXN1bmRhbmNlLTI1LW1pbGxpb24taW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1yaWdodHMtMTIzNDYyMTQzMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple and the $25 Million CODA Deal: Here's Why It's a Problem,"The record-breaking Apple Studios acquisition of “CODA” is still creating anxiety weeks after the Sundance Film Festival ended. The fear isn’t that streamers’ deep pockets will make it impossible for others to compete although that’s certainly a possibility. The “CODA” angst belongs to a much larger question: How can Apple hold all worldwide rights to a film that’s already sold to territories all over the world?

When Apple bought worldwide rights to Sian Heder’s “CODA” for $25 million January 30 the financiers planned to make buyback deals with those rights holders. Nordisk Film which pre-bought the rights nearly two years ago confirmed to IndieWire that the company still plans to release the film in the Nordics. Nordisk isn’t alone in that in stance.

Many Sundance films come to the festival with all rights available — indie films can be a tough sell overseas as well — but “CODA” is the remake of an award-winning 2014 French film “La Famille Bélier.” Financing on “CODA” came from French companies Vendôme Group Pathé and Patrick Wachsberger’s Picture Perfect Entertainment but territory presales on “CODA” were crucial in getting the $10 million film made without a US distributor. Those international distributors participated in a bedrock strategy of independent film: Take the risk up front for the potential reward of a hit title.

Sun Distribution Group which bought “CODA” for Latin America was nonplussed by the Apple buy. “If we begin to accept this idea [of mandatory buyback clauses] we’d go out of business” Sun executive director Ricardo Costianovsky told THR. “It would mean taking all the risk on flops and capping our upside on hits.”

Andrea Goretti CEO of Italy’s Eagle Pictures told Variety that he received a call from Pathé February 1 inquiring if the distributor would be willing to sell back Italian rights. In short: Nope. Not only did he still plan to release “CODA” for Christmas 2021 he’s already sold Pay TV and free TV rights in Italy. Eagle Pictures holds Italian rights on “CODA” for 20 years. Said Goretti “We have no intention to give back these rights now.”

Global streamers like Netflix and Apple TV+ generally prefer to buy worldwide rights although there are exceptions. At the 2021 European Film Market Netflix paid $18 million for the Liam Neeson title “The Ice Road” — US rights only since Neeson action films are a hot property and the film was already sold in territories all over the world. Similarly Netflix bought “Operation Mincemeat” starring Colin Firth but for North American and Latin American rights only; deals made in other territories remain intact.

“The big mistake [on “CODA”] was nobody ever called these distributors before the Apple deal was announced” said a US theatrical acquisitions executive. “Apple wanted that headline. They wanted to show the world they were in the content business in a big way.”

An Apple representative declined to comment. Reps for ICM and CAA which represented the filmmakers in the deal did not return requests for comment. All stand to lose from this transaction. The $25 million deal was meant to cover more than 100 countries where Apple operates its growing Apple TV+ service. The more distributors who hold out in ceding their rights the more the price drops.

For now it’s unlikely that buyback clauses and kill fees will become the norm in distribution contracts; Hollywood agencies and streamers don’t hold unilateral power. In the rapidly changing world of exhibition however flux is the rule and the industry will continue demanding reevaluation of business norms.

“We need to figure out how we transact with each other so all stakeholders can continue to participate in success” said one US sales agent and financier. “We hope and expect that there is going to be a great deal of productive and thoughtful conversations over the next year about how we are going to reimagine the way we’re all doing business together.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTAzLTA2L2NvdXBhbmctcy0zLTYtYmlsbGlvbi1pcG8tc2hvd3MtdS1zLXJlbWFpbnMta2luZy1mb3ItdGVjaC1pcG9z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coupang's $3.6 Billion IPO Shows U.S. Is King for Tech IPOs,"South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang Inc.’s initial public offering is on track to be the largest listing by a Korean company in a decade.

What do Apple Tesla and prefab homes have in common? Apparently a lot if you're prefab home maker Connect Homes.

California-based Connect Homes specializes in prefabricated houses. While this isn't a new concept prefabrication is increasingly being considered a potential solution to our housing crisis.

Currently prefabs can be seen across the spectrum from homes that can accommodate families to shelters for unhoused people. And recently several prefab makers — including Plant Prefab Pallet Dvele — have seen a boost in public interest and sales.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

But unlike other prefab modular home makers Connect Homes builds its units the same way Apple creates its phones and Tesla manufactures its vehicles: by ""understanding every stakeholder and every piece along the journey"" Greg Leung Connect Homes' CEO told Insider.

Leung who has been Connect Homes' CEO for about half a year previously spent 12 years at Apple overseeing its global supply chain planning and management. Despite the obvious differences between Apple and Connect Homes Leung says his experience at the tech giant — and a previous smart home tech startup — has lent itself to turning Connect Homes and the prefab home industry into one that can more frequently produce higher quality houses while using less time and money.

""Imagine you were to approach building a house the way Apple would approach building a product … from an end-to-end standpoint"" Leung explained. ""By thinking about it from that standpoint you're able to optimize and make decisions that allow the entire thing to work seamlessly for the end consumer and for [the process] to actually run efficiently and effectively.""

For prefab homes makers this execution could be the difference between being a niche home builder or a ""game-changer"" that could replace ""traditional construction in many use cases"" Leung said.

And for Connect Homes the goal is to become a key national home builder.

""Prefab has been around for decades and it has overpromised and under-delivered because prefab in and of itself is not the answer it's a technique that's used to address the problem [of our housing crisis]"" Leung said.

Creating a Connect Home

Connect's rising popularity is undeniable. The company saw the most bookings in its history during the second quarter of 2020. Now it's looking like this year's first quarter will beat last year's fourth-quarter numbers and the upcoming second quarter is already on track to surpass this quarter.

Among this influx of orders there's been a strong mix of requests for homes in urban suburban and countryside locations. No matter the destination Connect's modular units can be delivered across the US using semi-trailer trucks rail cars or cargo ships.

All of these homes are built in Connect's California factory using an ""assembly-line construction"" method. As a result Connect is able to build a home every six days while an entire home can be produced in 24 days according to Leung. When the units are finished Connect will deliver its homes 90% complete and will install them for its customers using a crane

Compared to traditional houses Connect's homes are more efficient — in terms of time money waste and carbon — to build ""by orders of magnitude"" Leung said. This eco-friendly angle can also be seen throughout its homes: Connect's units come with insulation systems focused on power efficiency a roof with high solar reflectance and LED fixtures.

Not all of Connect's customers are first-time homebuyers. In some cases Connect's clients are city dwellers looking to physically replace an existing home with a new house. Other times it's homebuyers seeking the ""city to countryside"" exodus that we've seen throughout COVID-19.

The company has also received inquiries from colder travel hotspots like ski resorts which benefit from Connect's strong insulation year-round construction capabilities and shipment of nearly complete homes.

While Connect doesn't build purely custom homes the existing models are semi-customizable via different finishes and appliances. There are also different packages — including one for cold weather and another for smart home tech — to further personalize the space.

Connect's units — which sit on steel frames — don't look any different than a typical modern house. The company offers 14 models ranging from the $202700 460-square foot Connect 1 to the $997000 3200 square-foot Connect 10. It's important to note that these prices include the estimated costs of both the home and ""site work.""

Connect's most popular model the Connect 8 falls closer to the larger model at 2560 square-feet. The two-story Connect 8 is a ""quintessential family home"" with its high-ceiling living room and entertainment spaces. The kitchen also flows into the back deck creating an indoor-outdoor feel.

In total the almost $814000 home has three bedrooms and bathrooms. The second floor holds all three sleeping spaces including the primary bedroom with an en-suite bathroom and walk-in closet. The top floor also has a second bathroom and a laundry room.

All of this is lined with floor-to-ceiling glass windows to bring in as much natural light as possible.

According to Leung the home's success comes from its ""versatile footprint"" and its ability to fit in thin but long urban plots of land.

""It's not your sprawling larger ranch home which doesn't always fit in urban settings but it's also equally good in the country"" Leung said. ""We sell them everywhere."""

She currently serves as the associate director of the Materials Science and Engineering Program and has recently been elected to be the director starting in July.

Her research explores biomaterials for functional regeneration specifically in designing hydrogel-based materials for musculoskeletal applications. Her group also focuses on leveraging material design to guide cell development and creating temporary scaffolds that can dissolve into the body once the cells are grown and effective.

Research explores biomaterials for regeneration

Hopes to see greater diversity within the university in the future

Coming from an academic family with backgrounds in biology and math Bryant has always enjoyed math and science particularly chemistry. A conversation with a relative who was an electrical engineer at NASA became the catalyst for Bryant to study chemical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. After completing her undergraduate studies she continued into graduate school at the University of Colorado Boulder and even completed a postdoc at the University of Washington before returning to CU Boulder as a professor.

Bryant said she has always been thankful for her support system throughout her career especially her mother who helped instill many important values. Her mother was an engineer herself and was even the first female manager at the telephone company she worked for. However she experienced struggles including not being listened to by her male colleagues and not being taken as seriously as her other colleagues. Because of these experiences her mother was steadfast in supporting Bryant and encouraged the mindset of being able to accomplish anything she felt strongly about.

Because of her determination and perseverance through difficult situations Bryant never thought about the disadvantages when she was going through them. She explained that it was not until reflecting on those times years later that she realized there were some situations that may have been more difficult and saw those situations in a different light.

In the future Bryant said she hopes to see a lot more diversity in the department and the university as a whole. She explained that the university should be more representative of the broad community in Colorado and emphasized the importance of having different perspectives especially in engineering where problem-solving is the focus. She hopes that CU will continue the mentality of wanting to help others and succeed together as a community.

With assets worth tens of millions of dollars associate attorney general nominee Vanita Gupta is thus far the Biden administration's wealthiest political nominee that has publicly released a financial disclosure form.

The disclosure of Gupta's financial interests comes as she faces a potentially rocky confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the coming week.

Gupta a civil rights attorney-turned Justice Department nominee has reported owning between $42 million and $187 million in assets and properties with her spouse in her disclosure report filed to the Office of Government Ethics. She reported earning between $902000 and $3 million in the past year the filing shows.

The biggest chunks of her assets come from her shares in companies linked to her father Raj Gupta a corporate chairman and Wall Street financier with vast corporate interests.

According to the filing Vanita Gupta owns between $11 million and $55 million in shares of Avantor a chemicals and materials company headquartered in Pennsylvania for which Raj Gupta is the chairman of the board.

She also reported owning between $500000 and $1 million in shares of Aptiv an American-Irish-British auto parts company headquartered in Dublin Ireland for which Raj Gupta also serves as chairman.

According to the report Gupta also owns between $950000 and $2 million in entities connected to the private equity firm New Mountain Capital for which her father has served as a senior adviser. Raj Gupta has also served on the board of the Vanguard Group one of the biggest index fund companies and Vanita Gupta owns between $11 million and $49 million worth of Vanguard index funds which are commonly owned by other political appointees.

She holds much of those assets through family trusts she controls except for $5 million to $25 million in Avantor $500000 to $1 million in Aptiv and six-figures in New Mountain Finance Co. which are under a brokerage account.

In her ethics agreement provided by the Biden transition team Vanita Gupta wrote that she would retain her financial interests in those companies but would resign from her position as co-trustee of her family trust.

She would also not participate ""personally or substantially"" in matters related to companies in which she or her family hold a financial interest.

She also wrote that she would not participate in matters related to companies in which her father holds leadership roles including Avantor and Aptiv.

A spokesperson for Biden's transition team when questioned about Gupta's financial interests referred ABC News to her ethics agreement. The Department of Justice when asked for comment also referred to the same agreement.

Gupta's plan to recuse herself from matters involving the financial interests of her family and herself is typically required by conflict of interest laws said Delaney Marsco senior legal counsel of ethics at Washington-based good government group Campaign Legal Center.

Gary Gensler Biden's pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission is the second wealthiest Biden appointee to disclose their financial interests to this point. Gensler reported owning between $41 million and $119 million in various assets comprised mostly of investment funds and brokerage accounts along with some real estate properties in Baltimore.

With the approach of Gupta's confirmation hearing she's recently been the subject of attacks from some far-right Republicans accusing her of being radically progressive and anti-police.

The Judicial Crisis Network has opposed Gupta's confirmation with an $800000 ad campaign titled ""Dangerous Appointee"" which accuses Gupta of supporting the ""defund the police"" movement.

Gupta who says that she has never endorsed such policies has had multiple police advocacy groups rally around her. Fraternal Order of Police President Patrick Yoes sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee last month expressing support for Gupta's nomination.

""She always worked with us to find common ground even when that seemed impossible"" Yoes said. ""Although in some instances our disagreements remain her open and candid approach has created a working relationship that is grounded in mutual respect and understanding.""

And a separate GOP-led group has launched a $1 million ""Confirm Gupta"" campaign highlighting Gupta's bipartisan support in TV ads running in Maine Alaska West Virginia and other states whose senators could be key to her confirmation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Louboutin and his business partner Bruno Chambelland a founding shareholder retain the majority ownership.

More from WWD

The designer whose BFFs include film producer and director Ginevra Elkann noted that he’s been friendly with the family for decades and even crossed paths with John Elkann chairman and chief executive officer of Exor and Ginevra’s brother about 20 years ago in China when both were on a business trip.

Expanding Louboutin’s presence in China and extending its digital and e-commerce platforms are among the headline projects the partners said they would activate to “accelerate the next phase of the company’s development.

“It is a great company. They know about luxury but they are actually bigger than just the luxury world” Louboutin said of Exor. “When you want to expand you have to think beyond your scope. They’re not limited by the parameters of fashion. And they definitely know about China.”

He also lauded that Exor would be a partner that respects individuality and originality.

“I have admired over the years Christian’s talent in creating one of the world’s great independent global luxury brands” John Elkann said in a statement. “We share the same family spirit culture and values which are the basis of a strong partnership. Christian Louboutin’s extraordinary creativity energy and unique vision are precisely the qualities needed to build a great company.”

The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter and suggests the Agnelli family owners of Ferrari have a growing appetite for fashion.

In December Exor said it would invest around 80 million euros in Chinese luxury brand Shang Xia and become the company’s majority shareholder alongside Hermès International and founder Jiang Qiong Er.

Exor is also a shareholder in The Economist Group PartnerRe Stellantis CNH Industrial GEDI Gruppo Editoriale and Juventus FC.

The Louboutin deal underscores keen investor interest in the footwear category. Earlier this month private equity giant L Catterton and family holding Financière Agache investment vehicles backed by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and luxury titan Bernard Arnault and his family respectively acquired a majority stake in Birkenstock with plans to expand the sandal maker in Asia open more stores and ramp up e-commerce.

That deal followed a bumper initial public offering in February for Dr. Martens and amid a sale process for Reebok currently owned by Adidas.

One of the world’s most famous and admired footwear designers Louboutin founded his brand in Paris in 1991 and has steadily built a global following for his red-soled heels expanding into men’s shoes handbags and small leather goods. In 2014 he launched Christian Louboutin Beauté. Today the brand counts around 150 boutiques in 30 countries.

Monday’s transaction values the company at roughly 2.2 billion euros and points to family offices as an important new actor in mergers and acquisitions.

“The luxury sector is particularly suited to family-office investment – it tends to be very resilient but a long-term play and it is all about growth equity and not so much financial engineering or leverage” said Pierre Mallevays co-head of the merchant banking department at Stanhope Capital Group in London.

He noted that family offices especially single-family offices are investing their own money “so they have much more flexibility than typical private equity funds when it comes to due diligence requirements and most importantly investment horizon.”

Mallevays allowed that not so long ago most family offices “would not necessarily have the adequate internal resources to properly evaluate such direct investment deals. With the rise of asset values globally this is no longer the case and most of them are now able to evaluate and monitor direct investment opportunities in a number of sectors.”

As part of the transaction Exor is to nominate two of the seven members of Louboutin’s board of directors.

Exor noted that “Christian Louboutin has a highly regarded and experienced management team that has successfully implemented a disciplined strategy focused on excellence and growth.”

In a separate interview on Monday Louboutin’s group managing director Alexis Mourot said orders for the brand’s fall 2021 collections unveiled to the press during Paris Fashion Week exceeded those for fall 2019 speaking to strong momentum for the company.

He cited particularly robust business in the United States its biggest market representing about 42 percent of revenues via 150 points of sales. Europe accounts for 40 percent of the business and the Asia-Pacific region 18 percent. At present Louboutin operates 15 stores in China representing about 7 percent of the business.

“We entered the market quite late” Mourot allowed.

Other future growth vectors include category expansion and digital channels.

At present women’s shoes account for 57 percent of the business men’s shoes 31 percent and leather goods 12 percent with the latter two categories expected to represent higher percentages in future.

Digital channels currently account for about 20 percent of the business up from 12 percent in 2019 and should quickly reach 30 percent in a few years Mourot said. The company operates e-commerce platforms in Europe the U.S. the Middle East Japan and Hong Kong for southeast Asia plus a concession on Tmall.

While often stereotyped as a stiletto maker Louboutin has in recent years widened its offering of flats sneakers booties and other low-heeled styles and these now represent a bigger part of the business.

“We continue to see good business with high heels” Mourot noted attributing that partly to the fact that many shoemakers have completely exited that part of the business.

In the interview Louboutin said working on his retrospective exhibition which debuted in February 2020 at the Palais de la Porte Dorée in Paris made him reflect on his legacy.

“I realized I needed to think about the next 30 years” he said. “To go to the next chapter I need to think about the development and to challenge myself and also to challenge the company.

“It’s great to be challenged by people who have a different experience but who are also listening.”

At a $7 billion valuation the company was briefly worth more than JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) and GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) combined. But there was one problem: Neither the company nor its merged entity HUMBL had a full-fledged operating business quite yet.

Instead the combined entity was merely an early stage startup — a dream and a series of test products put forth by its charismatic CEO and his team. Its multi-unicorn status was merely a product of its OTC share price — a number controlled by penny stock investors not by the company itself. As the firm rides a second crypto wave one thing will become apparent: The party is only getting started.

Tesoro’s rise illustrates a broader shift: Retail investors have found their way into the world of earlier-stage investing. The recent surge of SPACs initial coin offerings and OTC stocks mean that ordinary folks can now buy into companies that were once only available to angel investors and venture capitalists.

The trend won’t reverse anytime soon; big investor paydays will see to that. But as Wall Street and tech CEOs keep chipping away at accredited investor laws retail investors will find more opportunities to either make big profits or go home broke. After all removing the training wheels cuts both ways.

That means runaway stocks like Tesoro/HUMBL will happen more often. And only those who understand their anatomy can consistently profit in this wild new world of early stage investing.

TSNP Stock and HUMBL: A Marriage Made in Crypto-Land

In November HUMBL a global payments startup merged with Tesoro Enterprises in a deal worth about $10 million. Tesoro Enterprises itself was a relatively inactive company trading on over-the-counter pink sheets. Its final official SEC financial filing came in 2007 where the “value added reseller of ceramic floor and wall covering products” reported on its bankruptcy. After filing another small offering in 2010 the company went silent for over a decade.

HUMBL meanwhile was a hot startup in the payments and blockchain space. The young company founded by CEO Brian Foote was awarded the “Best North America Startup” at the 2019 World Blockchain Summit.

Why would a payments startup merge with a tile distributor? Without any apparent synergies HUMBL’s management likely did the deal so that they could access over-the-counter (OTC) capital markets – the wild west of finance.

Story continues

OTC Markets: Unimaginable Wealth and a Backwater of Bankruptcy

The Wall Street establishment tends to look down on the OTC market. With minimal reporting requirements and off-exchange dealings scam companies can often pass off as legitimate ones. It’s also where many de-listed companies go after their shares become worthless.

However the OTC market is much like visiting Grandma’s house and getting ice cream for breakfast: It offers a do-anything attitude that would make mom (i.e. the SEC) furious. Companies aren’t required to file audited financial statements making it a cheap place to do business. And OTC markets also allow companies to deal in legal grey areas. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCMKTS:GBTC) for instance trades OTC — making it the largest non-company entity on the exchange.

HUMBL Takes on OTC Markets

During ordinary times a startup like HUMBL might have ignored OTC markets altogether — raising money from angel investors and venture capital instead. It’s a well-worn path for promising young firms to access deep pockets and technological know-how. But with venture capital increasingly focused on larger later-stage deals HUMBL decided to go a riskier route.

The plan worked. After its merger in November 2020 TSNP stock rose from a penny to over 16 cents a stunning 1500% return. Much of this was from a smart investor relations campaign — the song and dance that most startups perform for their VC overlords. HUMBL did the same for penny stock investors and its early announcements created the intended result on its stock price.

But in late January things started to spiral out of control. In eight days the company announced launches in international payments e-commerce and blockchain products. Its shares immediately jumped to $1.91 an almost 20000% gain from barely two months before.

By the time the company announced the launch of its “BLOCK ETX Products” its market value of $7 billion had surpassed the two pure-play blockchain companies listed on the Nasdaq Exchange: Marathon Digital Group (NASDAQ:MARA) and Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT).

There was one problem: HUMBL was still a startup. Its products were a collection of test cases or “minimally viable products” (MVPs). VCs might have seen right through valuing HUMBL in the tens (or hundreds) of millions of dollars. But they certainly wouldn’t have paid $7 billion for the firm. (To reach that valuation the firm would have needed to look like Uber in late 2013 the year the ride-hailing firm would reportedly earn $210 million on over $1 billion of rides).

OTC investors however didn’t seem to care.

HUMBL’s Unexpected Rise

To understand how HUMBL became a $7 billion company let’s rewind to December 2020 when the company started its three-stage investor-relations push.

Act I December 2020: e-Commerce. That month HUMBL launches HUMBL Holiday Deal Days a destination for “highly curated holiday deals coupon codes and affiliate discount links in shopping verticals like electronics health beauty home fashion fitness and kids.” Investors might have initially cheered at the news. Like Grandma’s ice-cream breakfast only a killjoy could turn down “highly curated holiday deals.” But experienced VCs checking the humblpay.com site would have noted the true MVP nature of the product. Rather than deliver on the promise of “highly curated” the site instead posted links to retailers like World Market and Target as placeholders for future products.

Act II January 2021: Global Payments. HUMBL launches HUMBL Studios a “global merchant listings and web payment integrations” service. Again the “launch” is a great start for an MVP leaving room for a future payment system. A quick check on Builtwith a website that checks technology platforms and a quick call with the firm confirms that HUMBL runs Stripe as its payment processor.

Act III February 2021: Cryptocurrency. HUMBL makes its most significant announcement yet: “HUMBL Financial™ Launches BLOCK ETX Products in Over 100 Countries.” The press release sent TSNP/HUMBL stock soaring to its $7 billion market cap. And rightly so — financial firms have long tried to launch Blockchain ETFs for regular investors. The first firm to achieve that globally could become the next billion-dollar commodity ETF.

Sharp readers however would have noted that the BLOCK ETX product is still in a beta testing phase. The outcome was “not intended to be investment services or advice but rather are completely non-custodial.” In other words BLOCK ETX is a representation of an ETF not an ETF itself. (For non-crypto investors: It’s the difference between buying a $100000 sports car versus buying a $50 manual on how to build one).

The Reality Behind OTC Companies

All this might remind cynics of the Fyre Festival fiasco a luxury music festival in 2017 that ended with thousands getting stranded on an island in the Bahamas. While concert-goers were promised “a luxurious getaway on a private island of Exuma live music from top artists and partying with famous celebrities” people mostly ended up with leaking tents and Styrofoam-packed dinners. Many will fondly remember the viral photo of a cheese sandwich meant for the crew.

But VC investors and HUMBL fans would rightly disagree. HUMBL’s press releases look much like a startup pitchbook — filled with entrepreneurial dreams visions and test cases of where the products might finally fit in. But while VC investors have steeled themselves against overselling the same can’t be said of penny stock investors who sent TSNP stock to the moon.

Still More Questions

In a post-regulation world some might find this early stage investing rather exciting. TSNP stock would have made any quick-thinking penny stock investors extraordinarily rich. And virtually all VC-funded startups go through a “fake-it-til-you-make-it” cycle to raise capital and build world-beating products. It’s not clear if that’s what’s going on here. After all HUMBL’s BLOCK ETX product for instance has incredible real-world applications.

There’s also a hero element: Brian Foote. HUMBL’s CEO has probably become a billionaire thanks to his initial investment in the firm – a feat that takes most successful startup founders years not two months to achieve. (That’s of course if he bought at least 20% of the company in its penny-stock days).

But OTC investing also has costs: Those who bought at the top of the TSNP ride would have seen their wealth get torpedoed as TSNP stock sank back below $1. And Mr. Foote is under no obligation to build the products his firm has promised to bring. With virtually zero reporting requirements he could readily sell his shares and walk away from the company without anyone ever knowing. Its acquisitions of unrelated businesses might also worry investors who would rather see HUMBL build out its core crypto products.

What Can We Learn?

Audited financial statements aren’t perfect — plenty of companies stretch reality and even sometimes fake their numbers. But they’re the most objective source of truth that investors have. Since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act passed in 2002 corporate executives now face jail time for filing misleading financial statements.

Early stage investors however don’t have that luxury. Instead they’re faced with companies like HUMBL: A black box that could be the next PayPal or (very often) the next zero. Studies show the average OTC investment drops 60% every year.

So which one is it? HUMBL investors had collectively lost $4 billion since the stock peaked in early February before seeing an equally fast ride back up. But it’s only when the company re-lists on a major exchange and publishes audited statements that investors will finally find out what’s under the hood.

Until then we can all hang onto the dream that only penny stocks VC-funded companies and slot machines can provide — that magical ticket that might one day turn out to be a beautiful winner.

La tension monte au sein de l'Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Grenoble. Alors que ces dernières semaines ont été marquées par le débat sur ""l’islamo-gauchisme"" dans les universités l'établissement est en proie à une vive polémique après les accusations d'islamophobie visant deux professeurs. Une enquête a notamment été ouverte par le parquet pour ""injure publique"" et ""dégradation"" après que les noms de ces deux professeurs ont été affichés publiquement à l'entrée de l'institution. Sur Europe 1 Klaus Kinzler l'un des deux professeurs visés a accepté de revenir sur les événements niant tout propos islamophobe et regrettant au passage le manque de soutien de ses collègues.

""Une campagne de dénigrement et de diffamation sur Facebook""

Pour ce professeur d'allemand qui enseigne à l'IEP depuis 25 ans tout a débuté au mois de novembre. La polémique le concernant serait née après un groupe de travail informel constitué d'enseignants et d'étudiants pour préparer la semaine de ""l'Égalité et contre les discriminations"". ""Je m'étais inscrit pour préparer une journée thématique au titre : racisme islamophobie antisémitisme (...). Je comptais contester dans la discussion avec ma collègue et mes étudiants cet alignement de ces trois termes dans une seule thématique"" a-t-il raconté sur BFMTV.

Après une controverse entre enseignants c'est ensuite qu'une partie ""radicalisée"" des étudiants ""ont lancé une campagne de dénigrement et de diffamation sur Facebook en faisant de moi un extrémiste de droite et un islamophobe"".

""On a essayé de me punir""

Mais plus que l'attitude de ces étudiants Klaus Kinzler fustige celle de ses collègues dont ""une bonne partie ne me soutiennent pas ou pas vraiment"". Ces derniers estime-t-il ""sont très loin à gauche et ont plutôt ont des sympathies pour ceux qui défendent le terme islamophobie"".

""On a essayé de me punir"" poursuit-il. ""Et ce ne sont pas les étudiants mais mes collègues pour le fait d'avoir exprimé un avis différent de la doxa d'extrême-gauche dans ce chapitre."" Et d'assurer : ""Je n'ai jamais dit quoi que ce soit d'islamophobe"".

""Je ne veux pas trop dramatiser""

Revenant sur les affiches mentionnant son nom le professeur d'allemand assure que cela ne ""l'émeut pas outre-mesure"". ""Les méthodes de l'UNEF et des plus extrémistes des étudiants n'ont pas changé depuis 50 ans"" relativise-t-il. ""Il n'y a rien de bien nouveau."" Et Klaus Kinzler refusant tout parallèle avec la situation de Samuel Paty assassiné au mois d'octobre. ""C'est un débat entre universitaires je ne veux pas trop dramatiser"" répond-il. ""Ce que je regrette c'est que je ne sois pas soutenu par la plupart de mes collègues qui sont plus proches de ces étudiants extrêmes que de moi qui suis un libéral centriste convaincu depuis 40 ans. C'est ça qui m'effraie beaucoup plus que ce qu'ont fait les étudiants.""

""Je n'ai pas peur du tout"" poursuit Klaus Kinzler interrogé sur un éventuel sentiment d'insécurité. ""Je n'ai pas été menacé ni physiquement ni par des lettres"" précise-t-il racontant recevoir des centaines de mails ""extrêmement positifs solidaires"". L'enseignant rechigne d'ailleurs à porter plainte contre les étudiants. ""Pourquoi punir des étudiants qui sont jeunes immatures parfois bêtes ?"" interroge-t-il. ""Je n'ai rien contre eux. Moi j'aime les jeunes et j'aime bien discuter avec eux.""

""Rester debout et défendre la liberté""

""J'ai presque plus envie de porter plainte contre ceux de mes collègues qui publiquement m'ont sans aucun fondement accusé de harcèlement et d'atteinte morale violente uniquement parce que j'ai exprimé un différend dans un dialogue interne par mail avec une collègue"" conclut Klaus Kinzler qui confie ses doutes quant à l'attitude à adopter les prochains jours. ""J'ai un peu envie de me couper de ca je ne suis pas loin de péter un câble. Mais en même temps j'ai envie d'aller jusqu'au bout de rester debout et de défendre la liberté dans le milieu académique.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91ZXN0LWZyYW5jZS5mci9wYXlzLWRlLWxhLWxvaXJlL2NoYWxsYW5zLTg1MzAwL2NoYWxsYW5zLWFudGhvbnktZ3V5b24tb3V2cmUtdW4tYXRlbGllci1kZWRpZS1hdS12ZWxvLTcxNzgwNDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Challans.

D’une longueur de 54130 mètres cette infrastructure répond à un type de structure mixte reliant l’acier et le béton. Elle contribue ainsi au désenclavement intérieur et extérieur de notre pays et à la croissance économique tout en assurant la continuité du trafic sur le corridor Bamako-Dakar par le nord de la ville de Kayes.

Journée historique dans la cité des rails marquée par une cérémonie des grands jours 22 ans après la mise en service du 1er pont. Pour l’occasion quelques membres du Gouvernement des Autorités politiques administratives et traditionnelles de Kayes étaient présents. Cette infrastructure vient ainsi décongestionner le trafic sur l’ancien pont qui de par sa conception et son âge ne répondait plus aux exigences techniques de circulation : « En effet 80% du trafic poids lourd soit environ 1000 camions transitent quotidiennement par le 1er pont. Cette énorme pression a rendu la structure de l’ouvrage très fragile et exposé les usagers à des risques majeurs d’insécurité » a déclaré Makan Fily DABO ministre des Transports et des Infrastructures.

La réalisation du 2ème pont est aussi l’aboutissement d’un long combat de l’ensemble de la jeunes Kayésienne : « Le samedi 16 juin 2016 la plateforme des associations de jeunes de Kayes avait organisé une marche pacifique allant du pont de Kayes Ndi au stade Bassi Coulibaly en traversant le pont à pied pour demander un nouveau pont moderne au Gouvernement du Mali » a relaté Boubacar NIANE le représentant de la Plateforme des Associations de la jeunesse de Kayes.

Au-delà de l’amélioration de la fluidité du trafic souligne-t-il cet ouvrage assure désormais une liaison pérenne entre Bamako et le port de Dakar en contribuant au renforcement de l’intégration économique et de la coopération sous régionale les échanges commerciaux et à la réduction des coûts de transports ainsi que le temps de parcours. Il favorise le développement de la recherche et l’extraction des ressources minières et donc contribuerait à la réduction de la pauvreté dans la région.

Il sera aussi un soutien du développement réel de la première région ajoutant qu’il s’agit d’un ouvrage d’utilité et de qualité. Mais au-delà ce sont d’autres ouvrages qui viendront pour consolider ces acquis notamment la réhabilitation du chemin de fer Bamako-Dakar. Et le Ministre DABO a rassuré l’ensemble des populations de la cité des rails de la détermination de son département dans la relance du trafic ferroviaire.

« Nous sommes résolument engagés au département sous l’autorité du Chef du Gouvernement à assurer la mise en œuvre du plan d’urgence de relance du chemin de fer Bamako-Kayes en vue de redonner espoir aux riverains et usagers des rails. Nous sommes conscients que la relance du trafic ferroviaire contribuera également entre autres à promouvoir l’économie locale à réduire la paupérisation à renforcer le ciment sociétal et surtout à prolonger la durée de vie de nos routes » a-t-il indiqué.

Selon Moctar OUANE qui a procédé à la coupure symbolique du ruban cette cérémonie marque la concrétisation d’une aspiration fondamentale de tous les maliens en général et de tous les Kayesiens en particulier : « le 2ème pont est le prolongement de la route qui relie Kayes au reste du Mali ouvre la ville aux échanges multiples et vient renforcer son intégration économique sociale et culturelle. Ce pont à ne pas douter constitue un puissant vecteur de communication et de désenclavement. Il contribue également à l’esthétique urbaine et à l’amélioration de la sécurité routière » a-t-il déclaré.

Il convient de noter que le financement des deux lots des travaux de construction du 2ème Pont sur le fleuve Sénégal et ses routes d’accès a été entièrement pris en charge par le budget national pour un coût global de 58 156 134 751 F CFA TTC.

AFRIQUE Congo-Présidentielle : Denis Sassou-N’Guesso a lancé sa campagne à Pointe-Noire

Alwihda Info | Par Olive Jonala - 6 Mars 2021



La place de la République ex rond-point Lumumba dans la ville océane était noire de monde le 05 mars 2021. Les populations de Pointe-Noire venues par millier n’ont pas été effrayées par le soleil caniculaire qui illuminait leur cité ce vendredi. Elles voulaient écouter Denis Sassou-N’Guesso candidat à l’élection présidentielle du 21 mars 2021 à l’occasion du meeting de lancement de sa campagne.





La campagne électorale pour la présidentielle du 21 mars 2021 s’est ouverte ce vendredi 05 mars. Candidat à sa propre succession à la tête du Congo Denis Sassou-N’Guesso a lancé sa campagne électorale au bord de l’océan comme il l’avait promis. Une marée humaine l’a accompagné depuis l’aéroport jusqu’au site retenu pour le méga meeting déjà pris d’assaut par une autre foule compacte. Les deux se sont fondues à l’instar d’un fleuve qui déverse ses eaux dans la mer. En effet cette foule immense venue de l’aéroport s’est mêlée à celle qui depuis des heures était massée avec allégresse à la place de la République.



Le méga meeting de lancement de la campagne du candidat de la majorité présidentielle a ainsi mobilisé plusieurs couches sociales de la capitale économique du Congo. Plusieurs messages ont été délivrés tous assurant le candidat du soutien de toutes les forces vives composant la population de Pointe-Noire.



Du message de la jeunesse à celui du directeur national de campagne du candidat en passant par ceux des femmes et des personnes vivant avec handicap il s’est dégagé deux constances : la reconnaissance par les couches sociales de la ville océane de la détermination du président candidat à développer son pays et l’engagement de ces différentes couches sociales à accorder leurs suffrages au candidat Denis Sassou-N’Guesso.



La foule enthousiaste avait déjà soif d’écouter le président candidat. Celui-ci a sans texte livré un message d’espoir. Denis Sassou-N’Guesso a en effet assuré ses concitoyens qu’il incarne la stabilité et l’expérience au sommet de l’Etat. « Dans le contexte actuel de la crise nous avons levé l’option de mettre notre expérience à la disponibilité de la jeunesse pour conserver la paix et poursuivre le cap fixé vers le développement » a clamé le candidat.



Il a présenté son nouveau projet de société intitulé « Ensemble poursuivons la marche » : il est le prolongement du programme du mandat qui s’achève a-t-il expliqué avant d’en commenter le contexte. Le nouveau projet de société a commenté le candidat Sassou-N’Guesso s’articule en neuf points en énumérant quelques-uns à l’instar de ce qu’il a appelé le vaste programme de « développement soutenu de l’agriculture au sens large ».



Pour lui l’agriculture est le plus sûr moyen à notre portée de lutter efficacement à la fois contre le chômage la pauvreté l’urbanisation non maîtrisée la désarticulation du territoire national l’insécurité alimentaire et le déficit du commerce extérieur ». Il s’agira pour l’Etat de mécaniser l’agriculture et d’aider les exploitants agricoles. A propos de la mécanisation le candidat de la majorité présidentielle a illustré cette volonté par l’implantation dans la zone industrielle de Maloukou [non loin de Brazzaville] d’une unité de montage des tracteurs destinés à la modernisation de l’agriculture. L’objectif est de poursuivre le développement afin d’assurer l’indépendance alimentaire du pays mais aussi de diversifier l’économie nationale en la sortant de sa dépendance au pétrole a-t-il martelé.



Denis Sassou-N’Guesso a en outre pris l’engagement de construire une fois réélu pendant son prochain mandat une université à Pointe-Noire avec vocation de former des cadres en adéquation avec le marché de l’emploi. Avant de clore son propos le candidat Denis Sassou-N’Guesso a invité ses électeurs à transformer leur mobilisation et engagement de ce jour en bulletins de vote dans l’urne le 21 mars 2021 pour une victoire dès le premier tour.

Four human skeletons - all missing their hands and feet - had been discovered buried inside the villa of Hermann Goering.

The remains were found at Wolf's Lair in February. The area which is in modern-day Poland served as Hitler's chief headquarters from 1941-1944 when it was part of Germany.

The compound of about 200 Nazi bunkers and military barracks hidden in deep woods was the site of the failed assassination attempt on Hitler by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg on 20 July 1944.

Wolf's Lair was destroyed by German Nazi forces as they retreated in early 1945 to prevent it falling into the hands of the approaching Soviet Red Army. What is left is now a tourist attraction.

Local Polish prosecutor Daniel Brodowski said police officers secured the remains after they were found by a local group Latebra which searches for historical objects.

A forensic investigation was carried out to try and establish if manslaughter had occurred but was discontinued due to a lack of evidence that a crime had been committed he said.

But due to advanced decay of the remains it was no longer possible to determine the cause of death he said noting that at least several dozen years had passed.

Then the suspect’s relative is found dead in the gunman’s home,"CNN —

An armed man gave no warning as he walked toward the front of Jesus’ Dwelling Place Church in Pennsylvania on Sunday raised a gun toward the pastor’s face and pulled the trigger.

What happened next may have been divine intervention Pastor Glenn Germany said.

“I’m thankful to God that I’m still here because he definitely pulled the trigger” Germany told CNN affiliate WTAE.

The gunman “attempted to shoot but the firearm failed to discharge” Pennsylvania State Police said in a statement.

The incident in North Braddock was captured on the church’s livestreamed video. Immediately after the gunman pulled the trigger a church member tackled the suspect to the ground.

Police say Bernard Polite tried to shoot a pastor in North Braddock but the gun wouldn't discharge. Jesus' Dwelling Place Church

State police identified the suspect as 26-year-old Bernard Junior Polite.

It’s not clear why the suspect tried to shoot the pastor. Germany said he had never seen the gunman before Sunday WTAE reported.

“All of a sudden I just seen a gun pointing right at me” the pastor told the affiliate. “And at that point all I could do was run for cover.”

As Germany ran and hid behind a lectern the church’s cameraman rushed the gunman and tackled him to the ground according to WTAE. The pastor quickly emerged from behind the lectern and helped subdue the suspect.

Polite faces charges of attempted criminal homicide aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person court records show.

He was arraigned early Monday morning and was denied bail. He is being held at Allegheny County Jail and his preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 13.

It was not immediately clear if Polite has an attorney.

After the attempted shooting at the church police found the body of a man who was shot in Polite’s home Allegheny County police told CNN. The homicide victim was identified as 56-year-old Derek Polite a relative of the suspect from the church incident.

“County Police can confirm Bernard Polite a suspect in a previous incident Sunday morning at a North Braddock church is known to live at the residence where the shooting occurred and is a relative of the shooting victim” police spokesperson Jim Madalinsky told CNN in an email.

“At this point no charges have been filed in connection with the homicide and it remains an active investigation.”

A makeshift United defence that included Casemiro at centre-back was easily picked apart by Palace on several occasions as Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell joined the scoresheet in the impressive win.

- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga Bundesliga more (U.S.)

United remain in eighth place with 54 points from 35 games two points behind Newcastle United in sixth with their hopes of European football next season fading fast. Palace are still in 14th with 43 points from 36 matches.

United had several injury absentees and were without Bruno Fernandes the first time in his 230-game Old Trafford career he has missed a match with injury but the ease with which they were beaten will be a huge concern for everyone at the club.

""A big disappointment. We just had an off-day and we weren't in it"" midfielder Christian Eriksen told the BBC. ""It is what it is. We can't really change the injury things. We have to do what we can on the pitch to change it.

""Today it didn't matter who we played. Everyone could have done better. We tried to do what we could but we were not good enough. We'll take the blame as players.""

It is the first time in the Premier League era United have lost 13 games in a season and the scoreline might have been worse.

Palace have found their groove under new manager Oliver Glasner but United are limping to the end of a season that cannot finish soon enough for Ten Hag.

The home side took the lead inside 12 minutes and it was far too easy. Olise collected a throw and evaded a limp challenge from Casemiro and with no United player attempting to close him down was able to unleash a low shot from just inside the box.

United had the ball in the back of the net from Casemiro's header but the effort was ruled out after contact from Rasmus Højlund on Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson.

It was 2-0 to the home side five minutes before the break as Mateta breezed past United defender Jonny Evans and thrashed the ball into the net for a ninth goal in 11 games since the arrival of Glasner in February.

The striker had scored 11 goals in his previous 80 games for Palace.

United's defence was struggling to contain the movement of their hosts and when Diogo Dalot failed to deal with a ball to the back post Mitchell had a tap-in with home players queuing up to score.

Olise's second goal added more salt to the wound and it could have been worse for the visitors as Odsonne Édouard saw his shot come back off the woodwork late on.

""I think we could have got a few more. That shows the potential we have to play against any team in the league"" Palace defender Chris Richards said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvdHJ1bXAtaHVzaC1tb25leS10cmlhbC1wYXBlci10cmFpbC1jaGVja3MtMDAxNTY0MDjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Forget the sex. Check out those titillating invoices at the Trump hush money trial.,"Jurors did see Trump’s Sharpie-crafted signature on several $35000 checks that were drawn from Trump’s personal bank account and sent to Michael Cohen in 2017. Prosecutors hope jurors will conclude that Trump was personally involved in Cohen’s arrangement of hush money to keep porn star Stormy Daniels quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump.

But the salacious details were entirely absent Monday as attorneys grilled a former Trump Organization financial controller and a current bookkeeper about “accounts payable” and the nuts and bolts of how money moved through the massive company. In many of the instances at issue in the case these witnesses said the money ultimately moved at the direction of Trump himself.

The sense of abrupt deceleration stemmed in part from sky-high expectations for an explosive confrontation between Trump and Cohen or live testimony from one or both of Trump’s alleged paramours who figure in the case: Daniels and Karen McDougal a former Playboy Playmate who got a payout from Trump allies at the National Enquirer.

For court watchers hoping for that level of drama they’ll need to wait at least another day — or possibly much longer. Prosecutors revealed on Monday afternoon that they still have about two weeks’ worth of witnesses to go.

Defense attorneys meanwhile appeared to revel in the prosecution’s responsibility for the tedium and mercifully offered up only cursory cross-examination of both witnesses: former controller Jeffrey McConney and accounts payable clerk Deborah Tarasoff. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche’s questioning of Tarasoff took only five minutes.

“The checks that we just went through for the past hour and a half…” Blanche said as he opened one of his few questions to Tarasoff who’s worked for Trump for 24 years and gave Trump’s son Eric Trump a smile and a pat on the leg as she returned to the courtroom after a break.

As prosecutors plodded through the documents Monday they did draw out some subtext and nuances suggesting to jurors that there was an unusual air of secrecy and irregularity around the payments to Cohen. The documents associated with those payments — including the checks that prosecutors laboriously displayed — are the very business records that Trump is accused of falsifying in violation of a New York law on corporate fraud.

McConney testified that he was instructed to make the payments to Cohen at a brief meeting in 2016 with Trump’s then-CFO Allen Weisselberg. The controller said that while the payments were recorded as legal expenses pursuant to a “retainer agreement” they did not go through the Trump Organization’s legal department as such payments typically did.

Emails suggested Cohen was slow to understand that Trump’s accountants wanted invoices to support the monthly $35000 payments Cohen received.

“A lot of people ask for money. I need an invoice” McConney explained matter of factly.

When McConney reiterated that requirement to Cohen Cohen offered a somewhat puzzling reply: “Jeff Please remind me of the monthly amount.”

Cohen also at first simply typed in a few lines under the word “Invoice” in an email. He later sent monthly invoices to Weisselberg — but often curiously continued to omit the amount.

In later testimony Tarasoff said she checked with McConney and Weisselberg on those invoices and confirmed that Cohen was due $35000 each month.

Prosecutors’ suggestion of subterfuge and irregularity around the payments could be harnessed later to suggest Donald Trump’s consciousness of guilt on a key element in elevating the business-records charges from misdemeanors to felonies: that he knew the hush money payment to Daniels was legally required to be reported as a campaign contribution and that he conspired with others to hide it.

Trump’s attorneys disputed that there was any unusual secrecy around the payments and have suggested that any discretion around the matter was to protect Trump’s wife Melania and other members of his family not to influence the 2016 presidential election or to circumvent the more esoteric and debatable aspects of campaign finance law.

While prosecutors have seized on the categorization of the payments as “legal expenses” in Trump Organization bookkeeping records as a flagrant falsehood McConney said under cross-examination that label was simply one of a limited number of choices in “a drop-down menu” in the dated computer system used by Trump’s finance personnel.

“These categories: There was a level of rigidity to them right? … If you’re talking about payment to an attorney legal expenses was the account that was used” Trump lawyer Emil Bove asked McConney who readily agreed.

And while the prosecution made much of McConney keeping his notes about the structure of the payments to Cohen in a locked drawer the controller said that was standard practice for most of what he had in his office since it contained information on employee payroll and bonuses.

“I had a lot of sensitive information” McConney said.

While few reporters were seen gripping the courtroom’s wooden armrests Monday the hush money trial has featured an unusual dose of suspense for journalists — and for Trump’s defense attorneys. That’s because prosecutors have been unusually guarded about their schedule for the witnesses they plan to call each day.

The judge Juan Merchan has refused to order that sort of routine disclosure citing Trump’s public comments about witnesses and his repeated violations of the judge’s gag order.

Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said Monday that the prosecution has been voluntarily telling Trump’s attorneys “the day before” about whom the government plans to call the following day. “We did not want to have the next witnesses’ names out there” Steinglass said.

The most attention-grabbing developments of the day — the judge’s renewed threat to throw Trump in jail if he again violates the gag order and Trump’s defiant statement at day’s end that he’d proudly become a political prisoner if necessary — both took place out of earshot of the jury.

Most members of the jury remained attentive through the long slog Monday but one seemed visibly bored by the repetitive testimony. During the morning session he stared out into the gallery largely filled with reporters. By the afternoon he was resting his head in his hands as the documents popped up on small video monitors in front of the jurors and oversize ones mounted on the walls of the courtroom.

Olivia Indre however will have her artwork transported around Lake County for all to see on a 35-foot transit vehicle as the top winner in Laketran’s “Design a Bus Wrap” art contest.

The Mentor High School senior recently took first prize for her design entry themed “For a Greener Future.”

Consequently as the top winner Indre’s design will be displayed on one of Laketran’s Local Route buses for six months.

“I am honored for my art design to be chosen – it’s obviously the biggest form of art of mine I’ve ever seen and I think art is one of the most profound ways to bring awareness to important issues like protecting the environment” she said.

“I really wanted to highlight the environmental benefits of public transit in this design because I think it is important to recognize that Laketran’s services help to cut down on air pollution and fuel dependency which creates a better future for all of us.

“I also feel that this bus design serves as a good introduction to the eventual addition of the first battery-operated electric busses to join its fleet later in the year” Indre added. “This contest was a great opportunity for students to use their passion for design to share what our community means to us and the benefits of public transit.”

The contest which received over 75 entries was open to middle school high school and college students from Lake County (or students attending a Lake County school) homeschooled students and students enrolled in art school.

Entrants were encouraged to design a bus wrap displaying the theme “Lake County Pride” and could include iconic images of Lake County and/or promote public transportation.

A panel of transit employees graphic art professionals and community leaders served as judges for the contest.

Due to its success Laketran officials confirmed the contest the first of its kind will now be held annually.

“We are thrilled with the amount of interest the contest received from our community” said Laketran CEO Ben Capelle. “We have a lot of talented artists here in Lake County and the entries were impressive. Encouraging local students to think about public transportation and being able to combine that with public art is a unique and fun opportunity that we will continue to offer Lake County students in the future.”

Avery Dennison Corp. a Lake County-based manufacturer and distributor of pressure-sensitive adhesive materials donated the vinyl material used to wrap the vehicle.

“Avery Dennison is committed to the communities where we live and work” said Daralyn Baldogo senior marketing communications specialist for Avery Dennison Graphics Solutions. “We welcome opportunities where our employees and our products can make a meaningful impact and help others. The art contest for Laketran was an immediate opportunity where we could provide support appreciation for public art initiatives and value to the community.”

Capelle added the agency is grateful for Avery Dennison’s “generosity and desire” to make a meaningful impact in the community.

The sub-4m compact-SUV is also the cheapest one in its segment and has a starting price of INR 5.45 lakh. It is based on the CMFA+ platform which also underpins the Nissan Magnite. The Kiger is welcomed by the Indian audience with a warm response. The deliveries of Kiger began on March 3 and the brand managed to hand over 1100 units of the Kiger on the very day. Indeed some consumers have already started to modify their possessions. We recently came across a modified example of the Renault Kiger via the YouTube channel of Car Stylein.

In the video the host showcases a brand new example of the Renault Kiger. It is in fact the top-spec RXZ trim of the sub-4m compact-SUV. Talking of the modifications the tuning house has wrapped the top half of the car in Avery Dennison’s glossy black vinyl wrap to give it a dual-tone treatment. And the complete car has now undergone a ceramic treatment which is designed to preserve its shine. Sadly these are the only changes on the outside.

Interestingly the tuner has managed to revamp the interior to a great extent. It now features a black-tan dual-tone theme for the cabin. The pillars are now finished in a tan shade while a faux wood insert is used on the dashboard. A similar treatment can also be seen on the door handles. Moreover the seats are upholstered in leather and don a dual-tone appeal like the steering wheel. On the centre console the tuner has infused a little vibrancy with the use of tan colour for the wireless charging pad.

To accentuate the interior furthermore the upholstery features dual-tone white-brown stitching and a diamond-type quilt pattern. The host also reveals the cost of these modifications which is somewhere around INR 32000. The Kiger is currently on sale with 2 engine options – 1.0L NA petrol and 1.0L turbo-petrol. While the former develops 72 PS/96 Nm the latter churns out 100 PS/160 Nm. The gearbox options on the Renault Kiger include a 5-speed MT 5-speed AMT and a CVT.

A veteran officer said no. His name was Derek Chauvin and as the world now knows he was kneeling on George Floyd’s neck. Lane was holding down a leg Officer J. Alexander Kueng had a knee on Floyd’s lower back and Officer Tou Thao was standing guard nearby.

After three final calls of “please” according to transcripts filed with the court George Floyd had stopped talking.

“This was murder” Minneapolis Chief of Police Medaria Arradondo would say of the May 25 killing at the corner of 38th and Chicago in south Minneapolis — an event which unleashed waves of protest and a global call for reckoning over the treatment of Black Americans at the hands of police.

In a trial set to weigh murder charges against Chauvin beginning on Monday March 8 a Minneapolis jury will decide if they agree with the city’s top officer of the law. The three other officers will face charges of aiding and abetting later this summer.

Hennepin County Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker has noted cardiac arrest during police ""subdual restraint and neck compression"" as the cause of death. Baker noted but did not attribute meaning to the presence of heart disease and drugs in Floyd's system.

Armed Forces Medical Examiner Dr. Paul Uribe has added ""elements of positional and mechanical asphyxiation"" to this determination. The world has remained fixated on the sight of Chauvin’s knee on Floyd’s neck.

But Lane’s odd remark in the middle of the slow-motion killing raises another troubling question whether contested research has led officers to misidentify the factors at work during death in custody and if that worsens the treatment of those being restrained.

For nearly 9 minutes Chauvin Lane and Kueng remained atop a prone man immobilized in handcuffs conditions known for decades as capable of causing sudden death from a process alternately known as compression- positional- or “restraint asphyxia.”

Yet Lane listed “excited delirium” as the reason for his worry and repeated this arcane term during an interview with investigators.

This would suggest compression asphyxia has become entangled in the minds of officers with the contentious psychiatric diagnosis that is ""excited delirium."" The officers clearly believed a related fallacy — that asphyxia cannot occur in the presence of speaking.

With the eyes of the world on the refusal by Chauvin to lift his knee the failure of his fellow officers to force him and whatever plans the defense may have for assigning blame to the methamphetamine and fentanyl in George Floyd’s system a separate question still lingers:

How did prone restraint a known risk whereby officers can kill become co-opted by excited delirium an exotic determination in which police are held blameless? Did policing science play a role?

'I can’t breathe'

Floyd had been saying ""I can't breathe"" since before Lane and Kueng tried to get him into the back of their patrol car. Now he was saying it from the ground.

Twenty years earlier this kind of warning from the mouth of a prone handcuffed subject might have led Lane to worry about restraint asphyxia. Instead he would tell Chauvin and investigators he was worried about something called “excited delirium.”

A term for catatonic madness dating to the age of the asylums beginning in the 1980s excited delirium had become slowly resurrected within policing research to describe police actions involving agitated people acting in a bizarre fashion.

As presented in studies often funded by policing interests like the manufacturers of Taser  excited delirium can make a person hyperthermic and incoherent violent hallucinatory and unpredictable.

Excited delirium has been invoked in connection to fatalities after being stunned by conducted-electricity weapons while on stimulant drugs and almost exclusively while being restrained by police.

Persons with excited delirium are usually encountered naked moving aimlessly perspiring and in a state of disorientation.

This raises a question: Are police called to the scene of those about to die from a mysterious condition? Or is the excessive restraint of those in such a state the true cause of death?

Policing materials assert there has been evidence of death from excited delirium without police on the scene in the form of people found naked and surrounded by cold and wet towels. Research has found no evidence of death from excited delirium without restraint.

""Excited delirium is a medical emergency usually brought on by acute drug intoxication or psychiatric illness"" Dr. Judy Melinek wrote in an email to Forum News Service last summer. Melinek is a forensic medical examiner and author unaffiliated with the case formerly based in California now practicing in New Zealand.

She adds that in the video evidence there was never any reason to suspect excited delirium in George Floyd.

""In the bystander and restaurant videos” Melinek says “Mr. Floyd appeared to be responding and talking to the officers and once restrained he was speaking clearly that he couldn’t breathe; he also wasn’t dressed inappropriately for the weather and didn’t appear to be sweating profusely. All of these facts argue against excited delirium as being the cause of death or a significant contributor.""

Contrary to police training that people with excited delirium can ""just snap"" catatonic madness took weeks to evolve. Critics assert excited delirium is a phantom diagnosis used to exonerate officers charged with murder. It is accepted by some medical societies but not others.

""They always try to bring it up in a case where a person dies and there’s any drugs in their system"" says Minneapolis attorney Robert Bennett who could not speak to the specifics of the Floyd killing. ""It’s a charade that’s meant to capture the public’s opinions and acquit police officers and find them not liable.""

A separate problem seems to be the way in which a heightened urgency surrounding excited delirium has fogged over the risks of asphyxia.

Lane told investigators he learned about excited delirium while working at juvenile detention then again at the Minneapolis Police Academy where they taught him “when someone is on drugs they kind of work themselves up and they can have issues from that.”

In that interview  he never mentioned restraint asphyxia.

The discovery of restraint asphyxia

First reported in the late 1980s and early 1990s by a Seattle-area forensic pathologist named Dr. Donald T. Reay “restraint asphyxia” reflected the chief medical examiner’s determination that you can accidentally kill a person who is prone and handcuffed while under compression.

As Reay would argue — and as surgeons have known for almost 60 years — when you place a person on their stomach and take away their ability to shift position the abdomen cannot expand the diaphragm is disabled and the brain can become deprived of oxygen.

Add compression obesity struggle disease stimulants or stress to the equation Reay wrote and sudden death can result.

“The original studies on asphyxia were done by Dr. Reay” said John Ryan co-director of the Legal & Liability Risk Management Institute and a trainer for police departments on safe uses of force. “Dr. Reay said position and compression weight on somebody's back could compromise breathing.”

Ryan who agreed to be interviewed on the condition he could not speak to the particulars of the Floyd killing says that today “I think in most of the country they are being trained to immediately get off the person and they're being trained that it can cause harm. I train thousands of officers per year and that's certainly what I train them.”

He has also learned however ""that a number of trainers misunderstand the issues related to positional asphyxia and prone restraint"" as he wrote on his blog last fall. Some police trainers erroneously believe it has been debunked Ryan says something he calls dangerous.

Reay made his discovery while investigating the cause of death for three hog-tied subjects who died during rides downtown on the back of a police cruiser. As he wrote in 1992 in The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology  “it is obvious that any restraint that prevents a change in position could restrict breathing.”

His work was eventually joined by lab studies demonstrating cardiovascular and pulmonary harms from prone restraint many of which can be found in an extensive online archive dedicated to the question  a website maintained by a retired EMT and restraint asphyxia advocate named Charly D. Miller.

Reay who died in 2018 believed “each death (should) be evaluated using all available information especially historical and scene investigative material rather than relying on solely anatomic and toxicologic information.” The need for on-the-ground evidence in determining cause of death is underscored by the fact that there are often no physical signs of asphyxia .

“I’m not a witness for the defense or for the prosecution” Reay remarked on the occasion of his retirement in 1999. “I am a witness for the dead. I’m the one person who can say anything about that person’s last minutes on earth.”

Surgeons: Prone asphyxia is real

In sounding the alarm on restraint asphyxia Reay had identified a risk known to physicians for decades.

Surgical research has determined prone immobility restricts not only lung function but blood supply and heart rate  and that it can happen to both the lean and the obese.

To this day the need to let the abdomen move freely while immobilized is the reason why prior to spinal surgery or the “proning” of sedated COVID-19 ICU patients nurses will place pads elevating the shoulders and pelvis.

These findings have failed to quash an industrious effort to cast doubt upon restraint asphyxia one exhibiting many of the hallmarks of so-called ""industrial research"" including the involvement of scientists from private industry and the use of studies for legal defense in liability suits.

Much of the effort to ""debunk"" restraint asphyxia has been at the hands of University of San Diego emergency and pulmonary medicine specialists Dr. Ted Chan Dr. Gary Vilke and Dr. Tom Neuman.

A University of Minnesota bioengineering professor named Mark Kroll has published in opposition to restraint asphyxia as well. Kroll sits on the board of Axon Enterprise the manufacturers of Taser stun guns body cameras and facial-recognition AI software.

Chan's disclosure reveals that the decades-old body of research purporting to discredit restraint asphyxia began with work funded by legal counsel defending wrongful death charges against two sheriff's deputies in San Diego.

Working with nearly $34000 in funding Chan Vilke and Neuman with others conducted a study of blood oxygen levels in healthy volunteers who agreed to be trussed on their stomach after a short bout of exercise.

Critics said the conditions bore little resemblance to those of a true street arrest as the subjects were fit calm and lightly trussed on cushioning. A judge found for the defense however.

The physicians went on to provide papers chapters and expert witness testimony arguing for the safety of prone restraints and other elements of rough policing. All of this work suffers from a basic limitation — you cannot replicate the conditions experienced in a street arrest prior to death.

Though sworn to the care of patients the ER and pulmonary physicians-turned tough-policing advocates have nonetheless gone on to argue for the safe use of pepper spray  neck holds  stun guns  restraint chairs  hog-tying and most of all pressing down on the back of a person who cannot lift their chest .

Their work remains influential to this day with Chan’s research having been admitted as evidence in the Chauvin trial.

'The George Floyd case before George Floyd'

Upon his discovery of restraint asphyxia in the early 1990s Reay's warnings were soon heeded by police departments from Chicago to Wichita.

Dr. Charles Hirsch chief medical examiner for the city of New York argued that deaths from restraint asphyxia should be considered homicides. The Department of Justice issued an alert that officers should roll handcuffed persons on their side. The New York Police Department would eventually produce a safety video.

“You enter into a vicious cycle” Hirsch says in this video  “where compression causes air hunger air hunger creates struggle and struggle creates greater compression. The price of tranquility” it warned “is death.” Records show this same video was shown to officers of the Minneapolis Police Department. Whether it was heeded is another matter.

In 2013 Minneapolis settled a lawsuit with the family of a man named David Smith for $3.08 million one of the largest police brutality settlements in city history. Plaintiffs argued that Smith after being stunned and then compressed while handcuffed on his stomach died from compression asphyxia.

“One knelt between his scapula and the other straddled his buttocks and hip area” says Bennett the Minneapolis attorney. Bennett argued the case for Smith’s relatives and deposed Chan a witness for the city of Minneapolis for more than seven hours in February 2013 as part of that lawsuit. “He did that for about 6 minutes ... instead of turning him on his side ... which is how they are trained.”

Today while Bennet says the drugs in the two cases are different he calls Smith’s death “the George Floyd case before George Floyd.”

As a condition of that settlement Minneapolis agreed to train all officers on the dangers of restraint asphyxia.

Following the killing of Floyd Minneapolis Police Conduct Oversight Commission member Abigail Cerra asked the department what had been done to train officers about restraint asphyxia. In making her request Cerra says she never mentioned excited delirium.

“Initially I just got back a couple of items and it didn’t seem like very much since the lawsuit was settled in 2013” she says. “Like nothing had been done for the past six years and that felt wrong to me.”

Cerra eventually asked Katie Blackwell of the MPD Training Division who interceded on her behalf.

“A week after she called them they released the data to me” Cerra says. “I went through it and what I saw was a lot of information about excited delirium and very very little just a couple of mentions about positional asphyxiation. When I asked her about that she (said) that the two are related.”

Abigail Cerra pictured here in a recent meeting of the Minneapolis Police Conduct Oversight Commission asked the Minneapolis Police Department for information on restraint asphyxia. Instead they gave her information on excited delirium. Photo: Screencap from a recent meeting of the Minneapolis Police Conduct Oversight Commission.

Blackwell had written Cerra a letter stating that “excited delirium and positional asphyxiation are related; however two separate things” and that “those displaying signs of excited delirium are at higher risk to positional asphyxiation due to muscle exhaustion.”

“I can confirm that MPD fulfilled the training requirement” for positional asphyxia Minneapolis Police Chief Arradondo wrote in a response to Cerra's request last summer. “The reason for getting an arrestee into a recovery position is to prevent positional asphyxiation and the training covered situations where positional asphyxiation is of primary concern.”

Arradondo said that Chauvin and Thao “both had this training.”

MPD training materials submitted to Cerra on the causes of arrest-related death however call excited delirium the “main culprit” for such deaths. Slides list “insensitivity to pain” “superhuman strength” and “unlimited endurance” as characteristics of excited delirium.

These materials also included images of The Incredible Hulk Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining"" and “Fat Bastard” the uncontainable henchman from the ""Austin Powers"" movies. In Minneapolis training about airflow was accompanied by messages that subjects can suddenly become like animals.

“What the world didn’t hear in the Floyd case was an officer talking about the risks of asphyxiation” says Jeff Storms an attorney in the David Smith case who agreed to speak about only what is public in the Floyd case. “We should have heard officers talking about the risks of asphyxiation.”

Storms describes a department preoccupied with excited delirium all the way to the top.

“Even though they ultimately did not pursue an excited delirium defense” he recalls “you still had then-chief of police (Timothy) Dolan saying he believed David Smith died as a result of excited delirium which has no basis in science. They ultimately say delirium is a thing and we don’t understand it ... sometimes people just die from this delirium.”

At least one high-ranking Minnesota scientist believes that the causes of accidental death under restraint are often just unknown.

“Sometimes when people fight the police the human body just seems to run out of gas for reasons that aren’t understood” said the U of M adjunct professor of biomedical engineering Kroll in a 2017 interview with The Force Science Institute on “arrest-related deaths.”

A biomedical engineer whose work in electrocardiology has earned him hundreds of device patents and an award of distinction from former Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton Kroll is part of an industrious cluster of researchers to have ventured beyond their primary area of expertise by publishing studies in defense of tough policing.

It's an effort that is quick to deride Reay's work on restraint asphyxia as debunked an assertion the courts have rejected as well as the assertion that Reay somehow ""retracted"" his position in court testimony something he explicitly refuted.

In disclosure statements Kroll (no relation to former MPD union chief Bob Kroll) says he also works as an expert witness in use-of-force cases and sits on the scientific and corporate board of Axon Enterprise the company that makes Taser brand conducted energy weapons and bodycams.

Though he calls “arrest-related death biomechanics” his academic sub-specialty contacted last year to comment on the arrest-related killing of Floyd Kroll replied that he had not studied the effects of kneeling on the neck.

Contacted again last month Kroll did not respond to follow-up questions about his research.

Kroll made his 2017 remarks that people who fight the police “seem to just run out of gas” in one of his frequent appearances on the website for the Force Science Institute (FSI) a controversial Plymouth-based company that has published numerous articles on excited delirium and trains police departments from across the country.

At the time Kroll had just published a paper in the journal Medicine Science and the Law seeking to estimate how much weight officers can apply to a person before killing them. In interviews and writings however he had already described restraint asphyxia as a “thoroughly defunct theory"" however as well as a “ dying unscientific theory.”

Kroll’s 2017 investigation combined complex mathematical modeling the notes of 17th-century executioners and lay observations on NFL hog-piles. It concluded that roughly 600 pounds of compression was the breaking point for the adult male rib cage. The device expert-turned-tough policing scientist cited this work to mock restraint asphyxia on FSI as “crazy” and “junk causation with no basis in science. ”

Broken bones however are not a requirement for restraint asphyxia.

U of M study depicted officer knees very close to the neck

Kroll co-authored a 2019 paper with Michael Brave conducted through the U of M's Institutional Review Board. Brave’s biography states that he has worked as the National Litigation Counsel for TASER International Inc. a company known as Axon Enterprise since 2017.

The U of M study argued for the safety of knees on the upper back during handcuffing either one or two provided officers keep their weight “on the ball of their stabilizing foot.”

Photos that accompany the American Journal of Forensic Medicine paper show volunteers from Plymouth Minn. police department posing atop prone mannequins their knees just inches below where Derek Chauvin pressed his weight into George Floyd's neck.

MPD training materials submitted as exhibits in the Lane defense go further showing an officer with his weight on the ball of his stabilizing foot and his knee on the neck of a volunteer.

MPD training materials carry instructions to roll subjects on their side in order to avert positional asphyxia. They also show the placement of a knee on the neck similar to the method used in the killing of George Floyd . Photo: Traci Westcott/Rochester Post-Bulletin

Observers describe a former-MPD policy allowing neck holds using the leg as out-of-sync with the rest of the country.

""It should be noted that the Minneapolis policy which authorized the use of legs and contemplated putting pressure on one side of the neck is unique in the experience of these authors"" Ryan the use-of-force trainer noted last year on his blog.

“A person can die within minutes of compressive force on the neck” forensic examiner Melinek says. “It generally only takes 6 pounds of pressure to compress the jugular veins of the head and 11 pounds of pressure to compress the carotid arteries that bring oxygen to the brain.”

“So I am not in the police department” Minneapolis Police Conduct Oversight Commission member Cerra says “and I am not a medical professional. But from where I sit it does not seem like the message that positional asphyxia is a risk is getting down to the rank-and-file.”

“If we train officers that ‘hey this is all a bunch of baloney stay on top of somebody and it’s no problem because it’s not going to kill them” says Ryan “when it does the officer will be shocked in trial to find that there’s an expert on the other side saying and the judge allowing the expert to testify that in fact it does cause compromised breathing.”

Reay for his part believed positional asphyxia and excited delirium “are not mutually exclusive and may coexist.” He held similar views on the deadliness of restraint for persons with heart disease and on drugs.

“There will be deaths where cocaine methamphetamine and high levels of alcohol are present in which it becomes tempting to assign the cause of death solely to these intoxicants and to ignore or discount the final position in which the victim was found dead.”

Reay wrote those cautionary words in his first paper on the dangers of prone restraint a passage that anticipated issues soon to be weighed in a Minneapolis courtroom.

At the same time the discoverer of restraint asphyxia argued in an accompanying editorial  ""the pathology is often less important than are the investigative circumstances"" not to mention ""that most precious (and all too uncommon) of human attributes common sense.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

That’s how she stumbled on a deal that let her buy 12000 packets of oatmeal for $1200.

Similarly it was a surprise when she learned recently the Baker Hughes Foundation funded a $25000 grant for Backpack Buddies.

“We are proud to partner with charities like the Backpack Buddies of Douglas County” said Bently Nevada Vice President Ed J. Boufarah. “Bently Nevada is an active member of this community and we are honored to support this cause. No children should have to go without food or have to choose between food and school. We’re excited to provide this donation and to expand the reach and the kindness of Backpack Buddies even further.”

Bently Nevada a Baker Hughes business is headquartered in Minden.

“We’re extremely excited about this grant” Larson said. “It’s absolutely wonderful.”

Larson said the grant will help take the pressure off fundraising for a bit while the program focuses on enhancing the services it provides to schools and preschools.

“We will be able to buy things we need to have” she said. “There are certain things you can’t get from the food bank.”

Backpack Buddies distributed 47 tons of food last year.

The program has provided additional food to school children for the past 15 years.

Shares have lost about 7.5% in that time frame underperforming the S&P 500.

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release or is Ball due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.

Ball Corp Q4 Earnings & Sales Top Estimates Up Y/Y

Ball Corporation reported fourth-quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents. The bottom line also improved 14% on a year-over-year basis. The quarterly results reflect solid global beverage-can volume growth and aerospace backlog.

The Naas Ball in Kildare has become a national treasure over the past few years.

It's gained internet notoriety from memes being posted about it.

People love to crack an old joke about the Naas Ball but how many of us really know where it comes from?

In fact how many of us know that the Naas Ball isn't its proper name?

What is the Naas Ball actually called?

The Naas Ball's official name is 'Perpetual Motion'.

It was the winning art concept in an anonymous competition held by Kildare County Council in 1993.

Some thirty artists submitted proposals for Stage 1 of the competition.

Four proposals were short-listed for Stage II of the competition where more detailed and highly developed plans were examined.

Perpetual Motion won out was built at the site on the Naas bypass.

It was subsequently learnt that the artists Remco de Fouw and Rachael Joynt had jointly submitted this piece for the competition.

Who was behind the design?

Remco de Fouw holds an honours degree in Fine Art Sculpture from the National College of Art & Design.

He has exhibited at several prestigious shows including EV A R.H.A. ESPACE Oireachtas and Aer Riannta’s Gateway to Art.

He has also won awards from the Arts Council IONTAS and the Donal O’Morchada Travel award.

Previous commissions include sculptures for the Highschool Rathgar 1990 and Waterford Regional Hospital 192.

Rachael Joynt graduated with first class honours in sculpture from the National College of Art & Design.

She has exhibited in several group shows including ESPACE Oireachtas and Fernhill’s Sculpture in Context and she has had solo exhibitions at the Project Arts Centre and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland’s Gallery in Belfast. Commissions include People’s Island at D’Olier St. for the Dublin Millennium Solas na Glasrai at Moore St. and Wood Quay Walk Winetavern St. for Dublin Corporation and a sculpture at the Visitor’s Centre Kilrush Co. Clare for the O.P.W.

She has work in several collections including Bank of Ireland Allied Irish Banks and Temple Bar Properties.

What is the Naas Ball made from?

The Nass Ball is a hollow ferrocement sphere approximately 9 meters in diameter.

The colour and texture of the sphere is similar to a road surface and the various road markings depicted would are painted with a similar substance to that of actual roadmarkings.

The road arrows suggest the movement of air water currents over the surface of a globe and follow the main flow of traffic towards Dublin across the bridge and particularly along the turn off for Naas.

This emphasises the town’s geographical position in relation to the motorway.

In an artist's statement for the competition the ball is described as: ""As an element symbol of motion the sphere of its size with roadmarkings would act as an impressive yet integrated celebration of travel and motorway design.

""It would appeal to a broad cross-section of roadusers and be a lighthearted and distinctive landmark.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbGZhc3RsaXZlLmNvLnVrL3doYXRzLW9uL2FydHMtY3VsdHVyZS1uZXdzL3N0b3J5LWJlaGluZC1iZWxmYXN0cy1pY29uaWMtbnVhbGEtMTk5NzA0NzbSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWxmYXN0bGl2ZS5jby51ay93aGF0cy1vbi9hcnRzLWN1bHR1cmUtbmV3cy9zdG9yeS1iZWhpbmQtYmVsZmFzdHMtaWNvbmljLW51YWxhLTE5OTcwNDc2LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The story behind Belfast's iconic 'Nuala with the Hula' from the artist who designed her,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Belfast's Beacon of Hope fondly called 'Nuala with the hula' or 'the thing with the ring' has been gracing the Laganside skyline for almost 15 years.

The 'big lady' as her world renowned designer dubbed her stands 19.5 metres high at Thanksgiving Square in Belfast and was the brainchild of Belfast woman Myrtle Smyth who was inspired following a visit to Thanksgiving Square in Dallas Texas.

Her Scottish sculptor Andy Scott told us she was his biggest project at that time but he has since gone on to create imposing masterpieces gracing beach fronts and parks around the globe including the monumental Kelpies in his home country.

Now based in Philadelphia USA the in-demand artist took some time out from his busy schedule to talk to Belfast Live of his fond memories about Beacon of Hope came to be.

He told us: ""It was a fantastic project and she even made it onto Royal Mail postage stamps and was used in all sort of publicity material for Belfast - it was a real thrill to see.

""I was very proud of her and I remain very proud of her. It was just a great honour to have done the project. On a purely personal level I just loved my time in Belfast it was smashing.

""It was a lovely project to be involved in. I had done quite a few fairly large sculptures but at that point that was very much the biggest one and even now it's still a fairly prestigious and grand thing to have been involved in.""

As for her nicknames Andy says he first encountered them on an open top bus tour of Belfast when they were ""driving past the Queen's Bridge and you could see the sculpture"".

""I was feeling all proud of myself with my wife"" he explained ""and then the fella starts the commentary and says she's known as 'Nuala with the hula' and 'the doll with the ball' and I thought it was hilarious. As we were getting off the bus I said to the tour guide 'I made that sculpture' and he was like 'no way get out of it - fantastic'.

""I am very laid back about that type of thing - I think it shows it has been accepted by people and shows a sense of ownership.

""It was a real thrill to hear him talking about it and a wee bit about the background.

""Belfast was only just out of a very dark time and it was a very bold thing for people to have the courage and do such a big thing in the city. It was a really humbling experience to be part of it and I have to say Myrtle [Smyth] who was the driving force behind the whole thing was a lovely lady.""

Andy said he was first approached about the project in the early 2000s a number of years before it was finally complete.

""It was a long long time ago"" he explained.

(Image: Artist contributed)

""Originally the design competition was a building which was going to be used for peace and reconciliation. The concept behind it was inspired by a place in Dallas Texas which was called Thanksgiving Square.

""The people who had conceived of this project in Belfast were aware of it and they wanted something that would create a multi-faith multi-denominational everybody space for contemplation.

""The architect came up with a building and asked me to come up with a central artwork feature for it which I did.""

Sadly the building was shelved but since ""they had gathered a great head of steam for the sculpture itself"" Andy said the architect ""nobly walked away from the project"" and ""handed over the remaining sculpture to me to take it forward"".

(Image: Artist contributed)

But he said he couldn't have done it without support from original architects Hurd Roland the Royal Society of Ulster Architects' Frank McCloskey driving force Myrtle Smyth ""who has sadly passed away now"" Clive Graham of Laganside Development Corporation Mike Clarke at Kirk McClure Morton which managed the structural engineering.

He also mentioned Dennis Rooney of Dennis Rooney Associates who was ""influential in getting the project off the ground"" and Diljit Rana who was later involved behind the scenes. Paul Shirley Smith of Camlins - the landscape architects who did the public realm design around the sculpture and last but by no means least PF Copeland who ""fabricated the sculpture and did an incredible job"".

""I had kind of given up on it but eventually they did get the funding together"" he continued.

""Everybody did it for next to nothing to make it happen because there was so much enthusiasm for it. It was very much a team effort and I was only the man that came up with the original idea.""

When all systems were go Andy said he ""made two small models of it one was about 6ft the other was about 12ft at my Glasgow studio and they were sent over to PF Copeland and they took on the job of fabricating it in stainless steel tubes and I undertook the job of making the globe the sculpture stands on"".

(Image: Artist contributed)

You may not have noticed but on the cast bronze foundry globe underneath he picked out cities around the world with historic trading links to Belfast.

""I went over the Belfast a couple of times to see the Copeland boys putting the sculpture together and cast my eye over it to make sure it was all looking grand which it was. They did a fantastic job and eventually it was all pulled together and installed down by the Lagan over one weekend"" she added.

When designing the Beacon of Hope Andy said he took his inspiration from Myrtle Smyth's idea of giving thanks peace and ""something that would be an iconic symbol for everybody"".

""One of the symbols that was used in the original place was a 'ring of thanksgiving' so I incorporated a ring the big circle that she holds aloft. I wanted to make the structure herself as open as possible because it would reduce the wind loading on the structure but would also make sure you still had views to the buildings around but still have a powerful presence.""

He added various other strands of local narrative such as St Brigid's cloak from old Irish folklore ""were bubbling about in my head"".

""The globe she stands on is a globe of the world but if you look very closely certain cities are picked out. They were the cities around the world were Belfast exported industry to like the ships and linen"" he continued.

""Those were the main strands and I wrapped it all together in this tall female figure and there she stands overlooking the Lagan.""

The sculptor says he has been back a couple of times to see ""the big lady"" but not in recent years and hopes to return again in future.

His Beacon of Hope of Belfast was first developed by the Laganside Corporation which is no longer in operation and is now owned by the Department for Communities.

A DfC spokesperson said it was not involved in the commissioning and development of this art piece and did not provide any funding to the project.

The iconic figure is understood to have cost around £300k.

""It's incredible what they did for that amount of money"" added Andy ""as it was a phenomenal amount of work in engineering.""

These agricultural investments largely unnoticed and unchecked represent a potentially catastrophic blind spot.

“Animal protein and even dairy is likely and already has started to become the new oil and gas” said Bruno Sarda the former North America president of CDP a framework through which companies disclose their carbon emissions. “This is the biggest source of emissions that doesn’t have a target on its back.”

We’re hiring! Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. See jobs

By pouring money into emissions-intensive agriculture banks and investors are making a dangerous bet on the world’s growing demand for food especially foods that are the greatest source of emissions in the food system: meat and dairy.

Agriculture and deforestation largely driven by livestock production are responsible for nearly one quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. By 2030 livestock production alone could consume nearly half the world’s carbon budget the amount of greenhouse gas the world can emit without blowing past global climate targets.

“It’s not enough to divest from fossil fuel” said Devlin Kuyek a senior researcher at GRAIN a non-profit organization that advocates for small farms. “If you look at emissions just from the largest meat and dairy companies and the trajectories they have you see that these companies and their models are completely unsustainable.”

Those trajectories could put global climate goals well out of reach.

The American banks that are the four leading financiers globally of fossil fuels —JP Morgan Chase Wells Fargo Citigroup and Bank of America—all to varying degrees have made climate action more of a priority. But these and other major global banks continue to funnel dollars into companies that trade in “soft commodities”including beef soy timber and palm oil that are linked to the destruction of forests and critically important ecosystems.

A battery of recent analyses by sustainable investment and environmental advocacy groups has tracked the dollars. JP Morgan Chase for example has directed more than $450 million since 2016 to leading Brazilian meat packers that environmental groups claim have direct ties to deforestation and to recent devastating fires in the Amazon. BNP Paribas and HSBC are among the banks that have committed to stop funding deforestation from agriculture but still continue to provide billions to companies that have not.

Though they have promised to address climate change Rabobank Morgan Stanley Barclays and Goldman Sachs continue funding agribusinesses directly or indirectly involved in deforestation or high-carbon agriculture.

The banks either declined to comment for this article or did not respond to requests for comment. HSBC and Morgan Stanley pointed to their sustainability commitments online.

“We’re still trying to get the banks to recognize that the land-use sector is part of the climate problem” said Hana Heineken a senior campaigner with the Rainforest Action Network an advocacy group that has extensively tracked how banks have financed deforestation. “As things stand right now there is still a disconnect between banks saying they’re going to address climate change in their portfolios and what they’re going to do about financing.”

The world’s largest asset managers—BlackRock Vanguard and State Street—sell investment funds marketed as “sustainable.” But some of these funds contain agribusiness companies blamed for cutting down tropical forests. And the asset managers are among the biggest investors in major meat and dairy companies including JBS the world’s largest beef producer. None of these asset managers has a formal policy on deforestation environmental groups say.

When reached for comment the asset managers pointed to their sustainability platforms online and noted increased efforts to address deforestation and climate impacts from agriculture in their portfolios. In early 2020 BlackRock acknowledged the climate impacts of certain agribusiness practices and said it would push for greater disclosure of sustainability measures from companies in its funds.

The world’s food system needs to feed a population expected to hit 10 billion by 2050 meaning that the system will have 3 billion more people to feed than it did a decade ago. Global investors and banks see an opportunity in these numbers and in some cases are doubling down.

The climate impact of this could be disastrous with emissions from the food system projected to rise by nearly 60 percent if they stay on their current path.

Faced with these dire numbers some critics are increasingly calling for divestment from the food and agriculture companies with the biggest climate impacts—especially giant livestock and grain companies—much as they’ve called for divestment from fossil fuel companies.

Others are simply calling for more vigilance in policing destructive farming practices and the financial institutions that support them. They’re also pushing for more support for farmers and farming methods that use fewer resources emit fewer greenhouse gases and replenish soils.

“We need food” said Moira Birss climate and finance director for Amazon Watch. “And we don’t need fossil fuels.”

As demand for food rises the world’s banks and investors will ultimately determine whether an increasingly taxed food system fuels a climate collapse.

Big Banks Have Big Impacts

Agriculture is the biggest driver of deforestation globally responsible for half of all recent tree loss and more than 90 percent in the tropics.

Palm oil soy and cattle are the largest commodities behind that loss with cattle accounting for from half to two-thirds as agribusiness interests or their suppliers cut down or burn forests to open up more pasture to graze the animals or cropland to feed them. These commodities known as “soft commodities” because they are grown not extracted pose the most significant risks to forests.

They are also the keys to profit for the agriculture and food industries.

Clearing forests releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide and destroys their ability to store carbon. It’s also a major cause of soil erosion and biodiversity loss which create yet more risk to the global food supply and to public health as the coronavirus pandemic has so clearly illustrated. With the destruction of large ecosystems biodiversity plummets. The species that survive tend to be the ones that harbor and spread disease.

While the burning of fossil fuels remains the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions emissions from agriculture would have to be slashed to stay within the 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius targets of the Paris climate agreement. That’s even if the rest of the economy including the energy and transportation sectors adequately decarbonized.

Stopping deforestation is one of the fastest ways to limit carbon emissions. Yet the world’s biggest banks and asset managers are fueling the problem instead.

The UK-based group Global Canopy examined the companies with the greatest exposure to deforestation including financial institutions. It found that despite making commitments to stop deforestation by 2020 as of 2018 not a single company was on track to cut deforestation from its supply chains. These included a range of companies that rely on commodities tied to deforestation including McDonald’s and PepsiCo.

Banks Global Canopy concluded were the biggest laggards: “Financial institutions are behind companies in setting commitments and policies on deforestation. Of the 150 financial institutions assessed nearly two thirds had no financing policy for any of the four key forest-risk commodities” their report said. In its 2020 analysis the group found 63 percent of financial institutions still did not have deforestation policies.

This despite the banks’ outward claims and commitments to tackling climate change.

In fact the world’s major banks are accelerating their funding of commodities tied to deforestation in Latin America Africa and Southeast Asia. Among the top banks funding “forest-risk” commodities—those potentially responsible for deforestation —are JP Morgan Chase and Rabobank the world’s leading agricultural bank which has said it does not fund deforestation in any areas of Brazil.

Many of their commitments—public and much applauded—have come since the Paris climate agreement. Yet as with the funding of fossil fuels the money they are investing has ballooned since the historic accord. Overall global banks have increased their lending to commodities linked to deforestation by about 40 percent funneling $154 billion in credit from December 2015 when the agreement was signed to April of last year.

Most of these forests are being converted into cropland to grow grain to feed livestock or to pastureland to graze cattle. The conversion doesn’t just destroy forests releasing carbon dioxide in the process it multiplies the number of animals that emit methane an especially potent greenhouse gas.

Financial think tanks and green investment groups in report after report have found that major global banks have made promises to stop financing deforestation but have not lived up to them. Not a single major bank that has committed to stop financing deforestation from soft commodities has done so completely or quickly enough according to a December report from BankTrack.

And no American bank has required its clients to adopt no-deforestation policies.

JP Morgan Citigroup and Bank of America are among the top US-based creditors of American commodities giants Cargill Bunge and ADM which supply major American food businesses from McDonald’s to Walmart.

These grain traders have made commitments to stop deforestation but continue to come under fire for their vast soy plantations one of the largest drivers of deforestation in South America.

Cargill and Bunge did not respond to requests for comment.

Edel Bach a spokesman for JBS said the company has a “zero-tolerance approach to illegal deforestation” and “has made extensive investments… to monitor its entire Amazon value chain to ensure it is illegal deforestation free by 2025.”

Jackie Anderson a spokeswoman for ADM explained that the company has a no-deforestation policy is a signatory to a moratorium on deforestation in the Amazon and is a founding member of the Soft Commodities Forum an effort to stop deforestation and land conversion in the soy supply chain.

Recent research has found that despite making these commitments the major grain traders are still producing commodities that are tied to deforestation in areas of Brazil beyond the Amazon. These same companies continue to be blamed for deforestation linked to palm oil in Southeast Asia much of which ends up in products made by top international consumer goods companies.

The Role of the Asset Managers

The biggest asset managers led by BlackRock are also significantly invested in the meat and dairy industries and in other commodities linked with deforestation.

Though meat and dairy account for less than 1 percent of their total assets under management BlackRock Capital Group and Vanguard are the meat and dairy industries’ largest shareholders according to Feedback Global.

Blackrock and Vanguard are also JP Morgan’s largest shareholders.

BlackRock Vanguard and State Street—“The Big Three” asset managers— have $12 billion invested in producers linked to deforestation including the major grain traders ADM Bunge and Cargill and the meatpackers JBS Marfrig and Minerva according to a recent analysis by Friends of the Earth. ADM Bunge Cargill and JBS in turn indirectly and directly supply some of the world’s biggest consumer goods companies including PepsiCo Nestlé and Unilever.

The report puts much of the blame on the big asset managers. “Powerful investors have consistently undermined meaningful action by agribusinesses and the consumer goods sector writ large” the analysis said.

The asset managers say they have no control over the companies in their funds because the majority of their investment products are passively managed index funds. These types of funds follow a major market index like the S&P 500 which means the index manager actually controls which companies are in the fund.

“Every dollar that BlackRock manages belongs to our clients and more than 90% of our equity assets are invested in index-based funds that our clients choose” a spokesman for BlackRock responded in an email. “We cannot selectively divest from individual companies in indexes that may present sustainability risks.”

A Vanguard spokesperson said that while there is “no industry acknowledged specific exclusion regarding deforestation” Vanguard’s sustainability funds track an index that filters out companies that fail to align with principles outlined by the United Nations. (These do not explicitly mention deforestation.)

State Street and Capital Advisors pointed to their sustainability statements online.

But critics say that the Big Three and other major asset managers are getting a pass and that they could exclude certain companies from their basket of investments if they implemented no-deforestation policies or structured their products differently.

“They could put in place explicit screening tools” said Matthew McLuckie managing partner at Posaidon Capital a London and Zurich-based green investment firm. “If you are going to support a net-zero transition or Paris alignment how can you be holding companies chopping down tropical forests?”

In emailed responses to questions about their deforestation practices McDonald’s Nestlé Unilever and Walmart said that they had made commitments to source their products only from deforestation-free areas: McDonald’s said it would eliminate deforestation from its supply chain by 2030; Nestlé said it would stop sourcing soy and palm from deforested areas by 2022 and stopped buying Brazilian soybeans from Cargill in 2019; Unilever said its supply chains would be deforestation-free by 2023; Walmart said it would stop sourcing beef in deforested areas of Brazil by 2022 among other commitments. PepsiCo did not respond to a request for comment.

Disclosure is Voluntary

Over the last decade investors and regulators have pushed companies including financial institutions to disclose their carbon emissions.

Disclosure is a key first step toward giving investors and banks the information they need to make informed decisions about where to put—or not to put— their money.

Guidelines like those outlined by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and platforms including the CDP (formerly the Climate Disclosure Project) have prompted greater responses from a growing number of companies that see climate change as a risk.

Without disclosures banks and investors aren’t equipped with information about the greenhouse gas impacts of the companies including banks that they invest in or support.

But these disclosure requirements are voluntary and critically they don’t comprehensively reveal the extent of deforestation or other climate risks in companies’ agricultural supply chains.

The TFCD guidelines the most robust and widely used explicitly say that banks don’t have to disclose emissions from agriculture. Rather the task force “suggests banks define carbon-related assets as those assets tied to the energy and utilities sectors.”

That means for banks at least in the framework of the TCFD agriculture isn’t a “carbon-related” asset so banks don’t have to reveal the extent to which they finance them.

Critics say this allows banks and the companies they finance to hide behind their supply chains. JP Morgan’s first report using the TCFD guidelines for example contains no mention of the bank’s investment in commodities with ties to deforestation.

Most of the emissions from agriculture and food companies come from their “Scope 3” emissions—emissions not from their direct operations but from their supply chains. Nearly 90 percent of food and agribusiness company emissions fall into this category experts say but only a fraction of the companies report them. Of the world’s top food and beverage companies only 16 percent disclose emissions from their agricultural supply chains.

Many companies don’t report on the deforestation in their supply chains at all. Those include Domino’s Pizza and Mondelez. And even those that do disclose may not depending on the company include a complete picture of emissions from deforestation or importantly the conversion of land from forest to pasture or cropland.

A Domino’s spokesman said the company provides information on sourcing for its U.S. products on its website and is currently developing a climate strategy. Mondelez did not reply to a request for comment.

Part of the problem is not just the general murkiness of supply chains but a lack of common principles for measuring emissions from land conversion and deforestation.

“In greenhouse gas accounting of Scope 3 emissions it’s challenging to get high quality data because they don’t have a lot of transparency in their supply chains” said Cynthia Cummis a greenhouse gas accounting expert with the World Resources Institute. “The science behind land-based emissions is challenging and there isn’t agreement on the best methods.”

Companies can take advantage of that critics say. The data self-reported to CDP by the companies is not audited by a third party and critics say CDP’s rating system rewards companies for having a policy on deforestation even if that policy is weak.

“In effect you’re taking a company’s word” said McLuckie. “Investors are left largely in the dark.”

‘This is Just About Money’

Demand for “green” investments that meet environmental standards has grown in recent years as progressive investors pressure companies to address climate change. “Impact investing” has gained traction with investors and sustainable funds now control more than $1 trillion in assets doubling according to a 2020 analysis by Morningstar over the three years before the study.

A 2019 report from the Croatan Institute found that impact investing now accounts for more than $17 trillion—or one in three dollars—of the more than $51 trillion in assets under professional management a 42 percent increase over 2018.

In a January 2020 commentary BlackRock acknowledged that agribusinesses have a significant climate impact especially because of their links to deforestation and said that the company would engage with those companies to improve their performance.

“Amongst other things we ask companies to disclose any initiatives and externally developed codes of conduct e.g. committing to deforestation-free supply chains to which they adhere and to report on outcomes ideally with some level of independent review” the company reported.

But some of BlackRock’s sustainable investment funds contain large agribusiness companies with ties to deforestation. For a company to be included in the fund it needs to provide an inventory of its greenhouse gas emissions but not its Scope 3 emissions.

“You have huge agroindustrial companies —chemical fertilizer seed monopolies— in these so-called sustainability funds” said Mark Campanale executive director of Carbon Tracker. “If they’re the answer we’re asking the wrong questions.”

Giant fund managers establish criteria for the risk they’ll take on in their portfolios but because of the lack of transparency and uniform standards on disclosure they may not know the extent of the emissions from any given company.

Companies with supply chains linked to deforestation often defend themselves by saying that the supply chains are too complicated to monitor effectively and that doing so would be prohibitively expensive.

Some companies notably Unilever are investing millions to clarify their supply chains so investors and consumers know exactly where their products are sourced. But many companies hide behind their supply chains some analysts say.

“They try to do everything they can to be intransparent in their supply chains” said Gerard Rijk senior equity analyst with Profundo a Netherlands-based research group that tracks supply chains and investing. “It’s clear they’re not trying hard enough. This is just about money.”

One initiative the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) created a system that enables financial institutions to assess their “financed emissions.” Like supply chain emissions a financial institution’s loans and investments are Scope 3 emissions and represent the vast majority of their emissions.

In July Morgan Stanley became the first U.S. banking giant to join PCAF. It was followed soon after by Bank of America and Citi. As of February 2021 PCAF included 101 financial institutions representing more than $21 trillion in assets.

But PCAF’s methodology a work in progress does not yet encompass carbon emitted from land-use conversion when land is changed from forest to crop or pastureland one of the biggest sources of emissions from agriculture.

Doubling Down

To feed 10 billion people by 2050 the world needs to produce 50 to 70 percent more food.

For investors those are appealing figures.

“Demand is going up and there’s a lot of money to be made” said Merel van der Mark coordinator of the forests and finance coalition for the Rainforest Action Network.

In a 2018 report Valoral Advisors said there were roughly 440 funds in the food and agriculture sector up from 38 in 2005. Those funds managed around $73 billion in investments. “The last 10 years have seen the emergence of the global F&A sector as an institutional asset class with increasing interest from private and institutional investors alike” Valoral said referring to the food and agriculture sector.

Indeed investors seem to be doubling down in part because they’re getting a strong message about future demand. That’s true for food of all kinds but especially for meat and dairy as appetites and incomes rise in developing countries.

A marked uptick in agricultural investing occurred after the 2008 financial crisis when global food prices spiked and investors began seeing opportunities especially in farmland.

“Within the financial sector there’s just been an evolving and growing effort to find returns wherever they can and it’s moving beyond your traditional investments” said Kuyek of GRAIN. “That’s part of the reason you’re seeing investment in agriculture.”

The profits to be made from meat and dairy are especially enticing largely because of rising demand but also because low grain prices have made it increasingly cheap to produce beef and milk at lower costs.

“There’s been a meat-ification of diets particularly in the US Europe Brazil and Australia and increasingly China” said Daniel Jones a senior campaign manager with Feedback. “We know that meat and dairy is a climate issue but why is it that meat and dairy continues to grow? Is it an insatiable human appetite for meat? Probably not.”

Saying but Not Doing

As investors increasingly move toward investing in sustainable investment funds and impact investing grows shareholders and green-focused asset managers have been pushing companies to tackle their climate impacts.

They do this through a range of actions including putting forward shareholder resolutions requesting climate action.

Because the giant asset managers are often the largest shareholders in corporations—including banks—their votes can determine whether a resolution passes or not. And for the most part even asset managers that have committed to addressing climate change often have failed to support climate-related resolutions. In 2020 for example BlackRock and Vanguard voted against climate-related resolutions more than 80 percent of the time.

On agriculture-specific resolutions the numbers are even lower.

In cases where BlackRock did vote with shareholder proposals in favor of climate action the companies it targeted were largely energy companies not those with agricultural supply chains and links to deforestation. Since 2012 the Big Three have voted against or abstained from 16 shareholder proposals aimed specifically at deforestation. (In a notable exception BlackRock voted in 2020 to support a shareholder proposal at Procter & Gamble that asked the company to report on its efforts to eliminate deforestation in its supply chain).

“There’s absolutely a big gap full-stop” said Jessye Waxman shareholder advocate with Green Century Funds. “I think this speaks to the broader questions about what it really means for a firm to be addressing climate risk comprehensively. If you want to address climate risk you need to address agriculture.”

Feedback Global and other critics contend that engagement—from appealing to companies directly to shareholder resolutions—isn’t working. They’re now calling for divestment from carbon-intensive agricultural and livestock companies.

Still other critics say that banks and investors have an opportunity to influence companies toward more sustainable forms of agriculture.

“Our call isn’t for full and immediate divestment from the agriculture industry as it essentially is for fossil fuels” said Birss of Amazon Watch. “It’s not the same. We can’t say it’s all terrible.”

But she added “If irreparable harms to the climate come from the production of food those who are carrying out the production of that food and the people providing the one necessary ingredient —finance—have a responsibility to ensure those irreparable harms aren’t happening.”

As inflation skyrockets the biggest bill is worth just 52 cents.

The Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) announced Friday the introduction of three new banknotes: 200000 500000 and one million bolivars.

But with inflation skyrocketing the highest denominated bill has a value of just $0.52 cents (€0.44 cents) according to the official rate.

These new notes will circulate alongside the 10000- 20000- and 50000-bolivar bills currently in use

But even the highest valued is worth only about $0.02 cents at current exchange rates.

Why even use paper money?

The new bills will begin to circulate ""gradually"" beginning Monday according to a brief message from the BCV.

Over the last few years various Venezuelan governments have turned to printing new banknotes at different denominations as a way to get ahead of spiraling inflation.

""These new bills will complement and optimize the current denominations to meet the requirements of the national economy"" the central bank said in a statement.

But with interannual inflation rates running at 2665% as of January according to the central bank the use of Venezuelan paper money has almost completely disappeared in favor of cards.

For the most part prices in Venezuela are denominated in US currency when stores show it.

Why is Venezuela's economy struggling?

For the past seven years sanctions imposed by the United States European Union and other nations on gold mining state-owned oil operations and other business transactions have battered the South American country.

The US also does not recognize the government led by President Nicolas Maduro the successor to former President Hugo Chavez.

The nation's situation has been worsened by falling oil prices and restrictions on sales of domestically refined oil.

But the Holburne Museum in Bath is staging a groundbreaking exhibition called Henry Moore in Miniature a collection of the great artist’s works that could fit into the palm of the hand.

The museum’s director Chris Stephens said its relatively small spaces meant one of the themes of its programme was to showcase the intimate in art – and the retrospective of mini Moores met the brief perfectly.

He said visitors to the exhibition which opened on Friday would be able to imagine Moore industriously working away in his studio finding new shapes and textures.

“The exhibition serves as a reminder that sculpture is as much an art of the hand – in its making and appreciation – as of the eye. An object may be small in size but large in scale” he said.

The show billed as the first of its kind features sculptures in stone wood terracotta plaster lead bronze and Plasticine and takes in themes recurrent in Moore’s work: the reclining female figure mother and child the human head the fallen warrior. It has works from every decade of his career from the 1920s to the 1980s.

The first piece the visitor encounters is a mother and child from the 1920s modelled in Plasticine which pleasingly was invented at the end of the 19th century by a teacher at Bath Academy of Art William Harbutt. It sits next to a small animal head made of boxwood in 1921.

Another intriguing display features of a pair of mother-and-childs from the 1930s modelled in plaster and cast in lead which Moore melted in saucepans on a kitchen stove. Stephens said the lead gave the pieces a “poisonous” air which perhaps reflected political times as the world headed towards war.

Seen in public for the first time is a collection of small terracotta heads that Moore modelled while planning two carved heads for a church at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire in the 1950s.

Stephens said: “These reflect his interest in classical traditions tribal masks and perhaps the graffiti carved into walls in Paris captured by the photographer Brassaï.” Moore’s fingerprints and tool marks are clearly visible in the heads.

The final displays are maquettes for yet more mother and child sculptures dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s and a cabinet of found objects from his studio that Moore worked with – bones flints stones.

Presented in partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation the exhibition features more than 60 works gathered in one room on the top floor of the museum. Moore’s daughter Mary Moore said she was delighted these smaller pieces would be seen.

She said: “An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work – particularly the starting point for his universally familiar large-scale sculpture – began with his modelling with his turning moulding and forming in the palm of his hands.”

By way of contrast a second show that opened at the Holburne on Friday stars a very different artist – Sam Cox better known as Mr Doodle who has almost 3 million followers on Instagram sells his work for hundreds of thousands of pounds a time and has covered every inch of his Kent home with his intricate patterns.

Mr Doodle! Museum Mayhem is the first UK museum exhibition of his work with the Holburne allowing Doodle to take over parts of the building and daub it with his “graffiti spaghetti” of black ink on white background.

He has also been given the go-ahead to replace some of its pieces with his own work. For example John Constable’s Flatford Lock from the Bridge (circa 1814-17) has been replaced with Doodle House from the Gates (2024).

Doodle studied illustration at UWE Bristol and used to bring a suitcase of his work to Bath to try to barter for a meal or a drink. “That was mostly unsuccessful” he said. “It’s cool to come back and do something grander.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMzM4NjQwNy9GV0FXLWZhbnMtc2xhbS1jcmluZ2UtYmF0aC1kYXRlLUZhcm1lci1Kb2UtQ2xhaXJlLmh0bWzSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTMzODY0MDcvYW1wL0ZXQVctZmFucy1zbGFtLWNyaW5nZS1iYXRoLWRhdGUtRmFybWVyLUpvZS1DbGFpcmUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Farmer Wants A Wife fans slam 'cringe' bath date between Farmer Joe and Claire: 'It felt awkward watching it!',"Farmer Wants A Wife fans were left 'cringing' on Sunday night as they watched an awkward date between two of the contestants.

The cattle and sheep farmer 33 offered another 24-hour date up for grabs with the marketing manager 36 pulling out all the stops to win.

'I saw the bathtub near our tent so yeah I just wanted to set up a little spot for us to share some time together' Claire told producers.

Farmer Wants A Wife Australia fans said they were left 'cringing' away from the TV on Sunday night as they watched an awkward date between two of the contestants

However it seemed the plan 'fell flat' when awkward scenes showed the pair stripping down and stepping into the warm bath looking shy in front of the cameras.

The pair appeared uncomfortable sharing affections while in their underwear on TV but did attempt to share a kiss and caress one another in a cringey display.

'I couldn't watch the bath just a bunch of giggling it was so cringe' one person wrote on Facebook.

Another added: 'I know I felt awkward for watching haha not even a conversation going.'

'Yes it was so cringeworthy it was hard to watch' one user commented.

Others noted that it was only awkward because Farmer Joe did not appear to be as interested in Claire as she was him.

'No he is not feeling it with any of them but well and truly enjoying the game!' another agreed.

Tomorrow (March 7) marks the anniversary of what proved to be Landon Donovan’s last goal for Everton when he came off the bench to score in a 5-1 victory at home to Hull City in what was the Blues 5000th competitive game in 2010.

Although over a decade has passed since then and the USA international’s two loan spells at Goodison Park were fleeting Donovan who describes himself as “An Evertonian for life” remains a hugely-popular player among the club’s supporter base.

Over the coming days the ECHO has produced a three-part special celebrating the Blues’ special bond with the California native.

Before embarking on a two-part exclusive interview with the man himself Chris Beesley begins our mini-series by finding out what makes Donovan such a special person.

He spoke to Kevin Baxter who has covered five World Cups three Olympic Games six World Series and a Super Bowl for the Los Angeles Times.

Ever since David Moyes’ bold proclamation on the day of his appointment as manager back in 2002 Everton has dubbed itself ‘The People’s Club.’

Landon Donovan is a ‘People person’.

In terms of longevity the Blues were never a large part of Donovan’s playing career.

This is a man who made 426 appearances in Major League Soccer and turned out for the USA national team on 157 occasions.

He was never actually owned by Everton and over two loan spells he totalled just 22 matches but those bare statistics fail to do justice to the impact both parties had on each other.

Donovan and the Blues were in many ways kindred spirits.

Kevin Baxter of the Los Angeles Times told the ECHO: “You know I’ve written about Everton a lot and to write about an English team in the States you have to find an additional reason beyond merely the soccer itself.

“Everton does so much charity work within the mile there by Goodison Park things like the sleep out with the academy team to raise awareness.

“A lot of teams raise money and give to charity and that’s really good but I think Everton have taken it to the next level by participating with getting players to see what it’s like to be homeless.

“That’s kind of where Landon comes from too. He goes beyond writing the cheques going to the supermarket openings and doing that kind of stuff – Landon lives it.”

Baxter believes that the demands of playing for Moyes’ Everton helped improve Donovan’s skill-set.

Blues fans are known for giving short shrift to those they deem to be shirking and the intensity of the Premier League required the man from Ontario California to take his game to another level by embracing what is needed to succeed at Goodison Park.

Even if his focus on matches supposedly caused him to miss one of the unique features of the ground!

Baxter said: “One memory that speaks to me about Landon and his time at Everton no matter how short it was but it made him a better player.

“There was a MLS game and I was talking to one of the club officials and he told me: ‘Look at Landon right now’ and he wasn’t running full speed after the ball and was conserving his energy.

“The guy then said: ‘He can’t do that at Everton. Do you think the fans are going to let him get away with that? If he goes to Everton he’s going to have to play 110% for the full 90 minutes and it’s going to do him good.’

“I think that was correct. Landon played at a different level at Everton. Not because he didn’t respect MLS but that’s what was demanded of him and I do think his spells at Everton helped him as a player.

“It’s funny though because I was talking to Landon one time and I said to him: ‘What’s Goodison Park like? They have the church there and it’s part of the stadium.’

“Landon said: ‘There’s a church at the stadium?’ He had no idea. I guess when he got to the stadium he was concentrating on football!”

Back in the USA though there’s no doubting Donovan’s credentials and for now at least Baxter insists he’s far from alone in considering him as ‘The GOAT.’

He said: “Landon is widely seen as being the best American player in history.

“He ties Clint Dempsey with most goals for the national team and has the most assists.

“He was the leader of the team that made it to the quarter-finals of the 2002 World Cup the best performance in modern times of a US team in the tournament.

“People talk about this new generation that we’ve got now and whether Christian Pulisic is going to be the best player or Weston McKennie but that’s maybe we don’t know what’s going to happen with those guys yet.

“Until somebody knocks him off the perch he’s the best player in American history and I don’t think there’s any debate on that everyone will agree.”

Asked just what made Donovan such a great player Baxter added: “He won six domestic titles in Major League Soccer – no other player has won that many – and until last season he’d scored the most goals in MLS history while he had a ton of assists as well.

“I think what made him a great player was his versatility. He could play on the wing he could be a central midfielder he could be a 9 or a false 9 and do about anything.

“Landon had some real leadership qualities too and a lot of times fans don’t always see that.

“I talked to a number of his team-mates from Los Angeles Galaxy and with the national team and they mentioned how he was a leader.

“A lot of players were upset when USA coach Jurgen Klinsmann left him out of the squad for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. He might not have been a starter by then but his leadership in the locker room was really important.”

Such qualities have served Donovan well in his latest venture.

Having hung up his boots in 2018 after a brief spell with Mexican side Leon Donovan who is still a year shy of the big 4-0 having celebrated his 39th birthday on Thursday is now the owner-manager of San Diego Loyal where he also holds the title of executive vice-president.

Donovan and his team made the headlines last season for taking a stand against opponents abusing their players – even though it impacted on their on-the-field fortunes.

Baxter said: “Landon is a coach now in the USL Championship – the second tier of soccer in the USA like our version of the Championship (but with no promotion and relegation with MLS) – and was a first-year coach last term.

“His team did not make the play-offs and the reason they didn’t was because they forfeited their last two games.

“In the first game a player in the opposing team made some racist comments to a player on Landon’s team and even though they were winning the game Landon pulled his team off the field and forfeited the game rather than continue to play against a team whose players were using racist comments.

“In the next game that Landon’s team had to win he pulled his team off the field at half-time after a player on the opposing team made a homophobic comment to an openly-gay player on Landon’s team.

“Landon took a vote from his players at half-time in the locker room and they decided not to play the second half if that opposing player was not ejected – and he wasn’t – and they forfeited their last two games.”

Baxter added: “There’s a lot of talk over why that was but I think it sealed Landon’s reputation for leadership and being a guy who would do the right thing rather than the easy thing and that’s another string to him that might get overlooked.

“There was the whole Black Lives Matter movement going on at the time and it was very big in California with lots of demonstrations but when the first incident happened Landon’s comment were along the lines of: ‘Has nobody been paying attention?'

""'Are we just going to pay lip service to this stuff? We kneel before the game but are we not going to follow through with what this represents? The game starts and we’re throwing racist epitaphs around?’ So it was really a stand on principle.”

It remains to be seen whether Donovan will go on to coach at the elite level after his own playing career at the top but given the scope that his current role provides him with and past conversations they have had Baxter is not so sure.

He said: “Landon said repeatedly as a player that he wanted to be a coach but he never wanted to be a pro coach.

“He said he wanted to coach kids because those are the people who are playing because they love the game.

“When you get to be a pro you get ego and everything that goes with it.

“Sometimes if you’ve got a general manager or sporting director above you you might not like the players they pick but I think Landon wanted to have total control of the whole operation if he was going to be responsible for the results on the field.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The boats carried three tribal chairs. From the Karuk Tribe there was Russell “Buster” Attebery who’d found pride as a boy catching salmon from the river and bringing them home to his family and later come to believe some tribal youth’s troubles — from suicides to substance use — could be traced back to their never having had that opportunity growing up alongside a river now choked with algae and diminishing fish populations. There was Joseph James from the Yurok Tribe who’d come to see the river’s declining health as a “slow strangulation” of his people — “river people” — who have lived along its banks and relied on its salmon as the bedrock of their diet since time immemorial. And there was Don Gentry recently elected to a third term as the upriver Klamath Tribes’ chair whose people hadn’t seen salmon and steelhead swimming in their ancestral territory in a generation.

There were others on the boats too. People like Craig Tucker an environmentalist who promised himself in school he’d never waste his career fighting for quixotic causes yet had now come to spend two decades working on Klamath dam removal. There was Frankie Joe Myers who’d come of age amid the fight to undam the river and was now in the thick of it as the Yurok Tribe’s vice chair.

But the trip up the Klamath that day in August wasn’t really about any of the people who’d made undamming the river a central part of their life’s work it was about making a case to two men who’d never set eyes on the river before but held its future in their hands.

Mahlija Florendo Berkshire Hathaway executives talk to Klamath Justice Coalition activists who stopped them on a trip to the river.

Weeks earlier after a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruling had derailed a hard-fought 2016 agreement to remove the four hydroelectric dams choking the lower Klamath River Myers and James had issued a plea. While PacifiCorp the electric company that owns and operates the dams was publicly musing about walking away from the agreements Myers and James decided to appeal directly to Berkshire Hathaway the holding company run by Warren Buffett perhaps the world’s most successful and famous investor which had acquired PacifiCorp for more than $5 billion back in 2005.

In a meticulously worded email to Berkshire Hathaway Energy Vice Chair Greg Abel who’s believed by many to be the 89-year-old Buffett’s successor Myers said he and James invited one of the world’s most powerful men to simply come see the river sit and talk. Abel accepted and soon he and Berkshire Hathaway Energy CEO William Fehrman were sitting on a jet boat headed upriver.

It’s hard to overstate the stakes that day on the river. Activists and officials alike had long believed the best chance to fundamentally change the dam-removal conversation was to get Berkshire engaged a step the company seemed entirely unwilling to take a core tenet of its company ethos being not to interfere in the operations of its subsidiaries. Yet here sat Abel and Fehrman the Klamath wind in their hair.

Tribal officials had worked hard to keep word of the visit close concerned an ill-timed protest or demonstration could jeopardize this show of good faith. They’d mapped out the day carefully to showcase the Klamath’s beauty and potential planning to give the executives a meandering tour of family fishing holes and camps on the river until eventually landing where Blue Creek enters the Klamath — a scenic spot filled with biological diversity and spiritual significance for the Yurok Tribe — where they’d lunch on traditional salmon cooked on sticks over an open flame. But as the boats rounded a sweeping bend in the river it became instantly clear some had other plans. A floating blockade — a few boats and dugout canoes with large nets stretched across the river — came into view dotted with signs calling for the river’s undamming some punctuated by red fists.

Myers who said he’d personally assured Berkshire representatives they would be safe coming to Klamath said his heart quickened a bit when he saw the blockade unsure what was to follow.

“It was risky” Myers said. “There were a few moments when I was like ‘I have a couple of the richest men in the country on a jet boat and I don’t know what [the protesters] were going to do.’ … Everyone in the boats felt very vulnerable.”

The blockade which comprised a couple dozen of the Klamath River’s most ardent activists ordered the jet boats to stop. Then the activists took turns addressing the representatives of one of the world’s most powerful companies.

One of them presented the men with a plastic jug of water pulled from behind one of the dams where the water is choked with bright green algae and pressed them to open the jug and smell the toxic brew. Another noted that an entire generation of water protectors had been raised in this fight under the oppressive weight of a sick river. Jon Luke Gensaw pulled off his COVID-19 facial covering telling the men to take a good look at his face.

“If this doesn’t end you’re going to see more of us” he said. “I want you to remember my face because you’ll see me again.”

Chook-Chook Hillman who joined the effort to remove the dams when he was a teenager and whose dad would take him to the meetings with upriver irrigators and ranchers that led to the 2010 dam removal agreement that died in Congress started by asking his son to present the executives with a gift.

“Thank you — very kind” one of them can be heard to stammer in a recording of the exchange.

Sammy Gensaw Berkshire Hathaway Energy CEO William Fehrman smells a bottle of toxic algae pulled from above one of the four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River while speaking to protesters at a blockade on Aug. 28 2020.

The gift Hillman later told the men was a small white flag affixed to a wooden stick. Hillman said he and his fellow water protectors would be waiting when the executives and tribal officials returned downriver. If they waved the flag it would be a sign that an agreement had been restored. But if not Hillman warned Berkshire Hathaway should brace for protests like it had never seen.

“If you guys ain’t waiving that flag when you’re coming down the river — it’s on” he said.

Annelia Hillman told the executives that the health of the river is their responsibility — their problem — and one that’s going to effect their children and grandchildren their futures.

“It’s affecting you too” she said. “Don’t think this is an Indian problem. It’s your f**king problem too.”

After a tense 15 or so minutes the blockade moved to the side and the boats headed on. When they came back down again some hours later Hillman said no one aboard would make eye contact with him or the other water protectors.

The flag was nowhere to be seen.

About six weeks before that day on the river the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had issued a ruling that put the groundbreaking dam removal deal — itself a resuscitation of a more ambitious deal reached in 2010 that was dependent on Congressional approval that withered on the vine — in serious jeopardy.

Under the terms of the 2016 deal the Klamath River Renewal Corporation had asked FERC to transfer the licenses of the four dams to a newly created nonprofit which would then oversee and assume liability for the removal process allowing PacifiCorp to step away cleanly. The dams would then be removed using $450 million already raised for the purpose — $200 million from PacifiCorp ratepayers and $250 million in water bonds authorized by California’s Proposition 1.

But FERC ruled the company couldn’t simply walk away from the dams it built and the situation it had created and would need to remain attached to the dams as their co-licensee until their removal.

Regina Chichizola the policy director at Save California’s Salmon who has been involved in Klamath dam removal and other watershed restoration efforts for more than a decade said she had mixed emotions watching the FERC hearing. On the one hand she said she personally understood the ruling and why a private company shouldn’t be allowed to permanently alter a river for profit and then simply walk away. She also knew it would mean trouble.

“I know how PacifiCorp is and I knew they would demand more because they always demand more” Chichizola said.

Within days of the ruling PacifiCorp began publicly hedging saying it had undercut some of the main “customer protections” that had brought the company to the table for the deal. This was a foundational shift it held and the deal would need to be re-negotiated.

They all settled on a single target for what would be a months-long multi-pronged campaign the likes of which the Klamath had never seen: Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett.

But any sizeable delay would cut sharply against the chances of reaching a new accord and seeing the dams removed as the pot of money for the project was unlikely to grow and cost projections would escalate with every month or year that passed.

In the days that followed FERC’s ruling pockets of dam removal stakeholders met quietly plotting paths forward. Chook-Chook Hillman said he and a handful of longtime river advocates got together on the banks of the Klamath with a whiteboard and started brainstorming. Chichizola held conference calls with environmental groups and other stakeholders. Tucker and tribal leaders pondered their next move. And North Coast Rep. Jared Huffman readied to throw all his weight as a member of Congress at the problem.

They all settled on a single target for what would be a months-long multi-pronged campaign the likes of which the Klamath had never seen: Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett.

Since Berkshire purchased PacifiCorp back in 2005 many dam removal advocates had felt Buffett was the key to getting the company on board. He wasn’t simply one of the world’s richest man but the Oracle of Omaha an almost mythical business figure famed for down-home sensibilities and philanthropy.

Advocates had long sought to turn his attention to the Klamath. For consecutive years Tucker had bought up as many tickets as possible to Buffett’s annual shareholders’ meetings — known by some as the “Woodstock of capitalism” — schmoozy affairs more focused on symposiums and cocktail parties than balance sheets. They’d successfully bombarded question and answer periods with Buffett with inquiries on the Klamath staged die-ins in front of black tie events and even had Native women flood a cocktail party at a diamond store wearing traditional regalia to talk to revelers about the Klamath and what it means to them.

“I have no idea how somebody like Warren Buffett thinks” Tucker said of the rationale for the approach. “It’s hard for me to put myself in the shoes [of someone] who has more money than God. But I do know he’s 90 and I do know he has Native grandchildren. These shareholder meetings of Berkshire Hathaway are big parties. There’s not that much business but a lot of cocktail parties. And I don’t think he wants them to be dominated by talk of the plight of Native people.”

But publicly anyway none of these efforts seemed to get through to the man who’d built an empire at least on the image that he purchased good companies and let them operate as they saw fit.

This time had to be different. And the effort also had to break through amid the COVID-19 pandemic which made mass demonstrations — and even traditional organizing strategies — dangerous and impractical.

On the banks of the river Hillman and other Klamath Justice Coalition members decided they would use personal connections to write heartfelt letters appealing to people close to Buffett.

Chichizola and others meanwhile plotted a massive social media push. They found Gates scholars willing to post messages in support of dam removal hoping to catch the ear of Bill Gates a longtime friend of Buffett’s. And they’d work toward a large scale day of action that would feature an online event as well as on-the-ground protests.

Meanwhile Myers and James got to work on their letter to Abel the man many expect to succeed Buffett at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway and its quarter of a trillion dollars in annual revenue imploring him to come see the Klamath River and its people for himself.

Ten days prior to the blockade on the river Huffman convened a special virtual hearing of his Water Oceans and Wildlife Subcommittee on dam removal and Klamath River conditions. The hearing featured tribal leaders who spoke of the river’s importance to their people; environmental scientists who detailed its dire condition and the dams’ impacts on water quality and fish populations; and North Coast State Sen. Mike McGuire and State Water Resources Control Board Chair Joaquin Esquivel both of whom indicated the state had taken a light hand with permitting PacifiCorp’s Klamath dams — a practice that would end should the company walk away from the deals.

“Warren Buffett has the chance to be a hero in Indian country. Or he has the potential to be remembered as someone who perpetuated a grave injustice just to make a little more money.” U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Cal. Dist. 2)

Berkshire Hathaway sent to the forum PacifiCorp Vice President Scott Bolton whom Huffman an environmental lawyer prior to entering politics seemed to relish questioning.

“Mr. Bolton I think it’s pretty clear that you and PacifiCorp are at a crossroads” he said. “You have a choice. The river is dying. The fishery is dying. Your dam is causing a toxic concentration of algae that’s the worst in the world. … But you’re not powerless to protect your ratepayers. We can work shoulder to shoulder get this done on time and on budget or you can blow this thing up.”

The comment struck back to something Huffman said in his opening statement laying the Klamath River’s future squarely at Buffett’s feet.

“Warren Buffett has the chance to be a hero in Indian country” he said. “Or he has the potential to be remembered as someone who perpetuated a grave injustice just to make a little more money.”

The ensuing weeks would see a bevy of action. Huffman introduced legislation that would have essentially given downriver tribes a voice in FERC’s re-licensing processes ensuring they would be unpleasant affairs for PacifiCorp moving forward.

Meanwhile as Chichizola and others pushed toward the day of action in October protests began to pop up — in San Diego where PacifiCorp was pursuing a power deal at the company’s headquarters in Oregon and elsewhere — and Klamath hashtags began to trend.

“One of the things I like to stress when talking about the story is how every single part was in play” said Chichizola adding that scientists argued the scientific case for dam removal politicians played politics tribal leaders negotiated and coordinated and a community of activists — many who’d grown up in this effort — organized and rallied.

When the day of action arrived it was massive with COVID-19 adapted protests in 11 cities — and in front of Buffett’s home — 7000 people attending a live online forum and 10000 signing petitions calling for dam removal. Multiple national Native rights groups joined the social media push and #undamtheklamath began trending on multiple social media platforms. Meanwhile a coalition took out a full-page advertisement in USA Today calling for dam removal and casting it as a social justice issue.

Tucker said he’s simply never seen anything like it.

“We had protests popping up all over the place that we didn’t really organize and that’s what you want — that’s a grassroots movement right there” he said.

It’s hard to pinpoint the moment it happened — whether it was on the river that day Huffman’s grilling of Bolton the scores of heartfelt testimonials on the day of action — but something moved and Berkshire came to the table. (Berkshire Hathaway through a spokesperson “declined the opportunity” to be interviewed for this story.”)

But when the company did decide to take PacifiCorp’s position at the negotiating table stakeholders say everything changed. Myers the Yurok Tribe’s vice chair said Fehrman Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s CEO stepped in as the company’s lead negotiator and took a granular approach to understanding the agreement the dam removal process and potential liabilities involved.

Over the course of about a week a core negotiating team formed with Fehrman representing Berkshire Myers representing the Yurok Tribe and Tucker there for the Karuk Tribe as well as Oregon Department of Environmental Quality Director Richard Whitman and California Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Charlton Bonham. Because everyone’s schedules were packed the only time they could find to meet were early mornings and weekends but Myers said no one flinched and the group began meeting three or four times a week with participants often joining the video conferences from their homes.

“We’re talking about removing four large dams — this is on the scale of demolishing skyscrapers or decommissioning giant power plants. But [Berkshire Hathaway] committed to being open-minded and said ‘OK you keep telling us this is buttoned up so let’s go through it again.’ "" Craig Tucker environmental consultant

“It did bring a certain amount of closeness to these meetings” Myers said. “The first hour of everyone’s day people are pretty straightforward with who they are. You get to see people in their homes getting their first cups of coffee. There’s some real humility there.”

Tucker said Berkshire wanted to be walked through every aspect of the plan in fine detail how construction would work and a detailed breakdown of the budget the insurance plan and liability concerns.

“We’re talking about removing four large dams — this is on the scale of demolishing skyscrapers or decommissioning giant power plants” Tucker said. “But they committed to being open-minded and said ‘OK you keep telling us this is buttoned up so let’s go through it again.’ Once we went through it they were like ‘Wow the Klamath River Renewal Corporation has it together.’ … We kind of watched the realization of the company that this wasn’t just some pipe dream. This was well-thought-out and well-managed.”

It was another shift. “And” Tucker continued “once they decided they were going to go for it everything changed. Every interaction with the company was all of a sudden they are clearly 100 percent committed to dam removal.”

Ultimately the parties agreed PacifiCorp California and Oregon would pledge another $45 million in contingency funds to account for cost overruns or liabilities and that Berkshire would agree to a three-way split of any liabilities or overruns beyond that moving forward. But a significant hurdle still remained: Berkshire wanted another entity to take over PacifiCorp’s status as co-licensee on the dams through the removal process. Oregon agreed to sign into the role. But the deal needed California to do so too.

Myers said Bonham had done a “phenomenal job” throughout the negotiations but indicated this kind of decision was beyond him. The tribes would need to talk directly with Gov. Gavin Newsom.

When tribal representatives met with Newsom in Sacramento Myers said he knew the stakes couldn’t be higher. His approach he said was not to vouch for the science or the economics of the project — others had done that for years. Instead he said the goal of the day was to really show Newsom what this agreement would mean to tribal people.

“California is all in and we’re never going to stop until the dams come out.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom

“It was our role to really say ‘This is worth it’ and to speak to the 150-plus years of pretty horrific negotiations with California” Myers said. “When you look at the gold rush in California when you look at the timber barons in California the commercial fleets of California the mission system in California there is an atrocity built on an atrocity built on the graves of our people. This is the world’s fifth largest economy because it’s built on the resources of the Indigenous people of California. … This is our land and we’re still here.”

After the group finished making its case to the governor and the meeting was wrapping up Myers said he offered a last push: “California has a huge debt to Indian people and dam removal does not repay that debt by a long shot. But it’s a good down payment.”

Newsom Myers said responded: “California is all in and we’re never going to stop until the dams come out.”

In late October and early November word crept into activist circles that negotiations with Berkshire were going well that there was progress. But it was hard to believe.

“I was still tepid” said Hillman. I’d heard there was another agreement in principle. Well I remembered the other agreements in principle. We were hearing that there’s an agreement that the states are involved. That sounds good. But other agreements have sounded good as well.”

It was mid-November when word began circulating that a press conference was in the works when Newsom Oregon Gov. Kate Brown Berkshire Hathaway and the Yurok and Karuk tribes would announce a new deal had been reached. But most interviewed for this story recall a singular moment when this agreement felt not just real but substantively different than its predecessors — a draft press release began to circulate and in it was a quote from Buffett himself. And the quote didn’t talk about ratepayers. It talked about the good of Native people.

“I recognize the importance of Klamath dam removal and river restoration for tribal people in the Klamath Basin” Buffett said. “We appreciate and respect our tribal partners for their collaboration in forging an agreement that delivers an exceptional outcome for the river as well as future generations. Working together from this historic moment we can complete the project and remove these dams.”

For Hillman who once fasted for 10 days in preparation for a meeting with Buffett only to be turned away the moment was profound.

“It hit me a lot harder than I thought it was going to for his words not to be about ratepayers but about restorative justice” he said. “That day did feel a lot different than it ever has. People say we’ve been here before but I’m saying ‘Not here.’ We haven’t been here where the states and the company and Fish and Wildlife are talking about restorative justice. Those statements are hard to walk back. It sure does feel different.”

Last month the KRRC filed the new agreement with FERC for approval and this time the consensus is it will be approved without issue having checked all the boxes the regulatory agency laid out with its prior ruling laying the path for dam removal to begin in 2023. Hillman said he’s heard Berkshire Hathaway representatives have been meeting with FERC staff to make sure everything is in order noting that he and other advocates were repeatedly denied such meetings.

“That makes me happy on the one hand but just angry on the other” he said. “We’ve always known that if the big wigs decide they want to do something as a corporation in America they do it. They could have done this the whole time.”

But they didn’t. Repeatedly. So what after years of pushing and angling finally brought Buffett to the Klamath table? Everyone interviewed for this story said it’s impossible to pinpoint any one thing as changing economics and political sentiments coupled with stalwart generational activism all created a perfect storm. But if there was a tipping point Myers and Tucker said it was likely that moment on the Klamath when a group of Native people seeking justice for their river refused to let Berkshire Hathaway executives pass.

“At the end of the day” Tucker recalled “I was like ‘I’m not sure that went the way we wanted it to.’ The tribal activists became a little confrontational and I thought in the moment ‘Oh no.’ But what I thought was things going off the rails and all our best laid plans starting to go awry I think was serendipitous. It created opportunities for interactions that wouldn’t have happened otherwise.

“No one sells the Klamath better than the people who live there” Tucker continued. “People’s entire adult lives have been spent fighting these dams. My child is 16 years old and that’s all he’s ever known that I do. And I think there’s a lot of Native kids who have grown up and that’s all they know their parents do. … We are committed. And it’s generational. If something happens to me something happens to Frankie (Myers) something happens to whoever there’s a generation of young people who will step in to fill our shoes. I think Berkshire finally understood that.”

What Happened: Scott has tied the knot with Dan Jewett a science teacher at a Seattle private school a person familiar with the matter told the Journal.

“Dan is such a great guy and I am happy and excited for the both of them” said Bezos as per a statement made available by an Amazon spokesperson the Journal reported.

Scott and Bezos were married for 25 years.

Why It Matters: The Bezos-Scott divorce was finalized in April 2019. Scott came into ownership of 4% of Amazon stock as per the divorce settlement and gave Bezos all her interests in the Washington Post and Blue Origin.

Bezos’s net worth topped pre-divorce heights in July last year. He is currently the wealthiest person on the planet with a total net worth of $177 billion as per Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index.

Scott is the twelfth wealthiest and is worth $51.5 billion as per the same gauge.

Scott revealed in a Medium blog post in December that she had made gifts of $4.18 billion to 384 organizations across the United States and Puerto Rico.

Jewett said on Saturday that he plans to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime on Scott’s page on The Giving Pledge a philanthropist initiative created by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda along with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett.

Price Action: Amazon shares closed nearly 0.8% higher at $3000.46 on Friday and gained 0.15% in the after-hours session.

Reykjavik-based Carbfix captures and dissolves CO₂ in water then injects it into the ground where it turns into stone in less than two years. “This is a technology that can be scaled—it’s cheap and economic and environmentally friendly” Carbfix Chief Executive Officer Edda Sif Pind Aradottir said in an interview. “Basically we are just doing what nature has been doing for millions of years so we are helping nature help itself.”

Once considered a pipe dream capturing and storing CO₂ has in the last few years become an area of immense interest for high-profile investors such as Microsoft Corp. founder Bill Gates and Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk who are searching for solutions to avoid the worst effects of global warming.

The technology can work in two ways. The first is called “carbon capture” where the gas is trapped from the smokestacks of factories and power plants before it escapes into the atmosphere. A second more challenging process is “carbon removal” — withdrawing CO₂ from the air around us. Carbon capture can cut a company or government’s emissions to zero while carbon removal can help offset its emissions or even make its impact negative by taking more CO₂ out of the air than it produces.

Carbfix is doing both. It’s scaling up its project at the Hellisheidi geothermal power plant to capture carbon emissions as they are released and it’s partnering with Swiss startup Climeworks AG that builds machines to capture CO₂ directly from the air. While geothermal plants are already classified as renewable energy they do produce a small fraction of the CO₂ that would be generated by a natural gas facility.

When it comes to carbon capture the Hellisheidi plant is able to do so at a cheaper cost than buying carbon credits according to Aradottir. Its process costs about $25 a ton compared with the current price of about 40 euros ($48) a ton on the EU’s Emissions Trading System the bloc’s key policy tool to reduce emissions.

Climeworks’ direct air capture operation is much more expensive. On the company’s website individuals can buy offsets that cost more than $1200 a ton. Bulk buyers can get them cheaper. “I bought out their capacity and I got volume discount” Gates said in an interview last month. “I think that may be at $600 [a ton].”

The EU’s ETS was created before direct air capture became a viable technology and it doesn’t currently accept credits for direct air capture. Yet a growing number of analysts say such offsets will need to become part of the program to ensure Europe meets its Green Deal objective of becoming climate-neutral by 2050.

That’s one reason why Gates and Microsoft are backing projects by Climeworks. “Climeworks’ direct air capture technology will serve as a key component of our carbon removal efforts” said Elizabeth Willmott Microsoft’s carbon removal manager. Musk announced last month that he’ll fund a new Carbon Removal Prize that will distribute $100 million to the best technology innovations over four years. CarbFix said it’s taking part.

Carbfix was born from a research project and founded in 2007 by Reykjavik Energy the University of Iceland CNRS in France and the Earth Institute at Columbia University. It’s owned by Reykjavik Energy.

The first pilot injections were done in 2012 followed by a full-scale capture plant for two of six high-pressure turbines at the Hellisheidi plant in 2014. The plant’s capture capacity was then doubled in 2016 and the aim is to bring emissions from the plant down to near-zero in the coming years. In 2017 Climeworks installed its direct-air-capture machine at Hellisheidi.

The technology relies on basalts where the carbonated water reacts with elements such as calcium magnesium and iron forming carbonates that fill up empty spaces in the rocks underground. Carbfix is also working with research institutions on making the technology applicable for other types of rock.

The company aims to reach 1 billion metric tons of permanently stored CO₂ in 2030. The global storage potential using the technology is greater than the emissions from burning all fossil fuels on earth according to Carbfix. Europe could theoretically store at least 4000 billion tons of CO₂ in rocks while the U.S. could store at least 7500 billion tons.

“It will never be the only solution” said Aradottir. “We are ambitious and have high hopes that we can bring the technology to scale—and there I’m talking about the gigaton scale—and that we’re able to do this quickly because that’s what the world needs.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90ZXNsYS11bnZlaWwtdXBkYXRlZC1jeWJlcnRydWNrLWNvbWluZy0wMjUzMDIzMjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla To Unveil Updated Cybertruck In Coming Quarter,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said over the weekend that an updated version of the upcoming Cybertruck will be unveiled in the next quarter.

Musk said the present focus has to be on building the Gigafactory in Texas where the vehicle will be built.

Why It Matters: In October last year Musk had said that the Cybertruck was going to be “better than what we showed.”

BBY,Best Buy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2dhbWluZy93aGVyZS10by1zZWxsLW9sZC1nYW1lLWNvbnNvbGVzLXBzNC14Ym94LXN3aXRjaC1nYW1lc3RvcC1mYWNlYm9va9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where to sell old game consoles: GameStop Facebook and 4 more options,"It might be time to trade in your old console. If you’re hoping to upgrade to a PS5 or Xbox Series X selling your PS4 or Xbox One can help slice down those $500 price tags. With recent rumors of a Switch Pro coming this year you also might want to start considering where you can trade in your old model soon too.

There is no shortage of ways to sell hardware these days. In addition to DIY websites where you can post your own listing several retailers will give you cash for consoles. There are way too many options on the internet these days so here are a few of the best ways you can sell your console when it’s finally time to say goodbye.

But first: How did gaming get you through the pandemic? We want to hear from you! Take this quick Inverse survey.

Below we'll break down the pros and cons of selling your old gaming hardware at:

Best Buy

eBay

Marketplace apps

GameStop

Local retailers

Facebook Marketplace

A Best Buy store. Best Buy

6. Best Buy

Best Buy has its own console trade-in program not unlike other retailers on this list. Get rid of a system and you’ll get some store credit in return. For example a 500GB PS4 in good working condition can net you up to $70 in credit. That’s not huge but it’ll certainly help you put a dent in the price of a new console. There are more preferable retailers but Best Buy is a strong option if it’s more convenient to get to one.

5. eBay

Yes eBay is still a thing. The auction website may not be the powerhouse brand it was in the ’90s but it’s still an excellent way to sell items on your own terms. The best part about eBay is its bidding function that lets users pay more to beat out the competition. That means that you can get more than your original listing price with the right item. With old consoles it’s unlikely that you’ll actually get users into a bidding war unless you set the price very low but you truly never know what will happen on the internet.

4. Marketplace apps

If none of those suit your fancy there are plenty of marketplace apps out there with similar functions. These will allow you to upload a product set your price and wait for someone to bite. If you’re not sure what’s out there here are a few highlights to consider.

3. GameStop

GameStop’s primary use in this day and age is as a trade-in center. The game retailer may be struggling in the age of digital gaming but there’s always a need to sell consoles. This is your best and easiest bet if you’re itching to get rid of a system. Note that while GameStop will give you cash it'll offer more money if you take it as in-store credit. The latter allows you to put money earned towards a purchase there. It’s especially a great way to sell one console and pick up another on the same trip.

2. Sell local

One of the best ways to sell consoles is also great for your local community. Call up a smaller retailer in your neighborhood to see if they’ll buy your old console. This is especially useful for mom-and-pop stores that specialize in video games. While other major retailers only offer credit for trades there’s a better chance that you’ll get cash at a local store too depending on their policies. You’ll be supporting small businesses and getting a great deal at the same time.

1. Facebook Marketplace

The Facebook Marketplace has really emerged as an excellent way to sell just about anything in recent years. Rather than haggling with a retailer you get to set your own price and terms for your system. That means you’ll have a better chance of getting more money for your hardware. It also helps that you have a built-in network of friends you can try to sell to via Facebook. You can always take a gamble with strangers but being able to help a mutual out is always just plain nice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGFtZGFuemlnZXIvMjAyMS8wMy8wNi9mb3ItcmV0YWlsZXJzLWdpdmluZy1lbXBsb3llZXMtZXh0cmEtcGF5LWlzLWdvb2QtYnV0LWFwcHJlY2lhdGlvbi1iZXR0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For Retailers Giving Employees Extra Pay Is Good But Appreciation Better,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2021/03/06/for-retailers-giving-employees-extra-pay-is-good-but-appreciation-better/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGFtZGFuemlnZXIvMjAyMS8wMy8wNi9mb3ItcmV0YWlsZXJzLWdpdmluZy1lbXBsb3llZXMtZXh0cmEtcGF5LWlzLWdvb2QtYnV0LWFwcHJlY2lhdGlvbi1iZXR0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9yZXZpZXcvc2Ftc3VuZy1xODB0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung Q80T (55-Inch) Review: Good but Expensive,"Most of us just need a TV that can look good next to a bright window whether for watching sports movies shows or playing video games. It doesn't need to be a cinematic behemoth that costs $2000 or more.

The Samsung Q80T sits in this tier. It's a semi-premium QLED TV with local dimming. It's bright enough for well-lit rooms and fast enough to work well with modern game systems. There’s even a center pedestal mount so you don’t have to buy an extra-long TV stand.

In the vacuum of Samsung's dizzying TV lineup it's the best TV for anyone who doesn't drive an import or own Tesla stock. Unfortunately most people should shop elsewhere. You can get the same tech from competitors like Vizio and TCL for hundreds less.

The New Q

Let’s get one quick thing out of the way. The Q80T made its way to reviewers and store shelves very late last year and it is technically a 2020 model. It’s currently the newest and cheapest Samsung TV you can get with local dimming a backlighting feature that allows the screen to dynamically dim parts of the screen while keeping other areas bright offering richer contrast. As far as I’m concerned that's a requirement for any modern TV.

All of our favorite non-OLED displays feature some form of local dimming from our perennial favorite TCL 6-series on up. That's why the Q80T is the most basic Samsung model anyone should really consider in 2021.

In the Lineup

It's not surprising that the bottom end of Samsung's local dimming line (the Q80T) is more expensive than similar models from TCL and Vizio. Samsung is a high-end TV manufacturer these days. It makes astonishing 8K models TVs that look like iconic paintings when they’re not in use and even a weird easel-like TV that rotates so you can watch TikTok videos vertically.

Paying up does net you some perks like smarter design. The two most immediately noticeable improvements I love are the center pedestal mount for easy placement anywhere and the excellent cable routing in the ribbed area on the back.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL2RlYWxzL2dldC10aGlzLXVsdHJhLXNtYWxsLXVsdHJhLWZhc3QtY2hhcmdpbmctMTAwMDAtbWFoLXBvd2VyLWJhbmstZm9yLWp1c3QtMTYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Get this ultrasmall ultrafast-charging 10000-mAh power bank for just $16,"When it comes to power banks the smaller the better so it's hard to beat Aukey's PB-N83 one of the smallest 10000-mAh models we've ever seen. It's a little over an inch thick but fits comfortably on a credit card. Combine that with the fact that it has dual charging ports -- an 18-watt Power Delivery USB-C connection and a Quick Charge 3.0 USB-A port and you have a formidable charger. Regularly priced at $21 right now you can get the Aukey PB-N83 power bank for as little as $19 using the coupon on the product page. It's not the lowest price ever but it's close -- within about a buck.

The black model is the better deal. Priced at $21 and featuring a 23% discount you can nab it for $16. If white is more your jam it's regularly priced at $20 and has a 15% discount which adds up to $17. Personally I think the black model looks better and it's cheaper to boot.

There's just one catch here: It doesn't come with a wall plug so you'll need to supply that yourself. That said if you're anything like me you already have a junk drawer full of USB wall plugs so this is no great disappointment.

The Power Delivery and QC3 ports mean this is a power bank designed for modern devices -- whether you want to charge an iPhone 12 Galaxy S21 or iPad this power bank can deliver the juice for your gadgets ' fast-charging modes. And it's small enough for your pocket.

You can skip our analysis of the oil tanker industry and its demand growth and go to 5 Best Oil Tanker Stocks To Buy Now.

The boom of the oil tanker industry is undeniable as the world has been heavily dependent on the steady flow of oil transfer from one point to another. The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in upsetting effects on the supply chain of oil which experienced an unprecedented decline in demand. According to the International Energy Agency (EIA) the average barrels of oil consumed per day decreased to an upsetting 30 million during the pandemic as compared to the usual consumption of 65-70 million barrels per day. The decline in demand forced the reduction of oil production because of the unavailability of land-based storage areas for oil. However oil producers were partially able to keep producing above the demand as they were able to use oil tankers as an alternative for oil storage. So the oil tanker industry actually benefitted from the pandemic despite the huge collapse in demand. In a separate article Business Standard noted that an increase in sea storage sparked 6-8 times higher charges where vessels may charge up to $200000 per day from $25000 per day before the pandemic.

Despite the global efforts to reduce climate change and rely solely on renewable sources the demand for oil continues to increase in relation to oil drilling and transport. In a report by Statista from 1980 to 2020 the global oil tanker fleet deadweight tonnage (DWT) increased around 77% throughout the 40 years. As of 2020 the number has already stood at 601 million deadweight tonnage.

The collapse of oil demand in 2020 is a temporary phenomenon. Economists expect oil demand to come back in 2021 and we can already see this in oil prices as US benchmark crude futures surpassed $66 on Friday.

Oil and Gas Forecast

The oil and gas industry is highly volatile as both supply side shocks and demand side shocks affect the industry at any time. Amongst most of the industries that recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic the oil and gas industry was left with the most uncertain rebound. According to an article published by Deloitte investors were not as bullish on the industry during the pandemic as S&P 500 index oil prices and energy stocks underperformed since July 2020. In the same article it was shared that the US oil and gas companies had to furlough around 14% of their employees because of the lower demand in the sector. The 2021 demand for oil will recover however the number is still expected to be around 5-7% lower than pre-pandemic levels.

Story continues

Growth of the Oil and Gas Industry

The Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve surveyed oil producers during the fourth quarter and found that most of the companies will limit their capital expenditures in 2021. Some companies' hesitations were brought about by the increase in electric vehicle (EV) demand and governments' efforts to achieve net zero-emissions by 2050. It is true that the long-term trajectory of oil consumption isn't encouraging for oil investors however we are still a long way away from that. McKinsey estimates that the global demand for oil will exceed 100 million barrels per day by the end of 2021 and gradually increase to 102-10 million level by 2025. According to McKinsey the oil industry spent $309 billion on development and maintenance capital expenditures in 2019 and projects a 34% decline in 2021 to $194 billion. McKinsey also estimates that capital expenditures will only increase to $234 billion in 2022. We believe oil producers are going to be slow in investing and this will continue to push the oil prices higher in 2021 but oil industry is a very competitive industry and higher oil prices will lead to higher capital expenditures and more production by oil companies in 2022.

In order to identify the 11 best oil tanker stocks to buy now we created a list of oil tanker stocks by searching Google as well as using articles like 12 Largest Oil Tanker Companies in the World published by Insider Monkey. We were able to narrow down our list to the 11 best oil tanker stocks using the hedge fund sentiment data.

We rely on hedge fund sentiment indicators because we have been able to use them to identify promising investment ideas in our premium newsletters. The portfolio of stocks that are shared in Insider Monkey’s monthly newsletter outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26th 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 197.2% vs. 72.4% for the SPY (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16.

10. Frontline Ltd (NYSE:FRO)

No of HFs: 6

Total Value of HF Holdings: $4.7 Million

The 10th best oil tanker stock to buy now is Frontline Ltd. The company operates 24 crude carriers 28 Suezmax tankers and 20 Aframax. The company offers a dividend yield of 28.25%. The year 2020 was one of the strongest for the company. FRO reported a net income of $412.9 million or $2.09 per diluted share.

There were 6 hedge funds in our database that held stakes in Frontline Ltd compared to 10 funds in the third quarter. Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP is the biggest stakeholder in the company which had 364 thousand shares worth $2.3 million at the end of December.

Evermore Global Advisors mentioned the stock in its Q2 2020 investor letter:

“Frontline (FRO US) one of the largest crude tanker vessel operators led by John Fredriksen was the second largest detractor to Fund performance during the second quarter. Despite the limited company-specific news flow the aggressive production cuts by Saudi Arabia Russia and OPEC+ have put pressure on Frontline’s share price. Short-term traders and retail investors have interpreted this development as an immediate destocking of inventories that will reduce the absolute demand for seaborne transportation of crude. While frustrating it is important to note that there have been several port disruptions and logistical dislocations related to COVID-19 that we believe will take more time than anticipated to destock the oil that was stored on floating storage (tankers) from the recent contango and demand. History shows that it did take longer than one expected when the destocking kicked off during the last time when there was a prevalence of floating storage on the water. In the end the longer wait time to load/unload cargoes will maintain the reduced effective crude tanker fleet supply in the market. In addition we believe Frontline has secured attractive rates during the second quarter which imputes strong free cash flow generation. Frontline paid a quarterly dividend of $0.70 per share in June implying an annualized dividend yield in excess of 35%. We believe the company will continue to pay out excess cash flow as dividends as it has done historically.”

The expectations for 2021 oil demand to grow by 5.4 million barrels per day. Full demand recovery to the pre-COVID-19 levels is deferred to late 2021 or in 2022 subject to how well the world will manage the resurgence of the pandemic how effective the two vaccines are and the other vaccines that are being developed and how quickly they will be approved and distributed worldwide in order to allow the gradual return to normal social and economic life.

These agricultural investments largely unnoticed and unchecked represent a potentially catastrophic blind spot.

“Animal protein and even dairy is likely and already has started to become the new oil and gas” said Bruno Sarda the former North America president of CDP a framework through which companies disclose their carbon emissions. “This is the biggest source of emissions that doesn’t have a target on its back.”

By pouring money into emissions-intensive agriculture banks and investors are making a dangerous bet on the world’s growing demand for food especially foods that are the greatest source of emissions in the food system: meat and dairy.

Agriculture and deforestation largely driven by livestock production are responsible for nearly one quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. By 2030 livestock production alone could consume nearly half the world’s carbon budget the amount of greenhouse gas the world can emit without blowing past global climate targets.

“It’s not enough to divest from fossil fuel” said Devlin Kuyek a senior researcher at GRAIN a non-profit organization that advocates for small farms. “If you look at emissions just from the largest meat and dairy companies and the trajectories they have you see that these companies and their models are completely unsustainable.”

Those trajectories could put global climate goals well out of reach.

The American banks that are the four leading financiers globally of fossil fuels —JP Morgan Chase Wells Fargo Citigroup and Bank of America—all to varying degrees have made climate action more of a priority. But these and other major global banks continue to funnel dollars into companies that trade in “soft commodities”including beef soy timber and palm oil that are linked to the destruction of forests and critically important ecosystems.

A battery of recent analyses by sustainable investment and environmental advocacy groups has tracked the dollars. JP Morgan Chase for example has directed more than $450 million since 2016 to leading Brazilian meat packers that environmental groups claim have direct ties to deforestation and to recent devastating fires in the Amazon. BNP Paribas and HSBC are among the banks that have committed to stop funding deforestation from agriculture but still continue to provide billions to companies that have not.

Though they have promised to address climate change Rabobank Morgan Stanley Barclays and Goldman Sachs continue funding agribusinesses directly or indirectly involved in deforestation or high-carbon agriculture.

The banks either declined to comment for this article or did not respond to requests for comment. HSBC and Morgan Stanley pointed to their sustainability commitments online.

“We’re still trying to get the banks to recognize that the land-use sector is part of the climate problem” said Hana Heineken a senior campaigner with the Rainforest Action Network an advocacy group that has extensively tracked how banks have financed deforestation. “As things stand right now there is still a disconnect between banks saying they’re going to address climate change in their portfolios and what they’re going to do about financing.”

The world’s largest asset managers—BlackRock Vanguard and State Street—sell investment funds marketed as “sustainable.” But some of these funds contain agribusiness companies blamed for cutting down tropical forests. And the asset managers are among the biggest investors in major meat and dairy companies including JBS the world’s largest beef producer. None of these asset managers has a formal policy on deforestation environmental groups say.

When reached for comment the asset managers pointed to their sustainability platforms online and noted increased efforts to address deforestation and climate impacts from agriculture in their portfolios. In early 2020 BlackRock acknowledged the climate impacts of certain agribusiness practices and said it would push for greater disclosure of sustainability measures from companies in its funds.

The world’s food system needs to feed a population expected to hit 10 billion by 2050 meaning that the system will have 3 billion more people to feed than it did a decade ago. Global investors and banks see an opportunity in these numbers and in some cases are doubling down.

The climate impact of this could be disastrous with emissions from the food system projected to rise by nearly 60 percent if they stay on their current path.

Faced with these dire numbers some critics are increasingly calling for divestment from the food and agriculture companies with the biggest climate impacts—especially giant livestock and grain companies—much as they’ve called for divestment from fossil fuel companies.

Others are simply calling for more vigilance in policing destructive farming practices and the financial institutions that support them. They’re also pushing for more support for farmers and farming methods that use fewer resources emit fewer greenhouse gases and replenish soils.

“We need food” said Moira Birss climate and finance director for Amazon Watch. “And we don’t need fossil fuels.”

As demand for food rises the world’s banks and investors will ultimately determine whether an increasingly taxed food system fuels a climate collapse.

Big Banks Have Big Impacts

Agriculture is the biggest driver of deforestation globally responsible for half of all recent tree loss and more than 90 percent in the tropics.

Palm oil soy and cattle are the largest commodities behind that loss with cattle accounting for from half to two-thirds as agribusiness interests or their suppliers cut down or burn forests to open up more pasture to graze the animals or cropland to feed them. These commodities known as “soft commodities” because they are grown not extracted pose the most significant risks to forests.

They are also the keys to profit for the agriculture and food industries.

Clearing forests releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide and destroys their ability to store carbon. It’s also a major cause of soil erosion and biodiversity loss which create yet more risk to the global food supply and to public health as the coronavirus pandemic has so clearly illustrated. With the destruction of large ecosystems biodiversity plummets. The species that survive tend to be the ones that harbor and spread disease.

While the burning of fossil fuels remains the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions emissions from agriculture would have to be slashed to stay within the 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius targets of the Paris climate agreement. That’s even if the rest of the economy including the energy and transportation sectors adequately decarbonized.

Stopping deforestation is one of the fastest ways to limit carbon emissions. Yet the world’s biggest banks and asset managers are fueling the problem instead.

The UK-based group Global Canopy examined the companies with the greatest exposure to deforestation including financial institutions. It found that despite making commitments to stop deforestation by 2020 as of 2018 not a single company was on track to cut deforestation from its supply chains. These included a range of companies that rely on commodities tied to deforestation including McDonald’s and PepsiCo.

Banks Global Canopy concluded were the biggest laggards: “Financial institutions are behind companies in setting commitments and policies on deforestation. Of the 150 financial institutions assessed nearly two thirds had no financing policy for any of the four key forest-risk commodities” their report said. In its 2020 analysis the group found 63 percent of financial institutions still did not have deforestation policies.

This despite the banks’ outward claims and commitments to tackling climate change.

In fact the world’s major banks are accelerating their funding of commodities tied to deforestation in Latin America Africa and Southeast Asia. Among the top banks funding “forest-risk” commodities—those potentially responsible for deforestation —are JP Morgan Chase and Rabobank the world’s leading agricultural bank which has said it does not fund deforestation in any areas of Brazil.

Many of their commitments—public and much applauded—have come since the Paris climate agreement. Yet as with the funding of fossil fuels the money they are investing has ballooned since the historic accord. Overall global banks have increased their lending to commodities linked to deforestation by about 40 percent funneling $154 billion in credit from December 2015 when the agreement was signed to April of last year.

Most of these forests are being converted into cropland to grow grain to feed livestock or to pastureland to graze cattle. The conversion doesn’t just destroy forests releasing carbon dioxide in the process it multiplies the number of animals that emit methane an especially potent greenhouse gas.

Financial think tanks and green investment groups in report after report have found that major global banks have made promises to stop financing deforestation but have not lived up to them. Not a single major bank that has committed to stop financing deforestation from soft commodities has done so completely or quickly enough according to a December report from BankTrack.

And no American bank has required its clients to adopt no-deforestation policies.

JP Morgan Citigroup and Bank of America are among the top US-based creditors of American commodities giants Cargill Bunge and ADM which supply major American food businesses from McDonald’s to Walmart.

These grain traders have made commitments to stop deforestation but continue to come under fire for their vast soy plantations one of the largest drivers of deforestation in South America.

Cargill and Bunge did not respond to requests for comment.

Edel Bach a spokesman for JBS said the company has a “zero-tolerance approach to illegal deforestation” and “has made extensive investments… to monitor its entire Amazon value chain to ensure it is illegal deforestation free by 2025.”

Jackie Anderson a spokeswoman for ADM explained that the company has a no-deforestation policy is a signatory to a moratorium on deforestation in the Amazon and is a founding member of the Soft Commodities Forum an effort to stop deforestation and land conversion in the soy supply chain.

Recent research has found that despite making these commitments the major grain traders are still producing commodities that are tied to deforestation in areas of Brazil beyond the Amazon. These same companies continue to be blamed for deforestation linked to palm oil in Southeast Asia much of which ends up in products made by top international consumer goods companies.

The Role of the Asset Managers

The biggest asset managers led by BlackRock are also significantly invested in the meat and dairy industries and in other commodities linked with deforestation.

Though meat and dairy account for less than 1 percent of their total assets under management BlackRock Capital Group and Vanguard are the meat and dairy industries’ largest shareholders according to Feedback Global.

Blackrock and Vanguard are also JP Morgan’s largest shareholders.

BlackRock Vanguard and State Street—“The Big Three” asset managers— have $12 billion invested in producers linked to deforestation including the major grain traders ADM Bunge and Cargill and the meatpackers JBS Marfrig and Minerva according to a recent analysis by Friends of the Earth. ADM Bunge Cargill and JBS in turn indirectly and directly supply some of the world’s biggest consumer goods companies including PepsiCo Nestlé and Unilever.

The report puts much of the blame on the big asset managers. “Powerful investors have consistently undermined meaningful action by agribusinesses and the consumer goods sector writ large” the analysis said.

The asset managers say they have no control over the companies in their funds because the majority of their investment products are passively managed index funds. These types of funds follow a major market index like the S&P 500 which means the index manager actually controls which companies are in the fund.

“Every dollar that BlackRock manages belongs to our clients and more than 90% of our equity assets are invested in index-based funds that our clients choose” a spokesman for BlackRock responded in an email. “We cannot selectively divest from individual companies in indexes that may present sustainability risks.”

A Vanguard spokesperson said that while there is “no industry acknowledged specific exclusion regarding deforestation” Vanguard’s sustainability funds track an index that filters out companies that fail to align with principles outlined by the United Nations. (These do not explicitly mention deforestation.)

State Street and Capital Advisors pointed to their sustainability statements online.

But critics say that the Big Three and other major asset managers are getting a pass and that they could exclude certain companies from their basket of investments if they implemented no-deforestation policies or structured their products differently.

“They could put in place explicit screening tools” said Matthew McLuckie managing partner at Posaidon Capital a London and Zurich-based green investment firm. “If you are going to support a net-zero transition or Paris alignment how can you be holding companies chopping down tropical forests?”

In emailed responses to questions about their deforestation practices McDonald’s Nestlé Unilever and Walmart said that they had made commitments to source their products only from deforestation-free areas: McDonald’s said it would eliminate deforestation from its supply chain by 2030; Nestlé said it would stop sourcing soy and palm from deforested areas by 2022 and stopped buying Brazilian soybeans from Cargill in 2019; Unilever said its supply chains would be deforestation-free by 2023; Walmart said it would stop sourcing beef in deforested areas of Brazil by 2022 among other commitments. PepsiCo did not respond to a request for comment.

Disclosure is Voluntary

Over the last decade investors and regulators have pushed companies including financial institutions to disclose their carbon emissions.

Disclosure is a key first step toward giving investors and banks the information they need to make informed decisions about where to put—or not to put— their money.

Guidelines like those outlined by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and platforms including the CDP (formerly the Climate Disclosure Project) have prompted greater responses from a growing number of companies that see climate change as a risk.

Without disclosures banks and investors aren’t equipped with information about the greenhouse gas impacts of the companies including banks that they invest in or support.

But these disclosure requirements are voluntary and critically they don’t comprehensively reveal the extent of deforestation or other climate risks in companies’ agricultural supply chains.

The TFCD guidelines the most robust and widely used explicitly say that banks don’t have to disclose emissions from agriculture. Rather the task force “suggests banks define carbon-related assets as those assets tied to the energy and utilities sectors.”

That means for banks at least in the framework of the TCFD agriculture isn’t a “carbon-related” asset so banks don’t have to reveal the extent to which they finance them.

Critics say this allows banks and the companies they finance to hide behind their supply chains. JP Morgan’s first report using the TCFD guidelines for example contains no mention of the bank’s investment in commodities with ties to deforestation.

Most of the emissions from agriculture and food companies come from their “Scope 3” emissions—emissions not from their direct operations but from their supply chains. Nearly 90 percent of food and agribusiness company emissions fall into this category experts say but only a fraction of the companies report them. Of the world’s top food and beverage companies only 16 percent disclose emissions from their agricultural supply chains.

Many companies don’t report on the deforestation in their supply chains at all. Those include Domino’s Pizza and Mondelez. And even those that do disclose may not depending on the company include a complete picture of emissions from deforestation or importantly the conversion of land from forest to pasture or cropland.

A Domino’s spokesman said the company provides information on sourcing for its U.S. products on its website and is currently developing a climate strategy. Mondelez did not reply to a request for comment.

Part of the problem is not just the general murkiness of supply chains but a lack of common principles for measuring emissions from land conversion and deforestation.

“In greenhouse gas accounting of Scope 3 emissions it’s challenging to get high quality data because they don’t have a lot of transparency in their supply chains” said Cynthia Cummis a greenhouse gas accounting expert with the World Resources Institute. “The science behind land-based emissions is challenging and there isn’t agreement on the best methods.”

Companies can take advantage of that critics say. The data self-reported to CDP by the companies is not audited by a third party and critics say CDP’s rating system rewards companies for having a policy on deforestation even if that policy is weak.

“In effect you’re taking a company’s word” said McLuckie. “Investors are left largely in the dark.”

‘This is Just About Money’

Demand for “green” investments that meet environmental standards has grown in recent years as progressive investors pressure companies to address climate change. “Impact investing” has gained traction with investors and sustainable funds now control more than $1 trillion in assets doubling according to a 2020 analysis by Morningstar over the three years before the study.

A 2019 report from the Croatan Institute found that impact investing now accounts for more than $17 trillion—or one in three dollars—of the more than $51 trillion in assets under professional management a 42 percent increase over 2018.

In a January 2020 commentary BlackRock acknowledged that agribusinesses have a significant climate impact especially because of their links to deforestation and said that the company would engage with those companies to improve their performance.

“Amongst other things we ask companies to disclose any initiatives and externally developed codes of conduct e.g. committing to deforestation-free supply chains to which they adhere and to report on outcomes ideally with some level of independent review” the company reported.

But some of BlackRock’s sustainable investment funds contain large agribusiness companies with ties to deforestation. For a company to be included in the fund it needs to provide an inventory of its greenhouse gas emissions but not its Scope 3 emissions.

“You have huge agroindustrial companies —chemical fertilizer seed monopolies— in these so-called sustainability funds” said Mark Campanale executive director of Carbon Tracker. “If they’re the answer we’re asking the wrong questions.”

Giant fund managers establish criteria for the risk they’ll take on in their portfolios but because of the lack of transparency and uniform standards on disclosure they may not know the extent of the emissions from any given company.

Companies with supply chains linked to deforestation often defend themselves by saying that the supply chains are too complicated to monitor effectively and that doing so would be prohibitively expensive.

Some companies notably Unilever are investing millions to clarify their supply chains so investors and consumers know exactly where their products are sourced. But many companies hide behind their supply chains some analysts say.

“They try to do everything they can to be intransparent in their supply chains” said Gerard Rijk senior equity analyst with Profundo a Netherlands-based research group that tracks supply chains and investing. “It’s clear they’re not trying hard enough. This is just about money.”

One initiative the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) created a system that enables financial institutions to assess their “financed emissions.” Like supply chain emissions a financial institution’s loans and investments are Scope 3 emissions and represent the vast majority of their emissions.

In July Morgan Stanley became the first U.S. banking giant to join PCAF. It was followed soon after by Bank of America and Citi. As of February 2021 PCAF included 101 financial institutions representing more than $21 trillion in assets.

But PCAF’s methodology a work in progress does not yet encompass carbon emitted from land-use conversion when land is changed from forest to crop or pastureland one of the biggest sources of emissions from agriculture.

Doubling Down

To feed 10 billion people by 2050 the world needs to produce 50 to 70 percent more food.

For investors those are appealing figures.

“Demand is going up and there’s a lot of money to be made” said Merel van der Mark coordinator of the forests and finance coalition for the Rainforest Action Network.

In a 2018 report Valoral Advisors said there were roughly 440 funds in the food and agriculture sector up from 38 in 2005. Those funds managed around $73 billion in investments. “The last 10 years have seen the emergence of the global F&A sector as an institutional asset class with increasing interest from private and institutional investors alike” Valoral said referring to the food and agriculture sector.

Indeed investors seem to be doubling down in part because they’re getting a strong message about future demand. That’s true for food of all kinds but especially for meat and dairy as appetites and incomes rise in developing countries.

A marked uptick in agricultural investing occurred after the 2008 financial crisis when global food prices spiked and investors began seeing opportunities especially in farmland.

“Within the financial sector there’s just been an evolving and growing effort to find returns wherever they can and it’s moving beyond your traditional investments” said Kuyek of GRAIN. “That’s part of the reason you’re seeing investment in agriculture.”

The profits to be made from meat and dairy are especially enticing largely because of rising demand but also because low grain prices have made it increasingly cheap to produce beef and milk at lower costs.

“There’s been a meat-ification of diets particularly in the US Europe Brazil and Australia and increasingly China” said Daniel Jones a senior campaign manager with Feedback. “We know that meat and dairy is a climate issue but why is it that meat and dairy continues to grow? Is it an insatiable human appetite for meat? Probably not.”

Saying but Not Doing

As investors increasingly move toward investing in sustainable investment funds and impact investing grows shareholders and green-focused asset managers have been pushing companies to tackle their climate impacts.

They do this through a range of actions including putting forward shareholder resolutions requesting climate action.

Because the giant asset managers are often the largest shareholders in corporations—including banks—their votes can determine whether a resolution passes or not. And for the most part even asset managers that have committed to addressing climate change often have failed to support climate-related resolutions. In 2020 for example BlackRock and Vanguard voted against climate-related resolutions more than 80 percent of the time.

On agriculture-specific resolutions the numbers are even lower.

In cases where BlackRock did vote with shareholder proposals in favor of climate action the companies it targeted were largely energy companies not those with agricultural supply chains and links to deforestation. Since 2012 the Big Three have voted against or abstained from 16 shareholder proposals aimed specifically at deforestation. (In a notable exception BlackRock voted in 2020 to support a shareholder proposal at Procter & Gamble that asked the company to report on its efforts to eliminate deforestation in its supply chain).

“There’s absolutely a big gap full-stop” said Jessye Waxman shareholder advocate with Green Century Funds. “I think this speaks to the broader questions about what it really means for a firm to be addressing climate risk comprehensively. If you want to address climate risk you need to address agriculture.”

Feedback Global and other critics contend that engagement—from appealing to companies directly to shareholder resolutions—isn’t working. They’re now calling for divestment from carbon-intensive agricultural and livestock companies.

Still other critics say that banks and investors have an opportunity to influence companies toward more sustainable forms of agriculture.

“Our call isn’t for full and immediate divestment from the agriculture industry as it essentially is for fossil fuels” said Birss of Amazon Watch. “It’s not the same. We can’t say it’s all terrible.”

But she added “If irreparable harms to the climate come from the production of food those who are carrying out the production of that food and the people providing the one necessary ingredient —finance—have a responsibility to ensure those irreparable harms aren’t happening.”

Among the biggest winners will be Moderna and Pfizer – two very different US pharma firms which are both charging more than $30 per person for the protection of their two-dose vaccines. While Moderna was founded just 11 years ago has never made a profit and employed just 830 staff pre-pandemic Pfizer traces its roots back to 1849 made a net profit of $9.6bn last year and employs nearly 80000 staff.

But other drugmakers such as the British-Swedish AstraZeneca and the US pharma Johnson & Johnson have pledged to provide their vaccines on a not-for-profit basis until the pandemic comes to an end.

Whether the market remains a money-spinner in the future depends on whether the vaccines become the type that need just a one-off shot – as for measles – or if regular vaccinations will be required such as for flu. But in the immediate future there are big financial returns up for grabs.

Here we look at who is in line for the biggest gains – and which shareholders have already made fortunes.

1 Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine

Pfizer’s Comirnaty vaccine developed with Germany’s BioNTech is based on re-engineered messenger RNA – the molecule that sends genetic instructions from DNA to a cell’s protein-making machinery. It was the first to be approved and has to be stored at ultra-low temperatures (-70C). Governments have ordered about 780m shots including the US (200m doses for $3.9bn) and the EU commission (300m) while 40m doses will go to lower-income nations via the Covax facility. It costs $39 (£28) for two doses in the US and about $30 in the EU.

Expected sales in 2021: $15bn-$30bn

Pfizer which splits costs and profit margins equally with BioNTech expects $15bn in 2021 sales based on current deals. The final number could be twice as high as Pfizer says it can potentially deliver 2bn doses this year. Barclays analyst Carter Gould is predicting sales of $21.5bn in 2021 $8.6bn next year and $1.95bn in 2023 on the assumption that the jab is given as a one-off shot.

Pfizer: +1.8%

BioNTech: +156%

The two founders of BioNTech the husband and wife team Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci – both doctors – became multibillionaires last year when the potential of the vaccine and the deal with Pfizer prompted the shares to surge.

2 Moderna mRNA vaccine

The vaccine produced by the US biotech firm based in Massachusetts must be stored at freezer temperature (-20C). The UK has ordered 17m doses the EU bought 310m with an option for a further 150m in 2022 while the US government ordered 300m shots. Japan purchased 50m shots. Moderna charges $30 for the required two shots in the US and $36 in the EU.

Expected sales in 2021: $18bn-$20bn

Moderna has said it expects 2021 sales of $18.4bn. Barclays analyst Gena Wang forecasts sales of $19.6bn $12.2bn in 2022 and $11.4bn in 2023 assuming recurring vaccinations.

+372%

A group of investors that backed the company when it was founded in 2010 will have made substantial returns. The chief executive Stéphane Bancel a 48-year-old French executive owns 9% of the shares now worth nearly $5bn.

3 Johnson & Johnson Adenovirus vaccine

J&J’s jab the world’s first single-shot Covid-19 vaccine was developed by its Janssen division in Belgium. It uses adenovirus-26 a rare variant of cold virus. It was approved in the US in late February and can be stored at standard fridge temperatures for at least three months. Big orders include the US UK (30m doses plus option for 22m) the EU (up to 400m doses) and Covax nations (500m doses through 2022).

Expected sales in 2021: up to $10bn

The company aims to deliver at least 1bn doses this year which would generate $10bn. The US government has ordered 100m doses with the option to buy 200m more and is paying $10 a shot.

4 AstraZeneca Adenovirus vector vaccine

The vaccine developed with Oxford University uses a modified chimpanzee cold virus and can be kept at fridge temperature. Viral vector vaccines use a harmless virus to deliver a piece of genetic code to cells. Big orders have come from the UK (100m) the EU (up to 400m) the US (300m) and Japan (£120m).

Expected sales in 2021: $2bn-$3bn

Analysts at SVB Leerink are forecasting sales of $1.9bn this year and $3bn in 2022. The 2021 figure could be far higher if AstraZeneca achieves its ambitious target of 3bn doses. The company has pledged to supply the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis during this pandemic and charges $4.30 to $10 for two doses.

5 Sinovac Inactivated virus vaccine

The CoronaVac jab has been administered for emergency use in several Chinese cities since last summer and was approved by China’s regulator in early February. Sinovac which is based in Beijing has struck deals with Brazil Chile Singapore Malaysia and the Philippines. In January Turkey and Indonesia kicked off their vaccination campaigns with the jab. Sinovac also plans to supply 10m vaccine doses to Covax nations.

Expected sales in 2021: billions of dollars but unclear

Sinovac says it can produce more than 1bn doses this year. The vaccine has been priced at $60 for two shots in some Chinese cities. Sinovac’s Indonesian partner Bio Farma which has ordered at least 40m doses said it would cost $27.20 for two doses locally.

6 Gamaleya Institute/Russian Direct Investment Fund Adenovirus vaccine

Although it has not been approved by the EU regulator yet Hungary and Slovakia have bought the Russian vaccine Sputnik V. In total more than 50 countries including Iran Algeria and Mexico have ordered it. AstraZeneca is testing a two-shot combination of its vaccine with Sputnik.

Expected sales in 2021: unclear but possibly billions

The developers are struggling to mass-produce Sputnik in Russia but RDIF a sovereign wealth fund told the Financial Times last month that it had signed contracts with 15 manufacturers in 10 countries to produce 1.4bn jabs. The developers have said they would charge $20 or less for the required two doses internationally but are providing it free in Russia.

7 Novavax Recombinant protein vaccine

The Novavax vaccine uses a small fragment of a lab-made version of the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein. The US firm hopes for regulatory approval in the UK US and other countries in the first half. The company has been researching vaccines for more than 30 years and has never before had a jab approved. It has agreed to supply 300m doses so far including the UK (60m doses) EU Canada and Australia. It hopes to produce 150m doses a month and is expected to be cheaper than rivals. According to the Financial Times the company has agreed to charge $3 a shot in Africa. The vaccine will also be made in Stockton-on-Tees in north-east England and can be be kept at fridge temperature.

Expected sales in 2021: ‘several billion dollars’

Based on these deals Novavax said this week it sees “the potential for several billion dollars in revenue in the next 12 months”. This is set to rise as Novavax expects to be able to make 2bn doses a year by mid-2021 thanks to a partnership with the Serum Institute of India.

The biggest financial gains will go to fund managers such as Vanguard and BlackRock who are the biggest shareholders.

8 CureVac mRNA vaccine

CureVac expects to publish late-stage results for its CVnCov vaccine in April and hopes to gain EU approval by June. The EU has pre-ordered 225m doses with the option to buy a further 180m. Unlike other mRNA vaccines CureVac’s shot can be stored at fridge temperature. Together with GSK which owns nearly 10% of the German firm it is seeking to develop next-generation shots for multiple emerging Covid-19 variants in one vaccine.

Expected sales in 2021: unclear – pricing not yet revealed but priced at a profit

The Nasdaq-listed biotech aims to produce up to 300m doses this year and 600m to 1bn doses in 2022. CureVac says its jab requires less active ingredient than rivals but insists it cannot price it at cost because investors are expecting a return.

And Kobe Pena provided it.

Jason Peters is usually the star of the show for the Eagles and he hit some monsters in Saturday’s Division III boys basketball championship game but Pena carried the load in the second half. He scored 17 of his team-high 21 points over the final two quarters and in the overtime session hitting a 3-pointer that gave Times2 a lead it would never give up in a 60-54 win over Blackstone Valley Prep.

“Once I hit two of those 3s [in the second half] Coach told me he wanted me to keep shooting the ball” Pena said. “I kept shooting the ball and they kept falling.”

It seemed every shot Pena hit was big.

Down 34-26 heading to the fourth Pena scored six points in an 11-5 spurt that made it 39-37 then dished to Peters for a triple that gave Times2 its first lead since 5:35 left in the second quarter.

BVP built its lead back up to four late but Pena hit another 3 with 2:05 left to cut the deficit to 1.

“Kobe — it’s not unexpected” Peters said. “He puts up big numbers and that’s my go-to guy. If I’m not hot then I’m giving it to him for sure. I know he’ll spark it.”

Peters did too.

The Pride led 48-47 with 56 seconds to go on a driving layup by Daniel Garcia. Peters hit a late 3 to put the Eagles up by two but Xavier Mendez (27 points 11 rebounds) hit a layup with 12 seconds left that got the game to OT.

“Xavier is a hell of a player and was killing us” Pena said. “We were sticking together and just played together.”

Pena buried a 3-pointer from the left wing 1:46 into the extra session and the Eagles went from there. Peters hit a shot from deep on the next possession and went 4-for-4 from the free-throw line to close out the school’s first title.

“It’s definitely a historic moment” said Peters who scored his 1000th career point on that 3-pointer in OT. “I think we’re the only charter school to be Division III champs … and this just proves Times2 can compete with any division.”

“Not at one moment did we ever doubt ourselves” Pena said. “We never came at each other and we were here for each other.”

It was a tough ending for Blackstone Valley Prep and the emotion from the loss was on the players' faces. But getting to the program’s first final was something they were proud of even in defeat.

“We put in the work for it"" Mendez said. ""We did everything we could. We were playing today and playing with our hearts.”

“We knew that we were underdogs coming in” BVP junior Jordan Mendes said. “We did our best.”

Highlander’s Farewell” celebrates a 20-year musical retrospective of one of the most acclaimed duos in traditional music. Blackstone River Theatre will be one of the sponsors for the 3rd concert in a series of 6 completely different shows with Alasdair Fraser and Natalie Haas. The musical partnership between Alasdair Fraser long regarded as Scotland’s premier fiddle ambassador and the sizzlingly-talented young California cellist Natalie Haas may not seem an obvious one. Fraser has a concert and recording career spanning 33 years with a long list of awards accolades television credits and feature performances on top movie soundtracks (Last of the Mohicans Titanic and more). He has been sponsored by the British Council to represent Scotland’s music internationally and he received the Scottish Heritage Center Service Award for outstanding contributions to Scottish culture and traditions.



Haas a graduate of the Juilliard School of Music wasn’t even born when Alasdair was winning national fiddle competitions on the other side of the Atlantic. But this seemingly unlikely pairing is the fulfillment of a long-standing musical dream for Fraser whose cutting-edge musical explorations took him full circle to find a cellist who could help him return the cello to its historical role at the rhythmic heart of Scottish dance music. “Going back to the 1700s and as late as the early 20th century” Fraser says “fiddle and cello made up the dance band of choice in Scotland with the cellist bowing bass lines and driving the rhythm. Pianos and accordions elbowed out the cello relegating it to an orchestral setting.” When Natalie was just 15 Fraser and Haas played their first gig together. Natalie is in the vanguard of young cellists who are redefining the role of the cello in traditional music. Their CD “Fire & Grace” won not only critical acclaim but also the coveted the Scots Trad Music “Album of the Year” award the Scottish equivalent of a Grammy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uYmEvMjAyMS8wMy8wNy9hZGFtLWJsYWNrc3RvbmUtbXVzaWMtZGlyZWN0b3ItbmJhLWFsbC1zdGFyLWdhbWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NBA All-Star Game: Adam Blackstone spotlights HBCU music groups,"Adam Blackstone will play a key role in bringing the 2021 NBA All-Star Game to life. As the league’s musical director for the weekend Blackstone who has worked with artists like Alicia Keys Cardi B and Justin Timberlake as well as for events like the Super Bowl Grammys and Oscars is entrusted with working with the various performers to balance their creative and musical visions and to develop a smooth run of show.

In the lead-up to Sunday's game in Atlanta which will be played in front of a limited group of spectators Blackstone teamed-up with various HBCU musical groups including the Grambling State University Tiger Marching Band and Florida A&M University Marching 100 to weave their identities into the broadcast. For the game’s player introductions the FAMU band will be backing Team LeBron while the Grambling State band will be playing as Team Durant gets called out. The bands themselves were pre-taped though Blackstone will be in a production truck on Sunday during the intros cueing the recordings in real-time to adjust to player reactions in the moment.

“The NBA and musicians and music in general has had a great marriage for a very long time” says Blackstone who has played a role in nearly ever NBA All-Star Game since 2010 and has been the league’s official All-Star Game musical director since 2017. “I love that our game is one of the things that always allows the music and the basketball to be at the forefront at the same time.”

Furthering a commitment to HBCU performing arts groups the Clark Atlanta University Philharmonic Society Choir is slated to perform an original rendition of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” and step teams from Southern University and Morehouse College will also be featured throughout Sunday’s telecast. Blackstone who is teaching a composition and songwriting class at Morehouse this spring is looking forward to showcasing both the tradition—and talent— of the various schools.

In the lead-up to the All-Star Game which will see more than $3 million donated in initial support of HBCUs and communities of color impacted by COVID-19 Blackstone spoke with Sports Illustrated about what it was like working with the marching bands what we can expect to see and hear on Sunday night and the NBA’s partnership with HBCUs for this year’s game.

The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity

Sports Illustrated: What’s the biggest challenge you had to deal with for this year’s event?

Adam Blackstone: One of the biggest challenges was that when you pre-record music you have a timestamp. What I mean by that is let’s just say I do five minutes of live music when we had an audience if Kobe or Dwyane Wade or LeBron got a longer applause than others then on the fly I had to make a decision to say we’re going to loop these eight bars because the announcements are still going.

I take that same mentality when it comes to incorporating the marching bands for this weekend. Something just as little as some of the players getting hurt before the game and now being replaced by other players will add time to everybody we announce. I might need another 20 seconds of music so I’m going to have to loop eight bars and say let’s get the announcer to go over these eight bars. Because technically I had not recorded that so now I’m going to make it seem like I’m producing it live on the spot as if we were all together. So that would be one of the challenges of a gig like this to say we’re going off of a feeling but the music is already recorded.

SI: How do you go about acting on that feeling?

AB: The music is actually recorded but I’m making it loop making it flow making it feel live on the spot by cueing different sections while the announcer and teams and the starters and the reserves and the coaches are being announced.

SI: You mentioned the HBCUs what was it like working with the marching bands in particular?

AB: We’ve been on a bunch of calls and the HBCU band culture is a whole other phenomenon. They’ve evolved from playing just football games and basketball games to having their own competitions whether that be drum line competitions or band competitions or formation competitions and so I have been so involved in making sure we carry on that tradition this weekend—to give the crowds of people watching on television a great show and to help the players get hype.

I picked a bunch of songs with them and I was able to say “Give me your top five Atlanta records that are recognizable.” We’re not coming in this year with a specific artist so you don’t hear a lyric. So one of my jobs was to say “What are the melodic songs that when you hear the melody and don’t hear the lyric you know what it is and still gets you hype.”

SI: Do you have any more specifics on what we should expect?

AB: I think just expect to have a really good entertaining party. For anybody that hasn’t experienced the HBCU culture especially at a basketball game you’re gonna have fun you’re gonna be up on your feet in your living rooms you’re going to be able to dance and be able to hopefully sing along with some of the horn lines and drum line melodies. And we want the players to have fun as well.

I hear LeBron talk about it all the time that no matter how many All-Star Games he’s done it’s always an honor to get that call and be considered one of the top players in your conference. What I want to do in a musical sense is show gratitude and show thankfulness to those players who give us this entertaining sport and continue to uplift us in our culture and in our communities. If I can provide the soundtrack to that for this weekend then so be it. I’ve done my job if everybody is happy and having a good time.

SI: Sticking with the topic of the HBCU involvement what message do you think involving the HBCUs like the league is doing this weekend sends more broadly?

AB: To me it means a lot. We can’t take for granted how long the NBA has been around and we also can’t take for granted the segregation before it was called the National Basketball Association. It was a segregated sport. We have a lot of work to do in our world don’t get me wrong but we have come full circle to now we are encouraging just by the look of the court by the sound with this music and just by an openness to attend Historically Black Colleges and Universities through a platform like All-Star Weekend is huge. I also think that it’s going to open the door for a lot of student-athletes that may be a little bit torn that they didn’t get into Kentucky or Duke Kansas or North Carolina and maybe they end up going to Howard or maybe they end up going to Morehouse and playing ball. And just to know that in this moment the NBA has an eye on them is a big big deal. It gives hope to men and women all over our country to say “No matter what I’m doing and what school I’m at eyes are on us so we should always do our best.”

SI: And you personally have also taken to teaching at Morehouse this semester correct?

AB: Right. And so what we do by highlighting these HBCUs and especially what I teach is that you don’t have to play an instrument or shoot a ball to be in the NBA. For what I do I get to be on the floor for the All-Star Game and it has nothing technically to do with basketball itself. I’m thankful I get to bring awareness and bring that light to say “Hey every camera operator is at the NBA All-Star Game every technician a sound person they’re at the NBA All-Star Game.” Education really outweighs everything and I do think this year plays a special role by highlighting HBCUs and highlighting the fact that school is a big part of culture. School should be a big part of our successes. It is not corny to be educated. It is actually very very fly to be smart. We look at somebody like LeBron James who may not have gone to college but continues to be a student and learns and he keeps giving people a higher viewpoint of where we go after a sport like basketball.

Courtesy of Okwa Andrews

SI: You’ve certainly been involved at a lot of All-Star weekends but what is your favorite on-court aspect?

AB: That’s very very easy. I would have to say slam dunk. I have been a part of going to the Slam Dunk Contest live since 2016. I remember Paul George when he just came in. I remember seeing last year with Aaron Gordon seeing Zach LaVine take off. I remember Victor Oladipo in New York. It has been a dream come true of mine since I was watching Vince Carter on my parent’s couch in 2000 and now to be a part of going to All-Star Saturday night. And now with it being at halftime this year I’m really looking forward to it.

SI: So who do you think will win it this year?

AB: I gotta go with [Knicks rookie Obi Toppin.] He has the youthfulness to do some creative things and he dunks with power.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlcG9ydGVyLXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDMvMDcvcHJlc2VydmluZy1sb2NhbC1oaXN0b3J5LzQ0MDI5ODA5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Preserving local history,"Cody Thompson

MARTINSVILLE — From the Martinsville Sanitariums to coach John Wooden Morgan County certainly has its fair share of history.

The Morgan County History Center and Museum set to open in early June is hoping to be a purveyor of just some of the historic artifacts one could find in this small slice of South Central Indiana.

The museum is located in the Blackstone House or what is also known as the Disciple House and — as of now — contains numerous half-full display cases as the interiors are still being completed.

Patty Dow the accessioning manager for the museum who is also on the board of directors for the Morgan County History Partnership said they were surprised something like this didn’t already exist.

“Actually it started three years ago with the partnership wanting to have a museum and live events of our history in this county” she said. “So it started from there but we didn’t actually get to rent this building until October of last year.”

Aside from a few grants Dow said they really will rely on donations from the community to make this work and to sustain it.

Just inside the door to the museum is a “founder’s tree” which will acknowledge donors to the museum with their name or their business name engraved on a tree colored depending on how much they donated and made by Shields Designs.

A $500 donation yields a Yellow Poplar a $1000 donation yields a Silver Maple and a $2500 donation yields a Golden Oak. For those businesses or individuals wishing to go even further a $10000 or more donation will allow the donor to have a room in the museum named after them or someone they choose.

The museum will also be having a golf outing as part of their fundraising efforts which will be on Saturday June 19 at Martinsville Country Club. Lunch will be at noon with and tee time at 2 p.m. There will be an opportunity to win a car with a hole-in-one along with other possible prizes.

Dow wanted to clarify that this is a county museum not just a Martinsville one. They still would like to see more items from the outlying communities outside the county seat.

“We are very interested in getting more items from Morgantown Mooresville Eminence Monrovia...all of the small towns that ever existed” she said. “We’re having a little bit of difficulty doing that because we’re right here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy9leC1ibGFja3N0b25lLW1kLXdoby1tYWRlLTE0MDAtb24tbXRhci1pcG8tc2F5cy1uby1wbGFuLXRvLXNlbGwtcmVtYWluaW5nLXNoYXJlcy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MTM2MzYxOC5jbXPSAZ0BaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvc3RvY2tzL25ld3MvZXgtYmxhY2tzdG9uZS1tZC13aG8tbWFkZS0xNDAwLW9uLW10YXItaXBvLXNheXMtbm8tcGxhbi10by1zZWxsLXJlbWFpbmluZy1zaGFyZXMvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgxMzYzNjE4LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ex-Blackstone MD who made 1400% on MTAR IPO says no plan to sell remaining shares,"You Might Also Like: MTAR IPO subscribed 201x on last day

These shares were sold in the price band of Rs 574-575 suggesting 15 times gains or 1396 per cent return.Mathew Cyraic has been playing an active part of the MTAR board with involvement in the audit committee nomination and remuneration committee as well as the management committee which took decisions with respect to operations and day to day management.In an telephonic interview with ETMarkets.com Cyriac said he never thought he would realise 15-times returns within such a short time but said he had faith in the 50-year-old family run company although it was loss making when he acquired it.""MTAR is very unique in what it offers. The 50 year old company has built certain differentiated technical capabilities which is not available with many companies in India or globally. It was an undermanaged business and I knew that could be fixed. MTAR is a family owned business but has swiftly professionalised the management in the last few years"" Cyriac said.""We made a lot of changes to streamline operations improve productivity and reduce cost. We also focused on driving the export mix of the business. We also introduced performance management process through monthly MIS and continuous reviews"" Cyriac said adding that his emphasis was on the performance management.Fabmohur would receive over Rs 335 crore in the IPO at the upper end of the price band. Fabmohur and Solidus will collectively continue to own over 10 per cent of the company post the IPO with an ownership of 3076270 shares which are valued at over Rs 177 crore.Cyriac said he has no plans to dilute his stake in the company for a considerable period.Founder at Gujarat-based at UnlistedArena.com Abhay Doshi who also tracks grey market said the stock was commanding Rs 430 premium in the grey market which has now surged to Rs 530-odd level following the strong investor response to the issue.Cyriac said while every other IPO these days is getting a strong listing response one must note the quality of pre-ipo investors (SBI MF and Axis MF) and the anchor investors the company attracted last week 10 of top 10 domestic mutual fund houses.P Srinivas Reddy Managing Director at MTAR Technologies said that while his company always had great potential it took strategic steps to expand exports and professionalise management. ""Fabmohur‘s presence further helped us in implementing our planned initiatives"" Reddy told ETMarkets.com.Cyriac who now is the Executive Chairman of Florintree Advisors a Mumbai-based India-focused Alternative Asset Manager was a senior managing director at The Blackstone Group and served as its Co-Head of Private Equity at Blackstone Advisors India till February 2017.Cyriac's other investments include garment exporter Gokaldas Exports CMS IT Services insurance broker OneInsure subway sandwich chain Bread Basket and fintech startup City Cash according to a recent ToI report. The MTAR stake is the first investment in a company that he will be encashing albeit partially."

An airline spokeswoman said the plane from Miami landed safely and taxied to the gate under its own power. She said there were no injuries among the 95 passengers and six crew members.

The Boeing Max was grounded worldwide for nearly two years after two crashes that killed 346 people. Investigators have focused on a flight-control system not the engines.

Federal regulators approved changes Boeing made changes to the flight system and American resumed flying its Max jets in late December. Since then United and Alaska Airlines have put passengers on Max planes and Southwest Airlines plans to resume flights with the planes next week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHNjaS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9ib2VpbmctbG95YWwtd2luZ21hbi1kcm9uZS1maXJzdC1mbGlnaHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch this Boeing fighter jet drone fly for the first time,"On February 27 a fascinating little aircraft lifted off the deck in Australia for its inaugural flight. Unlike most planes this one had no human on board.

The test pilot in charge of the flight remained safely on the ground at a facility in South Australia called the RAAF Woomera Range Complex.

The 38-foot-long aircraft called the Loyal Wingman took off “under its own power before flying a pre-determined route at different speeds and altitudes to verify flight functionality” Boeing said in a statement earlier this week.

As its name suggests the autonomous craft’s intended duty will make it a robotic ally in the sky for air forces. It could fly alongside a fighter jet or other aircraft that have actual humans on board to protect them or amplify what they can do or it could zoom ahead into riskier territory. Artificial intelligence will help it carry out those complex operations.

“The Loyal Wingman project is a pathfinder for the integration of autonomous systems and artificial intelligence to create smart human-machine teams” Air Vice-Marshal Cath Roberts of the Royal Australian Air Force said in the statement.

[Related: DARPA’s new combat drones could catch a ride from other aircraft]

The aircraft is 38 feet long and has a modular nose. Boeing

We first got a look at the full-sized version of this drone in May of last year; one of its most compelling features is the 9-foot modular nose. With 52 cubic feet of space within it the nose could carry various sensor packages for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions. A ground crew will be able to theoretically swap the nose out to rapidly change what equipment the little bird is carrying in between flights.

Boeing also said last week that they now have six of these craft contracted to be built in total.

The Chicago-based aerospace company isn’t the only group creating uncrewed companion aircraft like this. Last year the Air Force announced that it was contracting with multiple companies to create aircraft that could work together with manned airplanes. Called Skyborg the program aims to “to integrate autonomous attritable UAV technology with open missions systems to enable manned-unmanned teaming.” By “attritable” the Air Force means that it’s an aircraft designed to be lost in battle if necessary as opposed to an expensive fighter jet like an F-35 with a pilot on board.

Besides Boeing the other two companies working on the Skyborg program are Kratos Unmanned Aerial Systems and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems.

That’s not the only way that the Air Force has been experimenting with pairing people with more advanced tech: Artificial intelligence collaborated with a human aviator on board a U-2 spy plane flight in December.

And in the same general vein DARPA has been pushing the envelope in this field by both exploring how algorithms can perform in a dogfight and also announcing a program designed to create drones that would drop out of another aircraft and then be capable of firing air-to-air missiles at an enemy.

Boeing Australia and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) successfully completed the first test flight of the Loyal Wingman uncrewed aircraft on Feb. 27.

The flight of the first military aircraft to be designed and manufactured in Australia in more than 50 years flew under the supervision of a Boeing test pilot monitoring the aircraft from a ground control station at the Woomera Range Complex in the South Australian outback.

“The Loyal Wingman’s first flight is a major step in this long-term significant project for the Air Force and Boeing Australia and we’re thrilled to be a part of the successful test” said Air Vice-Marshal Cath Roberts RAAF head of Air Force Capability. “The Loyal Wingman project is a pathfinder for the integration of autonomous systems and artificial intelligence to create smart human-machine teams. “Through this project we are learning how to integrate these new capabilities to complement and extend air combat and other missions” she said.

Following a series of taxi tests validating ground handling navigation and control and pilot interface the aircraft completed a successful takeoff under its own power before flying a predetermined route at different speeds and altitudes to verify flight functionality and demonstrate the performance of the Airpower Teaming System design.



“Boeing and Australia are pioneering fully integrated combat operations by crewed and uncrewed aircraft” said Boeing Defense Space & Security President and CEO Leanne Caret. “We’re honored to be opening this part of aviation’s future with the Royal Australian Air Force and we look forward to showing others how they also could benefit from our loyal wingman capabilities.”

With support from more than 35 Australian industry teams and leveraging Boeing’s innovative processes including model-based engineering techniques such as a digital twin to digitally flight-test missions the team was able to manufacture the aircraft from design to flight in three years.

This first Loyal Wingman aircraft is serving as the foundation for the Boeing Airpower Teaming System being developed for various global defense customers. The aircraft will fly alongside other platforms using artificial intelligence to team with existing crewed and uncrewed assets to complement mission capabilities.

Additional Loyal Wingman aircraft are under development with plans for teaming flights scheduled for later this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ib2VpbmctNzU3LTEwMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Boeing 757-100: The 150 'Short' 757 That Never Was,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ib2VpbmctNzU3LTEwMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Its patented dual-sided cooling allows for significantly smaller and lighter designs - while reducing the amount of Silicon Carbide needed for each switch thereby cutting costs.

Viper is engineered to deliver up to a 70% reduction in power losses along with greater power density depending upon the drive cycle. Manufacturers can leverage these improved efficiencies when designing their propulsion systems to either boost vehicle range improve overall performance or reduce sticker shock through less costly batteries.



This flexibility allows manufacturers the means to present consumers with a range of performance options - including the ability to trade-off battery size cost and vehicle range - available at multiple price points which is similar to the way powertrains are marketed today.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvcmd3YXJuZXIuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ2llcy9oaWdobGlnaHQvYWxsLWluLW9uZS1ib3gtc29sdXRpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,All-in-one box solution,"By reassembling multiple power electronics functions into an ‘All-in-One box’ BorgWarner can help you save space and costs across your range of electrified vehicles.

Today’s power electronic components can be incredibly complex. Take an inverter for example one of the most critical components needed for propulsion electrification because the inverter converts direct current (DC) from the battery pack into an alternating current (AC) so that electricity can be used to power and control the vehicle. Inverters can have multiple electrical circuit boards each with hundreds of electrical components. All of this means that some inverters can be bulky expensive and prone to failure.



Thanks in large part to the Viper power switch with it’s double-side cooled silicon carbide (SiC) technology and design flexibility we’ve mastered the art of combining products such as inverters and DC/DC converters into single units.

And our ability to design ‘automotive grade’ electronics able to withstand extremes in g-forces temperatures and debris gives us an edge in producing “All-in-one"" box solutions for wherever they are needed in the vehicle. For example our engineers have connected the inverter directly to the motor which eliminated the need for additional connections and resulted in a smaller package with fewer cables and wires.",,,,,,,,,

Boston Scientific and Chengdu New Radiomedicine Technology Co Ltd on Friday signed a cooperation agreement on equity investment technology transfer and localized production in Chengdu Sichuan province.

It is the first time the US based global medical technology leader has cooperated with a local Chinese company in technology transfer and localized production marking an important milestone for the company to accelerate its localization process and facilitate its strategic layout in western China.

According to the agreement Boston Scientific will transfer TheraSphere Y90 glass microsphere technology to the Chinese company known as CNRT for internal radiotherapy of liver cancer in order to accelerate the introduction and localized production of this medical product to benefit liver cancer patients in China.

Speaking at a signing ceremony June Chang president of Boston Scientific China said: ""In the future we hope to deepen cooperation with more local partners go hand in hand to jointly accelerate the integration of China with international medical innovation; make high-quality medical resources more accessible and timely and contribute to realizing the vision of a 'Healthy China' with a never-changing commitment to 'Advancing science for life'.""

Liver cancer is the fourth most common and the second most deadly malignant tumor seen in China.

In October 2019 Boston Scientific and the city of Chengdu signed an investment cooperation agreement for a ""second headquarters"" in China.

Since then Boston Scientific's western China strategy has made rapid progress. In September 2020 the so-called ""second headquarters"" was officially put into operation in Chengdu.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NkZXZpY2UuY29tL2R0dy1wb2RjYXN0LWNhbi1haS1hZHZhbmNlZC1pbWFnaW5nLWFuZC1yb2JvdGljcy1kZW1vY3JhdGl6ZS1zdXJnZXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DTW Podcast: Can AI advanced imaging and robotics 'democratize' surgery?,"A new generation of digital surgery systems will level surgeons’ playing field — giving them artificial intelligence robotic tools and other assistive technologies.

The result is ""up to 85% greater stone ablation through 120 Hz ultra-speed stone dusting 20% shorter procedure times"" predominately resulting in same-day release from the hospital the company said in its statement.“The MOSES 2.0 technology provides much faster and more efficient operations with minimally invasive surgery and no catheter required” said Director of Endourology and Lithotripsy at Hadassah Ein-Kerem Hospital and Secretary-General of the Israeli Urological Association Prof. Mordechai Duvdevani.“Because of this we can treat far more patients and much faster. In fact most are discharged from the hospital on the same day whereas before MOSES 2.0 a short stay would be required"" he added. ""At Hadassah Ein-Kerem there has been a massive load of COVID patients. During an unprecedented public health crisis such as this this laser technology has been crucial in keeping hospital beds available to those who critically need them.”In terms of prostate treatment the MOSES 2.0 transforms the clinically validated Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP) therapy into an outpatient procedure with same-day discharge catheter-free. The procedures normally result in outpatient release times as well.“I’ve used the MOSES 2.0 technology during stones and BPH procedures for several years because it is so efficient” said Dr. Amy E. Krambeck a professor of urology at Northwestern Medical in Chicago Illinois. “MOSES 2.0 for BPH enucleates tissue even faster and stops bleeding very quickly which is important for visibility and postoperative recovery. It allowed me to change my entire practice and patients have been very happy to go home the same day without a catheter. This transformation is even more important now that COVID-19 makes patients put off essential care while our hospitals move to free up inpatient beds for acute cases. MOSES 2.0 helps make that possible.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlY3VyaW5naW5kdXN0cnkuY29tL3BoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy91cy13b21hbi1nZXRzLXNpeC1tb250aHMtZm9yLXNlbGxpbmctZmFrZS1zdXJnaWNhbC1tZXNoL3M0MC9hMTMxMDYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US woman gets six months for selling fake surgical mesh,"A Florida women has been sentenced to six months in prison after pleading guilty to selling fake Ethicon surgical mesh to a US medical clinic.

On testing the mesh was discovered to be both counterfeit and non-sterile putting patients at risk of serious infections. The scam was discovered after surgeons complained about the mesh.

Janaina Nascimento (38) admitted that in January 2019 she purchased 70 boxes of Ethicon Surgicel Original Hemostat from a distributor in the United Arab Emirates and attempted to sell them to a US customer who refused the purchase because the boxes clearly indicated they were “not for re-export to the USA.”

Undeterred she removed individual packages of the product from their boxes with the warning label and sold 828 such packages to a company called XS Supply which then resold them to the University of Kentucky Medical Centre in April 2019.

In addition to the six-month prison term will be on supervised release for a period of one year after her release and has been ordered to pay $24012 in compensation to the medical facility.

Counterfeit surgical mesh products have been a recurrent issue in the US and other markets over the last few years. In 2010 the FDA issued a warning about fake flat polypropylene mesh which was also found to be non-sterile that was counterfeited to imitate mesh made by CR Bard under the Marlex brand.

The prognosis of TP53-mutated myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) can be heterogeneous. TP53-mutated MDS with low variant allele frequency (VAF) without complex karyotype (CK) and those with mono-allelic TP53 alterations have significantly improved outcomes123. TP53 mutations are diverse and distributed across the codons of the entire coding region4. Different types of TP53 mutations lead to distinct functional consequences (such as oncogenic gain-of-function protein loss-of-function with dominant-negative effect etc567) that likely influence disease biology and outcome either independently or by influencing known variables such as VAF and allelic state23. Until now the relationship between various TP53 mutations and genomic/phenotypic features including outcomes is not well-characterized. This knowledge is important to assess the efficacy of novel therapeutic strategies that restore TP53 function8.

Evolutionary Action score (EAp53) is a computationally-derived score to quantify the deleterious impact of different missense TP53 mutations based on (A) phylogenetic divergence of the mutated sequence position [evolutionary trace (ET)] and (B) perturbation due to amino acid (AA) substitution9. EAp53 score ranges between 0 and 100 a higher score indicates a worse impact and 0 indicates wild-type function. EAp53 score has been shown to be an objective reliable prognostic biomarker in patients with head and neck (H&N) and colorectal cancers10111213. Here we used the EAp53 scoring system to evaluate the impact of different types of missense TP53 mutations on clinico-pathologic and genomic features in MDS.

We identified 270 patients with newly-diagnosed MDS or oligoblastic AML (<30% blasts) with ≥1 missense TP53 mutation(s) at baseline detected by next-generation sequencing (Fig. 1A). The median TP53 VAF was 33.9 (1–94.4); 165 (61%) had multi-allelic TP53 alterations. Majority were treated with hypomethylating agents (HMA). Informed consent was obtained the study was performed per institutional-approved protocols in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. See Supplementary Materials for detailed methodology. Fig. 1: Correlations between EAp53 score and TP53 mutational characteristics clinicopathologic features and outcome. A Lollipop plot showing the frequency distribution of missense TP53 mutations and associated concurrent non-missense mutations. B Spectrum of EAp53 scores of the TP53 mutations noted within our MDS cohort: the majority had a high (>52) EAp53 score. C Using RPART an EAp53 score of 52 provided an optimal cut-off based on overall survival in MDS patients. D The multivariate model identified EAp53 score R-IPSS risk score and serum bilirubin to be an independent predictor for worse overall survival. E Mutational frequencies of genes in the cohort separated by EAp53 risk category. Low-risk EAp53 MDS patients had a significantly higher frequency of mutations in NRAS and RUNX1 and a trend for higher frequencies in NPM1 WT1 and ASXL1 mutations. Full size image

Baseline characteristics are in Table S1. The median EAp53 score was 79 (4.2–97.9) (Fig. 1B). A higher EAp53 score correlated with worse OS (p = 0.087; HR 1.06 per 10-point increase [95%CI:1.01–1.13]). Using Recursive-Partitioning-And-Regression-Trees EAp53 score >52 predicted for worse OS (Fig. 1C) generating 2 risk-groups: low-EAp53 [EAp53 ≤ 52; n = 17 (6%)] and high-EAp53 [>52; n = 253 94%]. The median OS for low-EA-MDS vs. high-EA-MDS was 47.8 vs. 10 months (p = 0.01; HR: 2.6 [1.22–5.56]). EAp53 score of 75 previously described in TP53-mutated H&N squamous cell carcinoma did not show a survival difference in MDS. By univariate analysis high-EAp53 (>52) TP53 VAF number of TP53 mutations IPSS-R score CK/monosomal karyotype (MK) higher serum LDH and creatinine lower platelet hemoglobin and serum albumin associated with worse OS. Neither TP53 allele state nor del(17p) associated with OS. By multivariable analysis the EAp53 risk retained the independent predictive value for OS along with IPSS-R score and serum albumin but not TP53 VAF or the number of TP53 mutations (CK excluded due to a strong association with EAp53 score; Fig. 1D; Table S2). EAp53 risk was the only independent predictor of AML transformation. EAp53 risk did not affect transformation-free survival relapse-free survival overall response and complete remission rates (Table S3).

Next we explored the clinico-pathologic and cytogenomic differences between low-EA-MDS and high-EA-MDS (Table S4). Higher EAp53 score (as a continuous variable) positively correlated with multiple TP53 mutations (p = 0.00062) higher platelet (p = 0.041) and serum fibrinogen (p = 0.009) and negatively correlated with concurrent RUNX1 (p = 0.038) and EZH2 (p < 0.001) mutations. When stratified low-EA-MDS had fewer cytogenetic abnormalities (median 3 vs. 7 p = 0.019) lower frequency of CK (p = 0.0241) and MK (p = 0.0043). High-EAp53-MDS had a higher frequency of multiple TP53 mutations (32% vs. 6% p = 0.027) and multi-allelic TP53 alterations (63% vs. 29% p = 0.0087) suggesting that the type of mutation dictates the degree of karyotypic complexity. Patients with gain-of-function TP53 mutations (R175 R248 R273 all noted only in high-EA-MDS) showed no significant outcome difference compared to rest (Fig. S1). Across all genes the median mutation number (including TP53) in low-EAp53 and high-EAp53 was 3 and 1 (p = 0.000002). A higher proportion of low-EAp53 patients had additional gene mutations (63% vs. 33%; p = 0.05) involving NRAS and RUNX1 (p = 0.02) and a trend for higher frequencies of NPM1 WT1 and ASXL1 mutations (Fig. 1E; Fig. S2). There were no significant differences in the median TP53 VAF distribution of IPSS-R therapy-related or treatment characteristics.

The observed distinctive clinical cytogenetic and mutation characteristics provide support to the clinical validity of EAp53 scoring and confirm that low and high-EAp53 do not reflect different positions on the early to late disease trajectory. The presence of at least 1 additional gene mutation frequently NRAS in low-EA-MDS corroborates the leukemogenic role of RAS. These additional hits potentially modify the phenotype and outcome of low-EA-MDS. The need for additional hits in high-EA-MDS is abrogated by chromosomal aneuploidies involving chromosomes 17 and 5 that harbor negative regulators of the RAS pathway14.

We then assessed the downstream effect of the EAp53 score using immunohistochemical TP53 protein expression (low-EAp53: n = 10; median EAp53: 27.9; high-EAp53: n = 20; 84.8). The median H-scores (multiplied score of percent positivity and intensity) for wild-type (6.4) low-EAp53 (47.5) and high-EAp53 (157.5) were significantly different (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2A–D). These results are in accord with the mRNA studies in squamous cell carcinoma cells where low-EAp53 cells partly retained residual TP53 function1011. H-score correlated with TP53 VAF (p = 0.00015; rho(ρ) = 0.61).

Since protein function is further modulated by the 3D location of the residue we performed protein structural analysis using the crystal structure of the TP53-core-domain in complex with DNA (PDB ID: 4HJE; PyMOL molecular visualization). We hypothesized that this may explain the variable survival rates noted in some high-EA-MDS patients with similar EAp53 scores. All the TP53 mutations of this cohort mapped to the evolutionarily important sites of the TP53-core-domain. When segregated based on survival of 10 months TP53 variants with poor-survival (OS < 10 months) formed two clusters: a large cluster interfacing the DNA-binding site and a small cluster formed by residues V157 Y220 L257 and E258 showing that structure location further stratifies the outcome (Fig. 2E F). Analysis with different survival cut-offs yielded the same results.

Following this using serial NGS we compared the mutational dynamics of low vs. high-EA TP53 mutations during disease evolution and therapy. Among 9 low-EAp53 2 of 3 (67%) who achieved at least partial response showed mutation clearance. The remaining showed persistence of the same TP53 mutation with additional mutations in NRAS (Fig. 2G) KRAS RUNX1 IDH1 and JAK2. None acquired new TP53 mutations. Among 36 high-EAp53 MDS 5 of 11 (45%) who achieved at least morphologic CR showed mutation clearance. Rest had persistence of the original TP53 mutation(s) (Fig. 2H); 1 acquired 3 additional TP53 mutations (also high-EA). Only 2 patients (8%) acquired new mutations in NRAS IDH1 and TET2.

Finally we verified the biological relevance of EAp53 scoring using other independent computational methods. CADD and REVEL segregated the same prognostic subgroups (but not DANN Polyphen 2 MutPred PROVEAN SIFT; Fig. S3). To validate the EAp53 cut-off of 52 we used an independent single-center cohort of 62 MDS patients selected using the same criteria and treated using HMAs. There were 3 (5%) low-EA-MDS patients [p.Y220H p.F134L p.R209W] with a longer median OS (112 vs. 32 months p = 0.25) compared to high-EA-MDS (Fig. S4). CADD and REVEL could not separate these patients suggesting that the EAp53 method was superior. When study and validation cohorts were merged all 3 methods were concordant [EAp53 p = 0.0103; REVEL p = 0.03; CADD p = 0.006; Fig. S5].

The study has a few limitations. Although this is a large retrospective study the inherent low frequency of low-EAp53 MDS (~6%) warrants validation in multi-center cohorts. While the possibility that some of the low-EAp53 variants represent rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) cannot be completely excluded to the best of our knowledge all low-EAp53 variants were clinically reported by the laboratory after extensive curation using literature online databases including COSMIC dbSNP 1000 genome EXAC ClinVar and in-silico prediction tools. Repeat NGS on 9 (53%) patients showed clearance or significant variations in the TP53 VAFs strongly suggesting somatic origin. TP53 VAF was not independently prognostic in this study. Unlike other reports12 we note that this cohort is unique because it excluded patients with nonsense/frameshift TP53 mutations that are likely to have higher VAF and multi-allelic TP53 alterations due to a loss-of-function phenotype. Further VAFs were not normalized based on copy number. The study did not assess copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity that could explain the lack of association with TP53 allele status.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr. Sternlicht in a scathing email to The New York Times which he copied to Brown’s president Christina H.

“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts” he wrote. “It’s not education it’s propaganda.”

Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on “facts and moral clarity” as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage.

Blame the bird,"New York CNN —

It’s a moment many shoppers grapple with at some point during a grocery run: Why does a carton of brown eggs cost more than a carton of white eggs?

It’s not what you might think. It’s not about one type being healthier or more natural or fancier than the other but really about the nitty-gritty of farm economics. It costs more to keep the brown egg-laying hen happy and well fed.

“Basically there is no difference between a brown egg and a white egg nutritionally. It has to do with the breed of the chicken” explained Daniel Brey owner of Brey’s Egg Farm a fourth-generation family egg farm in Jeffersonville New York. The farm produces more than 200000 white eggs a day.

Some breeds such as White Leghorn chickens lay eggs with white shells while other breeds such as Rhode Island Reds lay eggs with brown shells. According to Brey the cost and taste of the egg you buy – white or brown - is determined by what – and how much – is fed to the hen.

“It has a lot to do with the chicken feed” Brey said. “It costs more to make a dozen brown eggs because the chickens that produce them tend to eat more.”

Egg farmers say brown and white eggs are closely matched in their nutritional value. Edmund McNamara

Edmund McNamara and his wife Rose run Sova Farms in Norwich NY about 200 miles north of New York City’s Central Park. Sova Farms he said is organic certified by the United States Department of Agriculture for its brown eggs and its chicken pork and lamb.

The farm currently produces about 350 brown eggs daily but expects to bump that up to over 1000 brown eggs a day after receiving a delivery of more than 700 pullets (or young hens) on this month.

“All our eggs are brown but every once in a great while a chicken will lay a very light brown” he said adding that the eggs are sold directly to consumers in New York’s Westchester County.

Harder to find

In stores brown eggs tend to carry a premium – even if it’s just because of their color anomaly.

“Eggs come in many colors not just white and brown. Depending upon the breed some are even blue and green” said Joan Frank assistant program director dietetics with the University of California David Department of Nutrition. Still there is no difference in nutritional value of eggs based on the color of the shell she said.

“I think consumers for some reason have come to believe that brown eggs are healthier which they are not” Frank said.

Sova Farms is currently selling a dozen large brown eggs for $8. Store prices for organic pastured brown eggs can be as high as $10 for a dozen while the price of conventional brown eggs is between $4.50 to $6 in most stores.

A dozen white eggs is about $2.50 in stores according to the latest weekly government data up from $1.50 a dozen from a year ago.

Yet McNamara too said “there is really no nutritional difference between white and brown eggs.”

Phil Lempert a grocery industry analyst and editor of SuperMarketGuru.com estimated how much more shoppers typically pay for brown eggs versus their white counterpart. “If there’s brown eggs next to white eggs typically you’re going to pay anywhere between 10% to 20% more for brown eggs regardless of free range or organic” he said.

The egg-onomics of it all

David Anderson professor of agricultural economics (with a specialty in livestock economics) at Texas A&M University has studied egg pricing and factors that affect it on farms and in the supermarket.

Egg prices regardless of the color of the shell generally respond to swings in demand he said. “You have short-term seasonal events such as Easter. We always see holiday demand for eggs. In the fall we also see demand increase for eggs for holiday-related activities such as baking” Anderson said.

Thrown into the mix are other influences on egg prices such as the cost of chicken feed. “Feed costs have been falling This is helping egg producers. We had a record large crop last year in the US and we have much lower corn and soybean meal prices right now he said.

Brown eggs generally cost more in stores than white eggs. It has to do with the cost of the upkeep of the chicken breed that produces brown eggs. Edmund McNamara

On the flip side the latest outbreak of Bird Flu could keep egg prices elevated versus last year. If egg producers aren’t able to meet demand because they’ve had to cull their chicken population due to bird flu then that can raise prices.

Looking specifically at the economics of producing brown eggs versus conventional white eggs Anderson confirmed it does indeed cost more to produce the brown variety. “If it costs more to produce they’ll probably be priced higher to the consumer.”

But as to the “perception” that brown eggs are healthier than white eggs?

“It’s almost like what comes first the chicken or the egg?” Anderson said. “Did the companies advertise that first or did it come from consumers who think that brown eggs just must be healthier?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vc3BvcnQvYXJ0aWNsZXMvYzZweWtwcDFwMmpv0gEzaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9zcG9ydC9hcnRpY2xlcy9jNnB5a3BwMXAyam8uYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Land Norris: McLaren driver is 'everyone's favourite' says team chief Zak Brown.,"McLaren boss Zak Brown called Lando Norris “everyone’s favourite driver” after the Briton won his first grand prix in Miami on Sunday.

It took six seasons and a 110 starts before Norris 24 finally topped the podium at a grand prix with second his previous best finish.

""I think that was a massive win for Lando and a lot of support behind it chief executive director Brown told BBC 5 Live.

""I never met anyone who doesn't like Lando.""

The turning point in Sunday's grand prix came when Norris took advantage of the race restarting with 27 laps to go beating Red Bull’s world champion Max Verstappen into second.

Brown said that Norris is ""everyone's favourite driver or number two or number three but I've never heard even number four and I've certainly never heard anyone not like [him]”.

Norris' win could signal the beginning of an end to Red Bull's dominance with chief technical officer Adrian Newey leaving the team and some uncertainty around Verstappen's future.

Brown disagrees however: “No I think that would be a bit premature thinking their time has gone but clearly with everything that has been going on this year and now Adrian Newey leaving it’s clear that team has some issues beyond the race car"" he said.

Brown did not rule out McLaren making a move for Newey when asked about the matter before the grand prix.

""They will miss Adrian Newey and I believe there is some truth to the Max Verstappen rumours so stay on top of your game or you can quickly slide back"" he added.

The next race in the F1 calendar is in Imola Italy and will take place from 17-19 May.

It features the artwork of Louisville resident Richard Sullivan a former professional baseball player. Sullivan’s stunning watercolor is of thoroughbreds as they thunder down the stretch. It was designed as a complement to last year’s Derby bottle artwork which Sullivan also created.

“There is a depth of beauty in Richard’s watercolors — and his back-to-back Derby bottles are a winning exacta” said Woodford Reserve Master Distiller Chris Morris.

The one-liter bottles of Woodford Reserve Bourbon are on sale across the United States and the globe with a retail price of $49.99. It is available for pre-sale starting March 2 on Reserve Bar.

“The Kentucky Derby is resplendent with color pageantry and pure athleticism — and I wanted to capture that in my artwork” Sullivan said.

Sullivan played baseball at Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) and in 2008 he was drafted by the Braves in the 11th round as a junior and played six years of minor league baseball. He returned to SCAD in 2014 to finish his degree and focus exclusively on his artwork.

His work is featured across the United States including at The Atlanta Braves Truist Park Mercedes Benz Stadium and the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

Sullivan said he enjoys the parallels between sports and creativity connecting two seemingly divided worlds that in reality require the same sense of dedication practice and expertise.

The Derby bottle has been an annual collector’s item anticipated by bourbon and racing fans since 1999.

The sports wagering business isn’t just about bookmakers and bettors handicapping games these days.

It’s about casino operators strategic alliances broadcast and podcast partners sports teams sports leagues stadiums technology and being the official “fill-in-the-blank” of a gaming company.

Every state is different.

There are different rules and regulations a wide array of tax rates and a variety of venue in commercial casinos tribal casinos lotteries card rooms and horse and dog tracks.

It’s a requirement to have a retail outlet in some states or being allowed to be exclusively online in others. It’s signing up for a mobile app in person as they require in Nevada or submitting a form online as they do in New Jersey.

And it’s constantly evolving. If you haven’t been paying attention to the sports-betting industry lately things have been changing as rapidly as a football game’s outcome after a successful Hail Mary.

Effects on Nevada

Just last week alone two unrelated events occurred that could eventually have an effect on sports wagering in Nevada.

Arizona’s House of Representatives passed a sports betting legalization bill in a bipartisan vote advancing it to the state Senate.

In Nevada the state’s Gaming Control Board unanimously recommended allowing Caesars Entertainment Inc. to acquire William Hill U.S. the state’s largest bookmaking operation with more than 120 outlets in a move that could help transform Caesars into a sports-betting powerhouse nationwide. The Nevada Gaming Commission will make a final decision on that on March 18.

Even Chris Grove managing director of sports and emerging verticals for Eilers & Krejcik Gaming a research company admits that it’s getting harder and harder to keep up with all the moves companies are making in the industry as it closes in on the three-year anniversary of the dawn of legalized sports betting in the United States in May.

Eilers & Krejcik tracks the industry and reported last month that 26 states now offer legal sports betting and that includes five in which betting has been authorized but is not yet operational.

The company estimates that 45 percent of the adult U.S. population lives in a state where sports betting is legal. And 31 bills on sports betting are pending nationwide.

Market growth

Sports betting revenue in the United States grew from $920 million in 2019 to $1.57 billion in 2020 and is projected to grow to $5.8 billion by 2023.

Much of that growth has been fueled by potential stakeholders seeking a piece of the action. And that growth Grove said may become harder to sustain as lawmakers debate the merits of sports betting in their respective states.

“Everyone that is in sports or entertainment at this point is taking at least a cursory glance at the sports betting opportunity” Grove said of the industry’s growth now compared with what it was immediately after the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act. That move essentially started the sports-betting boom in the United States in 2018.

“It’s different not just in the sense of it broadens the field of who has an economic stake in this industry” he said. “It’s also different in terms of who shows up to lobby for these bills. When you talk about sports betting getting done in Illinois the (Chicago) Cubs showed up to support that bill. When else can you think of a time when a professional baseball team is lobbying in favor of gambling expansion? Pretty rare.”

Grove said in Pennsylvania Comcast Corp. a worldwide media and technology company based in Philadelphia advocated on behalf of sports wagering. In Texas Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban spearheaded the discussion.

“That’s a brave new world when it comes to the legislative dynamics of gambling expansion” Grove said. “It’s also one of the reasons why it’s moving more quickly than gambling expansion typically does. That’s where you’re really going to see a seismic collision of sports and gambling stakeholders.”

Arizona legislation

Arizona could become the second state bordering Nevada to adopt sports wagering — Oregon was the first — if lawmakers approve it. The House bill would allow up to 10 mobile and retail gaming licenses for tribes and 10 more for professional sports teams. It also would permit betting at the stadiums of professional sports teams the TPC Scottsdale golf course where the PGA’s Phoenix Open is played and the Phoenix Raceway track.

Grove believes the diverse list of stakeholders may make it harder to craft a plan that works for all parties.

“And Rule Numero Uno of legislative handicapping is that it’s easier to kill a bill than pass a bill” he said.

The close proximity of a major metropolitan area such as Phoenix with a robust sports wagering system may worry some Nevada gaming companies but Jay Kornegay vice president of the Westgate Sportsbook expects Las Vegas to hold a big amenity edge over Arizona’s tribal casinos.

“I am a true believer that this is not going to hurt Las Vegas in the long run” Kornegay said. “I believe more and more people are going to be introduced educated and eventually will want to come to see the mecca of sports betting in Las Vegas for a number of reasons.”

Kornegay believes there are now other reasons people will flock to Las Vegas.

“People in New York don’t just fly to Las Vegas to make a sports bet” he said. “They might center their trips around a sporting event but they do other things while they’re here.”

That’s why he believes the rapid expansion of sports betting elsewhere ultimately won’t hurt Nevada.

The diverse list of potential stakeholders also may hold back California Grove said.

“The interesting thing about these big states is they’re such a big prize that stakeholders are really willing to dig their heels in to try to get the version of sports betting that they want to get done” he said.

The top two sports-betting companies operating in the United States aren’t licensed in Nevada. FanDuel which operates in Colorado Indiana Illinois Iowa New Jersey Pennsylvania Tennessee and West Virginia and DraftKings which is in all of those states plus New Hampshire are the two biggest sports-betting revenue producers in the country according to Eilers & Krejcik.

Daily fantasy sports

It’s no coincidence that those companies got their starts in daily fantasy sports games and then migrated to traditional sports wagering when PASPA was overturned. Daily fantasy sports were embraced by the NFL — but FanDuel DraftKings and the NFL didn’t consider fantasy sports to be a form of gambling. The Nevada Gaming Commission thought otherwise and said the companies had to be licensed if they were going to conduct business in the state. Neither has been licensed.

While DraftKings holds the No. 2 position in sports wagering revenue nationwide its executives continue to crank out new ideas for the industry. In a recent earnings conference call Jason Robins co-founder chairman and CEO of DraftKings discussed his company’s new relationship with InComm Payments to launch an industry-first retail gift card. The launch would expand DraftKings’ presence in convenience stores and would enable consumers to gift the DraftKings experience to others in $25 and $50 denominations.

“It gives our customers another way to fund their accounts and engage with our products while at the same time expanding across retail locations nationwide” Robins said.

Both Grove and Kornegay believe it’s only a matter of time before FanDuel and DraftKings enter the Nevada market.

“I think you will see those companies get licensed in Nevada eventually” Grove said. “I think that we are a small market in some ways but we’re a deeply symbolic market. We’re still the epicenter for gambling in the U.S. and I think participating in the Nevada market matters for that reason.”

“They already had established databases in many jurisdictions so they certainly got a jump-start and they were able to communicate to their customers from their daily fantasy leagues and sites” Kornegay added.

After starting the week on a positive note benchmark indexes S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average withdrew and slipped to a one-month low before ending the last session. They were down 1.34% and 1.11% respectively early Friday. Earlier sentiment had improved after jobless claims came in below economists’ forecast.

After a relatively quiet period consolidations seem to be making a comeback. Continuing its acquisition spree Accenture clinched at least four deals this week with the buyout of UK-based talent consultancy Cirrus Logic topping the list.

The professional services firm also agreed to buy Brazil-based robotics solutions provider Pollux and Australian logistics consultancy GRA. The other business that joined the Accenture fold is technology solutions provider REPL Group.

Agilent Technologies agreed to acquire Resolution Bioscience for $695 million while Taco Bell owner Yum! Brands bought artificial intelligence provider Kvantum. The other key deals include Digital Turbine’s purchase of Israel-based mobile advertising company Triapodi Ltd and the $1.45-billion acquisition of UK-based Capco by Indian software giant Wipro.

Once again retailers dominated the earnings scene with department store operators Kohl’s and Target Corp. publishing their latest statistics on Tuesday followed by discount chain Dollar Tree on Wednesday. The next day Kroger Company and warehouse giant Costco Corp. delivered mixed results for their most recent quarters amid tough-year-over comparison.

Chipmaker Broadcom’s first-quarter report was the other major announcement of the week. As Wall Street approaches the fag end of the earnings season Oracle’s third-quarter financial report is probably the most-awaited announcement next week — scheduled for March 10.

Prior to that H&R Block and Dick’s Sporting Goods are expected to report on March 9. As the week progresses Ulta Beauty will be unveiling fourth-quarter numbers on March 11.

FINAL: Team Durant 150 | Team LeBron 170

SCORING LEADERS

Team Durant: Bradley Beal (26) Kyrie Irving (24) Jayson Tatum (21) James Harden (21)

Team LeBron: Giannis Antetokounmpo (35) Damian Lillard (32) Stephen Curry (28)

SUMMARY

Despite a team-high 26 points from Bradley Beal Team Durant was defeated 170-150 by Team LeBron in the 2021 NBA All-Star Game on Sunday night in Atlanta. Beal’s 26 points were an All-Star Game career high and finished one point shy of tying Moses Malone’s franchise record for points scored in an All-Star Game. He finished 10-16 (.625) from the field 6-12 (.500) from 3-point range and recorded four assists.

“It was amazing” Beal said postgame. “It was amazing just to be out on the floor with 20-plus other guys in the league who are phenomenal at what they do. For me to start that felt great. I was happy about it. I enjoyed every single moment being out there on the floor. I’m happy we were able to compete and have fun with it.”

Giannis Antetokounmpo scored a game-high 35 points on 16-16 (1.000) from the field and won the NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant MVP Award.

Beal got on the board early scoring on a layup three minutes into the game. He scored four points in the first quarter but Beal and the rest of Team Durant were outdone 40-39 by Team LeBron in the first quarter. Antetokounmpo and Stephen Curry combined for 23 points in the opening frame to lead the way for Team LeBron.

Beal turned it on in the second quarter scoring a team-high 10 points on 4-5 (.800) from the field and 2-3 (.667) from 3-point range. His first points of the frame came on a fast break dunk from fellow St. Louis native and longtime friend Jayson Tatum. Just a few possessions later Beal knocked down two 3-pointers only 60 seconds apart part of a 20-8 Team Durant run to take a 61-55 lead with 7:10 left in the second quarter. Team LeBron however closed the quarter strong led again by Curry and Antetokounmpo who combined to shoot 10-10 (1.000) from the field for 23 points. Team LeBron won the second quarter 60-41 and led 100-80 overall at halftime.

Beal stayed hot in the third quarter knocking down a trio of 3-pointers scoring nine points and dishing out two assists but Team Durant again fell to Team LeBron in the quarter score this time 46-45.

Under the NBA All-Star Game format implemented last season the score reset at the end of each of the first three quarters. Teams competed to win each quarter for donation money for a series of charitable beneficiaries: the Thurgood Marshall College Fund UNCF (United Negro College Fund) the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education and Direct Relief (Fund for Health Equity).

“I think that speaks volumes to where we are as a league” Beal said. “It speaks volumes that we’re still trying to empower change in this world and level the playing field in all aspects. Definitely hats off to the league for everything they’re doing and every charity that we’re out there competing for.”

At the end of the of the third quarter each team’s cumulative score determined the Final Target Score (170) which adds 24 points to the leading team’s (Team LeBron) score (146). With Team LeBron leading 146-125 overall the first team to reach 170 points would win the game.

Beal and Team Durant ripped off a 9-0 run early in the fourth quarter but were unable to mount a full comeback. Damian Lillard scored 11 of Team LeBron’s 24 points in the fourth quarter including the 3-pointer to hit 170 points and seal the win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL3RyYXZlbC10aXBzL3BvaW50cy1taWxlcy9taXN0YWtlcy10by1hdm9pZC1yZWRlZW1pbmctYWlybGluZS1taWxlcy1mb3ItZmxpZ2h0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,12 Mistakes to Avoid When Redeeming Airline Miles According to an Expert,"No matter how frequent a flier you are chances are you've had your wings clipped by the COVID-19 pandemic. But just because you're not earning or redeeming airline miles for flights right now doesn't mean you won't be back in the skies in the future. In the meantime you can continue racking up rewards by using an airline credit card for everyday purchases shopping through various airlines' online portals and other activities. When you're ready to board again here are 12 common mistakes to avoid when redeeming airline miles for flights.

1. Not Redeeming Miles Before They Expire

Due to the coronavirus pandemic most airlines suspended mileage expiration for 2020 and 2021. They could reinstitute it next year though so it's important to check the expiration dates on your various mileage accounts now. Delta JetBlue Southwest and United miles do not expire at all. Air Canada Aeroplan American Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines miles disappear after 18 months without qualifying activity while Alaska Airlines miles go poof after 24 months of non-activity. Don't rush to hop on a flight though. Usually you can reset the expiry clock by earning or redeeming just a single mile. That includes making a purchase with an associated airline credit card shopping through airlines' online portals or just transferring a small bundle of miles to another member's account. There are lots of ways to keep your miles going for when you eventually want to redeem them.

2. Not Searching in the Right Place

One of the things that makes finding award tickets so difficult is that not all airline websites show the same amount of availability especially on partner flights. ""I always tell people to start by thinking about airline alliances"" says Spencer Howard founder of the travel website Straight to the Points. ""United is great for searching Star Alliance award space"" he says. ""Start a search there then run another one with Air Canada Aeroplan to confirm the availability. Delta.com can be used to find SkyTeam awards."" This includes flights on Air France KLM Korean Air and others.

To take another example Alaska Airlines is partners with Cathay Pacific. However the U.S. carrier's site does not allow you to search for or book Cathay award seats. Instead you might need to use the British Airways site — another Oneworld airline partner — for your search and then book your award over the phone with Alaska.

3. Not Jumping on Limited-time Deals

Most airlines used to have award charts with fixed pricing for flights. For example a domestic economy ticket would be 25000 miles round-trip while a business class seat from the U.S. to Europe would be 100000 miles. Now however many have shifted to a revenue-based system that more closely ties the number of miles required to paid airfares on specific routes. While that means some awards have skyrocketed in price others have dropped precipitously.

In fact there have been some incredible award deals lately including short Delta flights from just 2000 miles each way and United flights from 3000 miles one way. If you see a deal like that and it fits your travel dates and destinations don't hesitate to book as these bargains tend to disappear fast.

4. Waiting Too Long to Book

Even at normal prices airline awards can be tricky to pin down. ""Once you've found award space I don't recommend waiting too long to book"" recommends Howard. ""I've had too many clients and readers wait a few days only to find the award seats were gone."" If you find a ticket that fits your dates and destinations he says go ahead and hit that book button. Otherwise your plans could remain up in the air.

5. Not Being Flexible on Dates

Although award tickets are plentiful at the moment especially on shorter domestic flights booking long-haul tickets in premium cabins can be a crapshoot at the best of times. ""Flexibility is key. If you're locked into traveling on specific dates it can be tough to find award space in the most luxurious first-class cabins. Being open to different travel dates can make all the difference"" says Howard.

6. Redeeming Too Many Miles

When searching for award tickets on an airline's website you're bound to be confused by the sheer range of mileage prices for the same flight on different days and different classes of service. That's because airlines have become extraordinarily adept at adaptive pricing adjusting the mileage levels based on things like search demand airfare fluctuations and more. Before cashing in your miles think about this checklist. First if your airline still publishes award charts like American Airlines does use the ""saver"" level awards as your benchmark for how much you should be spending. If your airline no longer displays award charts like Delta and United do a few different searches on routes you're interested in flying plugging in dates over several months and check the range of mileage pricing. Aim for the lower end of the spectrum when you finally do end up booking something.

7. Using the Wrong Kind of Miles and Overpaying

Another way to overspend on award tickets is by not considering all the different types of miles or points you could use for the same ticket. These days airlines have so many partners — both other carriers as well as credit card issuers — and by thinking about what Howard calls ""arbitrage opportunities"" you can use the mileage currency that gets you the best return.

The example he offers is booking a one-way business class award ticket from the U.S. to Europe on Lufthansa. That would cost 77000 United MileagePlus miles but just 70000 Air Canada Aeroplan miles or a mere 45000 Turkish Airlines Miles & Smiles miles. Don't have Turkish miles? You actually might have some without realizing it because Citi ThankYou Rewards — the type of points you earn with the Citi Prestige and Citi Premier among other credit cards — transfer to the program. Sure it takes a few extra steps to convert your points and then book through Turkish Airlines but it's worth it to save 32000 miles.

To take another stark example let's say you wanted to fly from Los Angeles to Sydney in business class on Qantas. American Airlines AAdvantage would charge 80000 miles in each direction but Alaska Airlines (another partner) would only charge 55000 miles — a much better deal if you have enough miles with both programs to decide between them.

8. Transferring Credit Card Points Too Soon or Too Late

Several credit card reward programs including American Express Membership Rewards Capital One Venture Rewards Chase Ultimate Rewards and Citi ThankYou Rewards allow you to transfer points to partner airline programs. Amex points for instance transfer to Delta SkyMiles Air Canada Aeroplan and 16 others. Chase Ultimate Rewards points can be converted into miles for 10 airlines including United Southwest and JetBlue.

""Before transferring credit card points to an airline I strongly recommend confirming that there is award space because once you do so there's no going back"" says Howard. You can't turn those miles back into credit card points if you eventually decide not to book.

""Additionally remember that not all transfers process instantly"" he warns. ""That can be an important consideration since the award space you found could disappear if your points transfer takes several days to go through.""

9. Using Airline Miles Instead of Credit Card Points

Speaking of using credit card points in addition to transferring to various airline partners Amex Capital One Chase and Citi points are all redeemable directly for flights at fixed rates through their respective travel portals. American Express Membership Rewards points are worth one cent apiece toward flights booked through Amex Travel; Citi ThankYou Rewards points are worth one cent each for flights booked through the Citi portal; and Capital One Venture miles are worth one cent for flights booked through Capital One (though you can also redeem your miles within 90 days for a statement credit toward travel purchases made elsewhere at the same rate). If you have the Chase Sapphire Preferred card your points are worth 1.25 cents apiece or 1.5 cents with the Chase Sapphire Reserve when using them for travel booked through Chase.

So if you have these types of points and are considering using them to book travel directly or transferring them to an airline partner you're going to have to do a little math to maximize the value.

First find the flights you want and look at how much paid airfares are versus mileage redemptions. Divide the cash price over the number of miles needed and you'll get your per-mile value. If that value is lower than what you'd get by simply redeeming your credit card points for the same flight (i.e. you're getting less than a cent per mile and could use Amex Capital One or Citi points instead or you're getting less than 1.25 to 1.5 cents per mile when you could use Chase points) then you might be better off booking your ticket directly through your credit card portal.

Let's say you have the Chase Sapphire Reserve and are looking at United tickets from New York to Chicago. If United is charging 15000 miles or $150 for the ticket you're getting a per-mile return of one cent. But if you have the Chase Sapphire Reserve you could book the same ticket for 10000 Ultimate Rewards points since you get a fixed rate of 1.5 cents per point. Why bother transferring to United in that case?

10. Paying High Taxes and Surcharges

Certain frequent-flier programs like British Airways Executive Club are notorious for piling on surcharges of hundreds or even thousands of dollars on award tickets. ""[They're] the resort fees of the airline industry"" says Howard. ""You get excited about using your hard-earned miles and points to book an award ticket only to find out you also owe over $1000 in taxes and fees.""

""Fortunately some airline programs don't pass on those surcharges on award tickets"" he says. He suggests using miles from Air Canada Aeroplan United MileagePlus or Avianca LifeMiles to avoid high fees on Star Alliance partners. ""Similarly American Airlines AAdvantage can be used to book many Oneworld partners without surcharges"" he adds. Except on British Airways of course where you'll still get slammed with fees.

11. Buying Miles Instead of Transferring or Pooling

Although frequent-flier programs often run bonuses or discounts on mileage sales it's rarely a good deal. That's because they charge such a premium to buy miles you would be hard put to get the same value back that you paid when it comes time to redeem them for flights. While you might want to consider doing this if you just need a couple thousand more for a specific imminent flight you might have other better options.

First if you have transferable credit card points that you can convert to miles with the airline you need that's generally the easiest cheapest and fastest way to top up your account. You could also consider transferring miles in from the account of a friend or family member which tends to cost less than buying them outright. Some airlines even let you ""pool"" points with your family or household members for free. Among the ones that do are JetBlue Frontier Airlines Air Canada and British Airways.

12. Not Using Them for What You Really Want

The key to making the most of your miles is to focus on the kinds of travel experiences you want to use them for says Howard. ""It's so easy to lose sight of what's important to you"" he begins. ""If using miles and points for business and first-class flights is your priority that's great."" On the other hand he continues ""If using as few miles as possible so you can take more trips fly economy. If flying non-stop matters use a few more points to avoid a connection."" Just decide what you really want and then use your miles for it — don't get caught up in trying to book the craziest over-the-top options. Above all says Howard ""Redeeming miles and points is a choose-your-own-adventure game and you get to decide what you prioritize.""

The measure passed on a 25-24 vote after more than four hours of debate in the Democratic-led chamber. Three members of the Democratic caucus voted no: Sens. Annette Cleveland Steve Hobbs and Mark Mullet.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

“Our hardworking Washington families are ready for us to reform and rebuild our tax code” said Democratic Sen. June Robinson the bill’s primary sponsor. ""They are asking for the wealthy few to be part of equitable investments in our state’s future.”

The measure would impose a 7% tax on the sale of stocks bonds and other high-end assets — like a classic car or painting — in excess of $250000 for both individuals and couples. A person whose business makes more than $10 million per year is also subject to the tax if they make more than $250000 in selling the business.

Retirement accounts real estate farms and forestry would be exempt from the proposed tax. Staff for Senate Democrats say that between 16000 and 18000 people in the state could be subject to the tax based on data from the state Department of Revenue.

The measure which now heads to the Democratic-led House for consideration would take effect Jan. 1 2022 and is expected to bring in about $500 million a year.

Opponents of a capital gain tax have argued that it’s a type of income tax illegal under state law. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and other supporters have said they believe it is constitutional. The debate is certain to end up in court if the full Legislature approves the tax and Inslee signs it into law.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

Republican Sen. Lynda Wilson said that such a court fight ""will cost the taxpayer an enormous amount of money to challenge a law that they don’t want.”

The Democratic-led chamber rejected more than a dozen Republican amendments including one that would make the capital gains tax voluntary. Another proposed amendment would delay the effective date of the tax until mid-2025 in order to give the Legislature time to review recommendations from a work group that is currently developing tax structure ideas.

Republican Sen. Brad Hawkins said while the tax may be narrow now he believed it was inevitable that it would be expanded.

“It’s not about the ultra-rich. It’s about all of us” he said. “Over time once this gets implemented and once the court potentially upholds it then all of the exemptions will over time be whittled away to the point where it does impact all of us.”

One amendment that was adopted removed the bill's emergency clause which would have allowed the bill to take effect immediately upon signature by the governor instead of 90 days after the end of the legislative session. Removal of the emergency clause means that opponents could seek a referendum on the measure if they collect enough voter signatures to qualify for the November ballot.

The capital gains tax has been introduced several times in previous years but has never gained traction in the Legislature. Saturday’s vote in the Senate is the farthest the idea has made it through the legislative process. Supporters of the tax say that Washington — one of just a few states without an income tax — leans too heavily on its sales tax disproportionately affecting those with less income.

Democratic Sen. Joe Nguyen said that the working class have faced a higher tax burden especially during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

“People who have been deemed essential during this pandemic are paying a higher tax rate than those who are profiting from it” he said. “We cannot go back to that same regressive structure if we want a chance at a just recovery.”

On a 28-21 vote the Senate also on Saturday passed a measure that would increase eligibility and subsidies for child care and increase spending on early learning in the state funded through part of the revenues expected to be raised by the capital gains tax.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL3RleGFzLXNwb3J0cy1uYXRpb24vcm9ja2V0cy9hcnRpY2xlL1JvY2tldHMtY2FsbC11cC1LZXZpbi1Qb3J0ZXItSnItSy1KLU1hcnRpbi0xNjAwNjQ5OC5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rockets call up Kevin Porter Jr. K.J.

Both are involved with Camillus House which provides humanitarian services to the indigent and homeless populations in Miami-Dade County.

Dickinson is chairman emeritus and very active in the charity where he's played a role for 26 years while Hanley is VP development. In fact he hired her. Hanley had come to Dickinson's attention when she led the Coral Gables Community Foundation and seven years ago he recruited her to Camillus House.

Impressive mentee

'She was the best mentee short of Vicki Freed' said Dickinson referring to the current SVP sales and trade support & service Royal Caribbean International who served under Dickinson at Carnival as SVP sales and marketing.

Hanley and Dickinson's relationship as colleagues and 'just friends' ultimately deepened and she supported him through his 2019 bout with pancreatic cancer. She visited every day prepared meals and they made frequent trips together which took his mind off the chemo treatments. Dickinson beat the cancer.

'I'm very very blessed' he said.

Dickinson is busily preparing for a Camillus House live auction fundraiser and his chat with Seatrade Cruise News was punctuated by calls from Crystal's Carmen Roig SVP marketing and sales to donate a Crystal cruise and from Verité a boutique winery contributing an exclusive trip to its Sonoma County California vineyard.

(Dickinson a noted wine connoisseur once had a cellar of 20000 bottles which he estimated is now down to 5000 or 6000 since he's donated or sold many. He still enjoys drinking wine favoring Bordeaux California cabernets white Burgundies and Champagne — especially Champagne aged over 30 years.)

'Ton of energy'

'I have a ton of energy. I love what I'm doing' Dickinson said. Camillus House operates 12 facilities that domicile 1600 men women and children and provides job training and recovery programs for substance addiction and victims of sex trafficking.

'The cruise industry has been hugely supportive. NCL and Carnival have given millions' he noted. 'All the lines have donated cruises and a number have provided sponsorships for our annual gala. Cruise industry vendors have been supportive too.'

Industry resilience

Dickinson is impressed how the cruise giants are weathering the pandemic raising funding and shedding less competitive assets.

'They've done a good job' he said adding that the stock market has been 'unbelievably buoyant' and government stimulus programs have helped keep the economy afloat. Lines are doing their best to comply with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention an agency he described as 'remarkably risk-averse.'

Dickinson expects the US to achieve herd immunity by summer but he's concerned about the destinations ships visit.

On the shedding of assets — like some of those in the Carnival Fantasy class that were among the dazzlers during his Carnival years — he's not sentimental.

'They were very successful. They all made a lot of money. And it's time. There has to be a certain amount of reinvention' Dickinson said adding that it won't be possible for lines to resume with their full fleets and it doesn't make sense to lay up ships for an extended period.

Keen observer and avid cruiser

Though Dickinson is sometimes cited in the media he's not consulting for anyone and is merely 'kibitzing.'

He remains a keen industry observer though and is 'singularly impressed' with Viking and how Torstein Hagen's gambit with his first ocean cruise ship in 2015 has blossomed into a successful and fast-growing niche with six ships and many more to come.

And Dickinson's still an avid cruiser having sailed in recent years with Seabourn Carnival Viking Silversea Norwegian Cruise Line and SeaDream Yacht Club among others.

For his honeymoon he would have liked to take back-to-back cruises but given the shutdown the newlyweds are going to Palm Beach instead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RyYXZlbC1jYXJuaXZhbHMtY3lwcnVzLWNvcm9uYXZpcnVzLXBhbmRlbWljLWYxZWIyMTMxZjk1YmQ1MTk2ZWFjN2NkNjdmMTEyNjc40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AP PHOTOS: Cyprus keeps Carnival spirit alive amid COVID-19,"LIMASSOL Cyprus (AP) — Carnival is usually the highlight of the year for Cyprus when residents let loose in bizarre and colorful costumes joyfully dancing and celebrating during the Mediterranean island nation’s biggest annual party scene.

Following 10 days of festivities in the cosmopolitan town of Limassol the grand parade on the eve of the start of Lent — 40 days of fasting before Easter — usually attracts tens of thousands to indulge in an eight-hour feast for the ears eyes and stomach.

Revelers in every conceivable costume march along elaborately festooned floats that often mock the country’s rich and powerful.

But in the COVID-19 era the revelry has taken a backseat to lockdowns and bans on public gatherings. Although the parade went ahead last year this year carnival’s floats huge puppets and other decorations are sitting in warehouses.

But Limassol city authorities aren’t letting the festive spirit completely wither away organizing some events that comply with virus restrictions. The culmination of this is the secret outing of King Carnival the lead float that marks the season’s annual theme.

Skevi Antoniadou a city official in charge of organizing the Carnival festivities said the float which has an abstract figure frozen in a dancing pose will make the rounds of Limassol’s main thoroughfares without prior notice to avoid mass gatherings. One excursion on Thursday signaled the start of festivities. The second one will be on March 14.

The exact route will remain a secret and police will be out to discourage people from gathering in large numbers.

“The message to all is that we’re looking forward to having you back next year because we’ll bounce back from this even stronger” Antoniadou said.

Carnival festivities in Cyprus go back centuries and have evolved over time from simple home gatherings to the massive street party. One staple is Limassol’s famous street singers still known as Cantadori — a derivative of the Spanish equivalent — who dress up and walk the streets with guitars and mandolins singing festive songs.

Antoniadou said a key element of Carnival is the tremendous revenue that it generates for the town. He said hotels are usually completely booked for the 10-day period with hair salons restaurants and costume makers also super busy.

“The carnival is all about the joy it offers but the financial aspect is also important to the town and its people” he said.

This year’s limited festivities spent only a fraction of the approximately 350000-euro ($417000) annual budget with much of the money going to out-of-work artists.

It’s been a mixture of good and bad news across the industry and around the world.

It has been just another non-stop week in the cruise industry with many new developments as most cruise lines remain on hold.

We’ve had some good and bad news including cancellations and new UK-only sailings from two cruise lines a major update from Virgin Voyages Port Canaveral being ready for Carnival’s new Mardi Gras a further ban for cruise ships in Australia along with some positive news from Royal Caribbean and MSC Cruises. We’ve got lots to get through so let’s get started.

P&O Cruises to Offer UK Only Sailings

British cruise operator P&O Cruises announced it would be canceling all voyages onboard all of its ships until August and into September. However all is not lost as P&O Cruises is preparing to offer “the ultimate escape” staycation this summer.

The company hopes to offer guests an opportunity to cruise around the British Isles this summer but it does mean the cancellation of regular sailings. So Arcadia Aurora Azura and Ventura regular cruises have been cancelled until the end of August 2021 and on Britannia and Iona until the end of September 2021.

The new UK-only cruises will depart from Southampton and sail around the UK coastal waters. P&O Cruises will be announcing further specifics on the new sailings later in March.

Princess Cruises Cancels UK Sailings

Princess Cruises has released a major update on its operations out of the UK following a UK government announcement on a framework on reopening international travel.

The UK’s Global Travel Taskforce chaired by The Secretary of State Grant Shapps met for the first time on March 2 to discuss a plan that will be submitted to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on April 12 2021.

So this does mean that the cruise line has extended its pause on regular European sailings to and from the UK including roundtrip from Southampton through September 25 2021 on Sky Princess Regal Princess and Island Princess.

The good news is that Princess Cruises will be offering new UK cruises. All we know at the moment is the cruise line will launch a series of new short cruises departing in late Summer on Regal Princess and Sky Princess out of Southampton. More details on this will be released later in March 2021.

Virgin Voyages Extends Suspension

Virgin Voyages has followed many other cruise lines by extending its pause on operations further into 2021 for Scarlet Lady. Cruises have now been canceled from May 9 through June 30.

Those guests impacted by the latest round of cancellations have two different options unless their voyage has been canceled before. The first option for guests is a 200% Future Voyage Credit of the amount paid to date towards the voyage fare which can be applied to another sailing rather than a refund.

The second option for affected guests is a refund option which means a full refund of everything paid along with a Future Voyage Credit equal to 25% of the existing paid voyage fare to be used on a future sailing.

Port Canaveral Ready for Mardi Gras

Innovation in the cruise industry continues to move forward during the suspension of operations as Port Canaveral is now ready with LNG. The new Q-LNG 4000 arrived at the port which is an articulated tug and barge (ATB) able to offer safe and reliable delivery of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG).

It has been nicknamed Q4K and the project has been in the making for four years. The barge has the capacity to fuel up to two cruise ships with a 7-day itinerary each.

When the Q4K arrived at Port Canaveral recently it was actually conveniently docked at Port Canaveral’s new Cruise Terminal 3 which was completed in June 2020. The terminal has been constructed for Carnival Cruise Line and the new LNG-class cruise ships.

Mardi Gras Carnival’s first fully powered LNG cruise ship is currently in Barcelona Spain but she will soon be heading across the Atlantic to the port. The huge 180000 gross ton vessel will be fueled using the new barge kicking off a new era of eco-friendly fueling for the port and North America.

MSC Seaside to Resume Sailings in May 2021

Even though most cruise ships remain on hold worldwide MSC continues to move forward on new ways to keep some of its ships moving. MSC Seaside a popular MSC vessel that has been sailing out of Miami in the past will begin cruises this May for the first time since the suspension of operations.

So the new 7-day itinerary for MSC Seaside will include calls to Siracusa and Taranto which are both in Italy. The first voyage will depart on May 1 2021 out of Genoa and it will be a 7-night voyage. The itinerary will be sailing five times during the month of May departing on the 1 8 15 22 and 29.

Measures will include universal testing at embarkation as well as mid-cruise weekly testing of the crew social distancing the wearing of masks in public areas only protected shore excursions as well as enhanced deep sanitation and ongoing cleaning procedures.

Australia Extends Cruise & Travel Ban

The human biosecurity emergency period which includes the ban on cruise ships and has been in place since March 17 2020 will be extended by an additional three months until June 17 2021.

The measures almost completely ban all international travel to Australia. This will impact a number of cruise lines that operated from the country including P&O Australia.

According to Joel Katz the CLIA Managing Director the industry is disappointed with the decisions made although it does understand them. Whether cruise ships will be sailing in Australia depends on the Government. CLIA says it is working with the Government on a resumption of cruising in Australia. But when cruising can return to Australian waters remains unclear and we have not heard any specific dates on the framework.

Allure of the Seas to Homeport in Galveston from 2022

Royal Caribbean has announced that one of its largest cruise ships in the world will homeport out of Galveston Texas from November 2022. The Oasis-class vessel will sail 7-night Western Caribbean itineraries from the popular cruise port.

Allure of the Seas will make calls to Roatan Honduras as well as Cozumel and Costa Maya. The first voyage will depart on November 27 2022 and the final 7-day cruise will depart on April 23 2023. The ship will be based from Galveston on a seasonal basis for the cruise line’s 2022-23 winter season.

Rendering: Royal Caribbean

What’s also exciting about this announcement is that by the time Allure of the Seas starts sailing from Galveston the new terminal will be completed. Back in 2019 Royal Caribbean did already announce the ship would be sailing out of its new terminal at the port. However things have changed since then and construction was delayed.

Construction on the new state-of-the-art terminal will finally begin in April 2021 and be completed just in time for Allure’s arrival in fall 2022. The two-story facility is costing $100 million with a total of 170000 square feet.

The mega cruise ship is 225282 gross tons with a guest capacity of 5484 at double occupancy along with 2200 international crew members.

Odyssey of the Seas to Sail Vaccinated Guest from Israel

A remarkable announcement from Royal Caribbean confirmed Haifa in Israel to be the homeport for Odyssey of the Seas in May of this year. The cruise line’s highly-anticipated new ship will offer Israelis a combination of 3- to 7-night getaways on the Greek Islands and Cyprus. The new sailings will go on sale on Tuesday March 9.

Apparently Royal Caribbean has been eyeing up cruises out of Israel for sometime so who knows what other surprising new homeports it has lined up!

The first guests to cruise on Odyssey of the Seas during its inaugural season will be residents of Israel. This ship is designed to provide every kind of traveler with an unforgettable vacation. Benjamin Netanyahu Israeli Prime Minister said that the Israeli government is proud to offer Royal Caribbean the opportunity to sail from Israel.

Royal Caribbean will be the first to offer fully vaccinated sailings where both crew and guests above the age of 16 will be vaccinated. Details on the other health and safety measures to be implemented by Israel and Royal Caribbean will be announced later

Grenada Carnival is normally launched in the second quarter of the year and reaches its climax in August.

Prime Minister Dr Keith Mitchell announced the disappointing decision as health officials raced to vaccinate 60% of the 110000 population by July 2021. The first dose of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine was administered on 12 February.

At a press conference on 26 February PM Mitchell admitted: “I don’t see how we will be able to achieve 60% by July. But even if we did I think it will be a mistake to go and have a mass event because you will still have 40% of the people who will not have been vaccinated. I don’t think it is a smart thing.”

The Prime Minister acknowledged the decision would create difficulties for musicians and many others whose livelihoods are dependent on cultural activities. He asked the Minister of Culture to meet carnival stakeholders to discuss possible relief packages for the affected groups.

Although Grenada Carnival was cancelled in 2020 many people took part in J’Ouvert celebrations in defiance of government Covid protocols."

In Kansas City farmers are struggling to ship soybeans to buyers in Asia. In China furniture destined for North America piles up on factory floors.

Around the planet the pandemic has disrupted trade to an extraordinary degree driving up the cost of shipping goods and adding a fresh challenge to the global economic recovery. The virus has thrown off the choreography of moving cargo from one continent to another.

At the center of the storm is the shipping container the workhorse of globalization.

Americans stuck in their homes have set off a surge of orders from factories in China much of it carried across the Pacific in containers — the metal boxes that move goods in towering stacks atop enormous vessels. As households in the United States have filled bedrooms with office furniture and basements with treadmills the demand for shipping has outstripped the availability of containers in Asia yielding shortages there just as the boxes pile up at American ports.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9iZWxhdmlhLTI1dGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Happy Birthday Belavia – The Belarusian Flag Carrier Turns 25,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9iZWxhdmlhLTI1dGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTAzLTA3L3JleC1zeWRuZXktbWVsYm91cm5lLWZsaWdodHMtdG8tY29tcGV0ZS13aXRoLXZpcmdpbi1xYW50YXMvMTMyMDU4NTjSASdodHRwczovL2FtcC5hYmMubmV0LmF1L2FydGljbGUvMTMyMDU4NTg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Regional Express begins Sydney-Melbourne flights amid 'perfect' pandemic opportunity,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-07/rex-sydney-melbourne-flights-to-compete-with-virgin-qantas/13205858 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTAzLTA3L3JleC1zeWRuZXktbWVsYm91cm5lLWZsaWdodHMtdG8tY29tcGV0ZS13aXRoLXZpcmdpbi1xYW50YXMvMTMyMDU4NTjSASdodHRwczovL2FtcC5hYmMubmV0LmF1L2FydGljbGUvMTMyMDU4NTg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24vc2hpcHBpbmctLy10cmFuc3BvcnQvYWxsLXdvbWVuLWNyZXctb2YtbXQtc3dhcm5hLWtyaXNobmEtbWFrZXMtaGlzdG9yeS1tYW5zdWtoLW1hbmRhdml5YS1mbGFncy1vZmYtdmVzc2VsL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgxMzc3NzQ2LmNtc9IBugFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24vc2hpcHBpbmctLy10cmFuc3BvcnQvYWxsLXdvbWVuLWNyZXctb2YtbXQtc3dhcm5hLWtyaXNobmEtbWFrZXMtaGlzdG9yeS1tYW5zdWtoLW1hbmRhdml5YS1mbGFncy1vZmYtdmVzc2VsL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MTM3Nzc0Ni5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,All-women crew of MT Swarna Krishna makes history; Mansukh Mandaviya flags off vessel,"

In an attempt to acknowledge the efforts of women in breaking down the stereotypes in erstwhile male-dominated maritime sector Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya has flagged off an all-women crew onboard Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) vessel MT Swarna Krishna  the Ministry of Ports Shipping and Waterways said on Sunday. The vessel was virtually flagged off by the Ports Shipping and Waterways Minister on March 6 it said.""The Shipping Corporation of India as a part of its ongoing Diamond Jubilee celebrations and also to commemorate the International Women's Day on March 8 2021 achieved another feat when Mansukh Mandaviya Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Ports Shipping & Waterways virtually flagged off the 'All Women Officers' Sailing' on MT Swarna Krishna - SCI's product carrier from JNPT Liquid Berth Jetty on March 6 2021"" the Ministry statement said.This is the first time in the world maritime history that a ship is being sailed by all women officers it added.Mandaviya acknowledged the contribution and sacrifice of the women seafarers who acted as the Indian ambassadors to the global maritime community and had made the nation proud it said.HK Joshi CMD SCI spoke of the unabated and relentless pursuit of SCI to realise the 'paradigm shift' in the maritime sector which has recognized and honoured the 'empowered womanhood' in seafaring women who have dared endeavoured and sacrificed to achieve it.Secretary Shipping Sanjeev Ranjan Chairman JNPT Sanjay Sethi Chairman Mumbai Port Trust  Rajiv Jalota and DG Shipping Amitabh Kumar attended the ceremony virtually and commended the efforts of the women seafarers.""The move demonstrated the gradual shift in the perception of seafaring as a male-oriented profession and the principles of Diversity & Inclusion that SCI upholds.

Guardianship only makes the news when something goes terribly wrong. Take Rebecca Fierle-Santoian: Acting as a professional guardian she placed a do-not-resuscitate order on an elderly man who said that he wanted to live. He died. Fierle-Santoian served as the guardian for some 450 people and it was later discovered that many of them were placed under DNRs or denied life-sustaining medical care without their input or permission or that of family members or the courts. The Argument is a column where writers and thinkers propose a provocative idea that may not be politically realizable in the short term but that pushes one to think broader about a pressing issue of public importance.

Or consider the case of William Dean who was placed under state guardianship after his mother’s death. Maine’s Department of Health and Human Services sold his home for below market value got rid of his beloved musical instruments and euthanized his cat Caterpillar. Most famously of all there is Britney Spears and the ongoing battle over who should control the pop star’s life and sizable estate.

These cases make it obvious that guardianship needs reform. But the problem is not a few individuals abusing their power; it is guardianship itself. Stripping a person of their legal rights is inherently dangerous and dehumanizing. Guardianship is built on the patronizing assumption that people with certain disabilities are incapable of being full citizens and need a nondisabled person to act as their proxy in all things. While I do not discourage reform what we ultimately need is abolition.

According to AARP about 1.3 million Americans are currently under guardianship. It is hard to say exactly how many because the record-keeping is poor and there are no national standards or federal oversight. As a system guardianship relies on the assumption that guardians are benevolent and always want the best for their wards. And this is probably true for most guardians: They want to protect their elderly parents or disabled children from financial exploitation and worse. But unfortunately no system that depends on the individual benevolence of someone with absolute power can be relied on. People under guardianship still have their own opinions and feelings and they deserve the respect that everyone else is afforded. The Argument Cancel the Presidential Debates—Permanently Ed Burmila The Votes of Black Americans Should Count Twice Brandon Hasbrouck

Significant disability is real. Some people struggle to make decisions or understand the world around them. In calling for an end to guardianship I am not being Pollyannaish about the individuals whom it is usually imposed upon. There will always be some need for proxy decision-making. But guardianship should be the nuclear option: It strips every legal right a person has and once entered it is extremely difficult to end. Disabled children in schools are legally entitled to the “least restrictive environment” under federal law. This means that children who receive special education are entitled to spend as much time as possible in non-special-education classes making the same choices as their nondisabled peers. Their educational plans are regularly reevaluated as people’s needs are rarely static. The same standard is not applied however to disabled adults. If a person has difficulty managing money why should they lose their right to vote or to marry? Instead of stripping them of all legal rights as is the case with guardianship courts should consider where a person is vulnerable and what that person needs just as schools are supposed to do. While schools aren’t always successful in determining the least restrictive environment at least this standard is something to aspire to. No such standard exists with guardianship.

When it comes to serving disabled adults there are alternatives to guardianship that attempt to preserve as many of their rights as possible. Supported decision-making is a system in which trusted advisers—usually family members friends or care workers—explain complex choices to help a disabled person make their own decisions. Such choices can involve something as simple as what color to paint a bedroom wall or as complicated as whether to get surgery. While supported decision-making is increasing as a legal alternative across the United States it is still rarely considered as a first option for vulnerable people. It is also generally used only for people with developmental and intellectual disabilities. The support needs of a young person with an intellectual disability and an older person with dementia aren’t too dissimilar but they exist in different legal universes.

Supported decision-making is not without its own limitations. Depending on the degree of disability supporters still exert some measure of control over the person they’re assisting. If a person needs help leaving the house they must rely on someone else’s good will regardless of the legal rights involved. These practical difficulties however are still an improvement over that person having no legal rights at all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9qb3VybmFsdGltZXMvbmFtZS9kYXJyZWxsLXdyaWdodC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD03NjA0NjE10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Darrell Wright Obituary (1953 - 2021) - Racine WI - Racine Journal Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/journaltimes/name/darrell-wright-obituary?id=7604615 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9qb3VybmFsdGltZXMvbmFtZS9kYXJyZWxsLXdyaWdodC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD03NjA0NjE10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaW5lbWFyZXRyby5jb20vaW5kZXgucGhwPy9hcmNoaXZlcy8xMTI0NC1SRVZJRVctS0lMTERPWkVSLTE5NzQtU1RBUlJJTkctQ0xJTlQtV0FMS0VSOy1LSU5PLUxPUkJFUi1CTFUtUkFZLVNQRUNJQUwtRURJVElPTi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"REVIEW: ""KILLDOZER"" (1974) STARRING CLINT WALKER; KINO LORBER BLU-RAY SPECIAL EDITION","BY TODD GARBARINI



If the title Killdozer is familiar to you you may have seen it before. Originally a novella by Theodore Sturgeon published in the November 1944 issue of Astounding Science Fiction magazine a Marvel Comics book in April 1974 and later appearing in The Mammoth Book of Golden Age: Ten Classic Stories from the Birth of Modern Science Fiction Writing (1989) Killdozer was adapted into a made-for-TV movie which aired on Saturday February 2 1974. Sporting the tagline â€œSix menâ€¦playing a deadly game of cat and mouseâ€¦With a machine that wants to kill themâ€ and billed as A World Premiere ABC Saturday Suspense Movie there is little suspense in this overly silly tale of a Caterpillar D9 that is enlisted by a team of construction workers who have been assigned to build a landing strip for an oil drilling company on an island near Africa. Were it not for the movieâ€™s literary origins I would have sworn that it was an attempt to rip-off Steven Spielbergâ€™s Duel (1971).

Kelly (Clint Walker) the projectâ€™s foreman and bulldozer driver Mack (Robert Urich) uncover a meteorite which was buried many years prior â€“ shades of â€œWho Goes There?â€ the 1938 novella by John W. Campbell and later the inspiration for the 1951 and 1982 film versions of The Thing. The strange sound emitting from the object fails to deter the men from attempting to move the meteorite a decision which proves to be fatal to Mack who dies several hours later as a result of radioactive material emanating from the foreign object. In the company of these men is a mechanic name Chub (Neville Brand) who fails to ascertain why the bulldozer has been rendered inoperative; it is swiftly barred from further use. In comes genius Beltran (James A. Watson Jr.) who forgoes the caveat and puts the D9 back to work. Unfortunately the bulldozer becomes sentient and has a life of its own going on a rampage to destroy their only radio communications a la Quint in Jaws (1975) and then it turns into Agatha Christieâ€™s Ten Little Indians until the filmâ€™s silly finale.

The decision to make Killdozer into a film may have been inspired by the publication of the Stephen King short story â€œTrucksâ€ which appeared in the June 1973 issue of Cavalier a menâ€™s magazine. Mr. King later directed this as Maximum Overdrive (1986) in the fall of 1985. Killdozer is a bit of a dozer in 2021 but lovers of television films of the era of the 1970s will find much to admire here: the technology of the time the neat musical score by Gil MellÃ© the possessed titular â€œcreatureâ€ and the performances of the lead actors.

Kino Lorber continues their track record of releasing nifty and semi-forgotten titles on Blu-ray and Killdozer is now available. This Blu-ray release contains:

A brand new 2K transfer and the film image is very clean.

There is an audio commentary by film historian Lee Gambin and film critic Jarret Gahan. This is an excellent and informative listen and is truly the reason to spring for this release even if youâ€™re on the fence about the actual film itself.

There is an audio interview with director Jerry London that runs just over twenty-two minutes wherein he discusses making the film.

There is also a stills gallery and a set of trailers for Fear No Evil (1969) Ritual of Evil (1970) More Dead Than Alive (1969) and Sam Whiskey (1969).

The disc also includes optional English subtitles.

There have been several real-life incidents with near impenetrable vehicles commandeered for ill-purposes with terribly sad and tragic results. On May 17 1995 a military veteran named Shawn Nelson had suffered many personal tragedies and stole an M603A Patton Tank and drove it through the streets of San Diego CA wreaking havoc before being shot and killed. Some years later fifty-one-year-old Marvin Heemeyer an avid snowmobiler welder and automobile muffler repair shop owner was living in Granby CO and got into a dispute with a company wanting to build a concrete batch plant near his property. Push came to shove following many acrimonious townhall meetings and arguments with the concrete company that were either real or imagined depending on whom you speak with. Mr. Heemeyer inspired by the vigilante Vin Diesel action film A Man Apart (2003) and passionately believing that God sanctioned him to do so purchased a Komatsu D355 bulldozer and modified it undetected over 18 months into an armored behemoth outfitted with thick steel and cameras. On June 4 2004 he bulldozed his way through town destroying the main building of the concrete batch plant and caused seven million dollarsâ€™ worth of damage in a two-hour rampage until he was ultimately stopped by a leaking radiator and an error in judgement electing to shoot himself rather than be taken into custody. A well-made documentary was made about this horrible event called Tread (2020). It was directed by Paul Solet. Strangely no mention of Killdozer is ever made during the 88-minute documentary.

“To design our new space and bring all of our game studio dreams to life we collaborated closely with architect Ayca Dogan and her team at CBRE who transformed the studio’s interior into functional and innovative spaces aimed at facilitating our collaborative and creative approach to game development” wrote Guerrilla Games.

In terms of game development the new studio comes with state-of-the-art facilities and includes “all high tech game studio requirements.”

“Across multiple floors this building offers everything our game studio needs from state-of-the-art audio booths to a dedicated mocap space and a big cafeteria on the top floor with the most amazing views of the city” the blog continued. “We are incredibly happy with the results and look forward to having all Guerrillas together again! Stay tuned for more behind-the-scenes glimpses of our studio in due time.”

Guerrilla Games is currently working on the highly-anticipated sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn. Horizon Forbidden West is slated to release sometime this year on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 but Sony has yet to share a release date.

HARRIS COUNTY Texas (KTRK) -- Seven CenterPoint Energy workers were injured in a massive gas fire near Klein on Friday.

It happened in the 18700 block of Gleannloch Lakes Boulevard around 6 p.m.

Comcast crews were in the area working when they punctured a gas line according to the Harris County Fire Marshal's Office.

CenterPoint Energy crews were then sent to fix the line. As they were leaving crews hit what was described as a 6-inch high pressure natural gas line which is considered a main line.

Authorities say they hit what was described as a 6-inch high pressure natural gas line.

Six workers were taken to hospitals for evaluation and treatment according to CenterPoint Energy. One of those workers was transported via Life Flight.

That victim was in critical condition according to authorities.

The fire marshal says a 500 ft. perimeter was established in the area and all residents were evacuated.

One house in the area sustained damage to its exterior and fencing. Residents in the area were not allowed to return to their homes until the fire was completely out.

The fire knocked out power and gas to surrounding homes. Power in the area was restored Saturday morning.

At least six employees of CenterPoint Energy were transported to local hospitals Friday after what the company described as a “natural gas incident.”

Company spokesperson Olivia Koch told CNN the incident occurred in Gleannloch Farms near Spring Texas.

According to a post on Twitter by the Harris County Fire Marshal’s Office investigators were called to “a possible gas explosion and fire” and based on initial reports it seemed that crews working in the area struck a natural gas line.

Officials evacuated residents from the area and set up a 500-foot perimeter around the scene according to another post from the HCFMO.

In addition to those injured at least one home was damaged in the fire according to the Marshal’s office.

Electric service was also interrupted for about 800 customers in the area due to damage to some electrical equipment Centerpoint’s Koch said.

The fire was reported in the 18700 block of Gleannloch Lakes Boulevard.

Officials from the Harris County Fire Marshal’s Office said that a crew from Comcast was working in the area and nicked a natural gas line. The crew called in a CenterPoint crew to inspect the line which is when two lines exploded officials said.

A representative of Comcast said a contractor cut a small line in an area where the line was incorrectly marked. The representative said CenterPoint crews hit a larger line while repairing the small line.

Five people were transported by ambulance. One was airlifted to Memorial Hermann in critical but stable condition as of 11pm according to Klein Fire Rescue.

Video from Sky 2 showed several vehicles belonging to a construction crew at the scene. Some of them appeared to be burning.

Officials said at least one home sustained damage.

People are asked to avoid the area.

HCFMO officials said that people within 500 feet of the scene have been evacuated.

“They’ve gotta be very concerned. We’re keeping them in our prayers and hopefully we’ll get everything under control here shortly” said neighbor Jim Crenshaw.

At around midnight authorities reported the fire had been put out and residents were being allowed back into their homes.

As of 8 a.m. Saturday repairs are in progress and CenterPoint Energy crews remain on site working to restore service to impacted natural gas customers.

Residents who had their natural gas service interrupted as a result of the incident are urged not to turn any valves or tamper with the natural gas meter for safety reasons. Opening or turning any valves could allow air to enter the natural gas lines which would hinder the restoration process CenterPoint said in a statement.

All electric customers who experienced an outage due to the incident have had their power restored.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vcmJuZW5lcmd5LmNvbS9iZXR0ZXItdG9nZXRoZXItZW5lcmd5LXRyYW5zZmVycy1wdXJjaGFzZS1vZi1lbmFibGUtbWlkc3RyZWFtLWhlbHBzLWl0cy1nYXMtYW5kLWxpcXVpZHMtc2VnbWVudHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Together - Energy Transfer's Purchase of Enable Midstream Helps Its Gas and Liquids Segments,

SOISSONS France––Christophe Ellul 46 boyfriend of November 16 2019 pit bull attack fatality Elisa Pilarski 29 was on March 4 2021 indicted for manslaughter by Soissons prosecutor Julien Morino-Ros.

Pilarski was six months pregnant. Ellul the father of their unborn son Enzo was released on his own recognizance. A trial date has not yet been set.

Julien Morino-Ros and staff concluded after a 16-month investigation that only Ellul’s pit bull Curtis was involved in Pilarski’s unwitnessed death in the Retz Forest near Ellul’s home.

Pilarski had moved in with Ellul just nine days before her death relocating from Rebenacq in the French Atlantic Pyranees region just north of Spain.

The indictment states that Ellul “unintentionally caused [Pilarski’s] death” through what French law defines as circumstances amounting to “clumsiness recklessness inattention negligence or a breach of an obligation of prudence or safety.”

Illegal import

As pit bulls are banned in France the mere import of Curtis from a breeder in the Netherlands using paperwork misidentifying his ancestry may be construed as “a breach of an obligation of prudence or safety.”

Ellul and friends have contended ever since Pilarski’s death that Curtis was a 34-pound Patterdale/whippet mix not a pit bull of nearly twice that size.

Ellul and friends have further insisted that Pilarski was killed by a pack of 21 Poitevin hounds from among 62 of the rare hounds kept by the Paris-based Le Rallye de la Passion hunting club. There is however no record of Poitevin hounds ever killing a human.

The 21 hounds pursued by horsemen were released nearby to hunt deer about half an hour to an hour after forensic examination indicates that Pilarski died.

An autopsy found that Pilarski died from “hemorrhage following several bites to the upper and lower limbs as well as to her head.”

Vets confirmed ANIMALS 24-7 findings

Two court-appointed veterinarians testified that Curtis was “the only author of the bites that caused the death” adding that the attack was the result of “unnatural” training ostensibly for competition in weight-pulling climbing and configuration which “shaped in Curtis a behavior of predation diverted from purpose.”

“The vets established with certainty” FranceBleu said “that Curtis is indeed a pit bull” who was “illegally imported with forged documents.”

This confirmed details of Curtis’ origin discovered by ANIMALS 24-7 researcher Beth Clifton and initially published on November 25 2019.

Both Drago and Curtis ANIMALS 24-7 reported are pedigreed two-year-old American pit bull terriers apparently bred by Sharon DeWit of Hitam Kennel in the Netherlands. Curtis was originally named Dark Midnight.

(See DNA & vets agree: pit bull Curtis not hunting hounds killed Elisa Pilarski.)

“Fighting dogs war machines in combat”

The French tabloid Oise-Hebdo (Oise Weekly) reported that Ellul in several emails wrote that his dogs “Drago and Curtis are real pit bulls” whose “origins are designed to make fighting dogs war machines in combat.”

The Ellul/Pilarski household in Saint-Pierre-Aigle also included three other pit bulls. Chivas and Lady belonged to Ellul; Ice arrived with Pilarski. The pit bulls were reportedly kept in separate cages in the home and were exercised separately.

(See Pit bull or hunting hounds? Who killed Elisa Pilarski & unborn child Enzo?)

Poitvin hounds cleared

DNA test results released on November 3 2020 by Eric Boussuge prosecutor for the district of Amiens supported the veterinarians’ finding that only Curtis participated in killing Pilarski.

DNA was tested from all five of the Ellul/Pilarski pit bulls and all 62 of the Poitevin hounds kept by the Le Rallye de la Passion hunting club.

Among the few undisputed facts about the case are that Pilarski was walking Curtis at the time she was attacked and that Ellul found Curtis alongside Pilarski’s badly mauled body in a ravine below a trail.

Ellul and advocates for Curtis and pit bulls in general as well as other opponents of hunting with dogs have argued ever since the fatal attack occurred that the pack of hunting hounds was responsible or at least contributed to the incident.

“There is nothing against the hunting hounds”

Ellul was indicted for manslaughter 30 days after attorney Xavier Terquem Adoue representing Pilarski’s mother and uncle Nathalie and Vincent Labastarde indicated to Fabrice Alves Teixeira of the newspaper Oise Hebdo that he believed an indictment was overdue.

“We examined the file together with my assistant” Xavier Terquem Adoue said. “And we couldn’t be more neutral: there was one who thought [Pilarski was killed because of] hunting with hounds and the other that it was more Curtis.

“But from halfway through the study of the investigation file our conviction was made: there is nothing against the hunting hounds. If we want to incriminate the hunters it is perhaps on their failure to come to the aid of Christophe Ellul when they met him in the forest.

Time conflict

“What can be said very simply” Xavier Terquem Adoue explained “is that the hunting dogs could not have been there when Elisa was killed. Elisa telephoned Christophe at 1:19 p.m.” complaining to Ellul he contends that she was already under attack by the hounds.

The newspaper Sud Ouest and Agence France Presse reported that “According to Ellul she said she was with Curtis and was worried about the presence of several ‘threatening’ dogs. Christophe decided to go looking for her.”

Shortly after 1:00 p.m. Ellul later told Remi Havyarimana of the newspaper L’Union “She called me at work. She said she was attacked by several dogs she was bitten on the arm and leg and she could not hold Curtis. I told her to let go of the dog” Ellul said. “And my phone fell in the car. When I stopped to pick it up there was no sound. I called back 35 36 37 times … She never answered.”

Was Ellul at work or was he already speeding to the Retz Forest about 45 minutes away?

Neither Pilarski nor Ellul called for help

Neither Pilarski nor Ellul called police emergency medical services animal control or the Retz Forest game wardens any of whom would have been much closer to the scene with jurisdiction to assist.

Ellul arrived near the scene of the attack at about 2:00 p.m. he said.

“The time stamps on the photos of the hounds’ hunt at the Conservateur crossroads show that the dogs were released afterward” Xavier Terquem Adoue said. “It’s very simple: when Elisa made her phone call to Christophe Ellul the dogs could not have been there.”

“While respecting the presumption of innocence” Xavier Terquem Adoue continued “it is already necessary to qualify the [alleged] offense manslaughter by dog.”

Five to seven years

“If the alleged offense is only manslaughter” Xavier Terquem Adoue detailed “the potential penalty is up to five years in prison” plus a fine of up to 75000 euros.

“If there are aggravating circumstances it is seven years” Xavier Terquem Adoue told Fabrice Alves Teixeira. “There must be two aggravating circumstances. I already have four: lack of muzzle” although a muzzle was found about 130 feet from Pilarski’s body “dog imported illegally dog not declared to the authorities [licensed] and mistreatment of animals” specifically how Curtis was trained.

Xavier Terquem Adoue also noted that “Ellul presents himself as a civil party” i.e. a victim “in the same way as my clients. It is not very healthy.”

(See Pit bull suspected of killing Elisa Pilarski struck twice more in five days.)

Details “which were quite indecent”

Ellul Xavier Terquem Adoue said had “sent documents from the file to my clients with details they would have done well without which were quite indecent.”

Ellul “has a personality that worries me” Xavier Terquem Adoue added. “He continued to visit my clients at the grocery store” that Nathalie Pilarski manages in Rebenacq Pyrénées-Atlantiques” a day’s drive south of Ellul’s home near Soissons. He did not respond to a summons [to testify at the coroner’s inquest] and bragged about it to my clients. His intellectual process is clearly that of denial. When justice does not go in his direction he attacks the judiciary.

“Let him play his part play his last cards” Xavier Terquem Adoue finished “but the noose tightens.”

“Nathalie Pilarski must change lawyers”

Xavier Terquem Adoue observed Benoit Blanc a journalist and blogger who has closely followed the Pilarski case from the beginning replaced an allegedly pro-hunting attorney Caty Richard whom Christophe Ellul and his police officer sister Sandrine Ellul had often claimed was biased against Christophe Ellul and Curtis.

“Nathalie Pilarski must change lawyers” Sandrine Ellul had said in so many words.

When Nathalie Pilarski finally did replace Caty Richard Benoit Blanc recounted defenders of Christophe Ellul and Curtile took this as “proof that Elisa’s family continues to trust Christophe Ellul. For them it had nothing to do with the communication of the prosecutor following expert reports and DNA results” which clearly established the involvement of Curtis and the lack of involvement of the hunting hounds and “nothing to do with a possible indictment of Christophe Ellul.”

Rottweilers killed deputy mayor

But “Contrary to what some may have thought possibly uninformed” Benoit Blanc wrote “the family does not deny the involvement of Curtis and does not believe in the involvement of the pack. Note that the ‘Support page for Elisa Pilarski’” which was actually a support page for Christophe Ellul and Curtis “and the ‘Curtis’ Rights Committee support page’ have been deactivated for a few days.”

While the Pilarski case approaches a trial date another fatal dog attack briefly gripped France. Sandra Vicente 38 a wheelchair-bound local politician who had just been re-elected deputy mayor of Sénouillac was on January 26 2021 found mauled to death by her two Rottweilers.

Both Rottweilers were impounded and euthanized.

Following the recent announcement of business tycoon Manny V. Pangilinan San Miguel Corporation’s (SMC) Ramon Ang said that his conglomerate has also made a formal offer to Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. (SPEX) to purchase its 45% stake in the Malampaya gas-to-power project.

In a report by BusinessMirror Ang said that SMC likewise gave a non-binding offer to SPEX which operates the gas platform.

Last week Pangilinan said that First Pacific and PXP Energy offered to Shell its non-binding offer. PXP Energy through London-listed Forum Energy Ltd. operates Service Contract (SC) 72 in the Recto Bank near Malampaya in the West Philippine Sea.

Both the MVP Group and SMC have the financial capabilities to purchase Shell’s share in SC38 which covers the Malampaya project. However Udenna Corporation is expected to exercise the right of first refusal as the owner of the other 45%.

The Dennis Uy-led firm bought its share in Malampaya from Chevron for $65 million last year but the Department of Energy (DOE) has yet to approve the deal. The DOE previously said it sees no violations with the transaction. Uy was one of Pres. Rodrigo Duterte’s largest campaign contributors in the 2016 elections.

Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian who chairs the Senate Committee on Energy has raised on questions on how Udenna would be able to handle Malampaya when it hasn’t proven any technical capability.

SC38 will be expiring in 2024 while Malampaya’s reserves are expected to be depleted between 2024 and 2027. Surigao Del Sur Rep. Johnny Pimentel and Energy Sec. Alfonso Cusi have said that Malampaya’s buyers are interested in its undersea pipes which Pangilinan himself confirmed.

SPEX is selling its stake in Malampaya as part of Shell’s strategy to ensure the sustainability of its businesses in the Philippines.

A mansion on the Black Sea coast often linked to Russian president Vladimir Putin has been refashioned to include a church equipped with a throne according to a report by Russian investigative outlet Proekt. It published the videos of ""Putin's palace"" which were recently renovated. The existence of the mansion was first revealed in 2021 by Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny who had said that it has a wine cellar a casino and an ice rink. Russia has not official reacted to the Proekt report.

The palace is sealed off from rest of the Russia by 17000 acres of forest and a special no-fly zone.

""Many viewers of Navalny's video remembered the entertainment areas - with a pole a casino as well as a room with toy cars and a railway"" Proekt said in its report adding that none of these areas exist anymore.

It also said that renovations suggest Putin ""seems to be obsessed with war and religion"".

The photos show a home church featuring a triptych and a wooden throne. The walls of the room are decorated with crosses and the triptych appears to depict a ""Saint Prince Vladimir"" two art historians and one icon painter said Proekt further said.

The outlet made a particular mention of a chandelier which it said has been made using red crystals from the French manufacturer Baccarat and costs $1 million.

In his 2021 video Mr Navalny had claimed that the property costs $1.3 billion and alleged it was paid for via an elaborate corruption scheme in which Putin gave top jobs and lucrative government projects to his allies at partially state-owned energy giants.

Thousands of Russians had come out on the streets in 2021 when Mr Navalny published the expose on Mr Putin's Black Sea complex.

But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had dismissed the claims in the report at the time calling it ""pure nonsense"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jaHVyY2gtZGlzcnVwdGlvbnMtb24tdGhlLXJpc2UtdGhyb3VnaG91dC1waXR0c2J1cmdoLWFyZWEtaW4tcmVjZW50LXdlZWtzL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9waXR0c2J1cmdoL25ld3MvY2h1cmNoLWRpc3J1cHRpb25zLW9uLXRoZS1yaXNlLXRocm91Z2hvdXQtcGl0dHNidXJnaC1hcmVhLWluLXJlY2VudC13ZWVrcy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church disruptions on the rise throughout Pittsburgh area in recent weeks,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- From Irwin to North Braddock to Ross Township multiple types of disruptions impacting church services have taken place throughout the Pittsburgh area within the last several weeks.

One of the incidents involved a gun pulled on a pastor during a sermon while another consisted of vandalism impacting an organ and sound equipment.

New federal funding has been approved to help increase security for places of worship and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says that all types of churches are welcome to apply.

Places of worship can apply for funding through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and can use the funds for whatever they would like as long as it helps add security. The deadline to apply for funding is May 21.

""I thank God because only God stopped and jammed this gun.""

A man was arrested in North Braddock on Sunday after pulling a gun on a pastor during his sermon at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church -- and it was all caught on camera.

Bernard Polite is facing attempted homicide and aggravated assault charges and is accused of trying to shoot and kill the pastor.

As the pastor ducked out of the way Polite was tackled by a deacon and held down on the ground until police arrived.

Police are also investigating after a man was found shot to death in Polite's home near the church. It's unclear if he is responsible for that shooting.

""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

A church in Westmoreland County fell victim to vandalism late last week and is looking for help identifying the teenagers responsible for the damage.

As a result of the vandalism the church was unable to use the organ for the first two Holy Communion masses the following morning.

The church is now asking for help identifying the two teenagers and say that information will be turned over to Irwin Police.

""It would be nice if people could just practice their religions in peace.""

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

""If they could get it done I'd be happy to come back"" Walsh told People. She teased ""Maybe I'll Zoom in. Dr. Addison could Zoom in.""

The show's current season is addressing the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic so it does make sense that Addison could appear remotely.

Walsh is currently living in Western Australia where she's been for over a year now.

Even after she stopped being a main cast member after season 3 she returned to Seattle Grace Hospital for a handful of episodes. She hasn't been on Grey's since 2012 though so it's high time she came back!

Pulau Kemaro juga disebut sebagai tempat yang melegenda karena cerita unik dan keistimewaannya.

Nama Pulau Kemaro berasal dari kata ‘Kemarau’ karena pulau ini tidak pernah tenggelam atau terendam meskipun air Sungai Musi sedang pasang.

Dikutip dari situs ibs.sumselprov.go.id asal usul Pulau Kemaro ini yakni dari kisah legenda cinta Siti Fatimah dan Tan Bun An.

Siti Fatimah dikisahkan sebagai keturunan Raja Sriwijaya yang menganut agama Islam sedangkan Tan Bun An yang merupakan putra Raja Tionghoa adalah penganut umat Buddha.

Klik untuk follow WhatsApp Channel & Google News

Pernyataan kalau cemburu itu adalah tanda cinta masih sering diucapkan oleh banyak orang. Gak ada yang salah dengan pernyataan tersebut tapi perasaan cemburu gak semuanya ditunjukkan sebagai tanda dari cinta.

Beberapa justru dikarenakan karena hal lain. Mulai dari ketergantungan sampai pada trauma masa lalu yang begitu menyakitkan.

Kamu harus paham dengan kecemburuan yang dirasakan oleh pasanganmu. Selain karena cinta cemburu juga bisa ditimbulkan karena lima sebab di bawah ini.

1. Cemburu itu tanda kalau dia merasa gak sempurna bersanding denganmu pexels.com/cottonbro Kamu perlu tahu kalau cemburu itu adalah bentuk insecure dalam diri. Dia yang saat ini sedang cemburu padamu bukan berarti itu menunjukkan rasa cintanya padamu tapi karena memang dia sedang merasa gak sempurna bersanding denganmu.

Source: Netflix

Pada tanggal 25 Februari lalu Netflix telah menayangkan film original Indonesia terbarunya yang berjudul ""Geez & Ann"". Disutradarai oleh Rizki Balki film ini diadaptasi dari novel populer dengan judul yang sama karya Rintik Sedu.

Film ini menceritakan tentang perjalanan cinta antara Geez (diperankan oleh Junior Roberts) dan Ann (diperankan oleh Hanggini Purinda Retto). Diceritakan Ann merupakan perempuan mandiri yang menginginkan sebuah cinta yang tulus.

Sedangkan Geez ditampilkan sebagai pria tampan penuh pesona dan juga misterius. Pada awalnya Ann bertemu dengan Geez secara tidak sengaja saat acara pentas seni di sekolahnya. Di mana Geez merupakan alumni SMA tersebut dan diundang ke acara tersebut untuk bermain band.

Setelah pertemuan tidak sengaja tersebut akhirnya membuat mereka berdua berkenalan. Kemudian terdapat adegan yang cukup greget saat Geez memberikan Ann sebuah CD yang berisi karya dari band-nya. Kisah cinta mereka berdua berjalan mulus hingga Geez harus berkuliah di luar negeri. Tentunya ini membuat mereka harus menjalani hubungan jarak jauh dan hubungan mereka mulai menghadapi masalah.

Menurut saya Hanggini cukup apik dalam berperan sebagai Ann. Di mana dia mampu menampilkan karakter yang mandiri dan bahkan dia juga terlihat natural saat beradu akting dengan karakter Geez. Sayangnya Junior Roberts kurang apik dalam membawakan karakter Geez.

Pasalnya dia terlihat cukup kaku saat beradu akting dengan Hanggini. Meski begitu ketampanan wajahnya mampu membuat saya memaklumi kepiawaian aktingnya tersebut. Apalagi saat dirinya menatap mata Ann mampu membuat hati penontonnya merasa meleleh.

Untuk alur ceritanya film Geez & Ann terbilang cukup datar. Pasalnya dari awal hingga akhir film belum ada satu bagian yang membuat saya merasa terbawa dengan drama dan keromantisan pasangan ini. Terlebih lagi Geez & Ann juga tampil ala-ala film ""Dilan"" dengan kata-kata puitis. Sayangnya menurut saya kata-kata puitis tersebut terlalu banyak disisipkan ke dalam film sehingga membuat saya kurang menyukainya.

Meski begitu secara keseluruhan Geez & Ann cukup oke untuk dijadikan tontonan santai saat mengisi waktu luang. Pasalnya film ini memiliki cerita yang cukup ringan. Kemungkinan bila kalian masih remaja dan menyukai cerita drama percintaan maka Geez & Ann akan cocok untuk mu dan mampu membuat mu greget. Terlebih lagi ketampanan wajah dan tatapan mata Geez juga mampu membuat hati mu meleleh.

Selain dimainkan oleh Hanggini dan Junior diketahui film ini juga dimainkan oleh Roy Sungkono Ersa Mayori Dewi Rezer dan Indra Brasco. Sedangkan novel Geez & Ann diketahui pertama kali meluncur pada tahun 2017 silam. Kemudian Rintik Sedu meluncurkan sekuel novel tersebut di tahun yang sama dan novel Buku Rahasia Geez tahun 2018."

Online education provider Coursera Inc on Friday filed for a stock market listing with US regulators revealing a surge in revenue from a boost to business due to disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Revenue rose 59% to $293.5 million for the year ended December 31 2020 the company said in a filing.

Coursera offers courses such as machine learning cloud computing and language learning with its platform used by more than 3700 colleges and universities according to the company’s website.

It launched “Coursera for Campus” in response to the pandemic to help educational institutions offer courses to stuck-at-home students. Online learning platforms also benefited as retrenched employees took online courses to rotate into new careers.

Mountain View California-based Coursera was founded in 2012 and its investors include venture capital firm GSV Capital and Kleiner Perkins. The company raised $130 million in funding in July bringing its cash balance to more than $300 million.

Other online learning portals such as Nerdy Inc and Skillsoft chose to go public through deals with blank-check firms as well. Coursera’s net loss widened to $66.8 million for the year ended December 31 from a $46.7 million loss a year earlier.

Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are among the underwriters for the education technology company’s offering.

But as Citizens Bank Park and the Wells Fargo Center begin welcoming spectators back those eager to see live games need to be careful about buying up tickets being sold on secondary markets.

Numerous listings selling tickets for Phillies games surfaced this week on StubHub — MLB's official secondary market partner — despite that the team has not begun to sell tickets yet and hasn't even released a seating chart for the 8800 fans who will be permitted at each home game.

More Phillies tickets also have appeared on other secondary ticket-selling sites like SeatGeek.

The secondary market tickets are for sale for hundreds of dollars. For example on Friday night two tickets for the Cardinals game at Citizens Bank Park were selling for $369 a piece for seats in the ballpark's upper deck – Row 16 of Section 428.

That's an inflated price limited seating or not. But it raises more questions like how how are tickets being sold on the secondary market when the Phillies haven't started selling tickets themselves yet? The team confirmed to PhillyVoice that mobile tickets with the barcodes which are scanned at the gates at Citizens Bank Park prior to entry have not been issued yet and at this point it's not guaranteed that the seating locations described in the StubHub listings will even be included in the Phillies' socially-distanced pod layout for fans.

""We're very aware of the secondary market"" John Weber the Phillies' senior vice president of ticket operations and projects said. ""People can post whatever ... but no tickets have been transferred to StubHub via the barcode.""

Screen Capture/StubHub.com This screen capture shows Philadelphia Phillies home game ticket for sale on StubHub on March 4 2021.

It is unknown how many of these listings resulted in sales if any but by Friday evening there were no longer tickets being sold for any of the games in the Mets series from April 5-7 pictured above.

The fact that these listings for Phillies games exist at all is — at best — confusing for buyers using secondary markets.

The Phillies began selling season ticket packages in December when the organization was unsure what fan attendance might look like by the start of the 2021 season due to COVID-19 restrictions. With the team knowing that uncertainty but still needing to prepare for the coming season fans who purchased those packages have not yet been issued tickets with seat assignments – and more importantly – the barcodes that validate them.

Beginning next week the approximately 10000 Phillies season ticket holders who have already paid the team will have the first crack at pre-sale single-game tickets for the first 19 home games before the tickets go on sale to the general public on March 12.

The team is only selling tickets to the first 19 home games at a limit of 8800 spectators per game which is about 20% of the ballpark's capacity. The Phillies explained they did this due to the fluidity of the situation and that the pandemic could swing occupancy limits in either direction by the time that early stretch is completed.

According to the Phillies since the seating chart has not been announced no secondary seller can sell tickets and guarantee the location of those seats.

Weber explained there is nothing preventing a season ticket holder from posting tickets on StubHub or another site and someone else could buy them.

""But nothing's transferred. The barcode is not transferred yet"" Weber said. ""The money may be transferred but the barcode is not transferred. So now it's just a matter of StubHub going back to those clients and saying these tickets are not valid.""

A spokesperson for StubHub explained that the MLB partnership is managed on a team-by-team basis which creates inevitable hiccups in the process from one organization to another. It's a byproduct of the COVID-19 pandemic across the secondary market ticket industry which has been caught in the middle of indeterminate timelines.

""Any Phillies tickets listed on StubHub prior to March 12 are likely season ticket holders who are listing tickets based on previous years"" StubHub said in a statement. ""If any of these tickets are canceled because of reduced capacity or other COVID-related restrictions buyers are covered by our FanProtect Guarantee which ensures that they receive a new ticket of equal or better quality if possible or a credit worth 120% of their original purchase.""

Depending where they live some buyers of invalid tickets can request a cash refund from StubHub. Customers can check with state regulators to determine whether they are eligible.

StubHub could not confirm how many Phillies tickets sold on its site have been or will need to be refunded – if any. The company did not confirm whether it plans to remove any of the listings though the Phillies said they will continue to work on this issue with the partnership team at StubHub.

In general the standard for the ticket re-selling industry is to allow sellers to post tickets for sale as soon as an event has been scheduled. The 2021 MLB schedule was released last July initially without game times and was later refined as planning advanced.

Although the games were confirmed no tickets were ever guaranteed for specific seats due to the uncertainty of the pandemic.

""Nobody knew what our capacity was going to be"" Weber said. ""StubHub they wanted to move forward with their clients. We didn't know what was going to happen. This really has to do with a moment in time where capacity was Y and now capacity is X.""

StubHub's view on this murky situation is that listings posted by season ticket holders are indeed legitimate to the extent that teams technically owe their customers the tickets they have purchased in some form.

But when seat maps are revised to account for COVID restrictions – and only 1 in 5 tickets normally available at Citizens Bank Park are issued – it's inevitable the tickets to many games will be canceled.

A secondary buyer who makes a purchase now for a specific game may not get a ticket if the seller doesn't end up with any of the 8800 tickets available for the game in the listing on StubHub or another secondary market.

""There's not a scam involved"" Weber said. ""StubHub's a reputable organization. Their goal is to take care of their clients just as our goal is to take care of our season ticket holders and fans. We're fortunate in that because of the barcoding there's communication between our system StubHub's system and obviously the gate access when you come down here.""

The situation has not been the same with secondary market tickets for the Philadelphia 76ers and Philadelphia Flyers. Officials with those teams said they have been in communication with season ticket holders and StubHub to avoid confusion wherever possible.

Occupancy at the Wells Fargo Center is capped at 3100 fans which is about 15% of the arena's capacity.

Similar to the Phillies season ticket holders for the Sixers will have access to a pre-sale for single-game tickets starting next week. Unlike with Phillies games there are no speculative Sixers tickets for sale on StubHub.

The Sixers have an exclusive partnership with StubHub and fans can not post tickets for sale there until they have actually purchased tickets from the pre-sale. That partnership does stop people from listing tickets for sale now on other platforms. On SeatGeek for example users can track upcoming Sixers home games but there are no active ticket listings as of publication of this article.

With a season ticket base of about 12000 fans the Sixers have told their customers not to assume they'll get tickets for a particular game and not to list them in advance on StubHub or any other secondary market.

The first Sixers home game with fans will be March 14 against the San Antonio Spurs.The team expects secondary-market ticket listings will quickly appear once pre-sales have taken place.

""The reason tickets haven't gone on sale yet is we have to have every configuration set and ready before we get there"" a team spokesperson said. ""You're not going to see Sixers tickets listed until (people) buy a seat and they know they have a seat.""

None of the Philadelphia teams have published a seating chart showing how they'll handle the occupancy restrictions.

On Sunday the Flyers will be the first of the city's pro teams to have fans in the stands when the Washington Capitals come to town. Flyers fans who are Inside Edge members with the club got first shot at buying tickets. For everyone else the team has created a priority waiting list to facilitate buying tickets directly from the Flyers whenever possible.

""We know that with significant demand for Flyers tickets some of those tickets are going to end up on the secondary market"" said Mike Shane chief business officer for the Flyers. ""There's not much we can do to control that but we do have a partnership with StubHub to ensure that any Flyers tickets sold there are legitimate. The best way to buy tickets this year is directly through the team either by signing up to become an Inside Edge member or by signing up for the priority waiting list.""

The Flyers said their partnership with StubHub maintains seating pods of two to four people that can't be broken up when sold on the site. While the team has not raised ticket prices there is nothing they can do to limit prices on the secondary market.

All three teams encourage fans to use StubHub to sell and buy tickets as opposed to other platforms since they each have a relationship with the company and believe it is the safest option.

The Phillies are the only team whose tickets are appearing for sale on StubHub before the team has issued them. And until tickets are issued buying secondary market Phillies tickets might wind up being a headache. That's a risk some buyers may be willing to take knowing they can get a StubHub credit at worst and a replacement ticket for the same game at best.

Without a seating chart to check listings against these first 19 Phillies games it may just be safer to wait until March 12 or after to buy tickets. The only seating information made available at this time is that fans will be socially distanced in pods consisting of between two and six seats. The overall seating arrangements will remain relatively consistent from game to game but even season ticket holders likely will not have the same seats from game to game Weber said.

Of course the ideal place to buy tickets would be directly from the Phillies website. It's not clear yet how many will be left over for the general public on March 12 following the pre-sale.

""Obviously our number one priority is taking care of our season ticket customers"" Weber said. ""I would expect Opening Day would be sold out. We have a season ticket base of 10000 tickets. We'll see what our retention rate is of our season ticket customers.""

In about two weeks many of the secondary market processes will likely be functioning more smoothly. And that's really when things will get interesting.

The Bank of Guyana claims First Citizens did not inform the financial sector regulator about its decision to buy Scotiabank's assets in that country.

In a statement on Thursday Guyana's Central Bank said despite a notice from First Citizens published in the TT press where the TT bank announced its intention to acquire Scotia's assets in Guyana the regulator was not informed.

""First Citizens does not have a licence to operate in Guyana. First Citizens has not submitted an application in keeping with the requirements of the Financial Institutions Act to the Bank of Guyana to acquire control of a bank operating in Guyana"" the statement said.

First Citizens in which the TT government has just over 55 per cent ownership does not currently have a presence in Guyana.

Its notice said any agreement with Scotiabank would be subject to regulatory approval.

First Citizens did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In 2019 when Scotia attempted to sell its Guyana assets to another TT bank Republic Financial Holdings Ltd the Bank of Guyana denied the transaction with governor Dr Gobind Ganga saying had it gone through Republic would have had over 50 per cent ownership of the assets and deposits in the Guyanese financial sector which would have raised major concerns such as impact on competition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZ3VhcmRpYW4uY28udHQvYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFuay1vZi1ndXlhbmEtc2F5cy1uby1vbmUtYWxlcnRlZC1pdC1hYm91dC1zY290aWEtc2FsZS02LjIuMTI5NzgwNS5iM2VkNmIxM2Q50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank of Guyana says no one alerted it about Scotia sale,"pe­ter.christo­pher@guardian.co.tt

The National Insurance Corporation (NIC) plans to double its market share in the next five years thus owning the entire insurance market by over a quarter.

NIC’s CEO Elirehema Doriye said this when speaking to The Citizen whereby he highlighted the company’s goals based on the organization’s strategic plan ending in 2026.

“Currently our share of the market is 13.2 percent but according to our strategic plan come 2026 we must be in control of the market by 25 percent and that will be achieved by having business partnerships with other establishments especially financial institutions so to increase our ability of reaching more people” he said.

Dr Doriye whose organization has more than 60000 customers said another factor that will help them achieve their goal is the fact that they were the sole supplier of East and Southern African Economic Community (Comesa) insurance in the country. “Every country has an insurance company that is a representative of others (Bureau) in this country it’s us and this is a great opportunity for us and our fees for the insurance are Sh15000 for a private car and Sh20000 for a commercial car as insurance lasts 30 days and applies to all Comesa countries” he said.

In addition Dr Doriye said through these strategies the agency will continue to hold its record of being the company that earns more profit than other companies in the market. He said the average profit after corporation’s tax is Sh25 - 26 billion.

In another development Dr Doriye said the business partnership between them and TPB bank has increased the agency’s closeness to serving Tanzanians as they can access such services through the bank’s branches nationwide.

“Our good business relationship means a lot in serving Tanzanians we have brought them closer to the service and now they should see insurance services as important and not a luxury” said Dr Doriye at a dinner for staff of the two institutions.

For his part TPB chief Sabasaba Moshingi said the focus of the bank and the government is on ensuring that all Tanzanians have access to financial services but the state of insurance services is low but hopefully he said through their partnership with NIC they will reach more.

“We aim to ensure that more people have access to financial services but the issue of insurance is very important we will continue to design more services for the benefit of Tanzanian customers together with connecting our systems with NIC to promote mutual understanding”he said.





Moshingi said at the event.

In addition Moshingi said in every branch of the bank one can get the same insurance services as he would in insurance offices and therefore it is imperative to take advantage of the proximity.

By 2030 the Tanzania Insurance Regulatory Authority (TIRA) set targets to boost the insurance market and reach more citizens from the current 15 to 50 percent increasing the contribution of the insurance industry to reach a GDP of 3 percent.

During the business year 2019 the insurance sector recorded Sh813.76 billion in raw material insurance and by the second half of 2020 revenue had reached Sh433.33 billion indicating growth in the sector.",,,

Sun-scorched expanses and steady Red Sea breezes make the northwest tip of Saudi Arabia prime real estate for what the kingdom hopes will become a global hub for green hydrogen.As governments and industries seek less-polluting alternatives to hydrocarbons the world’s biggest crude exporter doesn’t want to cede the burgeoning hydrogen business to China Europe or Australia and lose a potentially massive source of income. So it’s building a $5 billion plant powered entirely by sun and wind that will be among the world’s biggest green hydrogen makers when it opens in the planned megacity of Neom in 2025.The task of turning a patch of desert the size of Belgium into a metropolis powered by renewable energy falls to Peter Terium the former chief executive officer of RWE AG Germany’s biggest utility and clean-energy spinoff Innogy SE. His performance will help determine whether a country dependent on petrodollars can transition into a supplier of non-polluting fuels.“There’s nothing I’ve ever seen or heard of this dimension or challenge” Terium said. “I’ve been spending the last two years wrapping my mind around ‘from scratch’ and now we’re very much in execution mode.”Hydrogen is morphing from a niche power source — used in zeppelins rockets and nuclear weapons — into big business with the European Union alone committing $500 billion to scale up its infrastructure. Huge obstacles remain to the gas becoming a major part of the energy transition and skeptics point to Saudi Arabia’s weak track record so far capitalizing on what should be a competitive edge in the renewables business especially solar where there are many plans but few operational projects.But countries are jostling for position in a future global market and hydrogen experts list the kingdom as one to watch.The U.K. is hosting 10 projects to heat buildings with the gas China is deploying fuel-cell buses and commercial vehicles and Japan is planning to use the gas in steelmaking. U.S. presidential climate envoy John Kerry urged the domestic oil and gas industry to embrace hydrogen’s “huge opportunities.”That should mean plenty of potential customers for the plant called Helios Green Fuels. Saudi Arabia is setting its sights on becoming the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen — a market that BloombergNEF estimates could be worth as much as $700 billion by 2050.“You’re seeing a more diversified portfolio of energy exports that is more resilient” said Shihab Elborai a Dubai-based partner at consultant Strategy&. “It’s diversified against any uncertainties in the rate and timing of the energy transition.”Blueprints are being drawn and strategies are being announced but it’s still early days for the industry. Hydrogen is expensive to make without expelling greenhouse gases difficult to store and highly combustible.Green hydrogen is produced by using renewable energy rather than fossil fuels. The current cost of producing a kilogram is a little under $5 according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.Saudi Arabia possesses a competitive advantage in its perpetual sunshine and wind and vast tracts of unused land. Helios’s costs likely will be among the lowest globally and could reach $1.50 per kilogram by 2030 according to BNEF. That’s cheaper than some hydrogen made from non-renewable sources today.It’s more expensive to produce renewable energy in Europe and the continent’s anticipated demand while implementing a Green Deal should exceed its own supply Terium said. That $1 trillion-plus stimulus package will try to make the continent carbon-neutral.“By no means will they be able to produce all the hydrogen themselves” he said. “There’s just not enough North Sea or usable water for offshore wind.”Terium who is Dutch joined Neom in 2018 to design its energy water and food networks. His enthusiasm for technologies such as electric vehicles and digital networks wasn’t matched by Innogy’s investors but it is by the backers of Neom.The most important of those is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman the 35-year-old de facto ruler who envisions Neom as a zero-emissions exemplar helping transform society and the economy. The hydrogen plant is part of that vision. But while Neom’s $500 billion price tag prompts questions about whether it will go ahead exactly as planned the hydrogen effort doesn’t depend on the megacity’s overall success.There are other challenges too: The country produces one-eighth of the world’s oil supply but its operational renewables capacity is small by regional standards and it’s starting from zero with green hydrogen.The government is partnering with Acwa Power a Riyadh Saudi Arabia-based power developer partly owned by the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund and Air Products and Chemicals Inc. a $58 billion company based in Allentown Pennsylvania to build the green hydrogen plant.The trio is splitting the costs of Helios which will use 4 gigawatts of solar and wind power.“As the first gigawatt plant we will have an advantage in developing further innovation” Terium said. “This is not going to be the end of the game.”For starters Helios will produce 650 tons of hydrogen a day by electrolysis – enough for conversion to 1.2 million tons per year of green ammonia. Air Products will buy all of that ammonia which is easier to ship than liquid or gaseous hydrogen and convert it back upon delivery to customers.Enough green hydrogen will be produced to maintain about 20000 city buses. There are about 3 million buses operating worldwide and Air Products wants to be a mainstay in depots switching to hydrogen said Simon Moore vice president of investor relations.“We’re not going to wait until this project comes on-stream in 2025 to think about additional capacity” he said.Fuel-cell vehicles could capture as much as 30% of bus-fleet volume globally by 2050 with growth coming primarily from China and the European Union according to BNEF. Moore declined to identify Helios’s clients.Hydrogen will cost more than polluting alternatives at first but enough governments and businesses face stringent carbon targets that need the gas to meet them Moore said. Thirteen nations have hydrogen strategies in place and another 11 are preparing theirs according to BNEF.Germany said it needs “enormous” volumes of green hydrogen and it hopes Saudi Arabia will be a supplier.“The interest Saudi Arabia has had from investors leads us to believe that there is a sound economic case for hydrogen even at current prices” a spokesman for the Energy Ministry said.At the same time the government is trying to boost its own scant use of renewable energy. Currently under 700 megawatts operate nationwide -- less than 2% of Spain’s installed capacity. The nation plans to meet half of its power needs from renewables by 2030 and has several projects under construction or soon to start.Saudi Arabia also is one of the few countries regularly burning crude to make electricity. The highly polluting practice reached a four-year peak in August and critics say the energy used by the Neom plant should be diverted into the national grid instead.Yet the focus remains on exports. Petrostates stand to lose as much as $13 trillion by 2040 because of climate-change targets and Saudi Arabia is among those expected to be most affected.The hydrogen plant will produce 15000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at most hardly a match for the 9 million barrels of crude the kingdom pumps daily. Even so finding a way to corner part of the clean-fuels market represents a necessary economic lifeline.“It’s sponsored at the highest possible level so if any project happens it’s got to be this” Elborai said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L21hbGF5YWxhbS9tb3ZpZXMvbmV3cy9wYXJpcy1sYXhtaS10aHJvdWdoLWVsbGVzLWktd2FudGVkLXRvLXNob3ctdGhlLXBvd2VyLW9mLWZlbWluaW5lLWVuZXJneS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MTM2NjE5Ny5jbXPSAawBaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tYWxheWFsYW0vbW92aWVzL25ld3MvcGFyaXMtbGF4bWktdGhyb3VnaC1lbGxlcy1pLXdhbnRlZC10by1zaG93LXRoZS1wb3dlci1vZi1mZW1pbmluZS1lbmVyZ3kvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgxMzY2MTk3LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paris Laxmi: Through ‘Elles’ I wanted to show the power of feminine energy,"Women of all sizes shades and ages getting to celebrate their true self without stigma is still a distant dream in our society.However actress – dancer Paris Laxmi gives flesh and blood to this lovely thought through her Women’s Day special music video titled ‘ Elles – The Feminine Energy.’In French Elle translates to ‘she. In the video alongside Laxmi and celebrity transgender make-up artist Jaanmoni Das seven others who face varied stigmas – based on skin colour body types gender fluidity career choice menstruation and more - in their real life also make an appearance.Laxmi who scripted directed and acted in the video also turns singer and lyricist in it for the first time.She tells us “Elles is a sneak peek into the lives of nine individuals and shows how they overcome stigmas to emerge confident. For instance a little girl traumatised by her first period learning to enjoying her childhood; a dusky girl emboldening herself to embrace her skin colour a plus-sized woman loving her body a home-confined pregnant woman deciding to practice yoga and more.”She also mentions how the video shows a tall woman who belittles her ‘height-shamers’ by becoming a successful lawyer; a youngster born a man coming out to his parents as a gender-fluid person; a street dancer who eventually wins big stages; a transwoman who opens her own makeover studio and an elderly woman who pursues her passion for dance.Laxmi who has met them all in real life endearingly recollects each instance. To mention a few “I met Jaanmoni while taking part in her recent salon-opening event and felt she should be part of Elles. Adv K K Kavitha the tall woman in the video is from my place Vaikom. Samson Lei through whom we show women trapped in male bodies my student Panchami Aravind who represents dusky women and the others too are women whom I have watched braving stigmas in real life."" Kavya Madhav Lakshmi Shaji Induja Prakash and Shyamala Xavier are the others who appears as themselves in the video.Interestingly the video's street dancer bit is an episode from Laxmi’s own life. “When I was 19 I had no big stages unlike now and used to perform in France’s streets to earn money. And that’s what I have incorporated into the video through my portion” she says.Elles' music composed by Ramu Raj also showcases diversity. It has Carnatic vocals by Bhagyalakshmi Guruvayur Malayalam rap by Indulekha Warrier and Western vocals by Paris Laxmi herself. All of them penned their lines too themselves.What urged her to make such a video? “I wanted to showcase the different kinds of feminine energies around us artistically. The video also wishes to say that all kinds of women are facing stigmas but we can overcome them too. I wanted to show the power of the feminine energy” says Laxmi.As for challenges in putting the video together Laxmi reveals it was in incorporating all their stories into a few seconds. “Composer Ramu guided me on the music and we worked hard to narrate each story well within around nine seconds. It wasn’t my plan to accommodate nine types of women but when it happened I felt it’s a good number. It might remind one of navarasas though the stories aren’t representing individual rasas” Laxmi says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJuYS5iaC9lbi9TRUFQcmVzaWRlbnRyZWNlaXZlc0JOUFBhcmliYXNkZWxlZ2F0aW9uLmFzcHg_Y21zPXE4Rm1GSmdpc2NMMmZ3SXpPTjElMkJEZyUyRkQwOHI4QjRhUyUyQiUyRlRKaTRmMkVqMCUzRNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SEA President receives BNP Paribas delegation,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bna.bh/en/SEAPresidentreceivesBNPParibasdelegation.aspx?cms=q8FmFJgiscL2fwIzON1%2BDg/D08r8B4aS%2B/TJi4f2Ej0%3D on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJuYS5iaC9lbi9TRUFQcmVzaWRlbnRyZWNlaXZlc0JOUFBhcmliYXNkZWxlZ2F0aW9uLmFzcHg_Y21zPXE4Rm1GSmdpc2NMMmZ3SXpPTjElMkJEZyUyRkQwOHI4QjRhUyUyQiUyRlRKaTRmMkVqMCUzRNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZXJneWZtLm5ldC9jbXMvbmV3c19zdG9yeV82Njc2MTcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,315 COVID-19 active cases - six people in hospital,"315 COVID-19 active cases - six people in hospital

Cases of Covid-19 have continued to rise in the Isle of Man and six people are now being treated in hospital.

A further 81 cases were confirmed after testing on Saturday meaning the total number of active cases now stands at 315. More than 1000 people are currently in self-isolation – with 187 instructed to do so in the previous 24 hours.

Chief Minister Howard Quayle MHK said: ‘I understand that the numbers may cause concern to the public but increasingly they should be the result of transmission within households. We are not yet at the peak but may reach that point early next week as we start to see the effects of the first week of lockdown.

‘We are entering an important phase. It is more important than ever that we work together as a community by staying at home as much as possible to protect our vaccination programme and front line services.’

The Council of Ministers has considered the situation regarding schools nurseries and childminders. Given the most recent data they will remain closed tomorrow. Announcements on provision beyond Monday will follow shortly.

Dr Alex Allinson MHK Minister for Education Sport and Culture said: ‘We have made the important and necessary decision to keep schools nurseries and childminders closed for tomorrow to stop transmission between our young people. We are continuing to review this and are ready to make any changes when it is safe to do so but for now I ask you to please keep your children home.’

On Saturday more than 600 people were swabbed on the Island with 81 (13%) testing positive.

The Contact Tracing team are continuing to work tirelessly through the significant number of close contacts of those who test positive for the virus. They are asking people to be patient whilst the team work to contact everyone.

Anyone with symptoms is asked to contact 111 immediately. Do not assume the symptoms are something else.

Dr Henrietta Ewart Director of Public Health said: ‘We are heading to the end of the first week of lockdown and are starting to see the effect of community transmission of the virus with cases estimated to rise over the next few days as we hit the peak.

‘It is important to remember that the majority of these new positive cases will be as a result of transmission within households and close contacts and so will already be in isolation.

'I would encourage the whole community to be vigilant and continue to practise good hand and respiratory hygiene. If you do have any symptoms please report these with 111.’

The vaccination programme is continuing at pace with over 85% of the top 3 priority groups having already received at least one dose. From Monday 1000 doses will be delivered five days a week ramping up the rollout to the Island’s most vulnerable.

An option to register online will be available early next week and further information will follow on Monday.",,,
KO,Coca-Cola Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbnBvc3QuY29tL3ZvaWNlcy9jb2NhLWNvbGEtaXMtbW9yZS1wb3B1bGFyLXRoYW4tamVzdXMtYW1vbmctdGhlLXVucmVhY2hlZC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca-Cola is more popular than Jesus among the unreached?,"Home Opinion Coca-Cola is more popular than Jesus among the unreached?

Many Christians are surprised when they hear that there are communities where no one has preached nor heard about Jesus. In Nigeria there are over 83 people groups that are designated as unreached with a population of over 64 million (Joshua Project survey). It is surprising to note that even among the unreached short thick bottles of Coca-Cola are found in their midst. This observation calls for sober reflection and it is a challenge to global Christians.

Jan Conway in an article titled ""Coca-Cola statistics and facts"" said: ""Everyone has heard of Coca-Cola and you would be hard pressed to find somebody who was unable to recognize the iconic white lettering against the bright red background of this global brand"". Conway was convinced beyond every reasonable doubt that all have heard of Coca-Cola. The million dollar question to all Christians is: can any of us boldly assert that everyone has heard of Jesus?

It is obvious that no Christian can make such a claim because we know that it is not true. In Nigeria alone statistics has shown that over 64306000 have not heard about Jesus. In one particular community we informed the residents that Jesus was coming to rule over their community and that they should allow us to set ablaze their gods because they were man-made. They held a meeting and returned to us and told us that they would had liked Jesus to come to their community but they were afraid that He might not be able to survive the harsh environment.

According to them ""From your explanation about this Jesus He is a wealthy king. We do not have good house to accommodate Him. Our bed is not good enough for Him to sleep on. No good food for Him to eat and no clean water for Him to drink. Please tell him that we appreciate all the food and clothe which He sent to us through you but we are afraid that He will not be able to survive the hardship of our community.""

It is important to note that before these people came up with this response we had already done some explanations about the divinity of Christ. Yet they did not understand because they were hearing about Him for the first time. Even the name ""Jesus"" was mentioned for the first time in this community. The people innocently made the response out of ignorance.

We visited another community with relief materials and told them that Jesus sent us with the goods. Some groups of women gathered and requested that they would like meet with Jesus to express their profound gratitude to Him for all that He has sent to them. According to them ""Please whenever you are visiting again endeavor to come with Jesus. We want to thank Him for all these gifts that He has sent for us. Tell him that we would like to see Him.""

If Coca-Cola has advertised their products and everyone has heard about them why are Christians finding it difficult to advertise our only product – Jesus? Is it that we do not have the money to carry out the research and advertisement? Or is it that we do not have the personnel requirements? Are we not innovative enough?

Coca-Cola uses the social platforms sponsorship strategy television and radio commercials print media billboard ads etc. as advertising strategies to spread their brand farther. Coca-Cola maintains human connections stays truthful to their principles and remains innovative in order to ensure that all hears about their products. Jesus needs to be advertised through every available medium. Church program advertisement should be about Jesus and not about the men of God who are ministering in the program. I have not seen where Coca-Cola advertises their chief executive officer; their advertisement is product-focused.

How thick bottles of Coca-Cola found their ways to unreached communities is what I cannot really explain. I wondered if the company had in any way targeted the unreached who do not have access to any advertisement medium. I presume that their marketing officers must have accessed unreached and hard-to-reach places on feet with their products. Most of the villages where we saw Coca-Cola bottles do not even have roads. Jesus marketing officers (missionaries) should be massively recruited trained and sent to market their product among the unreached no matter how difficult the terrains.

Investment on research on how to develop missiological strategies to reach the unreached should be supported by every Christian. A comprehensive Biblical study of the history of the Christian mission should be embarked on by every mission-minded believer. There should be scientific investigation of the psycho-spiritual socio-cultural and geo-political background of every unreached tribe nation and community and an in-depth research on strategies used before now by missionary heroes of faith. Missionary researchers and field missionaries must learn how to hear the voice of the Holy Ghost for ideas on how best to reach the unreached.

Churches must embark on grooming every member to realize that missionary work is a collective responsibility. If you are not called to go you must hold lifelines to those who are going by intercession and giving. Every church must set up a mission team that must be stronger more committed more innovative and more pragmatic than the Coca-Cola team. It will be glorious if there comes a day when the leaders of our churches and mission agencies will lift their voices confidently to declare that everyone on this planet Earth has heard about Jesus.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNub3Blcy5jb20vZmFjdC1jaGVjay9mcmVlLWNva2UtYmFnLXNjYW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Coca-Cola Giving Away Free Bags with Goodies for their 125th Anniversary?,"Claim: In honor of their 125th anniversary Coca-Cola is giving away bags ""containing lots of Coke goodies and a $20 voucher.""

Instead it was a ""typical like-farming scam designed to promote the associated Facebook Page and gather as many new likes as possible."" The link to the ""survey"" was in fact a second scam redirecting users to a series of unrelated and fraudulent offers.

Indeed since the page was first created on March 5 2021 it has grown rapidly from zero to 37914 followers:

The real Coca-Cola USA Facebook page for comparison had 105301977 followers at the time of this reporting.

Because the page does not represent the Coca-Cola company and is instead an imposter attempting to build a Facebook page and make money off other shady offers the claim presented is a ""Scam.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xMDAtb2xkLWNvbXBhbmllcy1zdGlsbC1idXNpbmVzcy0xNzAwMjU4MzUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,100-Year-Old Companies Still in Business Today,"Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com

Some of the hottest major brands around today are also relatively young: Apple debuted in 1976 Amazon was launched in 1995 and Google didn’t fully hatch until 1998. While these snazzy tech entities tend to dominate top rankings lists — wowing critics with their innovations and enhancements — there’s a lot to be said for brands that have proven their resilience and endurance by standing the test of time.

There are more than a handful of big-name companies that were founded over a century ago and are still going strong today. When they were created there was no internet no computer and many deadly viruses like polio and H1N1 influenza (the root of the Spanish Flu pandemic) — no vaccine. These businesses weathered the Great Depression World War II and more. They’ve gone through their own ups and downs over the years — with some of them facing their greatest challenges yet as they navigate the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here’s a look at 10 brands that have been around for more than 100 years.

Last updated: March 2 2021

1. Coca-Cola

The Coca-Cola Company was founded back in 1892 several years after the beverage was invented by the pharmacist John S. Pemberton. Back then the fizzy drink spun as a tonic for numerous health ailments contained cocaine — which wasn’t removed from the formula until 1903. Over the years the Coca-Cola Company has grown to become a giant in the beverage industry ushering in other popular soda brands including Sprite Fanta Schweppes and Diet Coke. Coca-Cola has a global brand value of over $70 billion and its stock was trading at about $53 as of mid-December 2020.

2. J.C. Penney

J.C. Penney has had its ups and downs and then more downs in recent years as in-store retail struggles to stay relevant but 100 years ago the brand had nothing but potential. Founded in 1902 by James Cash Penney J.C. Penney was originally named The Golden Rule named after the concept that one should treat others as they wish to be treated. The company had just one locale in Kemmerer Wyoming but grew in part because of its savvy expansion overseas and its adoption of mail-order catalogs.

In 2020 the brand announced that it would close up to 200 stores in a financial restructuring effort that saw the company file for bankruptcy in May. In December Simon Property Group and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. purchased the department store chain. J.C. Penney stock has tanked and as of Dec. 14 was trading for only 15 cents a share — which might have been decent back in 1902 but not today.

3. UPS

The United Parcel Service is young in comparison to the USPS which was founded back in 1775 but UPS still weighs in at over 100 years old having been established back in 1908 by a 19-year-old Seattleite named James E. Case and fellow teen Claude Ryan. Launched as American Messenger Company the brand was renamed United Postal Service in 1925. UPS didn’t go public until 1999. UPS has had to tackle plenty of challenges during the pandemic — mostly related to an over-demand of its services. The shipping company had to turn down retailers after being overcapacity in December.

On the Wall Street side of things UPS is faring well. A recent CNN poll among 26 investment analysts found the consensus to be that UPS is a good stock to buy as it’s held steady since November. As of market close on Dec. 14 UPS stock was priced at over $166.

Boeing Airline company

4. Boeing

The Boeing Company dates back to 1916 founded by timber merchant William E. Boeing as Aero Products Company. The aircraft manufacturer was renamed Boeing Airplane Company in 1917. The brand made major strides in the military air-mail and of course passenger space and for decades it looked like nothing could take Boeing down.

Two recent events changed all that: first the regulatory ban placed on Boeing’s 737 Max the company’s star aircraft following two fatal crashes. Second is the pandemic which bulldozed the air travel industry and prompted mass layoffs at Boeing. With the 737 Max cleared for takeoff in 2021 investor interest in Boeing has been resuscitated. As of the evening of Dec. 14 Boeing stock was at $229.15.

5. L.L. Bean

L.L. Bean the retail giant famed for its no-nonsense winter wear with a cozy twist and its hefty mail-order catalogs launched in 1912 under the helm of Leon Leonwood Bean. Originally the brand focused on hunting shoes but grew over the decades to include other apparel for outdoorsy types. After all this time L.L. Bean is still privately held. As of 2018 it employed 5200 people yearly and garnered $1.6 billion in annual sales. 2020 hasn’t been too shabby either. As consumers turned to the great outdoors for solace and connection during the pandemic L.L. Bean saw sales in the winter sports category up 165% snow tube up 114% and snowshoes up 340%.

6. Harley-Davidson

Founded in 1903 Harley-Davidson is the oldest motorcycle brand in America. Harley-Davidson has as strong a brand heritage as they come and has honed an image that is practically synonymous with leather jacket-clad machismo but the company has been struggling of late as it fails to lure younger generations. The average Harley-Davidson stock price in 2020 is $28.26; its all-time high back in November 2006 was $75.50.

7. Kraft Foods

Founded in 1903 by James L. Kraft Kraft Foods started as a cheese delivery service catering to the Chicago area. Soon after James and his brother Charles Kraft patented a spoil-proof processed cheese that became a big hit with the U.S. Army during World War I. As a brand Kraft has been moved around within various mega-corporations. In 1988 the tobacco giant Philip Morris scooped up Kraft integrating it into its other food businesses Nabisco and General Foods. Philip Morris eventually changed its name to Altria Group and Kraft split into two brands: one serving North America as Kraft the other with a focus on international snacks as Mondelēz International. In 2015 Heinz acquired Kraft.

Kraft Heinz stock wasn’t looking too hot in late 2019 when 3G Capital tossed 25 million shares to drop its stake in the company to around 20% but the pandemic turned all that around. Consumers have been buying more shelf-stable and packaged goods showing rejuvenated interest in Kraft. At the end of October 2020 Kraft announced that it had beat its third-quarter earnings forecast with quarterly sales up 6% to $6.44 billion.

It all started with a bowl of corn flakes back in 1894 and then the formal founding of the company Kellogg’s in 1900. Previously known as The Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company Kellogg’s took on its new and lasting name in 1922 once it expanded into making other cereals. Kellogg’s has continued to innovate over the years and now owns a number of major food brands such as MorningStar and NutriGrain.

Like Kraft Kellogg’s has enjoyed a boom in sales as people are forced to stay at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Kellogg’s fourth-quarter 2020 organic sales surged 4.5%.

The consumer credit reporting giant Equifax was founded in 1899 under the name Retail Credit Company. The credit bureau grew to become one of the largest in the U.S. by the mid-1900s. Perhaps best known for the 2017 data breach that compromised the personal information of 147 million people Equifax is one of those companies that thanks to its crucial role in modern finance can survive even the worst of scandals. Despite the public shaming and costly legal fees Equifax’s data breach didn’t put the company out of business but it did set the company back by about $1.4 billion.

As of mid-December 2020 Equifax stock was popular in hedge fund portfolios trading at $193.58 on Dec. 15.

The South African leader previously held the same position at Coca Cola SABCO in Kenya for almost 12 years. He has been leading Coca Cola’s business in Ethiopia since May 2019 overseeing the 300 million dollars expansion project of the company. The Reporter’s Samson Berhane spoke to him about a range of issues that include the expansion projects they are undertaking in different parts of the country shortage of foreign currency its impact on activities and the current status of the company.

The Reporter: Can you please walk us through the current status of the company that you are managing in terms of production capacity and annual revenue as well as the taxes that you have been paying?

We have been here for almost 60 years. We have a long history of doing business very successfully in Ethiopia. We have been one of the top taxpayers in the country; the recent recognition by the government shows how big we are. Not a common knowledge but we have now Ambo facility East African Bottling and Ambo is now owned by the Coca-Cola Beverages Africa.

Coca Cola has been undertaking various expansion projects in Ethiopia. How do you explain the progress in this regard and what are you planning to achieve?

Currently we own facilities in different parts of the country including Addis Ababa Dire Dawa and Bahir Dar. We have been effectively expanding in Bahir Dar. With the expansion the size of the population and the opportunities there the company recognizes this is the right place to achieve our investment plan.We also started the Sebeta Project a year and half ago where about 90 percent of the construction is now completed and it is going to be a very big factory having seven production lines. What makes the Sebeta Project unique is that for the first time we will start preform manufacturing line the first process required to manufacture PET bottles. We used to import preform from Kenya and other countries. So the Sebeta Project once it completed will enable us produce our preform.

Other than Sebeta Hawassa will be our next stop. We are ready to start construction of another facility in Hawassa towards the end of the year. We will invest 300 million dollars in the next three or four years for the expansion of projects. We are also going to have two more new lines taking into the growing middle-income groups in Ethiopia where there is a potential market for us. It has a GDP that was growing impressively for over a decade except for last year due to the worldwide issue of the Coronavirus. We are so optimistic about Ethiopia and its potential for economic growth.

A decision to invest 300 million dollars for expansion projects requires some sort of feasibility study and market assessment. In this regard I presume you have conducted such assessments. Could you please discuss about your findings in relation to it?

Obviously when a company invests millions of dollar it conducts an assessment first. So we have been doing our homework for years in order to make the right decision. We look into growth in consumption and population. And of course we take in to consideration the GDP forecast made by government agencies. Consumption of products of Coca Cola is still very low in Ethiopia where its per capita consumption is the lowest amongst sub-Saharan African countries. There is a growth in demand for our products; so there are economic reasons to invest our resources in Ethiopia.

There was controversy over the merger of your company with the bottler of Ambo Mineral Water. Please reflect on this?

It goes back to three and half years ago. There were a number of entities that come together. SAB Miller owned Ambo Mineral at first while SABCO has been a major shareholder of East African Bottling. The two companies have merged and become a major shareholder of Coca Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA). It took three years to go through the process because there was a legal issue which is now settled. We are now in a very comfortable position. We are now starting to work with Ambo. They got a very amazing product which is very popular in Ethiopia with a rich heritage.

So Ambo and your company are now under the same management?

It is two separate companies having their own management each. But we have a plan to work together in distribution and marketing our products. Before the court cases were settled we were not able to do so; however now we are planning to do these together.

Given the size of the expansion projects that your company is engaged in is there any plan to export your products to neighboring countries like Eritrea where there is low production of your product?

In Coca Cola Company we usually look after the country that we are based in. This is because there are factories that produce our products in other countries. In this case there are factories in Djibouti Kenya and Eritrea among others. But we see a great perspective of export in case of Ambo Mineral Water. Everybody that comes to Ethiopia loves Ambo. We might change the bottle and export it abroad.

Coca Cola has many products in Europe and the US. But you have launched very few of them in Ethiopia. Is that because of lack of demand to other products produced by your company elsewhere?

There are over many brands of Coca Cola across the world. The reason is simple. It is because of our limited capacity. Once the factory at Sebeta is completed we are going to see many new products. We are doing some researches. But surely we are going to launch new brands very soon. Consumers are hungry for new products; so it is up to us to manufacture the right products. We want to give them more options. Novida which we have started to produce recently is a great success Predator the energy drink that is being produced by Coca Cola received a great acceptance already.

Let’s talk about the impacts of COVID-19 on your business activities. Reportedly there was an increase in consumption of soda products in western countries after the pandemic since people were staying at home. What have you experienced because of the virus?

We were badly affected by this global pandemic. Since one of our major channels is eating and drinking accounting for more than 60 percent of our sales we lost a big opportunity when restaurants and hotels closed. We lost between 15 to 20 percent of our volume due to the virus and the political instability in the country. We have been slowly recovering in recent months. Even as we speak it is not at the level it should be. Probably this year we may reach a number that is acceptable from sales perspective.

How badly were you impacted by the political instability which has rocked different parts of the country since 2016 and the war in Tigray region?

The last year has been very challenging partly because of the political unrest. But the biggest impact is in Tigray Region. About 22 percent of our annual volume comes from this region. We have lost this overnight. We still don’t have it. We are very sad to see such a situation and hoping to get to normalcy very soon which is very important to Ethiopia and our business. We are also working on how we can support the community when things get back to normal.

We will support the reestablishment of businesses in Tigray. We don’t have any physical property there. But not sure if our distributors have been impacted or not. We don’t know their current status mainly due to the communications constraints in the region.

How does the foreign currency shortage affect your business activity? And what are the measures taken to mitigate the difficulty from your side?

The foreign exchange shortage is obviously our biggest challenge. It is even worse when you got an expansion plan. We are really struggling to get foreign exchange. In the history of our company there were days when we stopped production because of foreign currency shortage that we need to import inputs. We are now trying our best to export anything that we can in order to get foreign exchange like Ambo. A small amount of foreign exchange we get from export could ease the burden for us. We could even hold our expansion plan because of the foreign exchange shortage. That is how bad it is.

So you are undertaking the expansion projects using what you have earned here in Birr. Any plan to get foreign exchange from your partners’ abroad?

We operate as a country and are expected to be self-sufficient. We ask the dollar from banks and the government. For instance this year although we need 100 million dollars for our expansion project what we have secured so far is just eight million dollars. We got a huge deficit. All these expansion projects if we were able to get the foreign exchange could have employed many individuals and created more job opportunities.

Can we say the difficulty of repatriating your profit is the pushing factor behind your expansion projects?

I don’t think that applies to our company. Of course we have not been able to repatriate our profit for 10 years; however our shareholders understand the situation in the country. It is based on understanding of the market opportunity in Ethiopia that we are undertaking the expansion projects.

You don’t have local shareholders in Ethiopia?

We have. But we pay the share in Birr. So that is easy for us.

What happened to your plan of acquiring a new sugar plant in Ethiopia?

We expressed our interest one and half years ago. The government has been I think undertaking different reforms to auction the sugar plants. Recently we had a meeting with the Ministry of Finance to discuss the matter. We have explained our big interest to acquire a sugar plant. Sugar is one of our key raw materials and so manufacturing it locally would be a great advantage for our company. We get 60 to 70 percent of our sugar locally and we import the rest.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZGludG90by5jb20vYnVkZHktYnJvd24td29rZS1jb2tlLWxlc3Mtd2hpdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buddy Brown Shreds Woke Coke Draws Massive YouTube Crowd,"Reddit Email Share 18 Shares

Indie artists are showing corporate America they don’t need them anymore.

Think Ryan Long Tim Dillon Tom MacDonald Tim Pool and other entrepreneurs carving out successful careers without the usual distribution channels.

Buddy Brown was ahead of this particular curve. Make that miles ahead.

He discovered the power of viral videos all the way back in 2009 strumming a song while sitting on the back of his pickup truck … like this:

USA Today profiled the country singer in 2016 noting how his stripped-down style drew a sizable crowd. Chances are USA Today along with the other media outlets won’t be serving up favorable profiles of him now.

Why?

Brown is tackling Cancel Culture head on and in the process drawing even more eyeballs to his YouTube channel. Consider recent Brown videos with titles like:

“Socialism is like HEMORRHOIDS”

“PRIVILEGE”

“Don’t ever APOLOGIZE for being a MAN”

“The OFFENDED Song”

His recent track “We Gotta Be Less White” mocks Coca-Cola’s leaked pamphlet telling employees why being white is the wrong way to go.

Coca-Cola is facing backlash after being accused of fostering an anti-white agenda in their online “anti-racism” training for employees with some training materials that instruct participants to “try to be less white.” After blowback the company has issued a statement denying that the materials are part of its learning curriculum.

That “woke a cola” song released Feb. 23 on YouTube already has a whopping 3.8 million views – with no help from traditional media outlets.

Here are some sample lyrics.

Coca-Cola’s done lost their dadgum minds

Yeah the white guilt’s hittin’ pretty hard this time

I thought I’d seen it all

But as it turns out

I have to change my skin

To live this one down

While I try to be less white be less white

‘Cause liberals gone wild and they lost their minds

We’ve gotta be less white be less white

Now I’m switching to Pepsi

And it’s all alright

He opens the track with a call for inclusion along with a note saying how “ridiculous” woke culture is becoming.

“We need to be less stupid” Brown says with a smile.

On the NFL chess board the quarterback is king. Always has been. Stable upright protected at all costs. Topple the king only when the game is lost. Then prop him up to start again.

Quarterbacks are on the move like never before in the NFL a dizzying offseason carousel that has already spit out new homes for Jared Goff Matthew Stafford and Carson Wentz. Still it promises more.

After what Tom Brady did in Tampa Bay winning a Super Bowl as a first-year free agent doing it alongside weapons he helped bring to Florida there is a whole new level of envy gripping the league. Teams can’t land the man himself — the 43-year-old ageless wonder has no peer — but they can follow the formula he laid out down South.

Even more interesting is the impact Brady’s success is having on the quarterbacks themselves. They want freedom.

“Clearly what you are seeing in the NFL and there are shades of the NBA is there’s a player empowerment movement going on here” said Damien Woody the two-time Super Bowl-winning former Patriot who works currently as an ESPN analyst.

“Some of these guys are saying ‘Wait a minute why am I letting a team dictate what my legacy is going to be?’ There’s always been the paradigm of ownership and players where ownership had all the control and players dealt with it. That paradigm is starting to shift. Given the quarterback position is the most important in sports this is the first time we see it in the National Football League. These guys are saying ‘I’m not just going to stand by with the status quo and let you guys stand by and dictate my legacy.’ ”

Make no mistake: The shift is seismic. That’s the NFL’s new buzzword.

When Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill told SiriusXM NFL Radio recently “I think there is going to be a seismic shift in talent across the NFL” he was speaking most specifically to his team’s signing of perennial Pro Bowler J.J. Watt another Houston emigre who’d had enough of the Texans’ unique brand of dysfunction.

But he spoke to the bigger picture where franchises are less bound by quarterback cap numbers that used to be too high to swallow where fans are as inclined to root for an individual player over the particular jersey he wears where the type of loyalty that used to bind these sides together has been replaced by something far more flexible.

And thus does the NFL offseason already a smorgasbord of can’t-look-away events add one more morsel of deliciousness.

“I have this vision in my head of Roger Goodell sitting in his Park Avenue office rubbing his hands together saying ‘Yes give me more of this!’ ” Woody said. “At the end of the day the NFL is entertainment. What could be more entertaining than all these franchise quarterback moves? We all saw Tom Brady who was obviously a free agent go to Tampa Bay and win a Super Bowl.

“The NFL is eating this up. The NBA has been about this for a long time — and yes that’s a player-driven league. But to see the NFL start to really embrace this and see these types of things happening it strengthens the NFL’s hold as the most popular league.”

The carousel will spin. Players want to move and teams need quarterbacks. The Patriots have a gaping hole under center and could be in the market for a veteran stopgap. The Saints may be replacing a retired Drew Brees and not content with Jameis Winston or Taysom Hill. The Bears could lose Mitchell Trubisky to free agency and might or might not be happy with Nick Foles. Washington released Alex Smith and who knows who starts for there next season? The Eagles jettisoned Wentz but could still draft over Jalen Hurts.

“We don’t know if all of these moves are going to be made or how many of them will” Woody said. “But thinking about the ones that were already made like Wentz [getting traded from Philadelphia to Indianapolis]. People said that his contract was immovable. Guess what? It got moved. Look at Stafford [swapped from the Lions to the Rams in exchange for Goff]. He was basically tired of Detroit said I’ve got to change and made it happen

“Think about it — Goff was in the Super Bowl a couple of years ago. People were talking about Wentz being the MVP a couple of years ago. I think we’re entering a new dawn a new era.”

Woody played in the last era and experienced its best and its worst. He won two titles protecting Brady’s pocket benefiting from the greatest run of quarterback stability the NFL has ever known. He later spent three seasons with the Jets whose level of dysfunction makes the Texans look brilliant playing in front of Brett Favre Mark Sanchez and Kellen Clemens. As those Jets now look to potentially move on from their latest franchise savior in Darnold it’s obvious how much the paradigm Woody spoke of has shifted.

“In this day and age part of it if you’re a young guy one of these high draft picks you don’t cost them as much as you used to before this past CBA” Woody said “so I think there’s a little more wiggle room now to offload these young QBs just draft capital and so on and so forth.

“I like it. I think it’s great for the National Football League. It brings more intrigue gives other franchises hope. Think about this — if you’re a New York Jets fan with all this draft capital those fans are excited because you have the opportunity to solve the one problem you haven’t solved since Joe Namath.”

Here’s Pirelli extending its F1 contract",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2hlYWx0aC9jb3ZpZC0xOS1yYXBpZC10ZXN0aW5nLTEuNTkxNzQ2OdIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS41OTE3NDY5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pilot programs reveal benefits and limitations of COVID-19 rapid testing,"Many businesses and schools across Canada are utilizing rapid COVID-19 tests and onsite testing technology to help catch asymptomatic cases and prevent spread of the virus.

On a recent weekday afternoon a fishing vessel called the Arctic Endurance prepared to depart from Mulgrave N.S. for a month-long clam harvesting trip. Blustery winds blew snow across the ship as it left the dock but at least on the pandemic front the coast was clear.

All 35 crew members had undergone testing for COVID-19 within the previous 24 hours and all their results were negative.

Their employer Clearwater Seafoods organized the tests. The company bought its highly accurate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing kits from Precision Biomonitoring last fall putting it among the early corporate adopters of mobile COVID-19 testing technology in Canada. The tests are like those used in health care settings but results come back in just a couple of hours.

Tony Jabbour vice-president of Fleet Operations admits it was a gamble.

""We're harvesters we're not lab technicians or medical professionals. And so getting a fairly complicated system purchase set up was a fairly big undertaking for us"" he said.

Onboard challenges related to physical distancing had compelled the company to put in place added COVID-19 precautions for its crews. Clearwater hasn't seen any outbreaks to date but Jabbour said asymptomatic transmission onboard a vessel would be ""catastrophic"" both on the business side and for employees.

""Throughout this I think we've been really cognizant of the fact that people are leaving home to go to sea"" he said. ""And making sure we take that extra level of precaution was certainly comforting.""

It's a notion that has enticed numerous Canadian businesses and institutions to begin pilot programs of their own for onsite COVID-19 testing. As Canadians await full access to vaccines and essential workplaces continue to guard against outbreaks the appeal of screening asymptomatic front-line staff is growing driven partly by wider availability of the technology in Canada.

At a busy Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacy in Mississauga employees without COVID-19 symptoms can get tested twice a week for the virus. Though many pharmacies are already equipped to offer PCR testing to members of the public who meet certain criteria this new employee-focused pilot uses rapid antigen tests. These are not currently as accurate as PCR but require a less invasive nasal swab and deliver results much faster.

""Results are being given to me within 15 minutes so you can't really beat that"" said Sabina Kapoor a pharmacist at the store who is participating in the trial program.

With a front-line job and two children at home Kapoor said she didn't hesitate when the store offered her regular screening for COVID-19 using rapid tests.

""It brings some sort of security and comfort I think when we go home to our families after a shift or working the full week. So I think everyone was pretty much on board for it"" she said.

Parent company Loblaw is currently offering rapid tests to employees at 20 of its pharmacy and retail locations in Ontario and Alberta. As part of the pilot staff at the company's Medisystem service which provides pharmaceutical services to seniors residences and care homes can also stop by participating stores to get tested.

If the program is deemed successful Loblaw said it plans to offer the rapid-testing service to other small and medium-sized businesses and their employees — in a sense outsourcing workplace COVID-19 testing.

According to Ashesh Desai the executive vice-president of Pharmacy and Healthcare at Shoppers Drug Mart employees of participating workplaces could get tested at their local Loblaw pharmacy in the near future.

""So if I'm grocery shopping [on] Sunday afternoon maybe there's an opportunity for me to book a screen at that time"" he said.

Desai added that the test results would go to the employer and as is currently done for those participating in the pilot anyone with a positive antigen test result would have to seek out a regular PCR test at a hospital or test centre for confirmation.

Rapid antigen testing cannot be used 'to rule out infection'

A negative test ""does not mean you can let down your guard"" said Desai. He added that Loblaw is working on messaging to convey that masks and social distancing are still ""extremely important"" even when a workplace is regularly using rapid tests.

University of Alberta infectious disease specialist Dr. Lynora Saxinger cautions that rapid antigen testing cannot be used ""to rule out infection.""

While research on the reliability of rapid tests is growing the current understanding is that people can rely on a positive test result but not on a negative one she added ""which kind of goes against human nature a little bit.""

""It's just an extra step"" said Antonella Picillo director of student services at Le Pensionnat du Saint-Nom-de-Marie in Montreal which is trying out the use of daily rapid testing on the school's asymptomatic students and teachers.

The private school has a now-familiar myriad of COVID-19 precautions in place from mandatory masks to class bubbles to ventilation upgrades. Rapid test screening is ""just one more way to make sure we have a handle on the situation"" Picillo said.

Le Pensionnat du Saint-Nom-de-Marie in Montreal is pilot-testing daily rapid tests for the school's students and teachers. (CBC)

The idea was proposed by Dr. Caroline Quach a pediatric infectious diseases consultant at Montreal's Sainte-Justine Hospital as well as a parent at the school.

""I think that in a classroom when you have a [coronavirus] case and you screen the students around them you might be able to find secondary transmission right away"" Dr. Quach said.

The goal of the pilot program is to research how well random daily rapid testing can do that in a school setting. But the limitations of widespread rapid testing are also becoming clearer.

""I'm not convinced that using these rapid tests on a larger scale to screen everybody walking into the school without symptoms is actually a good use of resources"" Dr. Quach said.

One of the main reasons she explains is that administering and processing those tests is labour intensive.

It's one of the reasons there has been less widespread adoption of testing so far across the country. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada the federal government has delivered nearly 17 million rapid tests to the provinces but only a fraction of them are in use.

With resources across public health systems already strained Dr. Saxinger said ""there's limited bandwidth to expand things"" when it comes to rapid testing.

""A lot of places have been doing relatively limited pilot testing of these but haven't yet had the capacity to roll them out more broadly"" she said.

It's an issue the Province of Manitoba has been trying to tackle as it offers rapid testing for educators in the province. Teachers are getting access to rapid testing if they display COVID-19 symptoms with the idea being they'll get a potential positive result back faster.

Curtis Aab acting chair of the life sciences department at Red River College said proper handling and processing of testing samples is crucial. (Jaison Empson/CBC)

The province has partnered with Red River College to design a micro-credential program to train more people in the skills required to properly process rapid tests such as transferring liquids using a pipet tube.

""When you're doing the COVID-19 testing it's really important that that pipetting is done accurately and precisely to produce reliable trusted results"" said Curtis Aab acting chair of the life sciences department at Red River College.

However despite the issues around accuracy and administering rapid tests Dr. Saxinger said targeted use in controlled settings such as schools and places where people work face-to-face makes sense.

""I think there's a possibility that these can add a layer of safety when they're applied in a structured way to the right places"" she said.

The Cancer Institute (WIA) in Adyar on Friday commissioned new advanced equipment for performing serum immunofixation electrophoresis a non-invasive procedure that will help in confirming the diagnosis of multiple myeloma a cancer that forms in a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell.

The project to get the equipment for the institute worth around ₹29.63 lakh was funded by the Rotary Club of Madras Temple City with support from the Rotary Foundation Grant and donations from The Cognizant Foundation the Rotary Club of Tower Hamlets in London and the Rotary Club of Hills Kellyville in Australia.

Arivazhagan head of the department of Clinical Biochemistry said a report could be obtained within 24 hours through the equipment and would avoid the need for invasive procedures like bone marrow biopsy.

T.G. Sagar director (Emeritus) of the institute said it was another milestone for the institution. The new facility would not only speed up the diagnosis of multiple myeloma and other plasma cell disorders but also establish the Department of Molecular Oncology as a Centre of Excellence for multiple myeloma research and treatment.

S. Muthupalaniappan governor of Rotary District 3232 said the equipment was dedicated to the memory of V. Shanta former chairperson of the institute."

Designed to advance oral healthcare diagnostics therapeutics and preventive strategies from basic to translational research the CARE program targets the development of junior faculty by providing seed research funding to emerging leaders in academia.

Liu was awarded $30000 in support of a study titled “Oral Candida Infection in Infancy and Early Childhood Caries” selected based on innovation clinical significance originality and scientific quality.

Established to recognize a new generation of academic researchers the CARE program recipients are required to be in the first five years of their academic appointment.

Though Liu joined the full-time research faculty at Penn Dental Medicine in 2020 she has been conducting research at the school since 2014 when she joined Dr. Michel Koo’s lab as a postdoctoral researcher.

Liu is now working with the school’s Center for Clinical and Translational Research with Dr. Pat Corby as well as well Koo a professor in the Department of Orthodontics and Divisions of Pediatric Dentistry & Community Oral Health.

Also Liu was the inaugural recipient of the Colgate-Palmolive Pediatric Dentistry DScD Fellowship at Penn Dental Medicine in 2017 earning her DScD in 2019.

“Dr. Liu’s study into severe early childhood caries is significant and conceptually innovative” said Koo. “This work may lead to a new paradigm for the etiology and pathogenesis of this severe disease impacting children worldwide.”

Globally there are nearly 1.8 billion cases a year of early childhood caries (ECC) with severe ECC (S-ECC) particularly problematic as the disease problematic as the disease progresses rapidly to the cavitation stage (within six to 12 months in some cases) with painful and costly consequences for toddlers.

Liu’s CARE program proposal was based on a recent discovery that oral thrush in infancy is strongly associated with ECC detection by pediatricians especially at younger ages.

“Early intervention is crucial. Discovering S-ECC risk factors can allow pediatricians to identify high-risk patients who can then be referred to dentists for early prevention measures” said Liu.

“Our previous studies show a synergistic contribution of Candida albicans in forming highly pathogenic biofilms leading to rampant caries” said Liu.

“This proposed longitudinal study will provide a much needed insight on whether Candida infection can alter the biofilm (plaque) microbiome and contribute with the aggressive onset of this costly pediatric disease” she said.

Liu was recognized for her research at the 2020 recipient of the IADR Women in Science Promising Talent Award as well.

HARRIS COUNTY Texas -- Seven utility workers were injured in a massive gas fire near Klein Texas just outside of Houston on Friday.

It happened in the 18700-block of Gleannloch Lakes Boulevard around 6 p.m.

Comcast crews were in the area working when they punctured a gas line according to the Harris County Fire Marshal's Office.

CenterPoint Energy crews were then sent to fix the line. As they were leaving crews hit what was described as a 6-inch high pressure natural gas line which is considered a main line.

Authorities say they hit what was described as a 6-inch high pressure natural gas line.

Six workers were taken to hospitals for evaluation and treatment according to CenterPoint Energy. One of those workers was transported via Life Flight.

That victim was in critical condition according to authorities.

They’ve been replaced by dealerships selling some of the hottest vehicles in the market: used cars and trucks. According to a December Automotive News article Americans buy more than twice as many used vehicles as new ones each year and the markup is higher too.

Family Deal Direct operated by the LaFontaine Automotive Group took the glass-box showroom on Jackson Rd. that was originally MINI of Ann Arbor and briefly a used-car buying center for the Germain Automotive Group (Marketplace Changes Sept. 2020.) This is LaFontaine’s second used-car-centric store; the first Family Deal Direct opened in Fenton in January.

CARite replaces Suburban Fiat Alfa-Romeo on W. Stadium. It’s next door to the main post office and compared to most dealerships it’s postage-stamp size. But CARite CEO Jeff Bartlett says that was part of the appeal.

“We liked the cozy neighborhood” he says. “We liked the idea of being in Ann Arbor. We like to get ourselves into areas where we believe we will be successful in the used-car market.”

Founded in 2011 and based in Madison Heights CARite now operates in eight states selling late-model used cars with in-house financing “regardless of credit history.” This one is managed by Jon Houston who went to Ypsi High WCC and Concordia University. His wife Amanda teaches at Bach Elementary which their son Grant attends; daughter Maddie is at Slauson. He says he was attracted to the company’s low-key sales approach. Its “guides” are on a salary so there’s no pressure to earn commissions. The company sets the no-haggle prices.

“We are reinventing what it means to buy a car” Houston says. “No one’s going to harass you; there won’t be any annoying emails or phone calls or texts. The only pressure is truly at the snack bar”–where he says customers are urged to take home a selection of packaged snacks.

Through CARite’s dealership development program he should be eligible to buy the Ann Arbor franchise in five years. “There are lots of stigmas in this industry and I feel like I want to take them all down single-handedly” he says.

They’re making a point of offering fuel-efficient vehicles in Ann Arbor including a recent flock of Chevrolet Bolts from California. Houston says he hopes to bring in some used Teslas this summer. But the SUV and truck buyers who dominate the market aren’t entirely neglected: in February he had a 2018 Lexus RX 350 and a 2018 Ford F-150 SuperCrew on hand.

Many of the vehicles CARite sells were previously leased but Houston says he also has an unusual college-town source of used vehicles: international students heading back to European countries and China.

In-person shopping is currently by appointment only. “It’s been a unique experience to open a dealership in the middle of a pandemic” Houston says. But “we’re not going anywhere. I hope to be on Stadium years from now.”

The clock is ticking.”

In a statement released Saturday night Time’s Up president and CEO Tina Tchen blasted the HFPA in a case of too little too late:

“So NBCUniversal Dick Clark Productions and the HFPA just declared that they have a plan to fix problems they’ve ignored for decades. We’re not so sure. On behalf of the many artists who look to us to hold the HFPA’s feet to the fire on the racism disrespect misogyny and alleged corrupt financial dealings of the Golden Globes we need to see specific details timetables for change and firm commitments. The right words are not enough. The clock is ticking.”

According to sources Time’s Up had a sit-down with executives form Golden Globes broadcaster NBC earlier this week over the controversy of the HFPA lacking Black members among its body.

The activist organization has been strongly suggesting to the Comcast-owned network that it use its influence over the HFPA in an attempt to open up the organization to a more diverse membership Deadline has learned.

PREVIOUSLY 6:49 P.M.: Nearly one week after the controversial 78th annual Golden Globe Awards the Hollywood Foreign Press Association tonight offered more details about its plans to be more inclusive and finally include Black members among their ranks.

“Hiring an independent expert in organizational diversity equity and inclusion to advise and guide us. Among other important tasks this expert will audit our bylaws and membership requirements to help us guard against any exclusionary practices and achieve a more diverse membership” the HFPA wrote in a statement posted on all of its social media platforms.

In addition to hiring an “independent expert” and outlining outreach plans the HFPA added that it in typical Hollywood corporate fashion will also hire a third-party law firm to “review the HFPA polices to ensure we are aligned with and exceed industry best practices in critical areas.” In working with the law firm the HFPA seeks to implement “a robust process” where any members can report violations of ethical standards or code of conduct with the “confidence that it will be fully and fairly investigated.”

The HFPA’s latest announcement comes nearly a week after its 78th annual Golden Globes where the organization’s controversy and lack of diversity took center stage. Just days before the annual awards ceremony Time’s Up and a number of Hollywood figures ranging from Ellen Pompeo to Ava DuVernay criticized the HFPA after a Los Angeles Times exposé revealed that the industry entity had zero Black journalists among its 87 current members.

During last week’s ceremony HFPA members took the stage to briefly address the controversy solely noting that “Black representation is vital” and that they’re working to make diverse member ship “the norm.” After the show Time’s Up doubled up on its HFPA criticism in an open letter dubbing the body’s proposed diversification goals “cosmetic.”

“We at Time’s Up stand ready to work for real change. The Globes are no longer golden. It’s time to act” the letter read.

The Critics Choice Association and the Television Academy have since touted their diverse membership and nominees and in-depth D&I efforts respectively.

“These are the initial steps we will take over the next 60 days and we will carry out further action based on the recommendations that come from these initial reviews and assessments” the statement continued. “We are committed to achieving these objectives in order to increase transparency in our organization and build a more inclusive community.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vcm9sbGluZ291dC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8wNy9yYXNoYWQtcmljaGV5LWpvaW5zLXR5dC1uZXR3b3JrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rashad Richey Joins The TYT Network With 17 Million Viewers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://rollingout.com/2021/03/07/rashad-richey-joins-tyt-network/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vcm9sbGluZ291dC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8wNy9yYXNoYWQtcmljaGV5LWpvaW5zLXR5dC1uZXR3b3JrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

If approved the building would top out at 350 feet tall not including mechanical bulkheads. The structure would span over 757400 square feet which includes office space retail and a 308-vehicle underground parking garage. The 2.65-acre development development would also provide 37233 square feet of waterfront public space along Wallabout Channel a narrow inlet that feeds into the East River.

Individual components include 593435 square feet of office space and 20476 square feet of retail. The underground parking garage would comprise 143520 square feet.

Before the development can break ground city agencies and community leaders will need to review and respond to current proposals which require major zoning amendments. This includes special waterfront zoning permits to ease maximum building height maximum base height setback distance requirements and the amount of allowable perimeter wall facing the shoreline. Additional zoning amendments are needed to facilitate the construction of the sub-grade parking garage.

500 Kent Avenue was formerly occupied by power generating plants from the late 19th to early 21st centuries. In 1959 Con Edison acquired the property from the City of New York and continued to operate the power plant until shuttering it in 1999 then demolished the plant buildings in 2009. Con Edison performed an environmental remediation on the land beneath the building in 2014 and the land has since remained undeveloped.

In 2019 JLL Capital Markets experts successfully sold the property on behalf of Con Edison for $50 million to the current owner Kent Member LLC. It is unclear which entity is represented by the anonymous LLC.

While the project will not immediately displace any residents a significant number of employees or any public facilities The Department of City planning has found that the project would still have a significant adverse impact on the surrounding environment. Those details were shared in a lengthy Environmental Assessment Statement dated February 17 2021.

The basis of those findings could be related to the legacy of the development site which was historically used by heavy manufacturing and industrial industries. Despite Con Edison’s environmental remediation efforts it is possible that the on-site soil contains hazardous materials or contaminants that could leech even further into Wallabout Channel.

To determine these variables the developer will need to submit an Environmental Impact Statement for further public review. If all goes well the developer anticipates completion by 2024.

Fortunately for me the museum is exactly 99 miles away from campus so I could go without exiting the 100 mile travel radius allowed by the school.

From the outside the museum is both striking and unassuming. A white box with straight corners faces rows of nearly identical houses reminiscent of the drawings of houses I made in kindergarten. The museum is the image of modern architecture with clean lines large negative spaces and huge windows. You enter through glass doors and after undergoing a temperature check and picking up your timed tickets you finally enter the contemporary art exhibit.

This part of the museum was fantastic and likely would have been enjoyable even to those who don’t particularly enjoy contemporary art. White walls carve the space up fluidly with gentle curves and skylights allow the sun to illuminate the glass on display. A bowl of fruit each one bigger than my (admittedly large) head rests on the ground. Freeform winding flowing pieces of glass combine at just the right angle to suggest a shape. Many of the exhibits play with light changing color from different angles or creating the effect of a foggy morning. A particular highlight: Nocturne 5 by Karen LaMonte a piece featuring a life size black dress which felt almost like it was really made of fabric wrapped around a turning figure.

Just off of this area was the demonstration room. Here two women worked in tandem to blow a glass vase in only a few minutes. It was remarkable how practiced their movements were individually and as a team. With only a handful of maneuvers a lump of molten glass became beautiful glasswork.

Next a bridge carried me to a section that seemed like it was designed to give further demonstrations of the modern history and processes of glassmaking. Unfortunately this section was largely closed down as many of the demonstrations and interactive exhibits couldn’t be operated safely during COVID-19.

The largest exhibit was the best. Starting with ancient Egypt the exhibit is a circular tunnel that takes you through the history of glassmaking. First simple perfume bottles then mosaics and eventually masterful works of Rome. You leave Italy to travel the world seeing works from a variety of cultures before returning to the height of the Italian Renaissance with the works of Venetian glassmakers. The historical section of the museum does a wonderful job walking you through not just the development of the craft of glassworking but also the ways that craft reflects cultural and political trends.

After the Renaissance you begin to see more and more contemporary work. More modern Finnish artists Steuben glass the history of industrial glassmaking and more. They start to blend together as the modern world allows for advancements and creativity abounds.

A museum of glass certainly isn’t for everyone. If you aren’t particularly interested in the glass itself but you do enjoy museum architecture history or contemporary art then the Corning Museum of Glass is a great place to see all three. If any of this sounds appealing to you and you don’t mind driving an hour and a half it’s certainly worth a day trip.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1sZWFkZXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8wMy8wNi9maXJlLWRhbWFnZXMtY29ybmluZy1ob3VzZS13ZXN0LWhhemVsLXN0cmVldC80NjEzNTk2MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One dead in West Hazel Street house fire in Corning,"CORNING - One person died in a house fire on West Hazel Street on Saturday afternoon officials said Sunday.

The two refrigerators and the two freezers are a unique addition to the pantry allowing fresh food to be available. This new space for the pantry is a major upgrade from the very small closet-like space they had before.

""Not only with food insecurities becomes preparedness for getting jobs and interviewing skills and so we've added this shelving area over here where we're taking donations for all kinds of clothing items. Particularly dress clothes where they can go and get an interview outfit or if they have a class presentation. And there's casual clothing here too for anyone that's in need of some extra clothing"" said Stacy Johnson CCC assistant dean of Student Services.

Here's what we know about this BTS rapper and songwriter RM who is also the leader of this K-pop group.

He’s the leader of BTS but he’s also a rapper and songwriter. As a virgo some fans think RM’s zodiac sign helps explain his creativity and hard-working side. Here’s what we know about this performer.

RM from BTS’ Zodiac Sign is Virgo

He’s the artist behind songs like “Intro: Persona” and “Trivia: Love.” He’s also one of the members who appears on chart-topping songs like “Dynamite” and “Life Goes On.” RM real name Kim Namjoon is one of the rappers in BTS.

Since BTS debuted over seven years ago fans shared their love for this member by celebrating his birthday nicknaming the day “Namjoon Day.” Born on Sept. 12 1994 this rapper’s sun sign is Virgo.

RM is the leader of BTS

He’s a rapper and a dancer in this boy band but RM is also the leader and unofficial translator for BTS. When they spend time overseas it’s RM who often answers interview questions regarding their music.

Part of the reason why RM is such a good leader for this K-pop group could be his birth chart and sun sign. Virgos aside from being creative and reliable are known for being hard-working and organized according to CoStar.

These traits come in handy while acting as the spokesperson for the K-pop group and even when he was a student in high school scoring in the top 1% of his class. Other celebrity Virgos include Beyoncé Zendaya and BTS’ own Jungkook the youngest member of the group.

RM is also one of the songwriters in BTS

Along with the other members RM functions as one of the songwriters and producers in this K-pop group. RM Suga and J-Hope co-wrote the group’s chart topping Be (Deluxe Edition) title track “Life Goes On.”

According to Genius RM also wrote the lyrics for “The Truth Untold” “Intro: Singularity” “Outro: Tear” and “Airplane Pt. 2.” Outside of BTS however RM also releases solo music under the same stage name. He also collaborated with Lil Nas X for a remix of “Old Town Road.”

“For us it will always be important to keep working hard dancing better writing better songs touring and setting an example” RM said during a 2017 interview with Time. “A lot of people say this but it’s really true for us: we are living a dream all seven of us being able to pursue what we love. We strive to [put] everything into our music.”

The “Dynamite” music video is now available on YouTube. Music by BTS including their recently released album Map of the Soul: 7 is available for streaming on Spotify Apple Music and most major platforms.",,,,,,,,,

SAN DIEGO — On Saturday the grassroots group “Save our Community Now” protested at the intersection of Carmel Valley Road and Camino Del Sur where the Camino Del Sur Marketplace would be built.

The Poway Unified School District owns the vacant land and in September the board voted to consider leasing the 27-acres to Costco. “The entire process was not transparent. We didn't have a voice in the matter” said Gianni Nguyen.

Parents say they are worried about traffic. “There's been over thirty-two recorded accidents and several deaths in the past five years including one that was only a few months ago” said Lucy Beard.

Poway Unified says it’s facing a deficit and rather than putting in a middle school as planned it families it would lease the land to Costco over 40 years.

Families question why they are paying high Mello-Roos taxes for a Costco and say a school is needed. “We’re actually orphans when it comes to a school a middle school” said Nguyen.

Protect Our Community Now has gained 3700 signatures to petition against the plan. It also filed a lawsuit claiming state law meeting violations and has environmental concerns where a 32-pump gas station is planned.

“The original master plan has talked about beautiful open areas the Black Mountain Preserve the hot air balloons the children all the great schools and districts” said Beard.

After outcry the district scheduled two virtual community meetings on alternatives to leasing the district-owned land to Costco. One was scheduled for March 1 and the next one is March 18.

Reading in the backyard having a picnic in a park heading to the beach camping porch-front yoga… we’re up for all of it — just get us outside stat. And in anticipation of afternoons spent at the park we’re planning on picking us this latest find from Costco: Novaform’s reversible memory foam roll-out loungers. They’re the comfortable mats we need in our lives ASAP.

The popular Instagram account @costcosisters shared the find with their followers writing “This @novaformcomfort memory foam roller looks perfect for those park days!🌳 Lay it out and soak up some of the sun!☀️”

We wanna soak up all of the sun on these comfy colorful mats. We have a feeling they’ll become a staple in our households during the summer months especially for outdoor date-night. Why sit on the grass or on a plain old blanket when you can lounge on a twin-size 2-inch thick memory foam mattress? The colorful covers are durable and machine washable so they’re outdoor-friendly; they’re also easy to carry as they roll up and come with a convenient shoulder strap.

Beyond the park we’re already imagining using these mats to make camping trips more comfortable — not to mention the convenience of having an extra mattress for overnight guests (someday kid-sleepovers will happen again!)

At $60 a mat these are totally worth it getting a Costco membership if you don’t already have one!

But this Cobra—CSX 4600—is no ordinary replica. It features hand-polished bare metal bronze bodywork complete with brushed racing stripes. It's currently up for sale through RM Sotheby's with a $475000 asking price.

The bronze Cobra is the work of Utah-based Kirkham Motorsports. The company has sold Cobra replicas with bodies built at a former aircraft factory in Poland since 1994 a partnership that began when founder David Kirkham has called in to help repair the nose cone of a recently imported fighter jet.

Kirkham bodies are typically aluminum but the company occasionally tries out other materials. In addition to the bronze CSX 4600 it built at least one car with copper bodywork according to the listing.

While this car isn't an original Cobra it does get a ""CSX"" serial number indicating that it is recognized as an authentic Cobra replica by Shelby American. The company has given its blessing—and serial numbers—to a handful of replica builders over the years and builds its own replicas. That makes modern CSX-numbered cars similar to the ""continuation cars"" built by automakers like Jaguar Aston Martin and Bentley as they're officially considered to be a continuation of the original production run.

1965 Shelby 427 S/C Cobra

CSX 4600 is modeled on a 1965 427 S/C Cobra. ""S/C"" stood for ""semi competition"" and denoted a handful of big-block Cobras that were originally built as race cars but then converted for street use after Shelby failed to get the 427 Cobra homologated for the 1965 racing season.

Under the bronze hood sits a ""427 FE"" V-8 built by the Carroll Shelby Engine Company bored and stroked to 511 cubic inches and featuring fuel injection with eight 58-millimeter Borla Induction throttle bodies. The engine makes 650 hp and 670 lb-ft of torque which is channeled to the rear wheels through a 5-speed manual transmission.

The asking price may be high but it's a bargain compared to the millions original Cobras tend to fetch at auction. For example a 1965 427 Cobra owned by Carroll Shelby sold for $5.94 million at a Mecum Auctions sale earlier this year.

Alternatively you can have a Cobra replica that departs from the original design. The Superformance MKIII R sports a handful of modern updates and the company is even planning an electric Cobra.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvY2Fycm9sbC1zaGVsYnktcy0xOTY1LWRheXRvbmEtY291cGUtaXMtcHJvYmFibHktd29ydGgtbWlsbGlvbnMtMTU3MjgzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carroll Shelby's 1965 Daytona Coupe Is Probably Worth Millions,CSX 2469 isn’t one of those cars though but it was built on a genuine roadster from the 1960s. Reconstructed into a Daytona in 1997 this blast from the past was commissioned owned and driven by Carroll Shelby But that’s not all. When it was a roadster chassis number CSX 2469 was driven by motorsport legends that include Phil Hill Derek Hill Derek Bell John Morton and Brian Redman. Offered by Worldwide Auctioneers with an Oregon title FIA paperwork and two documents from Carroll Shelby Enterprises the streamlined coupe was valued at $1.5 million in August 2000. Adjusted for inflation the original value converts to $2278560 today.A 289 engine is hiding under the hood but contrary to its name the motor doesn’t displace 289 cubic inches according to the Historic Vehicle Identity Form. The free-breathing V8 now has 4868 cubic centimeters or 297 cubic inches thanks to an increased bore and as opposed to Cobra and Daytona models from days long past this fellow is outfitted with electronic ignition.Finished in deep blue and white stripes this one-off commission is beautified by number 98 roundels on the doors hood and rear end. The Daytona Sports Exhaust system sponsor decals Goodyear rubber knock-off wheels and a spoiler-integrated third brake light pretty much sum up the exterior.Listed in the Shelby Registry CSX 2469 was never modified by the current owner.

They include a large piece of vacant land next to the First St. John United Church of Christ property between 2nd and Front streets and two pieces of land within about a mile of the new South Hamilton Crossing which carries Grand Boulevard over the CSX tracks.

All Aboard Ohio Executive Director Stu Nicholson said a stop in a city like Hamilton also would serve train riders in surrounding communities who want easier travel to places like Cincinnati Indianapolis Chicago Dayton Columbus and Cleveland.

Such stations also can be “all-purpose transportation centers” for regional transit buses.

Along Amtrak’s Capitol Corridor from San Jose to north of Sacramento Calif. and another privately run Brightline route from Orlando to Miami developers bought properties around stations before building offices shops and housing nearby.

“In simple terms what if you want to drop off your dry cleaning before you go to the train station or if you want to pick it up on the way home?” Nicholson said. “Or you want to grab a cup of coffee? But I’m also talking big projects too like hotels office space condominiums apartments things like that.”

Successful station in Emeryville Calif.

Emeryville Calif is a city of about 12000 that at least doubles in size during the day because the train station links commuters to new offices of high-tech firms and takes others to shopping areas. Emeryville is billed as Amtrak’s San Francisco stop even though it’s actually across the San Francisco Bay from there. Train riders transfer to a short bus to reach San Francisco.

“My city was over 90 percent redevelopment zones at one point” says Emeryville Mayor Dianne Martinez.

That means those areas were filled with blight and degraded buildings. When an Amtrak station on the Capitol route opened in 1994 built by Wareham Development it was California’s first new train station in 60 years.

Emeryville now a thriving community has the advantage of being located between Oakland and Berkeley with stylish new buildings around the train station which are occupied by high-tech firms.

Wareham has become “one of the premier landlords of the biotech space in this part of California” Martinez said.

Companies create alternative foods such as plant-based meat substitutes biofuels medical devices and alter DNA sequences.

“It really has brought up the value of all of the adjacent properties for a good radius around the station” Martinez said estimating about a quarter-mile.

Many decisions ahead

Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari said “station-location decisions — I can’t speak to the specifics here — are generally determined by the community coming to us and saying ‘Here’s where we want a stop.’ And then we go to the railroad who owns the tracks and it’s not us there and say ‘OK here’s where they’d like us to stop. Will this work?’”

Then Amtrak would help cities figure out what the costs would be “and help connect them with dollars to get that done.”

Any creation of the new routes and stops would depend on transportation or infrastructure legislation that has yet to go before Congress. Also Amtrak has not yet released an official plan of what it would do Magliari said. He emphasized it’s too early to know where stops might be.

“I would say Hamilton’s got as good a shot as any smaller community on the corridors” Nicholson said. “I don’t think it’s beyond the expectation that both Hamilton and Oxford could possibly be intermediate stops because I think what you’ll see is a mix of express and local service.”

“The best thing I can say is Amtrak will definitely be looking at intermediate stops in all of the corridors that it’s talking about” Nicholson said. “I think the good news is once these corridors get up and running — and it’s going to be a while before that happens — you will probably see an immediate increase in demand from people along the corridor that are wanting more service more frequent trains.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2NhcnJvbGwtc2hlbGJ5cy0xOTY1LWRheXRvbmEtY291cGUtaXMtZm9yLXNhbGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carroll Shelby's 1965 Daytona Coupe Is For Sale,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2NhcnJvbGwtc2hlbGJ5cy0xOTY1LWRheXRvbmEtY291cGUtaXMtZm9yLXNhbGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

WorldSkills International is celebrating IWD by highlighting its ongoing support for gender equality and the need for equal access by women to skills development. It’s against this background that young aspiring chef Jessica Cummins shares how she will #choosetochallenge gender inequality.

For Jessica Cummins indulging in a bowl of chow mein brings her back to the dawn of her passion for food. From her youth the rising star chef cultivated her budding skills in the kitchen alongside her grandmother whipping up everything from sweet breads and stews to her favourites Asian style chow mein and cheesecake.

Since then the second-year Culinary Arts student at the Barbados Community College’s Hospitality Institute has been blazing a trail of her own in the industry leading her to a gold medal win in Cooking at the WorldSkills Barbados (WSB) Competition last year and grabbing the Best Young Chef Ambassador and the Spirit of the Competition awards at the Young Chef Olympiad (YCO) 2021 in February.

The aspiring private chef and owner of ‘JC’s Perfect Treats’ says that putting smiles on her customers’ faces is at the heart of what keeps her cooking along with a need to show the world that women can do just as much in the kitchen as men.

“I would like to challenge the idea of there being more male executive chefs … or chefs in general because the females can do just as much as the males” Jessica says.

While men still make up the majority of those working in the culinary industry today Jessica sees this as a chance to outshine her competition and motivation to leave her mark on the world.

To become an award-winning chef didn’t come easy for Jessica. She says that it took weeks of gruelling preparation with her mentor and teacher Chef Tremaine Reece. Each week they practised recipes and timed her down to the last minute to perfect her winning dishes like her aubergine and tofu milfoy with a coconut curry sauce. But as Chef Reece says it’s her “raw talent and exceptional skills” shown throughout her school days that prepared her for this challenge.

Though Jessica says that she doubted herself at times her dedication to her craft and hard work led her to vanquishing the stiff competition at the YCO 2021 and ultimately becoming a better-rounded chef in the end. When asked what advice she would give to those following in her footsteps she says that lots of research practice and developing your skills can help you to showcase who you are on the plate and show those around you that you are capable of everything.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL3Nwb3J0L2dhYS9hcmlkLTQwMjM5NzA3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Danny Cummins the Galway footballer living in Australia: 'I'm delighted to be nowhere near it',"Greetings from Randwick Sydney where Danny Cummins remains 12 months after he and his girlfriend Karen Kennedy chose not to take one of the repatriation flights home to Ireland.

The Galway players had planned to return last September with Cummins hoping to convince Pádraic Joyce of his worth of inclusion for the 2021 campaign.

As the GAA season remains in the starting blocks the Claregalway man’s mind has already been made up for him. Lining out for Randwick’s Young Irelands in one of the handful of countries where GAA games can be played and living without severe restrictions suits him just fine.

“The phone call I had with Pádraic in 2019 he was very sound and understanding” recalls Cummins. “He said ‘Do what you have to do and give me a shout when you get back and we’ll see what the story is’.

“It was just supposed to be a year. Nobody could have foreseen what would came about after that. Galway had such a great start in the National League last year and I was staying up late to watch games and I was a little jealous not being involved. But the way the year worked out it became easier for me not to miss it.

“Every time I check Twitter there is something going on about the GAA back home; the GAA being an elite sport then not being an elite sport. It’s just so wishy-washy I’m delighted to be nowhere near it. It’s out of people’s control and if you were involved as a player you wouldn’t know if you were coming or going.”

Cummins and Kennedy a county camogie star spent four weeks in Vietnam in November 2019 before landing in Sydney just as Australia was experiencing some of its worst bushfires.

“We walked into a smaller pandemic of sorts. Then Christmas came and went and we were looking for work in January. We got that sorted accommodation too and then came March and Covid. Other couples we knew were coming to the end of their visas and as soon as Covid happened they just upped and left.

“The way we looked at it was our visas weren’t up until the end of the year we were both working and if it gets to dire straits we can always get on a plane and go but until then let’s stick it out. We’re thankful we did.”

With Coogee beach 20 minutes away and Royal Randwick racecourse nearby Cummins can’t complain. Along with former Meath goalkeeper Paddy O’Rourke he works for Antrim man Tommy Joe Johnston’s carpentry firm. Cummins and Kennedy were able to extend their visa doing the required three months of farm/regional work pursuing his horse-racing passion outside Scone the horse capital of Australia in the Hunter Region of New South Wales.

“I got chatting to a man called Fergal Connolly who is originally from Monivea Abbey who is over here a couple of years and he has his own Valiant Stud in New South Wales. He said he would love to take the two of us on. I told him I had no experience but I was mad interested and he said ‘don’t worry we’ll show you the way.’

“He’s a lady working with him as well called Ziva Mullins and she’s from Kinvara so when we moved up in July there were four Galway people working on this stud farm and they taught us so much things and it enlightened my interest and Karen loves animals as well. We stayed on for an extra month just to help out and give them a twist for looking after us so well. It’s more so the breeding that I have a huge interest in.

“I’ve been talking to people about what avenue I might get into when I get home because it’s a major interest. Our family has a farm and my dad is keeping that going with cattle and there is a bit of base there if I wanted to kick into something.”

For now it’s in the Sydney suburb of Ingleburn where the 30-year-old gets his kicks every weekend lining out with O’Rourke for Young Irelands in the NSW league.

Just the other week Sydney Swans and Tipperary footballer Colin O’Riordan turned up to take in the games.

“I’m trying to play a small bit of hurling as well. You head out to Ingleburn and you’ve a scatter of teams there. It’s a cool Irish community and afterwards you have a few beers. It’s a very enjoyable way of going about it.”"

In a recent announcement the pharmacy giant said it plans to put its latest strategies in place in March and April in conjunction with the YMCA.

“Throughout the pandemic the Y has worked to meet the needs of the 10000 communities we serve across the United States” Kevin Washington the president and CEO YMCA of the USA said in a statement.

“We are proud to team up with CVS Health as part of our efforts to help ensure everyone has equitable access to accurate information about the vaccines and to the vaccines themselves especially communities of color which have been disproportionately affected by the health and economic impacts of the virus” Washington added.

CVS Health has not yet disclosed where those mobile vaccination vans and participating YMCA facilities will be.

As part of its initiative CVS Health said it will engage in outreach activities that include text messages and emails to vulnerable communities in the coming weeks to address hesitancy and encourage vaccinations.

CVS Health also said it is partnering with Lyft to provide free or reduced-price rides to vaccine appointments in underserved communities.

The announcement came as Blacks continue to disproportionately fall behind whites nationwide in obtaining Pfizer and Moderna vaccinations. With Johnson & Johnson’s new one-shot inoculations underway there is concern that the vaccination gap between Blacks and white Americans will grow even wider.

CVS Health came under fire last month as State Representative La- Shawn Ford introduced legislation in the Illinois Assembly to ensure greater access to pharmacy services for Illinois Medicaid recipients.

As of December 1 2020 Aetna Better Health of Illinois (ABHIL) Medicaid recipients must use CVS pharmacies or a limited number of smaller independent pharmacies. Using Walgreens pharmacies is generally no longer an option for these recipients.

Much of the West and South sides of Chicago are pharmacy deserts with no CVS pharmacies in the majority Black West Side communities of Humboldt Park East Garfield Park West Garfield Park North Lawndale or Austin.

In Miami-Dade County in Florida Black leaders have called out CVS for having all its 67 stores in white and Hispanic neighborhoods.

The coronavirus has added to the urgency for more CVS Health pharmacies in Black neighborhoods in Chicago and other American cities.

CVS Health said it will also work to advance vaccine education in underserved communities to combat vaccine hesitancy.

“We are committed to reaching people of color and underserved communities to ensure health equity as we work to vaccinate all Americans” Karen S. Lynch the president and CEO of CVS Health said in a statement. “Our presence in communities across the country uniquely positions CVS Health to educate vulnerable populations and connect them with vaccine administration services.”

Almost half of the nearly 10000 CVS Health locations in the country are in communities ranked “high” or “very high” by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) according to CVS Health.

Currently CVS Health offers vaccinations at select locations in just 25 states. Most of those locations are fully booked and unavailable for more appointments according to a March 1 Crusader review of CVS Health vaccination store sites. Hawaii Rhode Island and South Carolina were the only states where CVS Health phar- macies had many openings for vaccination appointments.

A recent report said Black Americans are 2.3 times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to whites when age is factored in.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that Blacks and other minorities have borne the brunt of essential work roles during the pandemic. These roles have created a disproportionate number of minorities being infected with the virus than their white counterparts the CDC noted.

Meanwhile ABC News analysis shows that Black Americans have been vaccinated at rates significantly lower than white Americans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL2NhbGlmb3JuaWEvbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMvY3ZzLWV4cGFuZHMtY292aWQtdmFjY2luYXRpb24tc2l0ZXMtMjcyLWNhLWxvY2F0aW9uc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CVS Expands COVID Vaccination Sites To 272 CA Locations,"CALIFORNIA — The rollout of the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccination triggered an expansion of inoculation sites in the Golden State and there are still a number of CVS locations with appointments available this week .

Saturday Fortis MMA’s Nzechukwu (8-1 MMA 2-1 UFC) and City Kickboxing’s Ulberg (3-1 MMA 0-1 UFC) entered the cage during the UFC 259 preliminary card. Ultimately Nzechukwu’s hand was raised following a violent knockout at the 3:19 mark of Round 2 – but it was a hard-fought road to get the finish.

In the opening minute of the fight Ulberg rocked Nzechukwu with a high kick. Although he absorbed an onslaught of attack Nzechukwu survived. Back and forth the two fighters went. Nzechukwu found success with his sneaky left hand which he surprised Ulberg in on numerous occasions. Meanwhile Ulberg targeted Nzechukwu’s body. At times he wound up and landed full-force body blows on Nzechukwu who was covered up.

Fast-food workers in Los Angeles are facing unsafe conditions at work and outbreaks among staff at restaurants are threatening the area's ability to recover from the pandemic a new report says.

Fast-food workers in LA County are ""especially vulnerable"" to COVID-19 community transmission the report by UCLA and UC Berkeley found. They often face unmasked customers and unsafe workplaces the groups said.

Workers aren't protected when they speak up and some are even punished researchers wrote.

And the demographics of the fast-food industry means that women and minority workers have been hardest hit. The LA County fast-food industry has almost 150000 restaurant workers the vast majority of whom are women and workers of color the report conducted on behalf of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors said.

Staff say they weren't told when their coworkers were infected

In summer 2020 the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH) inspected more than 2000 restaurants and found that a third didn't follow physical distancing protocols while 44% didn't follow face mask regulations.

Fast-food restaurants in the county had at least 59 COVID-19 outbreaks between July and December 2020 affecting as many as 338 workers the UCLA and UC Berkeley researchers said citing data from the LACDPH.

In total around 15% of the county's documented coronavirus workplace outbreaks were at fast-food restaurants they said.

But workers often don't know how many COVID-19 cases have been linked to their workplace ""because employers do not disclose when employees test positive"" they wrote.

A McDonald's in Littlerock California has been linked to 32 COVID-19 cases the researchers said citing complaints to local authorities. Workers said they couldn't socially distance at the restaurant and that management tried to hide infections and pressure staff to work while sick.

""Even though there have been many cases of COVID-19 among coworkers at this McDonald's I have never been notified that I was in close contact with anyone"" one worker wrote in a complaint.

Workers went on strike multiple times to demand improved safety protocols but said they faced retaliation and had their hours cut per the complaints.

McDonald's operator Andrew Marroquin told Insider the restaurant had ""rigorous policies"" to protect staff and customers and would work with the LACDPH to comply with COVID-19 guidance.

""We are deeply disappointed in these inaccurate allegations which do not reflect what is actually happening in our restaurant"" Marroquin said.

When a COVID-19 case is confirmed in a restaurant the company immediately closes it to sanitize the restaurant and notify both local health authorities and other employees he said. The company supports staff with paid time-off during the entirety of their illness he added.

Staff also sanitize the restaurants on a nightly basis and sanitize and disinfect commonly-touched areas throughout the day Marroquin said. Staff are given gloves and masks and the company conducts wellness and temperature checks before each shift he said.

A worker at another LA fast-food restaurant said six people were sick with COVID-19 but the employer didn't share this information with staff according to another complaint cited in the report.

""We had a strike at the store and instead of listening to our concerns they terminated us"" the worker said.

In a survey by UC Berkeley's Food Labor Research Center 44% of food service workers said at least one of their coworkers had contracted the virus and 54% said they interacted with 10 or more unmasked people in one shift. More than a third said they weren't given mandatory training on COVID-19 safety protocols.

Fast-food workers were already vulnerable

""COVID-19 exacerbates the risks already faced by fast-food workers"" the UCLA and UC Berkeley researchers said.

LA County has around 9000 fast-food establishments with 150000 workers making up almost 4% of the county's total workforce they said.

Almost 70% of these workers are women and 90% are people of color with more than 70% Latinx the researchers said. People of color have been especially hard hit by the pandemic research shows.

In addition fast-food workers are more likely to be living in poverty. Fast-food workers nationally are twice as likely as other workers to fall below the federal poverty line and fast-food workers in LA County are one and half times more likely to be uninsured than the workforce as a whole the UCLA and UC Berkeley researchers said.

Fast-food workers are also three times more likely than the national average to get public transport to work and are also more likely to live in larger households the report said.

""This means that a worksite outbreak raises the risk for community spread in dense working-class areas of Los Angeles"" Tia Koonse legal and policy research manager at the UCLA Labor Center said.

“I grew up on a farm I was in FFA a little bit of 4-H” Schad said. “Agriculture has always been in my blood.” After graduating with an ag systems management degree at the University of Missouri Schad worked at a John Deere dealership before he started working for Missouri Corn in 2008. Many farmers in the state have livestock as well and Schad said he wants his work with Missouri Corn to help the broad agriculture sector. “What I’m looking forward to most is helping agriculture in general row crops and livestock” he said. “… I want to maximize the voice of how important agriculture is to the nation.”

He began working for Missouri Corn by specializing in ethanol and market development two areas he said will continue to be big priorities when he takes over as CEO. His interest in ethanol started when he was growing up. “I always enjoyed working on motors working with tractors tinkering in the shop” Schad said. He said some of his work with ethanol involved fighting for market access and “setting the record straight” on misconceptions about ethanol. A key task going forward will be to continue growing ethanol as an export product he said citing success in Mexico Japan and China. “We’re very excited about those opportunities and growing them” Schad said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9mcmVkZXJpY2tuZXdzcG9zdC9uYW1lL21pY2hhZWwtdmFuc2FudC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD03MDkxMTI40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michael VanSant Obituary (2021) - Mt.

The Azurit 9 precision seed drill allows tramlines to be created with very flexible spacings and rhythms thanks to its DeltaRow concept.

The Lemken tramline configurator is also now available to support convenient planning.

The configurator assists farmers in calculating tramlines as it determines how many rows need to be switched off where.

The Azurit unlike conventional precision seed drills uses the unique DeltaRow method in which each seed row consists of two staggered sub-rows 12.5cm apart.

If one of the twin rows is deactivated the distance between rows increases from 62.5cm to 75cm.

At the same time double the amount of seeds is placed in the other twin row so that the number of grains per square metre remains the same.

If the operator deactivates another twin row in the tramline on the other side of the track the tramline width is increased to 87.5cm. This distance allows farmers to work with wide tyres that protect the soil.

All this is planned with the tramline configurator which only needs the implement working width the track width and the distance of plants to the tyre edge to be entered.

Lemken said that the benefits for farmers are obvious such as all tracks are placed correctly; there is less risk of driving into tramlines incorrectly during crop care measures; crop and quality losses caused by passes are minimised; and ultimately the overall area output is increased."

Airbus' A220-300 is among the newest passenger aircraft in American skies and it just started flying passengers for Delta in November.

The pandemic masked the aircraft's arrival but Delta has already taken delivery of six planes that offer an impressive passenger experience with in-flight entertainment and mood lighting among them.

On the technical side the A220-300 boasts an impressive transcontinental range of around 3400 nautical miles and seats 130 passengers in Delta's configuration that includes a first class cabin. Fuel-efficient Pratt & Whitney engines also give Delta a fuel savings of around 20% when compared to similar aircraft.

Delta first began flying the smaller A220-100 in 2020 as part massive order for the aircraft that was threatened when Boeing opened a trade dispute against Canada's Bombardier the plane's original manufacturer. Airbus ultimately took over the program rebranding the aircraft as the A220 and the deal continued with Boeing later losing the dispute.

JetBlue Airways is the only other US airline to operate the Airbus A220-300 with plans to start passenger service in the spring between Boston and Fort Lauderdale. David Neeleman's new startup Breeze Airways also plans to use the aircraft as its flagship but won't take delivery of its first model until later this year.

But just because you're not earning or redeeming airline miles for flights right now doesn't mean you won't be back in the skies in the future. In the meantime you can continue racking up rewards by using an airline credit card for everyday purchases shopping through various airlines' online portals and other activities. When you're ready to board again here are 12 common mistakes to avoid when redeeming airline miles for flights.

1. Not Redeeming Miles Before They Expire

Due to the coronavirus pandemic most airlines suspended mileage expiration for 2020 and 2021. They could reinstitute it next year though so it's important to check the expiration dates on your various mileage accounts now. Delta JetBlue Southwest and United miles do not expire at all. Air Canada Aeroplan American Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines miles disappear after 18 months without qualifying activity while Alaska Airlines miles go poof after 24 months of non-activity. Don't rush to hop on a flight though. Usually you can reset the expiry clock by earning or redeeming just a single mile. That includes making a purchase with an associated airline credit card shopping through airlines' online portals or just transferring a small bundle of miles to another member's account. There are lots of ways to keep your miles going for when you eventually want to redeem them.

2. Not Searching in the Right Place

One of the things that makes finding award tickets so difficult is that not all airline websites show the same amount of availability especially on partner flights. ""I always tell people to start by thinking about airline alliances"" says Spencer Howard founder of the travel website Straight to the Points. ""United is great for searching Star Alliance award space"" he says. ""Start a search there then run another one with Air Canada Aeroplan to confirm the availability. Delta.com can be used to find SkyTeam awards."" This includes flights on Air France KLM Korean Air and others.

To take another example Alaska Airlines is partners with Cathay Pacific. However the U.S. carrier's site does not allow you to search for or book Cathay award seats. Instead you might need to use the British Airways site — another Oneworld airline partner — for your search and then book your award over the phone with Alaska.

3. Not Jumping on Limited-time Deals

Most airlines used to have award charts with fixed pricing for flights. For example a domestic economy ticket would be 25000 miles round-trip while a business class seat from the U.S. to Europe would be 100000 miles. Now however many have shifted to a revenue-based system that more closely ties the number of miles required to paid airfares on specific routes. While that means some awards have skyrocketed in price others have dropped precipitously.

In fact there have been some incredible award deals lately including short Delta flights from just 2000 miles each way and United flights from 3000 miles one way. If you see a deal like that and it fits your travel dates and destinations don't hesitate to book as these bargains tend to disappear fast.

4. Waiting Too Long to Book

Even at normal prices airline awards can be tricky to pin down. ""Once you've found award space I don't recommend waiting too long to book"" recommends Howard. ""I've had too many clients and readers wait a few days only to find the award seats were gone."" If you find a ticket that fits your dates and destinations he says go ahead and hit that book button. Otherwise your plans could remain up in the air.

5. Not Being Flexible on Dates

Although award tickets are plentiful at the moment especially on shorter domestic flights booking long-haul tickets in premium cabins can be a crapshoot at the best of times. ""Flexibility is key. If you're locked into traveling on specific dates it can be tough to find award space in the most luxurious first-class cabins. Being open to different travel dates can make all the difference"" says Howard.

6. Redeeming Too Many Miles

When searching for award tickets on an airline's website you're bound to be confused by the sheer range of mileage prices for the same flight on different days and different classes of service. That's because airlines have become extraordinarily adept at adaptive pricing adjusting the mileage levels based on things like search demand airfare fluctuations and more. Before cashing in your miles think about this checklist. First if your airline still publishes award charts like American Airlines does use the ""saver"" level awards as your benchmark for how much you should be spending. If your airline no longer displays award charts like Delta and United do a few different searches on routes you're interested in flying plugging in dates over several months and check the range of mileage pricing. Aim for the lower end of the spectrum when you finally do end up booking something.

7. Using the Wrong Kind of Miles and Overpaying

Another way to overspend on award tickets is by not considering all the different types of miles or points you could use for the same ticket. These days airlines have so many partners — both other carriers as well as credit card issuers — and by thinking about what Howard calls ""arbitrage opportunities"" you can use the mileage currency that gets you the best return.

The example he offers is booking a one-way business class award ticket from the U.S. to Europe on Lufthansa. That would cost 77000 United MileagePlus miles but just 70000 Air Canada Aeroplan miles or a mere 45000 Turkish Airlines Miles & Smiles miles. Don't have Turkish miles? You actually might have some without realizing it because Citi ThankYou Rewards — the type of points you earn with the Citi Prestige and Citi Premier among other credit cards — transfer to the program. Sure it takes a few extra steps to convert your points and then book through Turkish Airlines but it's worth it to save 32000 miles.

To take another stark example let's say you wanted to fly from Los Angeles to Sydney in business class on Qantas. American Airlines AAdvantage would charge 80000 miles in each direction but Alaska Airlines (another partner) would only charge 55000 miles — a much better deal if you have enough miles with both programs to decide between them.

8. Transferring Credit Card Points Too Soon or Too Late

Several credit card reward programs including American Express Membership Rewards Capital One Venture Rewards Chase Ultimate Rewards and Citi ThankYou Rewards allow you to transfer points to partner airline programs. Amex points for instance transfer to Delta SkyMiles Air Canada Aeroplan and 16 others. Chase Ultimate Rewards points can be converted into miles for 10 airlines including United Southwest and JetBlue.

""Before transferring credit card points to an airline I strongly recommend confirming that there is award space because once you do so there's no going back"" says Howard. You can't turn those miles back into credit card points if you eventually decide not to book.

""Additionally remember that not all transfers process instantly"" he warns. ""That can be an important consideration since the award space you found could disappear if your points transfer takes several days to go through.""

9. Using Airline Miles Instead of Credit Card Points

Speaking of using credit card points in addition to transferring to various airline partners Amex Capital One Chase and Citi points are all redeemable directly for flights at fixed rates through their respective travel portals. American Express Membership Rewards points are worth one cent apiece toward flights booked through Amex Travel; Citi ThankYou Rewards points are worth one cent each for flights booked through the Citi portal; and Capital One Venture miles are worth one cent for flights booked through Capital One (though you can also redeem your miles within 90 days for a statement credit toward travel purchases made elsewhere at the same rate). If you have the Chase Sapphire Preferred card your points are worth 1.25 cents apiece or 1.5 cents with the Chase Sapphire Reserve when using them for travel booked through Chase.

So if you have these types of points and are considering using them to book travel directly or transferring them to an airline partner you're going to have to do a little math to maximize the value.

First find the flights you want and look at how much paid airfares are versus mileage redemptions. Divide the cash price over the number of miles needed and you'll get your per-mile value. If that value is lower than what you'd get by simply redeeming your credit card points for the same flight (i.e. you're getting less than a cent per mile and could use Amex Capital One or Citi points instead or you're getting less than 1.25 to 1.5 cents per mile when you could use Chase points) then you might be better off booking your ticket directly through your credit card portal.

Let's say you have the Chase Sapphire Reserve and are looking at United tickets from New York to Chicago. If United is charging 15000 miles or $150 for the ticket you're getting a per-mile return of one cent. But if you have the Chase Sapphire Reserve you could book the same ticket for 10000 Ultimate Rewards points since you get a fixed rate of 1.5 cents per point. Why bother transferring to United in that case?

10. Paying High Taxes and Surcharges

Certain frequent-flier programs like British Airways Executive Club are notorious for piling on surcharges of hundreds or even thousands of dollars on award tickets. ""[They're] the resort fees of the airline industry"" says Howard. ""You get excited about using your hard-earned miles and points to book an award ticket only to find out you also owe over $1000 in taxes and fees.""

""Fortunately some airline programs don't pass on those surcharges on award tickets"" he says. He suggests using miles from Air Canada Aeroplan United MileagePlus or Avianca LifeMiles to avoid high fees on Star Alliance partners. ""Similarly American Airlines AAdvantage can be used to book many Oneworld partners without surcharges"" he adds. Except on British Airways of course where you'll still get slammed with fees.

11. Buying Miles Instead of Transferring or Pooling

Although frequent-flier programs often run bonuses or discounts on mileage sales it's rarely a good deal. That's because they charge such a premium to buy miles you would be hard put to get the same value back that you paid when it comes time to redeem them for flights. While you might want to consider doing this if you just need a couple thousand more for a specific imminent flight you might have other better options.

First if you have transferable credit card points that you can convert to miles with the airline you need that's generally the easiest cheapest and fastest way to top up your account. You could also consider transferring miles in from the account of a friend or family member which tends to cost less than buying them outright. Some airlines even let you ""pool"" points with your family or household members for free. Among the ones that do are JetBlue Frontier Airlines Air Canada and British Airways.

12. Not Using Them for What You Really Want

The key to making the most of your miles is to focus on the kinds of travel experiences you want to use them for says Howard. ""It's so easy to lose sight of what's important to you"" he begins. ""If using miles and points for business and first-class flights is your priority that's great."" On the other hand he continues ""If using as few miles as possible so you can take more trips fly economy. If flying non-stop matters use a few more points to avoid a connection."" Just decide what you really want and then use your miles for it — don't get caught up in trying to book the craziest over-the-top options.

And who owns your online life: you clicking around or Facebook selling your most intimate data?

Turns out these puzzles are both the same puzzle and they share a single answer: you lose. The prize goes to those who know how the simple rules of ownership really work.

James Beach is a large guy over six feet tall. On a United Airlines flight from Newark to Denver the businessman lowered his tray table and attached his Knee Defender. The Knee Defender is a simple plastic clamp available for $21.95 that locks the seat in front. Its website claims the clamp will ""stop reclining seats on airplanes so your knees won't have to."" Assured of his workspace Beach opened his laptop.

The Knee Defender claims are real. When the passenger sitting in front of Beach tried to recline her seat didn't budge. Outraged she slammed her seat back popping out the Knee Defender and jolting Beach's laptop. He quickly jammed her seat back up and reattached the clamp. She turned around and threw her drink at Beach. The pilot changed course to Chicago for an emergency landing and both passengers were removed from the plane.

This conflict keeps erupting—most recently on video. On an American Airlines flight from New Orleans to North Carolina Wendi Williams reclined her seat. The man behind was in the last row so he could not recline. Instead he tapped the back of Williams's seat repeatedly like an irritating metronome. Her video of this high-altitude fracas quickly went viral.

After each incident the blogosphere boomed back and forth with indignant commentary. Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres defended Williams: ""The only time it's ever okay to punch someone's seat is if the seat punches you first."" Delta Air Lines chief executive Ed Bastian took an opposing view: ""The proper thing to do is if you're going to recline into somebody you ask if it's OK first."" Williams didn't ask.

So who's right?

Williams's view is simple: her armrest button reclines her seat so the space belongs her. My home is my castle and anything attached to it is also mine.

Attachment is the most important ownership principle you've never heard of. It's why landowners in Texas can extract underground oil why California's Central Valley is sinking why Alaska can sustainably manage Bering Sea fisheries – and why occasional homeowners feel justified in shotgun blasting drones hovering above their backyards. Attachment is what translates two-dimensional boarding passes land deeds and maps into three-dimensional control of valuable resources.

But attachment is not the only ownership rule in play. At the beginning of every flight all seats are in the ""full upright and locked position."" At that moment Beach had exclusive use of the space in front of him. He had first dibs on the wedge. First-in-time is a second core rule for claiming mine. Kids assert it on the playground; adults invoke it up in the air. It's mine because I was first. Recall that Beach actually took physical control of the wedge with his Knee Defender. And there's a third rule. Possession. Nine-tenths of the law. Mine because I'm holding onto it. Possession means I get to defend my workspace.

Air travel brings into sharp focus three conflicting rules—attachment first-in-time and possession.

Each side picks the story that gives it the moral high ground each side wants ownership bent toward its view. But there is no natural correct answer to mine versus mine battles. Ownership is always up for grabs.

When we ask audiences about the Knee Defender conflict the answer is always the same whether we're talking with our law students at Columbia and UCLA or a non-law crowd. Most people respond with versions of ""It's obvious."" But when we ask for a show of hands people generally split between Williams and Beach—and everyone looks at each other with incredulity. In a 2020 national poll about half replied ""If it can recline I'm reclining"" and the other half said ""No just don't do it."" Everyone feels in the right as did Williams and Beach. That's why Williams felt justified in posting her video and Beach didn't hesitate to shove the front seat forward. Don't mess with what's mine.

Why are these conflicts breaking out now? There never used to be rage around reclining. Until recently airline seats had greater pitch or space between seats—enough both for reclining and for lowering the tray table. No one thought to ask who controlled the space because it didn't much matter. But airlines have been shrinking the pitch in economy class down from 35 inches not that long ago to just 28 inches on some planes.

There's a lot at stake for the airlines: one inch of pitch saved per row can add up to six extra seats per flight to sell. To grow profits airlines are squeezing ever more passengers inside a fixed steel tube—at the same time that people are growing bigger and tray tables have become precious computer stands. The stakes are high for passengers as well. In the COVID-19 era each inch of personal space can feel like a life or death matter. So passengers get angry at each other. But why aren't they angry at the airline?

It turns out neither Beach nor Williams really own the wedge of reclining space. The airlines do. And they are savvy pros at ownership design. As Ira Goldman the inventor of the Knee Defender (whose website traffic increased five-hundred-fold after the Denver flight incident) described: ""What the airlines are doing is they're selling me space for my legs and they're selling you the space—if you're sitting in front of me—they're selling you the same space to recline. So they're selling one space to two people.""

Can the airlines do that?

Yes. In 2018 the Federal Aviation Administration declined to regulate airplane seats leaving their design to the airlines. In turn the airlines use a secret weapon that lets them sell the same space twice on every flight. The weapon is strategic ambiguity a sophisticated tool of ownership design. Most airlines do have a rule—the passenger with the button can lean back. But they keep it quiet. Flight attendants don't announce it.

Ambiguity works to the airlines' advantage. When ownership is unclear—and it's unclear far more often than you might imagine—people mostly fall back on politeness and good manners. For decades airlines have counted on high-altitude etiquette to defuse conflicting claims. That's why Delta CEO Bastian said you should ""ask if it's okay"" to recline. Passengers negotiate among themselves as they angle ahead in line nudge elbows over shared armrests and jostle for overhead bins. Money rarely changes hands. (One study though suggests about three-quarters of passengers would agree not to recline if the person behind offered to buy them a drink or snack.)

But as airlines continue to shrink the pitch unspoken rules over the front-to-back squeeze are breaking down and everyone ends up looking unreasonable. Goldman saw ownership ambiguity as a business opportunity and created a technological solution. The problem though is that a unilateral move to lock the seat violates customs of politeness. It feels like taking something without asking.

The Knee Defender may seem like a silly novelty item but it reflects one of the great engines for innovation in our society: as valued resources become scarcer people compete more intensely to impose their preferred ownership rule and entrepreneurs find ways to profit.

The same clash profoundly reshaped the American West in the 1800s—but there it was farmers against ranchers. The huge cattle drives we love to watch in westerns existed only for a few decades. The numberless herds being moved to market were often roaming over private land but homesteaders had no ability to keep them out. Cows couldn't read No Trespassing signs and fencing was too expensive. So cowboys drove cattle over unfenced miles to rail yards in Abilene and Dodge City.

Then in 1874 Joseph Glidden patented his double-strand barbed wire hailed as ""The Greatest Discovery of the Age."" This invention as simple as the Knee Defender suddenly provided a cheap effective tool to exclude cattle drawing a line where homesteaders could make their stand. The Glidden wire was described as ""lighter than air stronger than whiskey cheaper than dust."" Ranchers fought back engaging in fence-cutting wars that led to shootings and deaths.

By resolving ownership ambiguity in favor of homesteaders Glidden's invention transformed the Great Plains. Small ranchers went out of business as they had no path to get cattle to market. Cowboys became hired hands on large-scale ranches. For many Native Americans barbed wire—""the Devil's rope""—effectively ended their nomadic way of life. Barbed wire was essential to creating the No Trespassing version of ownership that defines so much of modern life in America.

Changes in the technology of ownership can be painful embittering the range wars on the Great Plains and the knee wars at thirty-five thousand feet. Just as barbed wire gave farmers a way to fence out cattle the Knee Defender gives passengers a cheap tool to exclude recliners. Both technologies offer people an effective way to assert their preferred claim over ambiguously-owned resources.

There is a difference though: while farmers made barbed wire ubiquitous many airlines have banned Knee Defenders. As experts in ownership design airlines know how to profit from strategic ambiguity. They could ""pre-cline"" seats fixing them at a set angle but prefer to keep selling each wedge of space twice. This way angry passengers turn against each other with their competing stories rather than blaming the airlines which engineered the conflict. Still better—for the airlines—the discomfort creates a profitable market for higher-priced seats with more legroom and less hassle.

This is the real story driving Knee Defender conflicts.

The identical ownership conflict is playing out today on the Internet a far more consequential and less tangible arena than airplane seats. Our clickstreams reveal much of our private lives—what we buy whom we follow where we live even how we vote. This may seem a world apart from Knee Defenders and barbed wire but it's the same dilemma.

Facebook Google and other Internet titans are reclining their data trackers into our virtual laps earning billions in advertising fees by assembling uncanny profiles based on our likes and looks. Like the airlines tech companies are experts in profiting from ownership ambiguity. They assert a labor claim – the fourth ancient ownership rule. ""It's ours because we worked for it."" The companies created the cool websites we love to visit. They argue this labor earns them the right to collect our data and then sell ads that stalk us creepily around the Internet.

But if you know the rules of ownership you can push back. Clickstreams could be ours because of our self-ownership ""It's mine because it comes from my body."" This is the fifth ownership rule and it's every bit as valid as the labor claim.

One of the central questions for our time is choosing the rule that resolves ownership ambiguity online. Self-ownership or labor? A few places like the European Union and California have taken small steps toward giving us the digital equivalent of Knee Defenders and barbed wire. ""It's mine. Keep out!"" But most everywhere the answer remains up in the air. And continued ambiguity over which story should rule favors the tech companies.

Remarkably there are just six simple stories that everyone uses to claim everything. We've already seen five: first-in-time possession attachment labor and self-ownership. The last one is family – ""it's mine because I'm in the family"" – governing marriage and divorce birth and death. That's it.

And here's the point. Conflicts of mine versus mine go on around us all the time mostly out of view until something like a Knee Defender makes them painfully visible. Then we have to choose not just for reclining seats and online clickstreams but for every resource battle from climate change to wealth inequality. If you are not the one choosing who gets what then someone else is choosing for you.

That last one is on a giant mural in the middle of town.

Missouri Star Quilt Company founded by the Doan family in 2008 regularly drew 8000 tourists a week — all eager to shop in the 13 stores owned by Missouri Star and dedicated to the art of quilting.

Then the COVID-19 virus appeared. The town’s survival appeared threatened after the Doans last March taped signs on all 13 of their doors. “All shops closed until spring 2021” they said.

But it turns out Hamilton has held its own without the tourists.

Anne Kniggendorf / KCUR 89.3 Jenny Doan is the face of Missouri Star Quilt Company owned by two of her seven children. Here she works on a quilt that will be the subject of an April YouTube tutorial.

“What was really interesting was that when COVID hit and we shut down the shops our online business picked up by 40%” says Jenny Doan the matriarch and quilting celebrity of Missouri Star.

Though the town won’t see the revenue from online sales Doan says the company didn’t have to lay off even one person; all of the 400 plus employees not already working in the warehouse transferred there to fill orders. “It was like a miracle to me” Doan says.

The presence of the Missouri Star employees in addition to a generous dose of CARES Act money and a strong push to get people to buy local kept the town's businesses afloat says Mayor Kristopher Bruce.

“Maybe they’re eating at Subway maybe they’re at Dollar General. Or Casey’s is a way to get a slice of pizza and something. That’s kind of helped maintain through it” he says.

While the small number of non-quilting stores and handful of restaurants in Hamilton benefited from the tourist traffic Missouri Star Quilt Company’s brick and mortar sales have never accounted for more than 20% of its total revenue estimated at $40 million by Forbes in 2019.

Anne Kniggendorf / KCUR 89.3 In addition to the 13 quilt-related shops the town also sports several quilting-themed murals.

Doan’s weekly YouTube tutorials have created a massive online presence for the company — just one part of the nation’s $4.2 billion quilting industry. Doan says she receives mail saying that her YouTube videos have helped fans through the hard times.

“For people who are under a lot of stress which all of us have been during COVID creating is very calming and soothing” Doan says. “Nurses and doctors loads of them are quilters because it’s something they can do in their spare time.”

But Doan and many others in Hamilton know that not every visitor is interested in quilting. Because the majority of quilters are women Missouri Star opened a living room-style storefront geared toward male companions in 2016. It's called Man’s Land.

Around that same time the city’s business leaders starting having serious talks about diversifying Hamilton's attractions for visitors and residents of any gender.

Bob Hughes a retired nonprofit consultant is a member of the chamber of commerce and various boards around town. In his 40-year career his niche has been small town development—mostly towns with fewer than 10000 residents. Hamilton clocks in at 1809.

So when Hughes and his wife moved to Hamilton from Colorado in late 2016 after she took at job at Missouri Star he started brainstorming ways to strengthen the tax base.

He says the pandemic highlighted the importance of that effort.

“We want to expand our offerings to tourists as part of our marketing plan. To grow a tourist economy you either one attract more tourists or two you get them coming back more often” Hughes says.

The economic development board has developed a list of 32 projects that aim to attract more tourists inspire return trips and tempt people to stay longer.

Anne Kniggendorf / KCUR 89.3 Ryan and Dakota Redford are developing the Missouri Quilt Museum in an old high school building.

Many of the ideas are not related to quilting though at the top of the list is the Missouri Quilt Museum which is partnering with the National Quilt Museum in Paducah Kentucky — a rival to Hamilton's “Quilt Town” status.

Other projects include a 10-acre butterfly park that’ll act as the north anchor for the under-construction Highway 13 Butterfly Trail between Branson Missouri and Bethany Missouri; a 355-acre Little Otter Creek Recreational Lake; a visitors center; new businesses like a veterinary clinic and an insurance office; and more restaurants.

A new diner called Eggo’s opened last week. Claudia and Jose Dominguez from Lawson Missouri say they saw an opportunity when the space became available.

Jose Dominguez says that because they’re a small family-owned business he thinks the people of the town might be enough to sustain them without the tourists.

But he admits they did want the location because of the town’s quilting industry which is set to reopen the first week of May.

Dominguez says “We’re putting all our money on that.”

If and when the development board succeeds in creating other tourist draws Hughes says Hamilton will still be the Disneyland of Quilting. And that's just fine.

An additional felony charge has been filed against a Cantonment woman accused of punching a “frail” elderly woman in the face and spitting on her after a minor vehicle collision in a local Dollar General Parking lot.

Allisha Dawn Jarvis 25 was first charged with battery on a person 65 years old or older. Court and arrest records show that she has now also been charged with felony burglary with assault and battery.

The Escambia County Sheriff’s Office arrived at the Dollar General at Highway 29 and North Tate School Road to find a 72-year old woman in the parking lot bleeding from her nose. She told deputies she was turning around in the parking lot when she accidentally hit a Ford Expedition that was leaving the parking lot.

The victim stated she was still in her vehicle when Jarvis approached and “violently punched” her in the face through a rolled-down window before spitting on her according to an arrest report.

Jarvis told deputies that she walked up to the victim’s vehicle window and cussed at the elderly woman but she stated she never punched her in the face the report states.

An Escambia County Sheriff’s Office deputy wrote in his report that the victim was “extremely frail” at 5-foot three-inches tall and weighing only about 90 pounds. Jarvis the report states is about the same height and weighs 147 pounds.

The deputy stated the elderly woman had a slight cut on her nose that was bleeding and “you could clearly see dried spit on her collar.”

A witness confirmed the victim’s statements.

The burglary charged stemmed from Jarvis reaching into the victim’s vehicle.

Jarvis was later released from the Escambia County Jail on a $10000 bond for the burglary charge and $7500 for the assault charge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvaWRVU0tCTjJBWTAwNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exclusive: U.S. agency probes Facebook for 'systemic' racial bias in hiring promotions,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2AY006/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvaWRVU0tCTjJBWTAwNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5LmNvbS9kYWlseS1uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDMvMDcvaG93LWJpZ2dlc3QtYXJtcy1tYW51ZmFjdHVyZXJzLXN0ZWVyLW1pbGxpb25zLWluZmx1ZW5jZS11cy1wb2xpY3kuaHRtbNIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5LmNvbS9kYWlseS1uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDMvMDcvaG93LWJpZ2dlc3QtYXJtcy1tYW51ZmFjdHVyZXJzLXN0ZWVyLW1pbGxpb25zLWluZmx1ZW5jZS11cy1wb2xpY3kuaHRtbD9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Is How the Biggest Arms Manufacturers Steer Millions to Influence US Policy,"Five of the nation's biggest defense contractors -- Lockheed Martin Boeing Northrop Grumman Raytheon Technologies and General Dynamics -- spent a combined $60 million in 2020 to influence policy according to a new report from the Center for Responsive Politics.

The paper ""Capitalizing on conflict: How defense contractors and foreign nations lobby for arms sales"" details how a network of lobbyists and donors steered $285 million in campaign contributions and $2.5 billion in lobbying spending over the last two decades as well as hiring more than 200 lobbyists who previously worked in government.

The amount of money at stake is immense both at home and abroad the center states on its website OpenSecrets.org. Not only is a significant portion of the Pentagon's $740 billion annual budget spent on weapons the report explains but American defense firms agreed to sell $175 billion in weapons to other countries over the last year. That includes deals to sell $23 billion in F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and drones to the United Arab Emirates and billions more in sales to Taiwan and Saudi Arabia it adds.

The practice appears unlikely to change significantly under the Biden administration. The report notes that while President Joe Biden issued an order restricting officials who leave the White House from quickly lobbying the executive branch or registering as foreign agents several of his appointees have ties to the defense industry. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for example sat on Raytheon's board before joining the administration.

And since Biden's inauguration the report states the State Department has approved the sale of $85 million in missiles from Raytheon to Chile and a $60 million deal between Lockheed Martin and Jordan to provide F-16 Fighting Falcons and services.

Foreign nations that are among the arms industry's biggest customers also spend heavily to influence U.S. policy often to the tune of tens of millions of dollars in spending covered by the Foreign Agents Registration Act. However the report notes that some nations that spend the most such as South Korea and Japan focus more on trade and commercial issues than military spending.

Australia the United Arab Emirates Taiwan and Saudi Arabia are some of the other major buyers of American weapons.

Defense lobbyists are also among the best-connected in Washington D.C. the report states. Of the 663 lobbyists working for defense contractors nearly three-quarters used to work for the federal government -- the highest percentage of any industry according to the report.

""These connections make for cozy relationships and highly useful contact lists"" the report says. ""Overworked and underpaid congressional staffers can also hope that lucrative lobbying jobs await them at the same companies who come to them pushing their own agendas.""

The so-called ""revolving door"" also exists on Capitol Hill the report adds. Over the last 30 years nearly 530 staffers have both worked for a member of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees of both houses of Congress or the Defense Appropriations subcommittees and then as a lobbyist for defense companies.

The report highlights former Defense Secretary Mark Esper as an example of the revolving door in action. Esper worked for the Senate Foreign Relations and House Armed Services committees in the late 1990s and early 2000s as well as an assistant deputy secretary of defense before moving to Raytheon's government relations office. After seven years in that job President Donald Trump made him secretary of the Army and then head of the Defense Department.

Attorneys for three job applicants and a manager who claim the company discriminated against them told Reuters of the news on Friday.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) typically resolves disputes through mediation or allowing complainants to sue employers. But agency officials designate a few cases “systemic” enabling investigators to bring in specialists to analyze company data and potentially bring a broader lawsuit representing entire classes of workers.

Oscar Veneszee Jr a Facebook operations program manager and two applicants denied jobs brought a charge last July to the EEOC and a third rejected applicant joined the case in December. They have alleged Facebook discriminates against Black candidates and employees by relying on subjective evaluations and promoting racial stereotypes.

The designation of the EEOC’s investigation has not been previously reported.

The EEOC has not brought allegations against Facebook. Its investigation which may last months more may not result in findings of wrongdoing. The agency declined to comment.

A Facebook spokesman Andy Stone declined to comment on the status of the inquiry or specific allegations but said: “It is essential to provide all employees with a respectful and safe working environment.”

“We take any allegations of discrimination seriously and investigate every case” he said.

The EEOC had brought in systemic investigators by last August and had received detailed briefing papers from both sides over the last four months said Peter Romer-Friedman an attorney at Gupta Wessler representing Veneszee and the job candidates.

Facebook’s counsel Covington & Burling did not respond to a request for comment.

Increasing racial and gender diversity has been a persistent challenge for the country’s largest tech companies which at times have blamed a shortage of qualified candidates from underrepresented groups. But tech workers have grown emboldened to publicly challenge that notion and allege in formal complaints that biased employment practices cause disparities.

Romer-Friedman said he and his colleagues had told the EEOC in a submission last month that one such Facebook policy was awarding employees bonuses of up to $5000 when a candidate they refer is hired. Referred candidates tend to reflect the makeup of existing employees disadvantaging Black professionals he said.

Facebook said about 3.9% of its US employees as of last June were Black.

David Lopez a former EEOC general counsel now teaching at Rutgers University said systemic investigations were significant because of the additional resources involved. When they resulted in allegations of wrongdoing multimillion-dollar settlements sometimes followed he said citing recent cases against Dollar General and Walmart.

Last December the justice department accused Facebook of discriminating against US workers broadly saying it gave hiring preference to temporary workers such as H-1B visa holders.

Google last month agreed to spend $3.8m to settle US government allegations that it underpaid women and unfairly passed over women and Asian candidates for job openings."

RB Park Plaza I has proposed the restaurant at 1800 Sullivan Trail the shopping center that features a Dollar Tree store.

It’s unclear which restaurant RB Park Plaza I wants to bring in.

“The application for conditional use does not require that a specific name be given just the type of business” said township manager Donna Asure.

“They are not required to name any kind of chain” said supervisors chairman John O’Neil. “Sometimes we hear it during the hearing. Sometimes we don’t.”

RB Park Plaza I is based at 3864 Courtney Street in Hanover Township Northampton County according to Pennsylvania Department of State business records. The owners are Raylene Raynessa and Richard Bartolacci. The Bartolaccis couldn’t be reached for comment.

The proposal needs conditional use approval from the zoning hearing board according to a legal ad. It needs conditional use approval because the restaurant has a drive through and because the proposal would expand the shopping center.

The hearing will be at 7 p.m. March 18. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the hearing will be held virtually through Zoom. To access the meeting through your phone dial 1-929-205-6099 enter the meeting code 813 0597 4064 and the passcode 405611. You can also access the meeting online.

(KAIT) - A Trumann woman was killed and a Randolph County man was injured Saturday morning in a two-vehicle crash on Highway 69.

According to a post on the Trumann Police Department Facebook page officers went to the head-on collision near the Dollar Tree around 6:30 a.m. Saturday.

After starting the week on a positive note benchmark indexes S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average withdrew and slipped to a one-month low before ending the last session. They were down 1.34% and 1.11% respectively early Friday. Earlier sentiment had improved after jobless claims came in below economists’ forecast.

After a relatively quiet period consolidations seem to be making a comeback. Continuing its acquisition spree Accenture clinched at least four deals this week with the buyout of UK-based talent consultancy Cirrus Logic topping the list.

The professional services firm also agreed to buy Brazil-based robotics solutions provider Pollux and Australian logistics consultancy GRA. The other business that joined the Accenture fold is technology solutions provider REPL Group.

Agilent Technologies agreed to acquire Resolution Bioscience for $695 million while Taco Bell owner Yum! Brands bought artificial intelligence provider Kvantum. The other key deals include Digital Turbine’s purchase of Israel-based mobile advertising company Triapodi Ltd and the $1.45-billion acquisition of UK-based Capco by Indian software giant Wipro.

Once again retailers dominated the earnings scene with department store operators Kohl’s and Target Corp. publishing their latest statistics on Tuesday followed by discount chain Dollar Tree on Wednesday. The next day Kroger Company and warehouse giant Costco Corp. delivered mixed results for their most recent quarters amid tough-year-over comparison.

Chipmaker Broadcom’s first-quarter report was the other major announcement of the week. As Wall Street approaches the fag end of the earnings season Oracle’s third-quarter financial report is probably the most-awaited announcement next week — scheduled for March 10.

Prior to that H&R Block and Dick’s Sporting Goods are expected to report on March 9. As the week progresses Ulta Beauty will be unveiling fourth-quarter numbers on March 11.

The Electric Highway Coalition – made up of Southern Company American Electric Power Dominion Energy Duke Energy Entergy Corporation and the Tennessee Valley Authority – wants to collaborate on a network of DC fast chargers from the Atlantic Coast through the Midwest and South and into the Gulf Coast and Central Plains regions.

Southern Company and the others are each taking steps to provide EV charging solutions within their system service territories. The announcement represents an unprecedented combined effort to offer EV drivers convenient charging across different utility footprints and allow uninterrupted travel.

The Edison Electric Institute estimates 18 million EVs will be on U.S. roads by 2030. While many drivers recognize the benefits of driving an EV such as the ease of low-cost home charging some have expressed concern with the availability of charging stations during long road trips. With collaborative efforts like the Electric Highway Coalition energy companies demonstrate to customers that EVs are a smart choice regardless of distance.

The coalition will provide drivers with effective efficient and convenient charging options to enable long-distance electric travel. Sites along major highways with easy access and amenities for travelers are being considered as coalition members work to determine final charging station locations. DC fast chargers can get drivers back on the road in 20-30 minutes.

“At Southern Company we are committed to being a leader in building a clean and sustainable energy future for our customers and that includes continuing to increase the reach of electric transportation for more and more drivers” said Chris Cummiskey executive vice president chief commercial officer and customer solutions officer at Southern Company. “By increasing the number of EV fast-charging stations across our footprint we are providing drivers with additional transportation options that are reliable efficient and more convenient while helping reduce carbon emissions for the benefit of our communities we serve.”

Being a founding member of the Electric Highway Coalition is another part of Southern Company’s larger focus on electrification of the transportation industry and commitment to sustainability and clean energy. Along with the systemwide goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 last year Southern Company announced an internal fleet electrification goal where the company plans by 2030 to convert to electric 50% of its electric companies’ fleet vehicles in the auto/SUV/minivan forklift and ATV/cart/miscellaneous equipment segments.

The Electric Highway Coalition welcomes interested utilities to join as it seeks to extend the reach of network. Additionally its members support and look forward to working with other regional utility transportation corridor electrification initiatives.

Phil Mickelson has committed to play in the tournament which starts Friday at Omni Tucson National Golf Resort. Joining Mickelson in committing were 2017 champion Tom Lehman and fan favorite Fred Couples.

Mickelson turned 50 in June allowing him to play in PGA Tour Champions events. He has started — and won — two champions events since the Charles Schwab Series at Ozarks National and the Dominion Energy Charity Classic in October. No golfer has ever won his first three starts on the champions tour.

Mickelson an Arizona State product and owner of Oro Valley’s Stone Canyon Club has always played well in Tucson. He competed in his first tournament here as an ASU freshman in 1989 and finished seventh in the UA’s Ping Invitational. He received a sponsor’s exemption to the Northern Telecom Open a year later and finished 19th.

Mickelson returned to Tucson’s PGA Tour event two years later and won the tournament. He turned down $180000 in prizes to maintain his amateur status.

Mickelson came as a pro in 1991 and won Tucson’s tournaments in both 1995 and 1996.

Tournament and Tucson Conquistadores officials were holding out hope that Mickelson would return for the Cologuard Classic. He last played in Tucson during Thanksgiving week taking part in a made-for-TV event — “The Match: Champions for Change” — at Stone Canyon. He and former Phoenix Suns star Charles Barkley beat Golden State Warriors standout Steph Curry and former NFL quarterback Peyton Manning.

Mickelson becomes the most recognizable face in a packed field of competitors that includes former Arizona Wildcats star Jim Furyk another 50-year-old who’s also expected to challenge for the title.

There are more household names: Steve Stricker will make his fourth appearance at the Cologuard Classic having won the event in 2018. Ernie Els and Miguel Angel Jimenez should be familiar faces to Tucson golf fans. They’ve both played in the old WGC-Accenture Match Play events at Dove Mountain. Jimenez has played in the last two Cologuard Classics while Els made his Tucson PGA Tour Champions debut a year ago finishing 34th

Stricker is one of six former Cologuard Classic champions in the field joining Bernhard Langer (2020) Mark O’Meara (2019) Lehman (2017) Woody Austin (2016) and Marco Dawson (2015). There will be 10 World Golf Hall of Fame members at Tucson National: Couples Els Langer O’Meara Mickelson Retief Goosen Davis Love III Sandy Lyle Colin Montgomerie and Vijay Singh.

Baseball Hall of Famer John Smoltz received a sponsor’s exemption for the tournament. The other four exemptions are expected to be announced shortly.

The final four spots in the Cologuard Classic will be determined in Monday’s qualifier at Oro Valley Country Club.",,,,,,

A tiny Essex village with only around 200 residents living there has its very own exclusive pub which is run and owned by a group of locals.

Lamarsh a village in the district of Braintree dates back to the 10th century - and it has an incredible history.

The stunning and idyllic parish lies next to the River Stour on the Essex/Suffolk border and is made up of 934 acres - 200 of which is farmland.

With only 187 residents and 86 homes the tiny village has an exclusive pub which is entirely owned and run by the community.

The Lamarsh Lion also nicknamed The Painters Pub because of the artists John Constable and Thomas Gainsborough who visited was built in the 1300s and was originally an inn.

The pub briefly closed in 2016 for refurbishment but was reopened in 2018 by a group of locals determined to save it from being turned into housing.

It also has a dreamy pub garden and the front of the pub overlooks the jaw-dropping views of the Stour Valley which entices visitors from all over Essex to visit.

This is the story of how a group of locals banded together to save their pub from going under.

Bought by villagers

The Lamarsh Lion Community Pub Ltd was set up in order to buy the pub which was in danger of being sold to be made into housing.

The group of locals came together to raise the £495000 required to buy the pub. Shares were sold at £50 apiece and no fewer than 450 investors were involved in the acquisition mostly locals who were keen to preserve the pub at the heart of the village.

From the villagers in Lamarsh and neighbouring Alphamstone to charities and people who travel further afield to drink in the pub hundreds of investors aimed to keep the pub in the village.

Russell Haldane 51 chairman of The Lamarsh Lion Community Pub Ltd moved to Lamarsh in 2017 ahead of the pub's reopening and hasn't looked back since.

Even during the struggles of lockdown he still aims for the pub to be the centre of the community.

Russell said: ""Everybody is in it together. It's really quite enchanting.

""The Lamarsh Lion was restored with community money and was restored by people who knew what they were doing with old buildings. The renovation really has been done very well.

""Since then we received additional grants for the upkeep of the property along with the shareholders' funds but it is a difficult sector to survive with Covid but we are surviving and serving the people we need to serve.

""We provide a takeaway and delivery service for the villagers and have volunteers to deliver the food when people cannot attend the pub to pick up their food.

""People have even donated and bought things for the pub like pool tables and dartboards - everyone goes over and above their investment and shares just to make sure that everybody keeps the pub at the centre of the village.

""It really is a community effort and we are really looking forward to opening up again in April.""

Father of three Russell who is a solicitor by day said: ""It's easy to see the effect of losing a local pub or a post office in a small village compared to larger towns and cities. In Lamarsh we don't have a shop - and haven't had one for 700 years or so.

""But this pub has always been the centre of the village for residents so it was important to keep it.

""The pub operates as a hub for the communities of the villages of Lamarsh and Alphamstone but also serves those travelling from much further afield prior to Covid.""

""We had car club meets cyclists regular drinkers and even new people visiting the area and hopefully we will continue to be a welcoming place when we can reopen.""

The pub which has consistent 5-star reviews on TripAdvisor has been praised by many visitors for its 'outstanding' beauty both inside the building as well as the natural beauty of the views of the Stour Valley.

""Our pub has views across the Stour Valley and has views of outstanding beauty - it's really quite something"" Russell said.

""People normally travel to Bures train station which is just a little over a mile away from Lamarsh and walk over to the pub for their lunch or for a pint just for the views.

""The pub is there for the community but is also a destination pub for those wanting to see the beauty of the valley.""

Investment has also been made into the village with a train line being created which allows people to come into the village from Sudbury Suffolk.

Russell concluded ""If you haven't visited Lamarsh and the Stour Valley before then come and do it. You're missing out by not seeing the natural beauty. If at the same time you want to visit the pub there will always be a warm welcome to all visitors.""

The Lamarsh Lion is definitely a pub to add to the list once lockdown restrictions ease.",,,,,,,,,

The blue-chip benchmark gained 306.14 points or 1% to 31802.44 led by Disney. At its session high the 30-stock average jumped 650 points to hit an intraday record high. The S&P 500 erased a 1% gain to close 0.5% lower at 3821.35. The Nasdaq Composite slid 2.4% in volatile trading to 12609.16 as Apple dropped 4.2% and Tesla fell 5.8%. Alphabet and Netflix both slipped more than 4%.

The tech-heavy benchmark closed more than 10% below its Feb.12 closing high falling into correction territory.

The Senate passed a $1.9 trillion economic relief and stimulus bill on Saturday paving the way for extensions to unemployment benefits another round of stimulus checks and aid to state and local governments. The Democrat-controlled House is expected to pass the bill later this week. President Joe Biden is expected to sign it into law before unemployment aid programs expire on March 14.

Meanwhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday people who've been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 can meet safely indoors without masks further boosting reopening hopes. The positive news boosted stocks banking on a strong economic recovery.

Disney shares added more than 6% after California eased Covid rules paving the way for Disneyland to reopen on a limited basis in April. American Airlines jumped nearly 5% while United Airlines popped 7%. Target rose 2.5%.

""More stimulus could provide a big lift to the stock market but it may come with some bumps"" said Lindsey Bell chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. ""Runaway inflation worries have been a stumbling block for stocks as of late. Because of this there could be more market weakness ahead as investors grapple with the short- and long-term effects of stimulus. High-flying stocks like tech and the 'stay at home' stocks may be hit the hardest.""

Tech stocks remained the biggest losers on Monday continuing the trend for the last few weeks. High-growth stocks which were among the best performers last year are particularly vulnerable as higher rates reduce the value of future cash flows.

Apple has fallen 15% in the past month while Tesla has dropped 34% in that period. Pandemic bets Zoom Video and Peloton have tumbled 24% and 30% over the past month.

Sentiment got a boost earlier Monday after hedge fund manager David Tepper said the recent sharp rise in rates is likely over and it's hard to be bearish on stocks right now.

""Basically I think rates have temporarily made the most of the move and should be more stable in the next few months which makes it safer to be in stocks for now"" Tepper told CNBC's Joe Kernen who shared the comments on ""Squawk Box.""

The benchmark 10-year yield has risen sharply in recent weeks in anticipation of more stimulus on top of a booming economic recovery. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 4 basis points to 1.6% Monday. The benchmark rate started the calendar year below the 1% mark.

Tepper believes the sell-off in Treasurys that has driven rates higher is likely over as big foreign buyers like Japan are poised to come in. He also said ""bellwether"" stocks like Amazon are starting to look attractive after the pullback. Amazon shares have fallen 11% over the past month.

The market rotation has created a big divergence among the major averages. For March the Dow Industrials leveraged more to the reopening is up 2.8% while the Nasdaq Composite is off by 4.4%.

The agreement provides that Sagebird Consulting LLC will perform certain services for District 65 for a total of $112000 in connection with the District’s plan to revise its student assignment system. The goals of the overall project are to modernize the structure of the District’s student assignment system establish new school boundaries establish an equitable selection process for magnet schools and programs and establish a school in the 5th Ward said Sarita Smith Manager of Student Assignments at a District 65 School Board meeting on Feb. 8.

Sagebird Consulting LLC lists two people under the heading “Our Team” on its website: Cassie R. Blausey J.D. and Stephen W. Lin Ph.D.

Ms. Blausey was hired as the Director of School Choice at Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) in Louisville in about November 2017. During her tenure Dr. Horton served as Chief of Schools at JCPS. They served on a Student Assignment Review Advisory Committee at JCPS that recommended revisions to the student assignment plan there. JCPS’s website reflects that Ms. Blausey is currently the Executive Administrator of School Choice at JCPS.

According to one report on the web Sagebird Consulting LLC filed its organizational papers on Nov. 23 2019.

The RoundTable asked Dr. Horton in an email in the morning of March 4 to describe his working relationship with Ms. Blausey at JCPS and if they are friends; why he hired Sagebird Consulting LLC; if he considered any other firms; if he sought bids from any other firms; and if he obtained approval of the School Board or the Board’s Finance Committee to enter into the contract. Dr. Horton did not respond prior to the posting of this article.

In a memo to the School Board dated Feb. 8 2021 Ms. Smith said a team at District 65 is working to develop a Student Assignment Plan to present to the School Board in March 2022. She said the team from District 65 “includes Dr. Horton (Superintendent) Dr. Green (Deputy Superintendent) Kylie Klein (Director of Research Accountability & Data) Saranda Karpuzi (Registration) and Tania Margonza (Community Engagement Facilitator).”

Ms. Smith’s memo adds “We contracted Sagebird Consulting led by Cassie R. Blausey J.D. to guide us in our work. In her role as the Executive Administrator of School Choice for Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) Cassie leads several large-scale District initiatives including the building of charter school authorizer systems designing new magnet schools and co-leading the redesign of the JCPS Student Assignment Plan. Her partner Stephen W. Lin Ph.D. specializes in research methods and statistics. He has conducted program evaluations independent research and tailored consulting for public and private institutions.”

The RoundTable asked Anya Tanyavutti President of the District 65 School Board and Joey Hailpern a member of the School Board and Chair of its Finance Committee when they became aware of the contact if other firms were considered for the project if bids were sought from other firms and why Sagebird Consulting was selected.

Ms. Tanyavutti told the RoundTable “Regarding your inquiry we as a Board were notified of administration interest in working with Sagebird Consulting a uniquely qualified consulting firm run by a Latina woman who successfully supported JCPS system redistrict in complex racially and economically disparate demographics similar to ours in a superintendent update in November as such I did not advise my colleagues. Our district policy (2.170) does not currently require bid or Board approval for such a contract execution.

“We will be revisiting policy 2.170 at a future policy meeting.”

Mr. Hailpern told the RoundTable “Sagebird was selected to support the multifaceted student assignment work for a few reasons. They have recent experience doing this kind of work in getting teams organized for the long process ahead and strategizing the order of events. They have recently done this work in Jefferson County Schools in Kentucky.

“I was not aware of the Sagebird Consulting Contract until it was shared through a superintendent update to the board. As such I also did not advise other members of the board about the contract that I did not know about.

“As a part of our Student Assignment Work and the upcoming master facilities planning work additional expertise was expected to be hired along the way. It is common for schools to engage some specialty services like this to help move the project along maintain an unbiased view of the community and help us stay on target all while the school district business carries on.

“Around the same time I became aware of the Sagebird contract there were also suggestions for consultants to support the master facilities planning. I did speak to Dr. Horton about any work related to master facilities architectural engineering or land surveying follow a formal public bid process in line with policy 2.170 so that the Board can vote on the firm that is used in that work in open session with the public deliberation.

“In addition we are planning to review this policy and other financial policies to include expenditures like this so that there is a public review process in place.

“Finally I am not aware of any other firms considered nor was there a formal bid process performed as the scope of the work for this group is outside of the policy referenced above.”

Section 2.170 provides that the School Board may retain architects and engineers to render professional services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications and in accordance with State law. The Illinois Local Government Professional Services Selection Act 50 ILCS 510 provides the process to be followed before entering into a contract for architectural and engineering services which includes specified notice requirements and consideration of qualified firms who express an interest in the providing the services.

Ms. Tanyavutti and Mr. Hailpern focused on Board Policy Section 2.170 relating to engineering and architectural services but Board Policy 4.60 also contains provisions relating to contracts each of which must be complied with.

Section 4.60 provides “No purchase of contract shall be made or entered into as a result of favoritism….”

It also states “Adoption of the annual budget authorizes the Superintendent or designee to purchase budgeted supplies equipment and services provided that State law is followed. Purchases of items outside the budget parameters require prior Board approval except in an emergency.”

Section 4.60 also says “Supplies materials or work in excess of $25000 must comply with State bidding procedures 105 ILCS 5/10-20.21 unless specifically exempted.” State law exempts “(i) contracts for the services of individuals possessing a high degree of professional skill where the ability or fitness of the individual plays an important part; …”

There is no indication that either the School Board or the Finance Committee discussed voted on and approved the Sagebird contract in open session before it was entered into.

At the end of the Board’s Finance Committee meeting on Feb. 8 Mr. Hailpern said that a Board Policy provides that contracts over $25000 must be brought to the Board for approval. He said he wanted the Finance Committee to discuss lowering that amount “specifically so that purchases cannot be done without Board approval at a lower threshold.

“I think for me that’s just one way that we can slow the rate of spending and bring a little bit more oversight to the financial interests of the District long term.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vY2FuZHlzZGlydC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8wNy93aGF0cy1kZXZlbG9waW5nLWNlbGluYXMtY2hhbGstaGlsbC1hcmxpbmd0b24tbGV3aXN2aWxsZS1hbm5hLXZhbmFseXN0bmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's Developing: Celina's Chalk Hill Arlington Lewisville Anna/VanAlystne - CandysDirt.com,"Chalk Hill is at the corner of Preston Road and Collin County Road 102 (YouTube screencap).

Celina’s population just keeps growing. Since the 2010 Census the number of Celina residents has boomed — to 288 percent. Right now Celina’s population is 23427.

It’s going to continue growing thanks to a 95-acre master-planned development on the city’s north side near Celina High School.

Centurion American Development Group plans to bring 400 additional homes to Celina at its Chalk Hill community at the southeast corner of Preston Road and Collin County Road 102 north of the city’s historic downtown.

Farmers Branch-based Centurion recently announced Atlanta-based Beazer Homes and Arlington-based D.R. Horton will build 440 single-family homes in two phases. The first phase includes the construction of 157 homes the second 283 homes. Homes will start in the mid-$250000s and range in size from more than 1500 to nearly 2600 square feet.

https://youtu.be/2K4woU3lwgs

John D. Hutchinson president of Dallas-based Trez Capital which loaned $10 million to help fund the first phase told GlobeSt.com in 2018 that he’s confident Chalk Hill will impact the area’s growth.

“It is ideally located near major employment hubs in Collin County that are continuing to see corporate relocations and expansions” Hutchinson said.

Chalk Hill will feature an amenity center with a community pool six acres of community green space neighborhood walking paths and trails.

More evidence of Celina’s growth: In January Celina was issued 309 single-family home construction permits 100 more than January 2020 according to Tomlin Investment Reports. The city was issued 1862 single-family permits in 2020 second-most of any Dallas-Fort Worth suburb and 49 percent more than the 1252 permits issued in 2019.

Tomlin is building a $2 billion 1408-acre Green Meadows master-planned community on Legacy Drive west of the planned Dallas North Tollway extension on Celina’s west side.

All of this of course was decades before the internet and printed material was king. But one thing we also subscribed to was a uniquely South African periodical the lugubrious title of which was usually shortened to Jacobsen’s Index.

This publication listed everything the censors of the old apartheid regime believed to be anathema to its puritanical strict racially segregated society. In it one would find every book magazine T-shirt car bumper sticker record album film poster and anything else deemed a violation of the censors’ overzealous attention. To possess such materials once listed became an actionable offence.

As a result while the periodic listings could easily generate a giggle or a guffaw such as the listing of the children’s classic story Black Beauty (the censors clearly had no sense of proportion or irony) the listings provided us with a guideline over whether or not we might order and put on our shelves potentially problematic items. Other libraries throughout South Africa diplomatic enclaves or not assiduously followed the restrictions in the index. As a result travellers overseas would buy banned books wrap them carefully in their luggage perhaps removing the cover just to be safe and smuggle them into the country and pass them around among friends almost like samizdat literature in the former Soviet Union.

The reasoning was a simple albeit intellectually and ideologically treacherous one. If we had Ebony (a leading US magazine perpetually on the forbidden list) available to readers the man who we assumed was from the Special Branch who was always in the library would note the identities of readers and give them difficulties after they left our libraries. This was of course a slippery slope and eventually we all agreed this kind of decision was so antithetical to what we said we stood for and began to stock Ebony and Jet along with various other items of African-American life without reservation although we didn’t let those magazines get lent out — probably for the quite reasonable fear they would never be returned. Such forbidden work had great cachet with readers obviously.

This experience and the intellectually torturous rationale for it helped give this writer a particularly ferocious opposition to censorship except in the most limited and carefully articulated of circumstances. A public library probably shouldn’t lend the writings of the Marquis de Sade to preteens but such works should be kept on the shelves of a comprehensive library with a good international literature section — together with essays about and critiques of the man and his work.

This sensibility about censorship is why this writer has been so astounded by the decision to cease publication of six of Dr Seuss’s children’s books. Dr Seuss? Really? Dr Seuss’s real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel but many millions only know him by his pen name of course.

Technically there has been no board of censors that rounded up the millions of copies of Dr Seuss’s writings to be heaped up for giant bonfires in the fashion of the Inquisition the Nazis or the old Soviet Union or Mao’s China with the authors or their heirs forced to recant their views. But Geisel’s heirs have now determined that six of the author’s works including his first book And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street would no longer be available to be printed and sold by their publishers. Extant copies will continue to be sold and resold now as collector’s items.

As ABC News reported the decision “Six Dr. Seuss books – including ‘And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street’ and ‘If I Ran the Zoo’ – will stop being published because of racist and insensitive imagery the business that preserves and protects the author’s legacy said Tuesday.

“‘These books portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong’ Dr Seuss Enterprises told The Associated Press in a statement that coincided with the late author and illustrator’s birthday.

“‘Ceasing sales of these books is only part of our commitment and our broader plan to ensure Dr. Seuss Enterprises’ catalog represents and supports all communities and families’ it said. The other books affected are ‘McElligot’s Pool’ ‘On Beyond Zebra!’ ‘Scrambled Eggs Super!’ and ‘The Cat’s Quizzer.’

“The decision to cease publication and sales of the books was made last year after months of discussion the company which was founded by Seuss’ family told AP.

“‘Dr Seuss Enterprises listened and took feedback from our audiences including teachers academics and specialists in the field as part of our review process. We then worked with a panel of experts including educators to review our catalog of titles’ it said.” Well okay then. Case closed? Not so fast perhaps.

Much of children’s literature – and especially the many books by Dr Seuss – is a perpetual cash cow for publishers. Some of Dr Seuss’s books such as The Cat in the Hat One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish and Oh The Places You’ll Go! have ongoing sales in the hundreds of thousands of copies per year. Meanwhile works like Horton Hears a Who! and How the Grinch Stole Christmas! along with that top hat-wearing cat have become beloved animated cartoons for millions as well.

﻿

Reporting on the growing squabble The New York Times reported “Classic children’s books are perennial bestsellers and an important revenue stream for publishers. Last year more than 338000 copies of ‘Green Eggs and Ham’ were sold across the United States according to NPD BookScan which tracks the sale of physical books at most retailers. ‘One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish’ sold more than 311000 copies and ‘Oh the Places You’ll Go!’ – always popular as a high school graduation gift – sold more than 513000 copies.”

But the now-withdrawn books including Mulberry Street have not been selling much in recent years with that volume only achieving about 5000 sales last year although with the decision to discontinue publication the street value of resold copies of the now-so-disgraced volumes is shooting up dramatically. Still the question arises as to why this decision is becoming a divisive social issue right in the midst of major overlapping national crises.

This particular book and the rationale for it being withdrawn merits more discussion than simply letting the angry screams of right-wing commentators about this mysterious thing called the “cancel culture” social criticism that is despoiling everything that isn’t firmly in line with the most progressive “woke” thinking. The heirs’ decision has come from their review of the entire Dr Seuss oeuvre but the Mulberry Street determination seems to have come specifically from the stereotyped depiction of a Chinese person. The conceit of the book for those who don’t remember reading and rereading it from their childhood is of a young boy who sees a parade of people and things coming down an ordinary city street that becomes increasingly more outlandish and bizarre as he watches in open-mouthed wonder. In particular as part of that larger procession there is a Chinese man running down the street wearing a traditional Asian farmer’s conical hat. He sports a plaited pigtail of his hair; he is wearing wooden clogs; and as he runs he is holding a bowl from which he is eating his meal with chopsticks.

Now obviously collectively these could be read as disparaging stereotypical attributes of China and the Chinese. But back in the 1930s when he wrote the book it was certainly not uncommon in popular culture elsewhere to depict someone from China as wearing a conical hat and wooden clogs since so many millions of people actually did so. Similarly eating with chopsticks is after all ubiquitous throughout East Asia and remains so. And as for that egregious pigtail well historically the Ching dynasty that ruled China for hundreds of years until the early 20th century had actually required all male Chinese – at home or abroad – to bind their hair that way as a visible demonstration of fealty to the Ching emperor. Many Chinese probably continued to do so for some years after the 1912 revolution from long force of habit although many others publicly cut them off to demonstrate support for Sun Yat Sen’s new government.

Certainly these signifiers quite common in popular culture in the 1930s in film by themselves probably did not merit the death knell of a critique of Dr Seuss’ first big hit unless it could be shown it represented a deeper reservoir of his cultural and social poison and that it was deliberately designed to wound. Dr Seuss after all had also been a prolific illustrator of World War 2 propaganda posters for the war effort and some of those illustrations also included rather cruel caricatures of Japanese. But after all the Japanese were one of the US’s mortal enemies at the time and such depictions are in keeping with many other propaganda posters.

Yes some of his books have illustrations that could possibly be read as insulting or worse of Africans. But again they can also be seen as a sign of the times in which the artist/writer lived. Here are clearly areas in some of his books where the author’s apparent biases were in keeping with the common stereotypes of his time.

There have even been a few critics who have chosen to see that famous cat with the headgear as a stand-in for the presumed chaos of black life in the US or Africa. Or something like that. Still we should also remember that Dr Seuss’s Horton the Elephant should probably be best known for his expression of an all-encompassing humanism saving the populace of Whoville when he remonstrated their would-be enemies “A person’s a person no matter how small.”

But critics of this new publisher’s decision saw something that was deeply malign. Given the red-hot passions among many Americans along the political continuum not surprisingly this presumably hard-nosed business decision by Dr Seuss’s heirs and publishers has almost instantly become a cause célèbre among conservative media commentators the right generally and among Republicans all of whom saw this decision as the thin edge of the wedge for the dangers of “woke” and “cancel” cultural trends. This political flouncing around is rapidly turning children’s literature into yet another front in the US culture war.

Amazingly in the midst of the real Covid and economic crises that continue to grip the nation senior Republican politicians like Kevin McCarthy the House Minority Leader and stalwart defender of Trumpism chose to devote time to sniggering remarks over this publisher’s decision and in reading aloud from Dr Seuss books to a perplexed nation. That of course was instead of doing his real job.

This kerfuffle over Dr Seuss has a bizarre parallel among conservatives as well. Naturally it does. School districts in the US especially in the South continue efforts to remove Harper Lee’s perennial bestselling novel To Kill a Mockingbird from their respective high school curriculums and in some places even from public libraries.

As far as children’s books go after some of Dr Seuss’s books have gone to the knacker’s shop can Tintin and Babar be far behind? Or Tarzan? Or an adventure novel like Jules Verne’s Around the World in Eighty Days with all its stereotypes about Native Americans South Asians and more?

As the history.com website describes it “A school board’s decision to remove To Kill a Mockingbird from Grade 8 curriculums in Biloxi Mississippi is the latest in a long line of attempts to ban the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee. Since its publication in 1960 the novel about a white lawyer’s defense of a black man against a false rape charge by a white woman has become one of the most frequently challenged books in the U.S.

“According to James LaRue director of American Library Association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom challenges to the book over the past century have usually cited the book’s strong language discussion of sexuality and rape and use of the n-word.

“‘The most current challenge to it is among the vaguest ones that I’ve ever heard’ he says. The Biloxi School Board ‘just says it “makes people uncomfortable.”’ LaRue finds this argument unconvincing contending ‘the whole point to classics is they challenge the way we think about things.’

“One of the earliest and most prominent challenges was in Hanover County Virginia in 1966. In that instance the school board said it would remove the book from county schools citing the book’s theme of rape and the charge that the novel was ‘immoral’.

“The board walked back its decision however after residents complained about it in letters to local papers. One of the most prominent critics of the decision was Lee herself who wrote a letter to the editor of the Richmond News Leader. It began: ‘Recently I have received echoes down this way of the Hanover County School Board’s activities and what I’ve heard makes me wonder if any of its members can read.’” Maybe she was right.

In fact Harper Lee’s novel is just one of the mainstays of literature that face continuing challenges to allowing students to read them. Huckleberry Finn has been criticised almost since its publication given its rousing support for the struggle by Jim the black man with whom Huckleberry travels on the Mississippi River for his deep desire to gain his freedom – and in Twain’s treatment of Jim as a man with a vast humanity who is the equal of Huckleberry Finn. Catcher in the Rye has often similarly been attacked because of its apparent endorsement for the beginnings of the youth culture and rebellion.

Cancel culture is obviously only a problem when it comes from the left it would seem then. Should The Great Gatsby One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest On the Road or even English classics like Robinson Crusoe and Gulliver’s Travels be left on the shelves despite their obvious subversive messages and meanings?

As far as children’s books go after some of Dr Seuss’s books have gone to the knacker’s shop can Tintin and Babar be far behind? Or Tarzan? Or an adventure novel like Jules Verne’s Around the World in Eighty Days with all its stereotypes about Native Americans South Asians and more?

Is there a better way than this? Of course there is. In our view a book like Mulberry Street should continue to be published but it should come with a special foreword that gives parents (and young readers as well) the context to understand what might be objectionable and how they should understand and interpret the words the times and the ideas. The tales of Brer Rabbit and the Brothers Grimm certainly need some interpretation for modern readers and few have argued for their oblivion. (About now my wife points out to me that many of those well-loved English nursery rhymes have the subliminal purpose of teaching impressionable children about the so-called natural order of things learning one’s social and economic station and in deferring to those of a higher position.)

And even for those absolutely indisputable classics it is a really rare person in our own time who starts to read a copy of Hamlet or Macbeth (or watches them on stage or screen) without some preparation and introductory and explanatory readings and at least at first the guidance of a good teacher. Children’s books similarly should not be immune to explanation and discussion to keep them accessible and well understood by today’s readers. Warts and all.

Of course for today’s US among Republicans and their media allies the angry critique of the publisher’s decision over Dr Seuss’s six books – rightly or wrongly – is largely a way to keep the cult permanently revved up about the dire intentions of those “woke” and the “cancel culture” devotees and their feckless Democratic allies. And maybe in all this someone is about to launch a Go Fund Me defence fund that will help empty a few pockets for contributions to keep Mulberry Street open for business. DM",,,,,,

DUK,Duke Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3llbGxvd2hhbW1lcm5ld3MuY29tL3NvdXRoZXJuLWNvbXBhbnktam9pbnMtb3RoZXItdXRpbGl0aWVzLWluLXBsYW5zLWZvci1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlLWNoYXJnaW5nLW5ldHdvcmstdGhhdC1pbmNsdWRlcy1hbGFiYW1hL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southern Company joins other utilities in plans for electric vehicle charging network that includes Alabama,"Southern Company Alabama Power’s parent company joined five other energy companies Tuesday in announcing plans to ensure electric vehicle (EV) drivers have access to a seamless network of charging stations connecting major highway systems across significant regions of the country.

The Electric Highway Coalition – made up of Southern Company American Electric Power Dominion Energy Duke Energy Entergy Corporation and the Tennessee Valley Authority – wants to collaborate on a network of DC fast chargers from the Atlantic Coast through the Midwest and South and into the Gulf Coast and Central Plains regions.

Southern Company and the others are each taking steps to provide EV charging solutions within their system service territories. The announcement represents an unprecedented combined effort to offer EV drivers convenient charging across different utility footprints and allow uninterrupted travel.

The Edison Electric Institute estimates 18 million EVs will be on U.S. roads by 2030. While many drivers recognize the benefits of driving an EV such as the ease of low-cost home charging some have expressed concern with the availability of charging stations during long road trips. With collaborative efforts like the Electric Highway Coalition energy companies demonstrate to customers that EVs are a smart choice regardless of distance.

The coalition will provide drivers with effective efficient and convenient charging options to enable long-distance electric travel. Sites along major highways with easy access and amenities for travelers are being considered as coalition members work to determine final charging station locations. DC fast chargers can get drivers back on the road in 20-30 minutes.

“At Southern Company we are committed to being a leader in building a clean and sustainable energy future for our customers and that includes continuing to increase the reach of electric transportation for more and more drivers” said Chris Cummiskey executive vice president chief commercial officer and customer solutions officer at Southern Company. “By increasing the number of EV fast-charging stations across our footprint we are providing drivers with additional transportation options that are reliable efficient and more convenient while helping reduce carbon emissions for the benefit of our communities we serve.”

Being a founding member of the Electric Highway Coalition is another part of Southern Company’s larger focus on electrification of the transportation industry and commitment to sustainability and clean energy. Along with the systemwide goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 last year Southern Company announced an internal fleet electrification goal where the company plans by 2030 to convert to electric 50% of its electric companies’ fleet vehicles in the auto/SUV/minivan forklift and ATV/cart/miscellaneous equipment segments.

The Electric Highway Coalition welcomes interested utilities to join as it seeks to extend the reach of network. Additionally its members support and look forward to working with other regional utility transportation corridor electrification initiatives.

LOUISVILLE Ky. — According to a Facebook post three people were displaced following an overnight fire in the Portland neighborhood.

Louisville Division of Fire (LFD) says crews were dispatched to a structure fire in the 2700 block of Portland Avenue just before 4 a.m. Sunday.

Once the scene firefighters found a heavy fire coming from a two-story home with fire extending to two other homes located close by.

The people inside the home had already safely exited prior to crews arriving.

It took 35 minutes for 28 firefighters to bring the fire under control. The main fire building was destroyed. Neighboring houses sustaining significant damage.No civilians or firefighters were injured during the incident.

LFD Arson Investigators are working to determine the cause.

It could be a real-life freight rolling on the Norfolk Southern line that runs north-south through Lake Norman. Or it could be one of Lou Paone’s four model trains 1/32nd-scale locomotives and cars that broadcast a train whistle recording as they whip around the 485 feet of track in his back garden.

Paone a 72-year-old managing director at Deloitte Corporate Finance designed and built all of it in the 5000-square-foot garden behind his waterfront home complete with shrubs flowers bushes and rock formations. He created it after twin disasters. He and his wife Rosemary moved to The Point in 2007. A year later Paone a lifelong gardener stepped on a yellow jacket nest while working in a plant bed on the property. The wasps stung him nearly 30 times. About a week later with his wounds still open he contracted a waterborne bacterial infection. “I almost lost the use of my legs” he says.

Paone had to recuperate for several months while he worked from home unable to travel for business and he had time on his hands. He remembered a friend’s neighbor he’d met 25 years before who had built a model train display in his compact garden and spa. If I ever have the time and the space Paone thought then I’ll do the same. Now he had both and he started to research garden railroads. “The internet is amazing” he says. “I found tutorials articles and chat rooms that provided me with answers to many of the questions I had for designing and building a garden railroad.”

Paone had always admired “the lush and rugged character of the Pacific Northwest.” As he recovered Paone removed trees and dumped soil to level the 100 feet between his house and the shoreline then painstakingly built more than 125 feet of interconnected wooden trestles to guide the engines’ journey through the garden. The terrain beneath it contains waterfalls a pond and cove a river gorge and a dry riverbed. He even took an online bonsai class so he could shape shrubs and ornamental trees.

He found a tutorial from a pair of modelers in Australia to learn how to build the stone bridges and another from a U.S.-based modeler about how to stabilize the stainless-steel track as it expanded in extreme heat and contracted in cold. One way to answer those questions: Spend a lot of money. Stainless steel conducts electricity better than any other metal and doesn’t corrode. It costs $15 per linear foot and Paone spent $7000 on the track alone. He used 500 plants at $30 each and 40 pallets of stone. Each of the four train engines cost between $750 and $1500.

Then came the regulatory hurdles. “I had a cease-and-desist order from the (N.C. Department of Environmental Quality) that stated ‘If you continue to upset the naturalized area along the shoreline without getting our approval you’re going to be fined $2000 a day.’ I immediately called them and said ‘What do I need to do?’”

Paone had to add trees back to the property to reflect the original number and amend his original design for the pond because it encroached on a shoreline setback requirement.

“Duke Energy was also alerted by the NCDEQ because I was building a waterfall and pond that were using a secondary irrigation pump” he continues. “Duke Lake Services only allows one irrigation pump per property for lakefront homes to conserve lake water.” Paone redesigned the system to send water from the overflowing pond back to the lake.

His last hurdle: The Point community’s architectural committee which told him his plan had numerous violations of their code and that the model trains were “toys.” (The committee prohibits permanent toys visible from the lake on lakefront property.)

Paone did what he would at work: He made a PowerPoint presentation to address each concern. “I then brought in two of the railroad engines … and made the argument that they were essentially a unique garden accessory to a naturalized garden landscape” he says. “The committee was immediately taken by the visual attractiveness of the model train engines.”

It took about three months for him to win approval. But Paone says the trials were worth it. “People often say ‘Your grandsons must love it’” he says. “They do love it but kids get easily bored if they are not constantly active. It’s the adults that will stand there and be mesmerized by the layout and detail.”",,,,,,

It’s fluid. It’s fast. It’s mesmerizing. It catches the eye the way some Bruins watchers will remember when Bobby Orr showed up here 50-plus years ago and commanded the sheet with his beguiling blend of speed attack and stickhandling like no one the game had ever seen.

Headed into weekend play Kaprizov led rookies in scoring (6-11—17). And though this may sound silly his goals and assists aren’t all that important. Numbers unless they’re drastically beyond standard range are just numbers — no doubt important but not necessarily defining.

Barring some unforeseen inexplicable force of nature which we’ve all learned these last 12-14 months never to rule out Wild left winger Kirill Kaprizov will finish this abbreviated 56-game season as the NHL Rookie of the Year.

Edmonton’s Connor McDavid is astounding lightning quick off the hop and faster than a bullet train out of Tokyo when rolling down the track. Kaprizov is fast and while not McDavid fast separates himself from other skaters when he shifts into his dynamic edge work and defies the standard laws of skating physics when zipping around the offensive zone. Then the 5-foot-9-inch 185-pound dynamo becomes Shipstads & Johnson meets David Copperfield.

“The old 10-and-2s” said Wild GM Bill Guerin referring to the positioning of Kaprizov’s skates when he’s flashing the edgework. “I played with guys that did that a lot — Ulf Dahlen comes to mind. But I’ve never seen somebody do it like this where he actually accelerates when he does it. Really it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen.”

Jeff Skinner now struggling to stay in the Sabres’ lineup has a similar style. Ex-Bruin Ryan Spooner currently in career recovery with KHL Minsk often slipped into 10-and-2 mode. Two other great Russian skaters Sergei Fedorov and Alex Kovalev mixed flashes of it into their repertoires. But none of them ever worked the sheet like Kaprizov.

“It’s almost like a little shot of energy when he comes out of it” said Guerin as if describing a stone shot from a slingshot. “It’s different.”

The game’s truly great skaters those who marry offensive numbers to their speed are gifts to the game. Some of the great ones in recent decades have included Denis Savard master of his trademark spin-o-rama in his Chicago days and defensemen Paul Coffey and Scott Niedermayer. Wayne Gretzky of course.

“Textbook skater Coffey” noted at admiring Guerin. “If you wanted to be a skater it’s Coffey such ease . . . he could skate all night. And I’ll tell you another one J.R. [Jeremy Roenick]. I remember him from our younger years. It was like he wasn’t even touching the ice the way he’d float around. The glide was just incredible.”

In recent years Chicago right winger Patrick Kane his size and build very similar to Kaprizov’s has been among the game’s most dynamic skaters.

Like the budding Russian star all of them could produce at speed.

“It’s crazy” said Guerin who played 17 NHL seasons including nearly two full seasons with the Bruins. “And I don’t think it’s something either that you can really work on when it’s that much a part of it. That’s just how he skates.”

In other words we take certain skills to be gifts granted through the serendipitous alignment of genetics or from forces beyond be they spiritual or divine. Great skaters are stardust billion-year-old carbon and golden.

“No I don’t” said Guerin when asked if say even just one of 100 excellent skaters could train to reach Kaprizov’s dynamic level. “I don’t think somebody can go to a skating instructor and say ‘I want to skate like Kirill Kaprizov.’ I think that’s just the way he started doing it when he was younger. And like straight line A to B it doesn’t look like he’s gonna actually get there . . . but when he does get there and he starts in the tight areas or going around in circles that’s when it’s wow really something to see.”

Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy also adheres to the “either you got it or you don’t” philosophy of truly dynamic skating.

“I may be dating myself here a bit” he mused “but it’s like asking why aren’t there more 9.8-second runners in the 100-yard dash” he said. “There’s only so many guys that have that elite [skill].”

Cassidy believes the great ones mix in an abundance of fast-twitch muscles balance and strength.

“They’re just special players” he added. “Yeah of course they’ve worked at it. But I know guys that have worked on the ice and skated you know hours and hours and hours and they’re not going to have that ability to change speed or have open-ice speed. Call it God-given. Call it parent-given genes and I just think it separates the very elite from the elite right?

“Because I mean there are some guys McDavid skates away from that are elite skaters in this league. So it just tells you he’s in a category by himself.”

Ditto Kaprizov who was chosen 135th by the Wild in the 2015 draft after a humble first year in the KHL (31 games 4-4—8) with his hometown team (Novokuznetsk) in southwest Siberia (again kids if you’re good they’ll find you no matter where you’re hiding). Unlike most draft picks he opted for a slow track to the NHL despite repeated offers from a string of GMs including Chuck Fletcher Paul Fenton and Guerin.

Finally last summer after three highly productive seasons with Red Army (leading CSKA in scoring last season) Kaprizov signed his NHL deal. To guarantee Kaprizov would be here this season Guerin made it a two-year pact that included burning last season as time played. All of which means Kaprizov will be back in a matter of months for what promises to be a very lucrative second contract.

“When he got here I texted Chuck Fletcher” said Guerin noting that Kaprizov was drafted during Fletcher’s tenure there as GM. “And I just said ‘Chuck I don’t know how you did it but you guys drafted one hell of a player . . . I just want you to know this kid is spectacular.’ One great piece of drafting right there.”

OLD SCHOOL

Sutter’s style sure to light a fire

Darryl Sutter seen here with the Kings in 2018 is now coach of the Flames. Mark Humphrey

Darryl Sutter was named the Flames’ coach on Thursday night replacing former Bruins assistant Geoff Ward. Bruce Cassidy was still in his mid-20s when he came under Sutter’s coaching watch in the minors first in Saginaw and then Indianapolis both of them working their way up the ladder in the Blackhawks system.

“He really drilled down on habits away from the puck” recalled Cassidy who was part of Sutter’s 1990 IHL championship squad in Indy. “I was an offensive puck mover so for me it was a bit of a shock because I was used to just getting rolled out there.”

Such details such as shot blocking and full-sheet defense are “not always fun” noted Cassidy and he wasn’t enjoying the game as much as he had in the past. Until the winning. Victory brings its own pleasure.

“All of a sudden you have success as a team you feel you’re building your game . . . we end up beating a team that was probably more talented than us” he added. “So you walk away and you take away some of that in the moment but years later you realize that he saw a championship — even though in the minor leagues — he saw the ability to win by playing the right way.”

In retrospect said Cassidy Sutter instilled accountability in each player and showed how it helped the team at large.

“Then as a coach” said Cassidy reflecting on now Sutter’s style influences his own “how do you relay those messages and details to your players while getting them still to enjoy the game? Which is the challenge because usually it’s not fun to tell a guy some of the hard things to do the checking the things that don’t necessarily show up on the scoresheet. And how to build your team into a cohesive group.”

Sutter could be gruff which is woven deeply in the Sutter family DNA and those lessons came “with some tough love” said Cassidy.

“I think Darryl has a big heart always wants to do right and has the players’ interests at heart” he said. “Gruff coming across with his message but as you get to know him he is one of the funnier wittier guys I’ve ever been around — hopefully for him and Calgary they can get to where they want to get to.”

Flames management no doubt is banking on that tough love shaking a mediocre (11-11-2) team from the doldrums. Unvarnished truth can be a tough sell with today’s players.

“There are some things in how society and the game have changed that maybe you could get away with back then” said Cassidy. “I don’t know if ‘get away with’ is the right word because I don’t want to paint Darryl with the wrong bush — I don’t think he did anything inappropriate. It’s just different messaging how you got through to guys [30 years ago] is a better way to put it. He was by himself. There wasn’t use of video. So there was a little more hard work in practice to get to and more direct conversation.”

Lucic joins select company from Bruins

Milan Lucic has played in 981 career games entering Saturday. JONATHAN HAYWARD/Associated Press

Milan Lucic a man whose particular set of skills no doubt will be appreciated by the new guy behind the Flames bench next month should become only the 14th draft pick in Bruins history to reach the 1000-game plateau.

Looch the 50th overall pick in the 2006 draft on Saturday night was scheduled to play career game No. 982 with the Flames in Edmonton.

The affable-yet-menacing Lucic also stands as the last Bruins draft pick to crack 1000 penalty minutes (1143). Terry O’Reilly (2095) wins that category — lock stock and sin bin.

The next Boston draftee to crack 1000 games should be David Krejci (928 after Friday’s matchup with the Capitals).

Krejci if he signs a contract extension next season would become only the fourth Bruins draft pick to play 1000 games with the Black and Gold following Ray Bourque Don Sweeney and Patrice Bergeron. Bergeron today is the lone draftee among the 13 to have played all of his games with Boston.

Ivan Boldirev born in what was then Yugoslavia and drafted in 1969 did not get his name on either of the Bruins’ Stanley Cup titles in 1970 or ’72. He spent all of 1969-70 in Oklahoma City and appeared in only two games with the talent-laden varsity the next season. He made the 1971-72 squad but after 11 games was dealt to the California Golden Seals for Rich LeDuc and Chris Oddleifson. Combined they played fewer than 100 game for the Bruins

The complete list of Bruins draftees to reach 1000 games (stats as of Friday):

NHL has to pick right spot for draft

The first round picks of the 2020 NHL Draft were displayed on last year's board. The 2021 draft is scheduled for July 23-24. Mike Stobe/Getty

The annual NHL Draft remains a go on the books for July 23-24 in Montreal but some league GMs feel as if the annual talent pull would be better if rolled ahead to later in the year (November or December) or scrubbed entirely in which case the Class of ’21 would fold into what everyone hopes will be a 2022 draft staged in June (per standard NHL programming).

The case for postponing: Many leagues — college junior and European — have had schedules disrupted or scrubbed this season because of the pandemic leaving scouts challenged to get full reads on the incoming stock.

The case for going ahead as planned in July: Some portion of the 18-year-olds will have submitted solid work this season and they’re ready and eager to learn their destiny even if only a handful have a shot at landing an NHL job in 2021-22.

As of Friday of the 217 selections in the 2020 draft only the Senators’ Tim Stutzle and the Rangers’ Alexis Lafreniere had played this season. Only seven picks in the 2019 draft had logged 10 games or more.

Loose pucks

The next five weeks will be full of trade talk leading up to the April 12 deadline. One factor to keep in mind though it could change is that Canada insists on a two-week quarantine period for anyone entering the country. If any of the North Division’s seven Canadian clubs are importing talent be it from the United States or Europe they’ll have to wait to work the player into their lineup. The regular season ends May 8. No telling what it will mean in the overall trade market but it could encourage some of the Canadian-based clubs to deal earlier allowing more time for players to adjust to their new teams . . . Following a visit to Long Island on Tuesday the Bruins are back on Causeway Street for another pair (Thursday and Saturday) vs. the Rangers who look like they’ll be jousting with the Penguins for the final playoff seed in the East. Meanwhile Rangers left wing Chris Kreider is scoring like never before carrying a 13-2—15 line into weekend play. He had eight goals including a pair of hat tricks in his last five games through Friday night. The ex-Boston College Eagle who turns 30 next month never has topped 28 goals in a season . . . Through 20 games the 12-5-3 Bruins compiled 367:09 in lead time and trailed for an aggregate 334:24. Tight margins for a club with a .675 point rate . . . Interesting note by NESN pointing out that Charlie McAvoy’s scoring (3-12—15 into Friday night) had him on pace to deliver the best punch back there since Bourque put up a 20-62—82 line in 1995-96. McAvoy’s pace over an 82-game season would deliver almost 62 points. Bourque that season landed 390 shots on net second only to Jaromir Jagr’s 403. McAvoy hit the net 40 times in his first 20 games an 82-game pace for 164. He has a good shot one he is being encouraged to use more and one he’ll have to use more if he’s going to grow into the role of franchise defenseman . . . The coaching move in Calgary wasn’t a big surprise. A bigger surprise was that the listless Canucks (10-15-2) still had Travis Green on the coaching job . . . If the Sabres get serious about shopping Jack Eichel the Canucks have the kind of assets to swing a deal with Quinn Hughes or Elias Pettersson the starting point . . .

Eaton Company smiles as he addresses Eaton's employees outside the company's flagship store at the Eaton Centre in Toronto on Aug. 15 1997.Kevin Frayer/The Canadian Press

Fredrik Eaton belonged to the fourth – and final – generation to run Eaton’s the family’s department store empire. One of four brothers he had more in-store experience than any of his brothers starting on the sales floor and rising to run the firm from 1977 to 1988. Mr. Eaton who died at home in Caledon Ont. on Feb. 20 at the age of 82 also served as Canada’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in the early 1990s.

Less than a decade after Mr. Eaton’s tenure as chairman president and CEO of the T. Eaton Co. Ltd. the once-dominant retailer sought bankruptcy protection having fallen out of step with the times. The company had been thrashed by its competitors including Sears and Walmart which arrived in Canada in 1995. In response Eaton’s had made the mistake of aiming for the high-end market.

The department stores were sold to Sears and the Eaton family’s name was removed.

It is hard to imagine now two decades after the company’s demise but from the end of the 19th century to almost the close of the 20th century the Eatons were among the most famous families in Canada considered business and social royalty.

As recently as 1992 the family was listed on the Forbes richest list with an estimated wealth of US$1.2-billion.

Their retail chain boasted as many as 14 main stores usually the anchor of a shopping centre and 42 smaller outlets across Canada; in 1960 they had 45000 employees. They also co-owned the Toronto Telegram newspaper and from 1960 were the principal owners of CFTO the richest private television station in Canada.

Eaton’s was more than a collection of stores; it was a Canadian institution.

One innovation was its mail-order catalogue which was first printed in 1884 and distributed at Toronto’s Industrial Exhibition (later named the Canadian National Exhibition). The first issue was text only but within three years it began including illustrations of some goods for sale. It was a brilliant idea for a predominantly rural country with a population of 4.8 million in 1891. The Canadian Pacific Railway completed in 1885 could deliver goods across the country.

The Eaton’s catalogue which was offered in French as well starting in 1910 figures prominently in Roch Carrier’s famous 1979 short story The Hockey Sweater. The tale is based on a real-life incident when Mr. Carrier was a hockey-loving kid in small-town Quebec. When young Roch’s red Montreal Canadiens sweater wore out his mother ordered a replacement from the Eaton’s catalogue and a blue sweater of the arch-rival Toronto Maple Leafs arrived instead. In real life and in the story the boy was ostracized for wearing the enemy’s sweater. The story became such an important piece of Canadiana that a pictorial reference to it appears on $5 bills printed between 2001 and 2013.

Another Eaton’s practice was to manufacture its own goods including clothes cutting out the middle man and making the family even richer.

Fredrik Stefan Eaton was born in Toronto on June 26 1938 the second son to John David Eaton who owned and ran the Eaton’s department store chain and the former Signy Hildur Stefansson. The spelling of Fredrik Stefan’s given names reflected the Icelandic heritage of his mother who came from the Icelandic community in Gimli Man. His brother Thor who died in 2017 also had an Icelandic name.

The family business was founded in Toronto in 1869 by Fredrik’s great-grandfather Timothy Eaton an immigrant from County Antrim in Northern Ireland. The original shop grew into a department store and kept expanding. By 1900 the company employed 2500 people and the Eaton family owned mansions in Toronto farms in the country and houses on Lake Rosseau in Muskoka where they kept a large fast yacht to travel from the train station to their lakefront property.

Timothy Eaton died in 1907. His son Sir John Craig Eaton ran the store from 1907 to 1922 and his son John David Eaton owned and ran the T. Eaton Co. from 1942 to 1969. Professional managers ran the company during the in-between years.

Fredrik known to his family and friends as Fred first visited the downtown Toronto store in May of 1945 when he was nearly seven years old with his father and older brother John Craig to celebrate the end of the Second World War. Young Fredrik went to Upper Canada College then the University of New Brunswick where he studied philosophy and earned a bachelor of arts. He worked briefly as a police reporter at the Toronto Telegram which his family co-owned.

His first job at Eaton’s was in the children’s department; he then crossed the country to work at the Eaton’s store in Victoria then moved to the buying office in London England. Finding the goods to fill department stores across Canada and supplying the Eaton’s catalogue was a complex business and Eaton’s had buyers in major European capitals. The store prided itself on being able to source goods that Canadians couldn’t find elsewhere.

When Fredrik returned to Canada from his stint in London he managed the Don Mills store in suburban Toronto. During the time he served as chairman president and CEO the Eaton Centre mall in downtown Toronto opened in 1977. The nearby College Street store closed and sales were higher than expected at the Eaton Centre outlet. In 1988 Fredrik’s younger brother George became president; Fredrik remained on the board until 1991.

Eaton’s first sponsored a Santa Claus parade in Toronto in 1904. In 1913 it brought caribou from Labrador to pull Santa’s sleigh. Eaton’s sponsored similar parades in Winnipeg and Montreal. Eaton’s ended its sponsorship of the Toronto parade in 1982 and other corporate interests took it over.

As the most public of the four Eaton brothers Fredrik was in demand to lend his support and money to many causes and organizations. On the volunteer side among other things he was chancellor of the University of New Brunswick president of the Toronto General Hospital which his family first supported early in the 20th century and the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) where he was president from 1984 to 1986.

Nance Gelber whose family had a long connection with the AGO recalls asking Mr. Eaton a question at the annual general meeting where no one ever asked probing questions about why the gallery never used any of the newer art it had stored in the basement.

“I felt the gallery was a little stiff and should open itself to a wider public and tourists” Ms. Gelber said. “[Mr. Eaton] promised to get back to me and he did. I thought he cared about the gallery and had a real interest in it.”

On the corporate side Mr. Eaton was on many boards including the Toronto-Dominion Bank where the T. Eaton Co. banked for decades. He was on the board of Conrad Black’s Hollinger though the two men long-time friends fell out when Mr. Eaton left the board as the company faced legal troubles.

A long-time supporter of the Progressive Conservative Party Mr. Eaton was named High Commissioner to the United Kingdom by prime minister Brian Mulroney in 1991.

“There were lots of people who wanted the post. I chose Fred because he was a royalist and I knew he would represent Canada with dignity” Mr. Mulroney told The Globe and Mail in an interview. “Fred and Nicky did a tremendous job. He also had the means to travel and entertain much more than a civil servant would. Fred Eaton was the illustration of the perfect gentleman.”

Mr. Eaton used his business contacts to help Canadian firms.

“My father worked hard to promote ties between British and Canadian business” his son Fredrik said. “What he enjoyed most in his time in London were the people he met.”

When Mr. Eaton returned to Canada in 1994 he was still a director of the T. Eaton Co. but was not running it. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1997. The following year the company went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange but the money raised did not help. In 1999 Eaton’s declared bankruptcy and the chain was sold to Sears. The Eaton name was taken off the stores in 2002.

The company’s problems began before Fredrik Eaton was born according to Rod McQueen who wrote an unauthorized book on the family The Eatons: The Rise and Fall of Canada’s Royal Family. The company voluntarily returned the wartime profits it made to the federal government Mr. McQueen wrote which weakened the company. “By the end of the Second World War” he wrote “the [Eaton’s] factories were so decrepit they would never recover.”

Mr. McQueen also contends that management at the company became so bloated after the war that it “hobbled the decision-making process.”

Fred Eaton gave a four-hour interview to Mr. McQueen the only one of the four brothers to speak to him. None of them was happy with the final product.

Mr. Eaton was an officer of the Order of Canada a member of the Order of Ontario and had honorary doctorates from the University of New Brunswick and Queen’s University in Belfast. He was a member of a number of clubs including the Caledon Mountain Trout Club. He also enjoyed salmon fishing on the Restigouche River.

The Bishop the Right Reverend Peter Eaton consecrated Trinity Chapel and celebrated the first Eucharist with the school’s Chaplain the Reverend Dr. Mary Ellen Cassini concelebrating. At a time when so many in church leadership are faced with the closing of places of worship this historic occasion serves as a sign of hope. “The consecration of Trinity Chapel at the heart of one of our great schools is a sign that the Christian faith is alive and well in our diocese” said Bishop Eaton “It is also a sign of the flourishing of our ministry of education.”

Head of School Patrick Roberts and Chairman of the Board Hugo Mantilla participated in the service along with Ms. Tina Lane the Reverend Jennie Lou Reid and Benjamin Reid one of the Vice Chancellors of the diocese and students who are siblings Megan and John Keller. There were also musical contributions by students and faculty. The service was conducted according to the current safety protocols necessitated by the pandemic.

At the heart of this service are several important segments the first being the recognition that places have the capacity to mediate the holiness beauty and presence of God.

According to Dr. Cassini the building of this chapel is the fruit of a long-cherished dream and the efforts of many. Standing as a symbol of the school’s Episcopal identity Trinity Chapel has been made possible by the generosity of benefactors who had the vision of a sacred place for the community to gather. This sacred place is also dedicated in honor of the first Head of School of Trinity Episcopal School the Reverend Dr. Edward “Ned” Dougherty to recognize his commitment to the school community in its early years. An icon of the Hebrew Testament Trinity often called the Hospitality of Abraham will be placed in the chapel.

Chairman of the Board Hugo Mantilla said “This chapel at the heart of our school campus reminds us that God is present in the midst of us all the time and that the life of the soul is as crucial as the life of the mind the life of the heart and the life of the body. This service also reminds us that we are able to worship freely and openly without fear of persecution or ridicule. And this service reminds us that God is ready and waiting eagerly to live in a relationship of love joy and delight with each one of us.”

Head of School Patrick Roberts: “This sacred space will be a place where our alumni and others can celebrate weddings anniversaries baptisms and other special events in their lives”

This chapel is dedicated to the Holy Trinity to which the School is also dedicated. Christians have come to understand the being of the one God as Father the Son and the Holy Spirit who are intimately related in an eternal relationship of creating redeeming and giving life to the human family and all creation.

A church building is usually divided into four sections. The entrance area is known as the narthex. The body of the church is called the nave which comes from the Latin word for ship and refers to the idea that the Church is a vessel that helps transport souls to God. There is a choir section or chancel. Finally the focal point of the building is the altar area called the sanctuary.

Palmer Trinity School—a coeducational Episcopal day school—is dedicated to promoting academic excellence that integrates knowledge compassion global citizenship and social responsibility. Providing a supportive environment Palmer Trinity School serves students from a broad range of socio-economic ethnic and religious backgrounds in grades 6-12.

A cold blooded killer may not have known he had shot the wrong man until after the victim's identity came to light.

Victim Craig Eaton was gunned down on February 24 2004 on the way to a friend's house.

Police believe the murder was a case of mistaken identity.

Earlier in the evening Craig had been at the pub with a friend and was walking along Molyneux Road Kensington near to the junction with Mallow Road when he was fatally shot.

The 22-year-old who was a children’s carer at Alder Hey Hospital had been out mourning the loss of one of his patients on the night he was killed.

Two days before his tragic death two-year-old Michael Tierney who had been in Craig’s care had died.

The youngster was left blind with cerebral palsy and epilepsy after being starved of oxygen during his birth and a catalogue of errors by medical staff left him needing round the clock care.

Craig was only too happy to care for Michael and he was often seen curled up in the youngster's hospital bed making him laugh and playing games with him.

Therefore when the toddler died Craig was heartbroken and had been at the pub with his friend on the night of his murder to commiserate the little boy's death.

However on his walk home just after 11.15pm Craig was mercilessly shot twice and left in a pool of blood by his killer.

Despite the best efforts of passersby he was pronounced dead on his arrival at Royal Liverpool University Hospital.

Bus passengers could hold key information

On the night of the murder it is believed that Craig who was wearing a black cardigan over a light blue shirt black trousers and black shoes got on the number 26 Arriva bus on Belmont Road.

He travelled to Sheil Road Kensington and was sat near to the front of the bus. It is believed that Craig got off at the bus stop on Sheil Road just before the junction with Molyneux Road between 11.05pm and 11.15pm.

Detectives believe there were other passengers who stayed on the bus when Craig got off. A number of the passengers have been identified but detectives would like to speak to the other passengers who were on the bus as they may have information which could be vital.

A Ford Mondeo seen near the murder scene

Detectives are also trying to trace the movements of two cars which were in the Molyneux Road area on the night of Craig's murder

The first car a dark green Ford Mondeo registration number Y723 RJA with a brake light in the middle of the rear window is believed to have been parked on Molyneux Road at the junction with Gilroy Street around the time of the murder.

After the murder it is alleged the Mondeo was seen driving along Molyneux Road past the scene of the shooting and turned left in to Mallow Road.

The car was then seen turning left onto Malvern Road and left again onto Malden Road before back in to Molyneux Road.



The Ford Mondeo was recovered by police on Wednesday 3 March 2004 at the junction of Apollo Way and Barker Way Anfield.

It had been stolen from outside Lancashire Motor Radiator Company Limited Great Homer Street Kirkdale between 2pm and 2.30pm on Monday 23 February 2004.

Detectives are appealing to anyone who may have any information about the Mondeo particularly its whereabouts from the time it was stolen on Monday 23 February 2004 and when it was found on Wednesday 3 March 2004.

Movements of a Silver/ light blue Volvo 740 GL saloon



Detectives are also appealing for more information about a silver / light blue Volvo 740 GL saloon car (registration G690 NFR) believed to have been in the Molyneux Road area around the time of the murder.

This car also had a brake light in the middle of the rear window and had a blowing exhaust which made a distinctive noise. It is believed the car had been sold on the day of the murder.



Again detectives are trying to establish the movements of this car on Tuesday 24 February 2004 until it was seized by police on Friday 27 February 2004.

They would also like to speak to the previous owner of the car as he/she may have valuable information.

Case of mistaken identity

The murder of Craig baffled Merseyside Police as there was no clear motive.

Inquiries ruled out the kind carer having had any enemies and he was not involved in any criminal enterprises.

One line of enquiry was that Craig had been murdered in a case of mistaken identity and had not in fact been the killer's intended target.

Detectives believed Craig's mystery killer had followed him from the pub and struck when they were both alone in the street.

Only when the gunman saw his victim slump to the floor and he got close if he ever did would he have realised it was the wrong man.

Officers at the time and still believe he was followed by his killer and was almost certainly the innocent victim of a gangland hit gone wrong.

In the relatively early stages detectives spoke to two people who came forward believing they were the intended target including one man who matches Craig’s description and one man who was later ruled out of inquiries.

In July 2004 Liverpool coroner Andre Rebello ruled the victim had been unlawfully killed and appealed for help to catch those responsible.

In 2009 Craig's brother Lee described him as ""funny kind and the perfect brother and son"".

He told the ECHO: “He just loved being with his mates and working at Alder Hey. He never troubled anybody.

“I think it’s hard for the family to know that somewhere in Liverpool somebody knows who killed our Craig.

“Somebody is hiding that person and it just doesn’t make any sense to us.

Sadly Craig's heartbroken mum Denise died within a year of her son's murder never seeing justice for her child.

Kevin Clague Head of Merseyside Police's Serious Crime Review Unit said: ""Craig’s death remains an absolute tragedy and it is now 17 years that his family and friends have had to live without him and without justice.



""Craig was an incredibly caring individual who loved his job looking after ill children at Alder Hey Hospital and on the day he died he was coming to terms with the loss of one of the children who he had been caring for.

""He was so affected by the loss of the child that he went out with a friend and was walking to another friend's home when he was shot.



"" As a result of our investigations we believe the person who murdered Craig is involved in serious and organised crime and 17 years on we know there are still people out there with information on this despicable murder.

""Allegiances change over time and I hope that anyone with information seriously reconsiders withholding this and finds it within themselves to come forward.

""Craig’s family deserve to see justice done and the cowardly individuals involved put before the courts.



“Time should never be a barrier to obtaining justice and I would like to encourage anyone with information that could assist our enquiries to imagine themselves in the heart-breaking position that Craig’s family have been in for all this time and contact us.”

If your financial situation changes an item isn't what you thought it was or several other reasons you may want to cancel a bid on eBay. Here's how to do it as long as the rules you must follow.

Cancel Bids More Than 12 Hours Before Auction End

Provided there are more than 12 hours before the associated auction ends you can cancel or retract any bid you place on eBay. That said it's stipulated by eBay you can only retract a bid if:

You've accidentally bid the wrong amount (e.g. $900 instead of $9).

The seller has ""significantly"" changed the description of the item.

The seller isn't responding to your messages.

In practice it's possible to retract bids even if none of these circumstances apply.

How to Retract a Bid on eBay

With this warning in mind you can complete the retraction by navigating to eBay's Retract Bid webpage. To do this you can either access the retraction form or you can navigate to eBay's Help pages and go to the section on retracting bids where you can find an alternative newer link for retracting bids.

In cases where you use the old retraction form here's what you do:

Open the retraction form. Enter the item number of the item on which you've mistakenly bid. Choose your reasons for canceling from the Your explanation of the retraction drop-down menu. Select Retract bid.

You can also retract bid's on eBay by navigating to its Help pages. Lifewire / Simon Chandler

How to Cancel a Bid on eBay via the Help Page

And here's how you retract a bid via eBay's Help pages:

Select Help & Contact from the left-hand side of the menu bar at the top of the screen. Type Retracting a bid into the search bar. Select Retracting a bid when it appears. Select the item for which you'd like to retract a bid. It will be under the Retract your bid subheading. Select Continue. Choose the appropriate reason for canceling your bid. Select Continue. Select Retract bid.

Cancel Bids Less Than 12 Hours Before Auction End

It's also possible to retract an eBay bid when an auction is scheduled to finish in under 12 hours. However a few differences apply in such cases.

For one you can retract bids only within an hour of having made them. In other words if there are less than 12 hours before an auction ends any bid you place during this period must be retracted within an hour of making it. Assuming this condition holds you can then go about retracting exactly as described in the section above.

You can also contact the seller to ask for a bid cancellation. Lifewire / Simon Chandler

How to Cancel a Bid by Contacting the Seller

Nonetheless there is in fact one way in which you can attempt to have a bid canceled even when an hour or more has elapsed. To do this you have to contact the seller and ask for them to cancel the bid:

Go to the item's listing and select Contact Seller. Select Other from the Select a topic menu. Select Contact the seller. Enter a topic heading then type a message requesting bid cancellation and your reasons for wanting to cancel the bid. Select Send a copy to my email address if so desired. Type the verification code shown in the image then select Send.

You can also contact the seller in cases where the auction has more than 12 hours left to run but your reason for wanting to retract your bid isn't recognized as valid by eBay.

How to Remove a Bid on eBay's Mobile App

Retracting a bid on the eBay mobile app is pretty much identical to retracting a bid on the eBay website. You can go to the retraction form or you can follow the process below.

You can retract bids using the eBay mobile app by going to Help & Contact. Lifewire / Simon Chandler

Dr. Seuss books listings,"News is circulating that eBay are removing listings for ‘hurtful and wrong.’ Dr. Seuss books some of which were selling for thousands after publication was ceased by Dr. Seuss Enterprises’.

The following titles are being pulled from the marketplace due to their racist depictions of non-white characters:

And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street

If I Ran the Zoo

McElligot’s Pool

On Beyond Zebra!

Scrambled Eggs Super!

The Cat’s Quizzer

It seems that although the books are not being ‘banned’ or ‘canceled’ removing them from the marketplace is the right thing to do and helps the Dr.Suess company maintain their commitment in ensuring Dr. Seuss Enterprises’ catalog represents and supports all communities and families.

If you have any of these books and decide to list them you might end up having your listings taken down. Despite eBay trailing through the marketplace to remove the books many listings are still up and by the looks of it daring sellers are still attempting to cash in on and list the books even after the mass removal was announced.

Removing discrimination on marketplaces

As can be expected in modern times the removal of racist discriminatory or hurtful products from online marketplaces is becoming more common. We are advocating for a safer more connected world where hate is not tolerated. Big companies such as in this case eBay and the Dr. Seuss Enterprises can have an impact in making that change happen and are an important part of the process.

That being said the selling of products that are seen as discriminatory brings up much controversy. For instance these books being ceased from publication is one thing but when you can still find ‘Golliwog’ books and toys a character that has been publically stated as racist it begs the question as to whether eBay will be able to maintain the takedown. It’s likely they would if a listing was reported but still leaves room for listings to seep through when not.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zcG9ydHNsb2dvcy5uZXQvMjAyMS8wMy8wNy9jbGV2ZWxhbmQtYnJvd25zLTE5NDYtdGhyb3diYWNrLWplcnNleS1sZWFrcy1vbi1lYmF5L2Zvb3RiYWxsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cleveland Browns' 1946 Throwback Jersey Leaks On eBay – SportsLogos.Net News,"Back in January Cleveland Browns executive vice president and co-owner J.W. Johnson announced the team will wear alternate uniforms during the 2021 season as part of the team’s 75th anniversary celebration.

“We will have an alternate uniform this year so all the uniform heads out there that try to come up with them on social media can have a little fun now if they’re listening to see what they can come up with” Johnson said. “We will have a nice alternate to be able to present to everybody at some point for the 75th anniversary.”

It was unclear at this time what direction Cleveland would go with the throwback uniforms especially since the Browns’ look has remained relatively consistent throughout their history. But eBay user “originaljersey81” the same person whose listings include the Cincinnati Bengals’ new jerseys gave us our first glimpse of the throwback jersey on Sunday afternoon.

The white jersey features Cleveland’s traditional striping pattern but also includes brown numbers with an orange drop shadow replicating the uniforms the Browns wore in their inaugural season in 1946. It also includes a special football-shaped patch with that year on the left shoulder.

The most interesting part of the leak is that Cleveland wore white helmets from 1946-51 but the Browns won’t be able to recreate the full look unless the NFL relaxes its one-helmet rule. Could that be a sign of things to come? We’ll see.

Let’s find out.

The beginning: digital art

With the advent of the digital age almost every form of art has been digitalized. The fact that now almost everything can be traduced in zeros and ones and can be accessed wherever you are whenever you want has meant that art reaches billions of people expanding worldwide.

With the improvement of technologies digital artists are now able to recreate virtual environments and incredible visual effects impossible to reproduce in the real world. Images videos and music have been fully digitalized delivering stunning virtual experiences; an example has been Tomorrowland NYE edition where Tomorrowland’s team has recreated virtually the whole festival letting fans party from the comfort of their house.

This worldwide access to art tho has made lose that exclusivity for example when you bought a unique painting. This is where NFT comes in but how?

NFT (non-fungible token) what it is and how it has been applied to digital art?

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a special type of cryptographic token which represents something unique. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and many networks or utility tokens that are fungible in nature. This is what Wikipedia says but in easy words what does it mean?

Basically an NFT is a unique digital certificate of ownership. It is usually linked to a digital object and the token if you own it certified that you are the one and only owner of that digital object. This is possible thanks to blockchain and its ability to provide proof of authenticity and ownership of the digital object which in our case is digital art.

How NFT works?

As explained above NFT needs a network to work. Most of the NFT uses Ethereum blockchain to work. Even if Ethereum is a cryptocurrency the network that uses the blockchain also supports NFTs storing extra information. This information that can be stored works differently from an ETH coin and can be used to “create” and “manage” NFTs. The Ethereum network is one of the blockchains on which the NFT can work.

Now the question is: why and how we can apply these concepts to the actual art?

The answer is as simple as effective: every NFT is unique and linked to a digital object. This means you have actual proof you’re the one and only owner of that object. You may state that an image a video and basically every digital object can be copied and stored billions of times. Yes but the NFT can’t. Owning the token makes you the unique owner of that digital object. To put this in perspective everyone can buy a print of any famous painter or a sculpture of famous artists but only one person in the world will have the original one: in the digital world that person is the owner of the NFT linked to that digital object.

NFT in the music industry

NFT was firstly implemented with visual digital art; videos and images created in a digital way were the first to be sold as NFT but as soon as every digital object can be associated with an NFT artists and producers in the music industry started to implement this new system as well. To name a few Space Yacht was one of the first in the dance music industry to get into NFT.

3LAU launched a special campaign for his Ultraviolet album where only 33 non-fungible tokens were created. Each of them gave the opportunity besides being recognized as one of the few unique owners of the album a special edition physical vinyl unreleased music and unique experiences. Because the drop was in the form of an auction the top bidder will be able to collaborate with 3LAU and give creative input on producing a brand new 3LAU single. The 2nd through 6th bidders will be able to choose two dance songs to be incorporated in a custom 3LAU mix.

Friends!!! I just wanted you to know! I designed & animated the song NFT visuals myself! New student of professor @grimemonday 3 hours left! https://t.co/XNZpmgxGzM pic.twitter.com/gFzaDCb8qR — ▽ (@3LAU) February 27 2021

The money impact in the NFT

There’s no doubt that part of the “NFT hype” is also to be attributed to the quantity of money involved and there’s nothing wrong with it. Because of the uniqueness of the token and the high demand when it comes to famous (but even not-so-famous) artists’ products the sale takes place through an auction. 3LAU with the exclusive launch of his NFT album reached the incredible feeling price of 11.6 million dollars and it’s not uncommon to see prices with 4 zeroes.

We have to keep in mind that the abovementioned examples are the highest bids that happened in the last weeks; you can still win an auction for a couple of hundreds of dollars.

Is all that glitter gold?

Even if NFT seems a revolution for the digital creative world it has its big problems and controversies. First of all there’s an environmental impact. The creation the transaction the network and the actual bids need electricity to work.

Because NFT is mainly based on the Ethereum blockchain it shares the same issue when it comes to power efficiency.

The Ethereum blockchain currently uses Proof-of-work (PoW) which allows the Ethereum network nodes to agree on the state of information recorded on the blockchain. As the name suggests and to make it easy to understand the network stores data in blocks that are connected like a chain. The blocks basically contain the transactions on the network and are processed resolving complicated algorithms on decentralized nodes. Because the successful creation of a block is paid in Ethereum coin nodes race and fight to solve a new block. The problem is that although potentially millions of miners may compete to solve a block there is only one winner. The computation and energy consumption used by the rest of the miners who did not solve the block is essentially wasted.

Surely NFTs are a small percentage of what happens on the Ethereum blockchain currently but the discussions about if it’s worth it or not is still in place. If you want to know more about the environmental impact of NFT and Ethereum blockchain in general you can find a very well-written article on loop-news.com.

NFTs works and ethic

The ethic behind selling works via NFT is a topic that appeared recently especially when it comes to the music industry. If with visual products it was the norm to sell 1-o-1 for example a painting with music the matter is more complex. We have been used to buy music from our favorite artists and most of the time streaming the songs even for free and the fact to have certain music products unique creates a new situation in the industry.

An interesting conversation happens some days ago between Lane 8 and RUFUS DU SOL about the matter with Lane 8 stating that “excluding the normal fans who built me up in the first place” won’t be the right move just because you can sell your art for way more money. RUFUS DU SOL answered that “the two worlds aren’t mutually exclusive” adding that “It’s the token not the art that is owned by the buyer.”

Daniel the two worlds aren’t mutually exclusive. You can release music whatever the ‘normal’ way is and still explore tokenising certain pieces of your art while making those pieces of art widely available to ALL. It’s the tolken not the art that is owned by the buyer. — RÜFÜS DU SOL (@RufusDuSol) March 4 2021

What you just outlined seems like a much more equitable approach. I think artists should own their art and do what they want with it. Nothing against those who are doing this nft thing; that said it’s not for me — Lane 8 (@Lane8music) March 4 2021

Conclusion about NFT

Surely this new way to sell and deliver artistic products is exciting and interesting. We are still at the beginning of what could be a revolution in the art and creative field and everything is still possible. Like every new thing there are PROS and CONS that can be improved so we just need to wait and see what’s next."

JESSICA SONG/THE VARSITY

On May 17 1921 Frederick Banting and Charles Best began their summer project at the University of Toronto in the Connaught Antitoxin Laboratory which was run by John James Rickard Macleod. Less than a year later Leonard Thompson a 14-year-old boy suffering from Type 1 diabetes became the first patient to be successfully treated with insulin injection.

The discovery of insulin by Banting and Best was a watershed moment in the history of diabetes since the condition was essentially a death sentence for children before 1922. Today people with diabetes can manage their blood sugar and lead fulfilling lives because of insulin.

It is undeniable that Banting and Best have altered the lives of many people with diabetes since 1921. As U of T celebrates the 100 year anniversary of their achievement reviewing the timeline of events shows how Banting and Best owed their discovery of insulin to many researchers who came before them.

How it all began

The history of the discovery of insulin began in 1869 when Paul Langerhans a medical student in Germany identified the so-called ‘islets of Langerhans’ in the pancreas — groups of cells responsible for insulin production.

At the end of the 1800s French scientist Eugène Gley demonstrated that a pancreatic extract was able to reduce blood glucose levels in dogs without a pancreas. This was followed by the work of Eugene Lindsay Opie in 1901 which showed that destruction of the islets of Langerhans caused diabetes.

Armed with this new knowledge scientists spent the next two decades trying to isolate the mysterious compound from the pancreas with little success. While they knew that the islets of Langerhans were the sources of the anti-diabetic extract scientists at the time faced the challenge of separating these islets from the rest of the pancreas.

This was when Banting entered the picture.

Inspired by an article he read on pancreatic duct binding Banting came up with his own experiments and approached Macleod in 1920 with his plan. Macleod agreed to lend him his lab space at U of T and a student assistant 22-year-old Charles Best.

Banting designed a new technique to occlude the pancreatic duct which enabled further procedures to be carried out without destroying the islets. Banting and Best found that in dogs without a pancreas the preservation of the islets was sufficient to prevent the development of diabetes.

By July of 1921 the two had successfully isolated the elusive anti-diabetic extract that had evaded others for so long — insulin. With the help of the biochemist James Bertram Collip they were able to produce a safe and stable version of insulin for use in humans. On January 11 1922 14-year-old Thompson received an injection that would allow him to live for another 13 years.

Distribution in Canada and beyond

Nothing illustrates the importance and urgency of insulin than the speed of its distribution.

Although the Connaught lab was producing insulin for all Canadians in 1922 it did not have the capacity for global demand. To manufacture the newly discovered insulin on a large scale the governors of U of T came to an agreement with the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly & Co of Indianapolis in the spring of 1922. Macleod also started to share his recipe for insulin with other physicians in the US who used it for clinical and experimental purposes.

In October 1922 Danish Professor August Krogh and his wife Mary Krogh a physician who took care of patients with diabetes brought insulin to Denmark. In November of the same year Canada gifted the patent of insulin to Great Britain and Ireland. By May 16 1923 Britain became the first country to make insulin commercially available.

Then the agreement between U of T and Eli Lilly came to an end in June 1923 allowing for other manufacturers to acquire the right for insulin production. Insulin was finally made commercially available in the US and Canada on October 15 1923. By 1924 insulin was distributed in countries all over the world.

Diabetes in the modern day

A century after its discovery insulin continues to be an integral part of the lives of people with diabetes. For them management of their blood glucose is critical since uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious complications such as kidney failure blindness and nerve damage.

Since insulin’s discovery a century ago scientists have been improving its pharmacological profile to mimic its natural secretion. We now have short- and long-acting insulin and even insulin pumps that can be programmed to release insulin according to the wearer’s mealtimes.

However despite these advancements complete insulin replacement remains elusive.

To control their blood glucose level people with diabetes approximate natural insulin secretion with stringent glucose monitoring and insulin injection as appropriate. They must also adjust other behaviours such as dietary choices and physical activities.

This regimented lifestyle can be exhausting. Marley Greenberg a fourth-year student and the president of the College Diabetes Network at U of T has been living with Type 1 diabetes since she was eight years old. For her diabetes is a full-time job.

“I’m constantly checking my blood sugars giving insulin on my pump and counting every carbohydrate I eat” she wrote in an email to The Varsity. “Stress and hormones can make my blood sugars go high and there’s really no way of knowing how much insulin I’ll need to balance out things like exam-season stress.”

“Something as simple as walking from one class to another can make my blood sugars go low. There’s so many factors to consider and there’s never a break from management. The psychological weight of diabetes can be heavy and many people experience burn-out.”

Greenberg also emphasized the importance of peer support especially for young people with diabetes.

“Type 1 diabetes often feels like an invisible illness and it can be misunderstood and isolating. I’ve found that connecting with other young adults with diabetes is one of the best sources of support” she wrote. “That’s why we run the College Diabetes Network chapter at U of T to help students feel less alone. Sharing the mental weight of diabetes with people who get it can make this condition feel a lot lighter.”

The cost of insulin

Banting Best and Collip sold the patent for insulin to U of T for $1 following the success story of Thompson.

“Insulin does not belong to me; it belongs to the world” said Banting at the time.

Yet contrary to Banting’s vision insulin does not belong to everyone today. In fact many of the 11.5 million Canadians living with diabetes cannot afford insulin despite it being a life-saving treatment.

Since Canada does not have a nationwide pharma care plan to cover insulin costs many Canadians pay out of pocket to obtain insulin. In Ontario adults aged 25 or older who lack private insurance must pay out of pocket for insulin and many people still struggle to afford this life-saving drug.

According to Diabetes Canada people with diabetes can be expected to pay anywhere from $1100–$4900 per year depending on the types of insulin that they use. This does not include the cost of other diabetes supplies such as blood glucose strips and glucose monitoring devices.

Those who cannot afford the costs have to choose between insulin and paying for their food or rent. Last year professor and physician IIana Halperin tweeted about a 26-year-old graduate student at U of T who was having difficulty paying for her insulin. The student was no longer qualified for Ontario’s drug coverage plan and had depleted her university insurance.

Halperin wrote that the student was rationing insulin by taking just enough of the drug to prevent her from going to the hospital but not enough to sufficiently manage her blood glucose levels.

Greenberg and her family also experience the financial strain of insulin treatment. Greenberg’s mother Dana Greenberg who also lives with Type 1 diabetes described the immense costs of paying for both of their diabetes supplies over the years in an email to The Varsity. “Having no private health insurance the financial burden of keeping Marley and me not just alive but healthy is enormous. In 2021 people with diabetes shouldn’t still be struggling to afford insulin.”

Policies around diabetes need to catch up with scientific innovations. Unless we solve the issue of accessibility there will be no real progress for people living with diabetes.

The story of insulin began over 100 years ago but it is nowhere near finished. Today millions of people around the world are writing the next chapter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxmaXJzdG1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9tZWdobmEtYWdhcndhbC1hLWRyZWFtZXItYmVoaW5kLXRoZS13b3Jrc3BhY2UtdHJhbnNmb3JtYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meghna Agarwal: A Dreamer Behind the Workspace Transformation,"The story of Meghna Agarwal’s journey from a small-town girl in Alwar Rajasthan to becoming an entrepreneur is an inspiring one. It gives a valuable message – if you are persistent in your efforts and chase your dreams; you are bound to inspire others to follow your path. Meghna was only 25 when she co-founded HirePro Consulting. She was at the helm of the manufacturing industry with her next venture UltraFine Minerals. Then she and Rishi co-founded IndiQube a co-working space provider that onboarded companies like Bluestone KPMG Freshmenu Cohesity & TMF at the initial stages.

Meghna and Rishi secured a USD 15 Mn Series A round of funding in a matter of time scaled up IndiQube to six cities 3.5 Mn SQ.FT. & 50+ properties. Now IndiQube is ranked #20 in Economic Times India’s Growth Champions 2020 & Ranked #112 in the Financial Times list of 500 high growth companies in the Asia Pacific region. Onboarding large enterprises such as Myntra Philips and companies like Hitachi and Eli Lilly Elanco are among the many milestones surpassed in this journey.

“Space has always been close to my heart and I understood how space worked for diverse companies. I found that millennials and startups face challenges like volatility high Capex and long-term leases from traditional landlords during my entrepreneurial journey. It instigated me to start my journey with IndiQube as the flexible workspace provider catering to the holistic needs of Enterprises Offshore Development Centers SMEs and Startups” shares Meghna. With large clients buying into its vision in the very initial days coupled with the positive feedback they received about their product Meghna’s belief in this model was reinforced and IndiQube got the ammunition to go big in this space.

The journey to the top

“In a career spanning nearly 15 years from HirePro Consulting to IndiQube I have had many learning opportunities. The most important lesson that I have learnt from these opportunities is the importance to ‘Balance Time and Speed’” says Meghna. While it might sound simple Meghna knows that the timing of your decision and the speed with which you execute your decision makes all the difference. She adds “Even if you miss out on either time or speed you are bound to miss the bus.”

Fortunate to have a supportive ecosystem – both at work and home – Meghna considers her core team as her family. For her just like a typical family there is no hierarchy in interactions among the team as they are always focused on a common goal – the need to grow together as one single family. Meghna opines “When you fully trust a core team and encourage them to work together and build a result-oriented culture the team often comes up with innovative solutions.” From the very outset Meghna believes in the concept of ‘learning together.’ She ensures employee interactions especially with the core team are at a “Peer-to-Peer” level rather than as a boss and a subordinate. “These sorts of interactions created an environment of constant learning on both sides. It has led to the creation of a culture of learning together. When the core team is such closely knit with the leadership team each of us inspires the other” adds Meghna.

Carrying on Innovation amidst the Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a host of challenges to business leaders across industries. It has increased the need for business leaders to be conservative with costs flexible with business models and empathetic with employees all at the same time. “Commercial real estate has been one of the sectors that have got impacted significantly due to the increased adoption of Work From Home. Our occupancy rate that was 90 per cent pre-COVID-19 slumped to 75 per cent during the pandemic with many firms vacating their office spaces to save costs in the early part of the year” shares Meghna. However once the initial euphoria around working from home started to diminish enterprises realized that office spaces would continue to remain an integral part of professional life.

“We have realized that in the post COVID era enterprises will be more cautious about their commercial real estate costs and would prefer flexible workspaces that minimize their exposure to high Capex and long-term leases” says Meghna. IndiQube has now come up with innovative solutions around Walk to Work Satellite Offices Distributed Centers and Remote Working solutions to cater to enterprises’ unique needs. The company has also invested heavily in technology to develop on-demand solutions like Hot Desks Pre-booked Parking Slots and Smart Meeting Rooms. “The pandemic has taught me many lessons on Crisis Management the importance of flexibility in business models client relationship management in addition to the vitality of employee productivity and wellbeing” she adds.

Women in leadership roles in India

Globalization increased awareness emphasis on education for girls have led to a marginal increase in women’s leadership opportunities; however there is still a long way to go. While government initiatives have increased emphasis on girls’ education at the grass-root level Meghna believes that it is upon each of us to ensure that women pursue higher education in prime universities to equip them with the necessary skills for senior management roles.

Shedding light on women leaders in real estate space Meghna says “commercial real estate is tough and highly competitive. There are very few women like me in leadership roles in this space. So to all the women readers I urge you to instil in your mind the fact that ‘You can have it all.’” She believes that gone are the days where women had to always choose and prioritize one passion over the other. There should be an increased emphasis among women to develop leadership skills at the grass root levels. In addition to this women should also acquire skills pertaining to emotional intelligence self-awareness change management and problem-solving.

To all the women reading this says Meghna “Follow your dreams there would be many hurdles on your path and each hurdle would teach you a new lesson but do not stop dreaming and don’t let anyone dictate what you can and can’t achieve.”

Plans for Tomorrow

Currently IndiQube has successfully established leadership positions in the startup and IT hubs of Bangalore and Pune and began operations in other metros of Mumbai Hyderabad Chennai & Noida. From the building perspective the team at IndiQube is focusing more on integrating IoT and further strengthening its Smart Building Experience. “A key focus area for us has been on sustainability. We have started installing solar rooftops and should be having 4 MW of power generated from solar rooftops. 80 per cent of power consumption in Bangalore is targeted to be drawn from solar” claims Meghna.

Over the next two years IndiQube plans to reach 120000+ seat capacity. Beyond that the aim is to add at-least 30000 seats year-on-year. On the one hand this growth will be fueled by a deeper penetration in existing cities 70+ micro-markets in Bangalore Pune Chennai Hyderabad Noida and Mumbai. On the other hand the team at IndiQube has plans to expand into Tier II & Tier III centres by leveraging partnerships and exploring acquisitions of smaller players in these markets. The company is also looking to expand its Value-Added-Services to strengthen its position as a one-stop-solution for clients. “We are also planning to raise INR 300 crore this calendar year from equity investment to further our expansion plans” concludes Meghna.

The New Orleans Advocate/The Times-Picayune reports that the complaint was filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by the Louisiana Public Service Commission the New Orleans City Council and the Arkansas Public Service Commission.

The utility regulators argue that $800 million Entergy spent to upgrade its Grand Gulf Nuclear Station in Mississippi hasn’t improved the plant’s safety record and performance compared to other nuclear power plants. The utility also charged customers more than $361 million for power it had to purchase when the deficient station was offline the regulators said in the complaint.

They argued Entergy should refund customers the power costs as well as the cost of the 2012 upgrade which was passed on to ratepayers — more than $1.1 billion. And the regulators said other potential costs were due to Entergy lapses that “can only be identified upon further investigation.”

The regulators also want the federal regulatory body to force Entergy to run the plant more efficiently and to add a requirement that any major capital improvement be reviewed before it begins.

If the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission agrees refunds could eventually show up on customers’ bills as credits.

“Entergy customers deserve a full look at the potential imprudent management of Grand Gulf and eventually appropriate refunds if it is found that Entergy passed unnecessary costs onto those customers” said Craig Greene chairman of the Public Service Commission.

The complaint didn’t specify how big those credits might be for all of Entergy’s 3 million customers across Louisiana and Arkansas.

“Grand Gulf is the single largest energy resource for the city of New Orleans and we need it to be operating safely at full capacity and at a reasonable cost” said New Orleans City Council President Helena Moreno.

Entergy pointed to investments made at Grand Gulf over the past year and described more recent problems with its operations but didn’t address past issues brought up in the complaint.

In a statement the company said: “In late 2020 the plant experienced operational issues related to that upgrade including unplanned shutdowns and time spent off the grid. We’ve worked to identify the related issues implemented a maintenance outage and conducted additional training for our team.”

Entergy generates and distributes electric power to customers in Arkansas Louisiana Mississippi and Texas. The utility relies on a mix of nuclear power natural gas solar coal and purchased power to serve customers.

The Grand Gulf station in Port Gibson Miss. is the largest single-unit nuclear power plant in the country. In 2012 the 36-year-old station was upgraded in a bid to increase production by more than 13%. But according to the utility regulators’ complaint the station never delivered the extra capacity promised. Regulators also say its performance in recent years has fallen far below industry standards.

In November the Nuclear Regulatory Commission the federal agency that inspects nuclear power plants targeted Grand Gulf for additional oversight after the plant had unplanned emergency shutdowns earlier in the year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub2xhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL25ldy1vcmxlYW5zLWJhdG9uLXJvdWdlLWFyZWEtcGVvcGxlLWluLWJ1c2luZXNzLWZvci1tYXJjaC03LTIwMjEvYXJ0aWNsZV9mZjk5OWEyNC03ZGM5LTExZWItYjgyZS1kZjk2MTQwNDg4YzQuaHRtbNIBmQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub2xhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL25ldy1vcmxlYW5zLWJhdG9uLXJvdWdlLWFyZWEtcGVvcGxlLWluLWJ1c2luZXNzLWZvci1tYXJjaC03LTIwMjEvYXJ0aWNsZV9mZjk5OWEyNC03ZGM5LTExZWItYjgyZS1kZjk2MTQwNDg4YzQuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Orleans Baton Rouge area People in Business for March 7 2021,"You have permission to edit this article.

The Electric Highway Coalition – made up of Southern Company American Electric Power Dominion Energy Duke Energy Entergy Corporation and the Tennessee Valley Authority – wants to collaborate on a network of DC fast chargers from the Atlantic Coast through the Midwest and South and into the Gulf Coast and Central Plains regions.

Southern Company and the others are each taking steps to provide EV charging solutions within their system service territories. The announcement represents an unprecedented combined effort to offer EV drivers convenient charging across different utility footprints and allow uninterrupted travel.

The Edison Electric Institute estimates 18 million EVs will be on U.S. roads by 2030. While many drivers recognize the benefits of driving an EV such as the ease of low-cost home charging some have expressed concern with the availability of charging stations during long road trips. With collaborative efforts like the Electric Highway Coalition energy companies demonstrate to customers that EVs are a smart choice regardless of distance.

The coalition will provide drivers with effective efficient and convenient charging options to enable long-distance electric travel. Sites along major highways with easy access and amenities for travelers are being considered as coalition members work to determine final charging station locations. DC fast chargers can get drivers back on the road in 20-30 minutes.

“At Southern Company we are committed to being a leader in building a clean and sustainable energy future for our customers and that includes continuing to increase the reach of electric transportation for more and more drivers” said Chris Cummiskey executive vice president chief commercial officer and customer solutions officer at Southern Company. “By increasing the number of EV fast-charging stations across our footprint we are providing drivers with additional transportation options that are reliable efficient and more convenient while helping reduce carbon emissions for the benefit of our communities we serve.”

Being a founding member of the Electric Highway Coalition is another part of Southern Company’s larger focus on electrification of the transportation industry and commitment to sustainability and clean energy. Along with the systemwide goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 last year Southern Company announced an internal fleet electrification goal where the company plans by 2030 to convert to electric 50% of its electric companies’ fleet vehicles in the auto/SUV/minivan forklift and ATV/cart/miscellaneous equipment segments.

The Electric Highway Coalition welcomes interested utilities to join as it seeks to extend the reach of network. Additionally its members support and look forward to working with other regional utility transportation corridor electrification initiatives.

Commentary by Patrick Duffy | President | Houston

Last January we predicted steady growth for the Houston economy barring a “black swan” event and mentioned the “new Corona Virus in China” as an example. Little did we know that the virus would end up being the Godzilla of black swan events. On the heels of what had been a very robust economic expansion the virus and the global governmental response of massive shutdowns created one of the most dramatic economic crashes in the history of the world. U.S. GDP dropped an unprecedented 31.4% in Q2. While we saw a substantial recovery in the U.S. in Q3 (also an unprecedented 33.4%) and continued recovery in Q4 the lockdowns continue in many states. Most companies in the office sector are still in a work-from-home posture with their employees. Government and Federal Reserve Bank stimulus efforts continue to attempt to mitigate the permanent damage to the underlying economy caused by the virus and associated responses.

Houston had to Cope with a Double Impact

We had the same lockdown approach as most large metro markets and the global shutdowns reduced oil and gas demand by approximately 15% resulting in the lowest oil prices in history. In April of 2020 oil traded at a NEGATIVE $40 per barrel. The U.S. and Canadian rig counts historically averaging approximately 1500 active rigs dropped to 278 in June before “recovering” to 410 at year-end. With only one-third of average rigs active the companies engaged in engineering and oilfield services that support the upstream energy sector were hit very hard.

The good news is that energy demand is projected to surpass supply through year-end 2021 and oil prices have recovered to the high $40s per barrel as of this report. All indications are that we will see oil prices with upside pressure as reserves tighten and new production gradually comes online. This bodes well for the energy sector to see some stabilization and recovery in 2021.

Small businesses especially restaurants and local “mom and pop” retailers have been hit the hardest by the lockdowns with companies moving their employees to work-from-home and out of the typical high-density office markets. These small businesses depend on walk-in traffic which even with the lockdowns partially or entirely removed are still missing the usual client base supplied by nearby office users. Estimates of permanent closures for small businesses are in the 20% range nationally and Houston seems to be following that trend.

The Federal Reserve has signaled that they will continue to be accommodative with close to zero interest rates and liquidity injections as may be required through 21. The incoming administration has signaled massive plans for new spending and unfortunately potential tax increases; however it is unlikely that tax increases will be implemented before 2022. These supportive monetary and fiscal positions should continue to fuel recovery in 2021.

Other states notably California are losing companies and residents to Texas. The recent relocation of Hewlett Packard to Houston is a prime example. We expect this trend will continue to the benefit of Texas cities including Houston. Provided the vaccines prove effective and the global economy continues a steady recovery we believe the bottom has been reached in Houston and that 2021 will see moderate job growth and continued economic recovery. The jury is out on the long-term impacts on inflation of all the money printing that we have seen over the past several years. Real estate has long been a strong inflation hedge and will continue to be an asset of choice for those looking for returns and inflationary hedge over the mid-term.

Population Houston ranks among the leading metropolitan areas in the U.S. in population growth and is the fourth largest city and the fifth largest Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in the nation. Houstons’ MSA consists of nine counties and as of 2020 the region’s population increased by 7.6% since 2015 growing by 507666.

Houston’s MSA ranks fourth among U.S. cities with the most Fortune 500 headquarters with twenty-two on the list. Four of the top five are in the energy industry.

Business Climate

Houston has long been recognized among the most competitive U.S. cities for corporate relocation and expansion activity and is internationally recognized as the global energy capital. The Houston-Woodlands-Sugar Land region operates the largest petrochemical plants in the U.S. the Houston Ship Channel. In addition to its diverse industries and educated/skilled workforce a key factor underscoring Houston’s business appeal is the fact that it is one of the least expensive major U.S. cities in which to conduct business. Significant benefits include the absence of state or city income taxes no state property tax as well as a moderate cost of living index. Houston’s strategic location and core strengths including an expanding healthcare sector cutting-edge medical advancements technological breakthroughs across industries and strong import/export trade activity uniquely position it to play a vital role in meeting national and global market demands. Houston has and will continue to stand as a global leader among U.S. metros and the world.

SAN ANTONIO — ""Times are tough"" is a cliché that's never been truer – especially when it comes to personal finance. For those who may have lost their job because of the coronavirus pandemic trying to get a handle on their money matters might be especially challenging.

But there's hope in 2021. Although last year Americans had an average revolving credit card balance of $6271 according to research by The Motley Fool there are ways to reverse course. Carrying a high balance for example can negatively impact your credit.

According to The Motley Fool there are 5 things you can do to get a grip on your credit in 2021:

Here are tips from Chris Wong Consumer Savings Executive at @BankofAmerica on how you can grow your #savings. https://t.co/y6ovXtMvqm — The Ascent by The Motley Fool (@TheAscentMoney) March 2 2021

1. Get a free credit report. Normally you're entitled to one free copy of your credit report from each major bureau – Experian Equifax and TransUnion – once a year. But through April of 2021 you can access your report for free every week.

2. Set a budget to improve payment history. Being on time sends the message to lenders that you're trustworthy and responsible so it's important to work on improving your payment history – it carries the most weight of the various factors that go into calculating your credit score.

3. Lower credit utilization. A ratio of 30% or less is helpful to your credit score whereas a higher ratio will harm it. That's why it's important to keep tabs on your existing credit card balances to make sure you're not going overboard.

4. Check your credit score. Some credit cards provide a free FICO score – the industry standard.

5. Use a balance transfer card to wipe out interest until 2022. Balance transfer credit cards are a great way to save money while you pay off debt. This type of credit card offers a low introductory APR – many even start with a 0% APR.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZGVidGNhbWVsLmNvLnVrL2NvcnJlY3QtY3JlZGl0LXJlY29yZHMtbGVuZGVyLWFkbWluaXN0cmF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Correct credit records by ""suppressing"" them if the lender has disappeared","If you feel that your credit report is wrong the normal first step is to ask the lender to put this right.

But when the lender is in administration the administrators may not respond to requests from you to correct your credit files. And if the lender has been liquidated there is no-one for you to contact.

Here the Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs) should help if you ask them to. Incorrect reporting is against the data protection rules.

Dos don’t and better options

Do not ask for a record to be supressed if the lender is still going. This is not a short cut it will just waste your time. Complain to the lender instead (not the CRA).

Do send the complaint to the administrators first if is not too late to make a claim. The suppression process should only be used if you missed the deadline to claim it is not a quick alternative to making a claim as the the CRA will ask the administrators about your request and the administrators will reject it.

D0 use this suppression process when the administrators agreed to correct your credit record but failed to do so.

Do not think this will clean up your credit record if the debt was sold to a debt collector. Suppressing the record will only affect the credit record with the lender. You will need to complain separately to the debt collector if their record is wrong.

Problems that need correcting

Some of the possible reasons for an incorrect credit record include:

the debt has been settled but it still shows as open;

the lender had agreed to delete the credit record or to remove the default before administration but didn’t do this;

identity theft – you never took that debt out in the first place;

the default date isn’t correct or the dates of missed payments arent correct or the payments you made were not correctly reported.

You may feel the lender should have not have given you the debt as it was unaffordable but it is too late to make a claim in the administration. In this case it is usually simpler to complain about one of the above problems.

The error may be showing on the records of more than one CRA. So you need to check the Statutory Credit Reports from Experian Equifax and TransUnion.

You need to check those CRA reports not other reports such as ClearScore or Credit Karma because you want to talk directly to the CRA not through a third party.

First ask the administrators

It is best to first ask the administrators to correct any problem. If this works it will be the fastest option for you. Check the lender’s website to find how to contact them.

For affordability concerns you should send the administrators a Claim. If this is upheld the administrators will correct or delete the credit record.

Sometimes the administrators will refuse saying you need to contact the CRAs.

But if this is late on then you will not get a reply. For example the Sunny administrators have passed the point in the administration where they reply to CRAs. And Wonga has been liquidated – there is no one anymore to contact.

In this case you can go to the CRAs and you can say you have tried to resolve the problem with the lender but they don’t reply or there is no-one to contact.

Will the CRA correct this?

This is what Experian says about correcting data – Equifax and TransUnion say similar things:

We can only change this information once your lender has told us about it or with their permission.

But when the CRA asks the administrators they are unlikely to get any response… So the CRA has a problem – it can’t leave inaccurate data on your credit record and it can’t correct it unless the lender agrees.

The CRAs get round this by “suppressing” a record. If they do this the record still exists but it will not be shown to lenders who make a credit check on you.

Ask the CRA to “suppress” the record

Contact the CRAs where the problem is showing:

Experian – select Get in touch about > Errors on my Experian Credit Report > I think there’s an error with an account;

Equifax – select Do you still have questions then log in to your account (you will have created one when you asked for a copy of your Statutory Credit Report) and complete the form;

TransUnion – go through the Disputes process.

Tell the CRA:

which records are wrong listing the individual loans.

explain what is wrong and that you have asked the administrators to correct this on dd/mm/yy but they have not replied/told you to talk to the CRA. Or say administration has ended and the lender no longer exists;

ask the CRA to “suppress the record” as it is incorrect.

If the CRA refuses (or sends an irrelevant response such as saying the account will be deleted six years after the settlement date) explain again what the problem is and why you need the CRA to suppress the record.

Be persistent – this seems to resolve the problem in the end. Say you want to make a formal complaint if necessary.

The final option if you make a formal complaint and the CRA rejects it is to send the complaint against the CRA – not the original lender – to the Financial Ombudsman. I haven’t come across anyone having to do this when they have asked for a record to be suppressed.

Evidence that may help your complaint

Sometimes there is evidence to support what you are saying.

For example you may have reported identity theft to Action Fraud and have been given a crime reference number. You may have the email from the lender agreeing to delete the record or remove the default.

But sometimes there may be little or no evidence or it may be complicated.

It isn’t clear how much effort the CRAs will put into investigating these complaints. But if your complaint goes to the ombudsman they may ask you for some evidence.",,,,,,,,,

The house located in the Roxbury section of Boston is where Malcolm spent his teenage years living with his half sister fellow civil rights icon Ella Little-Collins according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation a D.C.-based nonprofit organization.

With the new designation the house will be considered in all federal planning may qualify for federal grants and will be eligible for tax provisions to rehabilitate the building.

Malcolm and his sister moved into the house in 1941 when Little-Collins gained guardianship of Malcolm who rose to be a prominent Black leader who was a spokesman for the Nation of Islam during the 1950s and '60s. He was known for encouraging people to fight against racism with whatever means were necessary.

After Malcolm was shot and killed in 1965 Little-Collins never returned to the house according to the National Trust although she maintained ownership of it until her death in 1996. Her son Rodnell Collins has since owned the historic building.

Nobody has lived in the two-and-a-half-story house located at 72 Dale Street for more than 30 years according to the National Trust and Collins is working on redeveloping the building so that it can be used as living space for graduate students who are studying African American history social justice or civil rights.

""Transforming the historic residence where Malcolm X spent his formative years into graduate student housing would provide an innovative model for sites across the country"" the National Trust says on its website. ""The rehabilitation would not only restore an important part of American history but transform an underutilized structure into an active and vibrant part of the surrounding community.""

The house was added to the National Register on February 12 for its local and national significance according to the National Park Service.

The Malcolm X–Ella Little Collins House in Boston MA was listed in the National Register on February 12 2021 at the... Posted by National Register of Historic Places - NPS on Thursday February 18 2021

Along with its connection to Malcolm X and Little-Collins the National Register for Historic Places said the property is ""significant"" for ""its demonstrated potential to provide information about 18th-century farm practices within the landscape context for Roxbury and for its later 19th-century development as a streetcar suburb of Boston.""

In 2016 the city of Boston conducted an archaeological dig at the site of the home and found kitchenware ceramics and other items that dated back to the 1700s. They also uncovered jewelry and toys from the 1970s.",,,,,,,,,

Available from Etsy seller ImagineYourSHELF the quirky kids’ furniture item is handmade from Baltic birch wood and finished with different colors of child-safe paint. Measuring 57 inches high 61 inches wide and 11.75 inches deep it’s available in two variations: with storage in the mane area or with a “closed mane.” A “primed only” option is also available for those who want to add their own creative flair to the whimsical creature.

“Imagine YourSHELF making memories with your (grand)child selecting their favorite book from this beauty for the nightly bedtime story!” says the product description. “It is sure to become the focal point of the room.”

The construction seems to be pretty solid — and with a price range of $1560 to $2235 you’d expect no less. Yes it’s pricey but it has that “wow” factor and it looks like it will last forever. According to the product information page each joint is glued and reinforced with mechanical fasteners for long-lasting durability.

Although the unicorn is sturdy it’s still not recommended that your child climbs onto its back for a “ride.” The package comes with a pair of anti-tipping hardware complete with instructions just in case your child does decide to go on a climbing adventure.

If your unicorn bookshelf budget doesn’t stretch to allow for this beauty there are more wallet-friendly options out there.

For $55 Etsy seller BlibloShop offers a smaller wall-mounted bookshelf shaped like a sweet unicorn head. The shelf is handmade from wood and is available in a wide array of colors.

And this white Wayfair version of a unicorn bookshelf ($173.99) may be smaller than the big one from Etsy but that’s a bonus if space is limited and there are still multiple shelf options for storing all those books and treasures.

Another option from Wayfair ($94.99) isn’t shaped like a unicorn but it will be the top choice for fans of Jojo Siwa who designed a range of children’s bedroom furniture for the retail giant.

The bookshelf made out of solid wood comes in bright colors with unicorn and bow motifs (plus Jojo’s logo of course) has three spacious shelves and comes with a wall mount for safety.

Like a curated list of shoppable Etsy treasures from Iris Apfel.

Whether you’re ready to take a (metaphorical) trip with Bruno Mars and Lacoste or Moncler and Jonathan Anderson this week’s fashion news presents the design-related escapism we need right now.

Bruno Mars (a.k.a. Ricky Regal) dropped a collection with Lacoste

Assuming the vibe (and moniker) of his designer alter ego Ricky Regal pop icon Bruno Mars has teamed up with Lacoste on a nostalgia-inducing assortment of pieces — some of which you’ll spy in the video for his new song with Anderson .Paak “Leave The Door Open.” Mars is quoted as saying” “I’ve been very fortunate to have been asked to do collaborations in the past but it always came with guidelines. Lacoste was the first and only brand that said ‘Bruno you can do whatever you want.’ The respect of such creative freedom coming from a heritage fashion house was an honor.” And just what did his artistic license yield? A variety of bold athleisure-meets-soulful psychedelic looks including patterned shirting tracksuits and a pair of aviator sunglasses. Get ready to croc on when the collection drops Monday March 8.

Jonathan Anderson’s latest Moncler Genius offering launched with a film curation and podcast episode

While working on Spring 2021 designs for the Moncler Genius line London-based creative Jonathan Anderson took inspiration from a nomadic seafaring lifestyle and applied the ensuing spirit of wanderlust to an array of classic silhouettes from outerwear to ribbed knits. To augment the new 1 Moncler JW Anderson launch an inaugural episode of the Moncler Genius Podcast series — featuring Anderson natch — has been made available; it details his creative process and scope of influence. Additionally the streaming service Mubi currently hosts a group of films from shorts to documentaries that explore “the mindset of the perennial traveler” in order to amplify concepts explored within the collection. Bon voyage!

Boasting over 100 happy-making finds from across Etsy’s range of vendors a new assemblage of favourites from the almost 100-year-old fashionista Iris Apfel is available for your consideration. “In otherwise gloomy times I think it’s important to let ourselves indulge in pretty things” Apfel said in a statement about the curation of goods which includes jewellery scarves garments and more. “I’ve always been amazed how a sparkly pair of earrings an interesting ring or a brightly-coloured necklace can transform my mood.” Found amongst the playful picks is a statement collar by Quebec brand Noémiah which won the Global Clothing Prize in the 2020 Etsy Design Awards.

Tommy Hilfiger introduces its first circular denim styles

Created with oversight by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation — a leading voice in the sustainability sphere — Tommy Hilfiger recently heralded the release of seven garments that nod to the importance of creating of a circular economy to combat climate change. The collection comprising five styles of jeans and two denim jackets was conceived as part of the Foundation’s initiative called ‘Jeans Redesign’ and crafted “with durability material health recyclability and traceability in mind” according to a press release from the brand. Details like detachable buttons the removal of metal zippers and using 100% organic fabrics are components of the array’s mindful design approach.

But where they might lack in the quality assurance department they make up for in rock bottom prices. Case in point Electrek found a battery-powered RV on Alibaba with an asking price of just $4800 (though a new listing suggests the price has since been bumped up to $6200).

Tiny RV — A couple of caveats are warranted. This vehicle is small with just two seats up front and three wheels not four — it's not so much an RV as an electric tuk-tuk with some truck space attached at the rear. Its product page even describes the RV as a ""tricycle motorhome."" So you're not going to have a lot of space for the family. A kitchen table in the rear comes down and can accommodate four people but when it's converted into a bed it only fits two.

If you're just going solo however the RV honestly doesn't look half bad. A tour of inside shows a decent enough living space with ample storage electrical outlets and even wood flooring. The rear of the RV has extra storage space accessible from the outside.

With a 120 Ah 7.2k Wh lead acid battery Electrek estimates the vehicle might be able to get a range of around 72-96 miles on a charge. And it only has a top speed of 25mph so you won't be hitting the freeway in this thing.

But it could still be a fun way to go on solo camping trips. Just be prepared to drop anchor outside as the RV doesn't have a toilet.

Live for the thrill — Safety is the probably biggest concern with this vehicle. With just a single wheel up front it seems like the RV is destined for a rollover. Or if you slam the breaks all the weight loaded towards the rear will be hard to stop and the front wheel might not be able to keep traction. Wind could even potentially tip the thing over depending on how heavy the battery is. So you'll have to exercise caution and the RV's low top speed may even be too fast.

These types of oddly shaped vehicles are common in China where current regulations don't cover any vehicles with a top speed below 62mph. The affordable pseudo-cars often replace electric bicycles and other sorts of low-speed electric vehicles that are already popular in the country.

While the electric RV surely isn't street legal in America buyers here would probably be turned off by the extra shipping cost of $2500 anyway. Still it's fun to dream.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoZXNlLWFyZS10aGUtYmlnZ2VzdC1pc3N1ZXMtd2l0aC1jbGFzc2ljLWpkbS1jYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Are The Biggest Issues With Classic JDM Cars,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoZXNlLWFyZS10aGUtYmlnZ2VzdC1pc3N1ZXMtd2l0aC1jbGFzc2ljLWpkbS1jYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

Traveling across the rugged unforgiving and roadless Alaska terrain is already hard enough but whatever comforts mushers previously had in the world’s most famous sled dog race will be cast aside this year due to the pandemic.

In years past mushers would stop in any number of 24 villages that serve as checkpoints where they could get a hot meal maybe a shower and sleep — albeit “cheek to jowl” — in a warm building before getting back to the nearly 1000-mile (1609-kilometer) Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race When the race starts Sunday north of Anchorage they will spend the next week or so mostly camping in tents outside towns and the only source of warmth — for comfort or to heat up frozen food and water — will come from their camp cookers.

""It’s a little bit old school” said Iditarod CEO Rob Urbach.

This year’s Iditarod will be marked by pandemic precautions a route change no spectators the smallest field of competitors in decades the return of one former champion and the swan song of a fan favorite all against the backdrop of pressure on the race and sponsors by an animal rights group.

The most noticeable change this year will be no spectators. The fan-friendly ceremonial start in downtown Anchorage which draws thousands of people has been canceled and the actual start in Willow of the race is being moved to a boat dock 7 miles (11 kilometers) out to help cutdown on fans who would normally attend the race start just off a main highway. Urbach is encouraging fans to watch the race start and finish live on TV or on the Internet.

The route has also been shortened to 860 miles (1384 kilometers). For the first time in the race’s 49-year history the finish line will not be in Nome.

Instead mushers will go from Willow to the mining ghost towns of Iditarod and Flat and then back to Willow for the finish. This Urbach notes was the original vision of the race co-founder the late Joe Redington.

Howard Farley 88 of Nome remembers that well. He disagreed with it in the early 1970s when Redington proposed it and he’s against it now.

He said he told Redington before the first Iditarod in 1973: “There’s nobody in Iditarod. It’s a ghost town. There’s nobody there to clap. I said ‘Just bring it to Nome.'""

The Iditarod could have easily and safely held the finish in Nome again this year too he said.

“It just makes me sad that all of our work and all of our prayers down through the years have come to this” Farley said.

Since the mushers will have to double back to Willow for the finish they will go over the Alaska Range twice. Mushers will have to navigate the dangerous Dalzell Gorge and the Happy River Steps or a series of steep switchbacks that routinely leave competitors bruised and sleds broken.

In an effort to prevent the spread of the virus the Iditarod will skip most of the communities to help prevent any transmission leaving mushers to sleep in tents specially made for Alaska's tough weather or under the stars in temperatures that could be well below zero.

Urbach has had challenges at every turn as he tries to pull off the second Iditarod during the coronavirus pandemic. The virus took its hold on the U.S. in the middle of last year’s race one of the few major sporting events not to be canceled in March 2020 when they learned to deal with the pandemic on the fly.

This year they’ve had more time to prepare. Mushers will undergo vigorous testing and anyone with a confirmed positive COVID-19 test before the start of the race will not be allowed to compete. Additional testing and monitoring will take place on the trail. Any musher with a confirmed positive test during the race will be withdrawn and isolated.

Defending champion Thomas Waerner is not the race telling The Associated Press “it is impossible to plan ahead” during the pandemic. Last year he and his dogs were stranded in Alaska for months because of travel restrictions after his win. They only made it home to Norway after hitching a ride on an airplane that was being flown from Anchorage to its new home at a museum in Oslo.

The race will start with 47 mushers the smallest field in decades. This year’s field includes four former champions including two four-time winners Martin Buser and Dallas Seavey. Buser last won in 2002; Seavey collected his four titles over a five year span ending with his last championship in 2016.

Seavey last raced the Iditarod when he came in second in 2017 when Iditarod officials said four of his dogs tested positive for a banned opioid painkiller. He adamantly denied giving his dogs the painkillers. The next year the Iditarod reversed its decision and cleared Seavey but he took his dogs to Norway to race instead.

At only age 34 Seavey is considered by many to someday match and perhaps surpass the win total of the race’s most decorated musher Rick Swenson who collected five championships between 1977-1991.

“Five would be awesome” Seavey said. “I’m going to do my best to win this. If I get beat which is a pretty likely outcome ... whoever beats me is going to earn it.”

While Seavey returns one of the sport’s most liked mushers is bowing out after this year’s race. Aliy Zirkle 50 announced on her website last month that it was time to retire. Zirkle has finished in the top 10 seven times since 2002 and finished second three years in a row starting in 2012. She has never won.

The individual prize money for the world’s premiere sled dog race hasn’t been determined. Waerner picked up about $50000 and a new Dodge pickup for winning last year’s race. However Chrysler through its Anchorage dealership dropped sponsorship of the Iditarod after that race.

The animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has been applying pressure on national sponsors claiming credit for ExxonMobil announcing it would end its sponsorship after this year's race.

PETA claims the race is cruel to dogs and says more than 150 have died during races since the first in 1973. The Iditarod disputes that number but has not provided its count to The Associated Press despite many requests over the years.

“PETA absolutely makes it challenging” Urbach said.

He said PETA is “inflammatory and grossly inaccurate"" in their approach but admitted it creates a difficult dynamic for the race.

However Urbach said they are trying to change the narrative continuing to promote dog wellness nutrition training and breeding on its website.

The Iditarod has had two other financial hits this year. Because of the pandemic fundraisers have been canceled and they have spent thousands of dollars on personal protective equipment and COVID-19 tests. They also reduced the entry fee in half and reduced the total prize purse by 20% to $400000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0cHRvdXIuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvZmVkZXJlci1kb2hhLTIwMjEtZHJhdy1wcmV2aWV30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roger Federer To Face Early Test In Doha,"Doha

Roger Federer will face an immediate challenge at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open in Doha his first event since the 2020 Australian Open.

The 20-time Grand Slam champion who underwent two right knee surgeries last year will face in-form Frenchman Jeremy Chardy or recent Murray River Open champion Daniel Evans in his return match. Chardy who pushed Andrey Rublev to three sets in Rotterdam on Friday has already reached two semi-finals this year and Evans climbed to a career-high No. 26 in the FedEx ATP Rankings last month.

Federer will be making his first appearance in Doha since 2012. The Swiss owns a 26-3 record at the ATP 250 highlighted by title runs in 2005 2006 and 2011. If he can overcome Chardy or Evans in his first match he could face eighth seed Borna Coric in the quarter-finals. Coric also has form on his side. The Croat has claimed three straight-sets wins en route to the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament semi-finals in Rotterdam this week.

Top seed Dominic Thiem could also face a tough test in his first match of the tournament. The US Open champion will meet Australian Open semi-finalist Aslan Karatsev or Qatar’s Mubarak Shannan Zayid. The 2018 semi-finalist is joined in the top quarter of the draw by fifth seed Roberto Bautista Agut in-form Kazakhstani Alexander Bublik and Reilly Opelka.

The wreckage of FedEx flight 80 at Narita Airport after the crash. (Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives)

On the 23rd of March 2009 a FedEx cargo plane was landing at Tokyo’s Narita Airport when something went terribly wrong. The plane bounced dived into the runway flipped upside down and exploded leaving a trail of fiery wreckage strewn across the airport in full view of passengers in the terminal. Although firefighters hurried to save the crewmembers it was too late: both pilots the only people on board the wide body MD-11 were killed in the crash. What struck investigators was the similarity to another accident nearly 12 years earlier in which another FedEx MD-11 touched down bounced flipped over and burned in Newark New Jersey. That crash had shown that the MD-11 had a nasty tendency to go out of control on landing if the pilots botched the touchdown; as a result new training was implemented. So why after all these years had it happened again? Had some lesson not been learned? The answer would once again change how MD-11 pilots are taught to land this most fickle of airliners.

In 1986 struggling manufacturer McDonnell Douglas announced that it was coming out with a new wide body airliner to compete with the next generation of long range jets by Airbus and Boeing. But while its competitors unveiled the radically new Boeing 777 and Airbus A340 McDonnell Douglas decided on something a little more conservative: a modernized version of its classic DC-10 a three-engine jet originally designed in the 1960s. The updated DC-10 would have a higher seating capacity greater fuel efficiency and a modern glass cockpit with computers assisting in every aspect of flight. Thus was born the MD-11: an airliner which in hindsight was doomed to rapid obsolescence from the very beginning.

The MD-11 was wracked with problems from the moment it entered service in December 1990. Operators rapidly discovered that its promised fuel efficiency was a myth: its range was actually 500 miles short of what had been promised. By the time McDonnell Douglas fixed the issue with fuel consumption optimization software in 1993 the damage was already done. And that was hardly the only issue: pilots were finding that the MD-11 was extremely difficult to fly. It was hard to override the autopilot. When the pitch became unstable in flight the plane would sometimes buck wildly up and down for several minutes before the pilots could regain control. It was easy to deploy the slats in cruise flight by accident. And landing the plane required intense concentration to prevent all kinds of undesirable effects that could manifest on touchdown. Part of the problem was that McDonnell Douglas had given the MD-11 an unusually small horizontal stabilizer in order to reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency. This reduced longitudinal stability and made the plane prone to wild changes in pitch which were in turn harder to counter due to the small pitch control surfaces. It also forced pilots to land the MD-11 at a speed of 154 knots faster than literally any other airliner. McDonnell Douglas had tried to compensate for these issues using software that worked full time to maintain pitch stability by controlling a ballast tank but the computers were unable to completely solve the problem.

Because of all of these problems by the time it had seen ten years in service the MD-11 had developed an accident rate 15 times worse than its contemporaries. And yet there didn’t seem to be one specific reason why this should be the case. McDonnell Douglas and later Boeing which took over its rival in 1997 frequently fixed problems when they arose but there were always more issues lurking under the surface and many of them involved some level of human error which made them especially difficult to root out. The reason for the MD-11’s poor safety record may well have been its basic design characteristics but to acknowledge this would require everyone from the engineers to the FAA to admit that they had designed built and sold an airplane that was fundamentally and irreparably unstable. Besides by 2000 production was wrapping up on the last handful of MD-11s and passenger airlines were already abandoning the type in favor of the Boeing 777. Within a few years almost all the remaining MD-11s would be flying cargo not passengers anyway.

By 2009 the largest MD-11 operator was FedEx Express the airborne division of the well-known logistics company and one of the world’s largest cargo carriers. (Today nearly half of all MD-11s still in service fly for FedEx.) The American company’s purple-and-white MD-11s were and still are a common sight at major airports around the world.

FedEx flight 80 was a regular MD-11 cargo flight from Guangzhou China to Tokyo Japan early on the morning of the 23rd of March 2009. In command of the flight were Captain Kevin Mosley and First Officer Anthony Pino both of whom were quite experienced and had plenty of time on the MD-11. They had been making short- to medium-haul flights all over East Asia for the past week and the flight to Tokyo’s Narita Airport presented no particular challenges.

Flight 80 departed Guangzhou at 2:06 a.m. local time — an unusual departure time for passengers but a normal time for cargo. The three and a half hour flight passed without incident until around 6:40 a.m. Japanese time when the flight was on final approach into Narita.

The weather that day was clear but extremely turbulent. Planes landing ahead of flight 80 reported that while the wind direction was consistent its intensity varied greatly with fluctuations as large as 15 knots above and below the nominal wind speed. For First Officer Pino who was flying the plane this would make landing the already squirrely MD-11 even trickier. Captain Mosley decided that they should use an approach speed ten knots faster than normal in order to ensure that a sudden decrease in the strength of the headwind wouldn’t cause a dangerous loss of lift.

At 6:46 the tower controller cleared flight 80 to land on Narita Airport’s runway 34L. Seconds later an automated voice called out “ONE THOUSAND.” Turbulence rocked the plane sending it lurching violently. “Yeehaw!” Mosley exclaimed. “Ride ’em cowboy!”

“APPROACHING 34L” said the Runway Awareness Advisory System.

First Officer Pino kept fighting to keep their speed near the desired value without success. Their airspeed increased as high as 180 knots and fell as low as 152 knots well beyond the parameters of a stabilized approach. By 500 feet they were supposed to have the approach stabilized — meaning on the proper glide path and at a speed and angle which require only small adjustments to maintain. Despite the gusts of wind throwing them in every direction when the automated voice called out “FIVE HUNDRED” Captain Mosley replied “Stable!” His announcement was met with laughter but both pilots continued on without a word.

The major fluctuations in the plane’s speed and pitch continued right up to the ground. At 198 feet they were at 178 knots; by 92 feet this had fallen to 154 knots. At this low speed and at low thrust the plane started sinking too rapidly so First Officer Pino pulled the nose up to try to gain lift and slow their rate of descent. But as soon as he pulled up the increased drag from the high angle of attack caused their speed to drop even more so he pushed the nose down again. He needed to increase thrust to more easily maintain the desired approach speed of 164 knots but at no point did he do this. Instead he pitched down to about 1.1 degrees well below the normal pitch attitude on approach in an attempt to increase their airspeed.

By the time they reached 50 feet above the runway their pitch was too low and their sink rate was much too high. At this point the autothrottle automatically entered “Retard mode” and began reducing engine power for landing making the problem even worse. Pino should have manually restored power but he was so busy trying to control the plane that he failed to do so.

“FIFTY” said the altitude alert system. The plane kept descending. “FORTY. THIRTY. TWENTY. TEN.” At this rate of descent there was only one second between each of the callouts barely enough time to act. Pino needed to pull up to flare the airplane for touchdown at around 30 feet but he didn’t manage to do so until 20 feet probably due to their rapid rate of descent. Recognizing that he had flared slightly late he pulled up quite sharply causing the nose to rise to 4.6 degrees which was too high. Perhaps fearing that he would cause the tail to strike the runway he immediately pushed the nose back down again.

One second later the MD-11 touched down on runway 34L at a speed of 166 knots — 307 kilometers per hour — with a sink rate of seven feet per second (2.1 m/s) more than three times the normal value. The plane touched down hard and bounced back into the air. When an airliner bounces on landing the pilot must raise the nose and increase power — known as the bounce recovery maneuver — in order to ensure that the second touchdown goes smoothly. The worst possible thing a pilot can do is pitch down — but that’s exactly what Pino did about one second after touchdown. The nose-down input he made right before touchdown was only just starting to kick in when he pushed down even more causing the plane to pitch over to -1.8 degrees. A split second later the MD-11 faceplanted into the runway; the nose gear struck the ground before the main gear causing the nose to bounce rapidly upward. The plane’s pitch increased substantially and they shot back up into the air a second time rising several meters above the runway.

Pino and Mosley were now in a truly critical situation: in just a couple of seconds they would come crashing back down onto the runway with incredible force and only prompt action could save them. Unfortunately they did the opposite of what they needed. When the plane pitched up suddenly on the second bounce the rapid rotation caught Pino by surprise and he pitched down sharply again. From a peak of 6.7 degrees nose up the plane rapidly swung around to nose down. Recognizing his mistake Pino began to pull up again but it was too late. With a terrible crunching sound the MD-11 nosedived into the runway with tremendous force pulling more than 3 G’s in the process. The nose bounced high into the air and the main landing gear slammed into the runway with a sink rate in excess of 21 feet per second (6.5 m/s). The left main landing gear plowed upwards through the wing snapping the wing spar in half instantly. The left wing started to tear away from the fuselage while the right wing continued to generate lift causing a rapid roll to the left. The fuel tanks tore open and a massive fireball erupted behind the plane as the atomized jet fuel ignited. Surrounded by flames the MD-11 began to turn over like a capsizing ocean liner streaking past the passenger terminal in full view of hundreds of people. Inside the cockpit Captain Mosley shouted “Fire! Oh shit!”

“BANK ANGLE! BANK ANGLE!” screamed the ground proximity warning system.

Before the plane had even come to rest the stunned air traffic controller activated the crash alarm and fire trucks were on the scene in under a minute. Firefighters tried to reach the cockpit which appeared to have remained away from the flames but the forward galley was on fire and they were unable to push through. It wasn’t until more than an hour after the crash that firefighters succeeded in breaking into the cockpit by which point both pilots were already dead. Captain Mosley had died of major injuries sustained during the impact while First Officer Pino died shortly afterward due to smoke inhalation. With both pilots dead that made flight 80 the first fatal aircraft accident in FedEx’s history.

When the Japan Transport Safety Board (JTSB) began the investigation it was already looking like this was yet another MD-11 bounced landing accident. There had already been several previous incidents in which MD-11s were substantially damaged due to hard landings including two in which a wing broke off and the plane flipped upside down. One of these occurred in 1997 in Newark New Jersey when FedEx flight 14 touched down hard on landing flipped over and burst into flames. Fortunately all five occupants managed to escape with minor injuries. And in 1999 a China Airlines MD-11 landing in Hong Kong during a typhoon also flipped over and lost a wing killing three passengers while 312 people escaped with their lives. The cause of all these destructive landings lay in the handling characteristics of the MD-11 specifically its unusually high landing speed (meaning more kinetic energy on touchdown) combined with its notoriously fickle pitch controls. Without aggressive recovery measures heavily bounced landings in the MD-11 tended to snowball into fiery wrecks due to a phenomenon called porpoising. In such an event each bounce causes the plane to rise higher off the runway resulting in more energy when it touches down again leading to an even larger bounce until eventually something fails catastrophically. Although porpoising can occur on any airplane the MD-11 was the only airliner on which porpoising had ever led to a wing breaking off and the plane going inverted — an accident scenario which had now happened three separate times.

After the 1997 crash in Newark the US FAA had ordered all MD-11 operators to train their pilots in a newly developed bounce recovery technique. Upon recognizing a bounce the pilots should hold a positive pitch angle while increasing engine thrust to rein in their sink rate allowing the airplane to float down the runway until it touches down smoothly. Both Captain Mosley and First Officer Pino received bounce recovery training in 2006. So why hadn’t it worked?

A review of the flight data showed that the landing began with a relatively normal bounce — toward the upper end in terms of force certainly but not outside what the plane was designed to handle. This bounce had come about because First Officer Pino had been unable to prevent the plane from sinking too quickly while fighting against turbulent winds. It was only after the first bounce that things began to go wrong: instead of pulling up and increasing power Pino didn’t touch the power lever at all and pitched down instead of up. It was at this point that JTSB investigators came to a fascinating realization: due to the way the plane was moving Pino probably never even knew that they bounced. Because the MD-11’s cockpit is unusually far forward of its center of gravity it was not always clear from the front of the plane what the back end was doing. When the main landing gear struck the ground and bounced off the back of the plane rotated upward while the front end continued on its original trajectory. From the perspective of the pilots it would have looked like they had touched down normally and were continuing to roll out with the nose gear on the ground. First Officer Pino probably pitched down after the first bounce in order to lower the nose onto the runway like he would during a normal landing.

All frames from the still-photo security camera (from the JTSB report) compiled into a single video by Chillout Jr. on YouTube.

This in turn led to the second touchdown which was heavier than the landing gear was rated for but not so heavy that it seriously damaged the airplane. This time it was obvious that the plane had bounced but Pino still did the wrong thing: he pitched the nose down again. Despite all his training the surprise effect overcame him and when the plane pitched up suddenly he instinctively countered it with a large nose-down input that sealed the fate of the airplane and its occupants. Although he quickly realized his mistake and began what might have been an abortive attempt at a bounce recovery maneuver (the flight data recorder registered an increase in engine thrust as well as an increase in pitch just before the third touchdown) the window of opportunity to prevent catastrophe was already gone. In the end the FAA-mandated training had proved unable to overcome a dangerous base instinct.

Several circumstantial factors contributed to the pilots’ failure to prevent the escalating sequence of bounces. Like so many other accidents fatigue looms large. The sources on this matter are somewhat contradictory: the official JTSB report indicates that investigators don’t know how much sleep the pilots got while NTSB representatives are on the record providing specific numbers. If the NTSB is to be believed Captain Mosley had perhaps four hours of sleep in the day before the accident while First Officer Pino had even less. Following this paltry rest they flew an overnight flight leaving the Philippines at 9:44 p.m. and remaining on duty until landing in Tokyo shortly before 7:00 a.m. The pilots themselves confirmed the negative effects of this lack of sleep and disrupted circadian cycle: 45 minutes before the crash the cockpit voice recorder captured them joking about being fatigued.

Investigators also noted that although both pilots were very experienced First Officer Pino did not have much practice landing the MD-11. He usually flew with relief crews meaning he only took over in the middle of cruise during long haul flights and rarely handled takeoffs or landings. During the previous two and a half years he had flown an average of just 2.5 landings per month far less than was needed to remain proficient.

Now there were three factors coming together: the pilots’ fatigue the First Officer’s lack of experience with landings and the MD-11’s tricky handling characteristics. All of these conspired in just a few critical seconds to cause the accident. Fatigued and lacking in relevant experience Pino had to use his full concentration to control the plane in the gusty winds leading him to neglect their descent rate. Due to the unexpectedly high descent rate he was about one second late flaring the plane for touchdown. Without time for the flare to smooth out their descent the plane hit hard and bounced. That one second between the height where he should have flared and when he actually flared was crucial. Perhaps had he not been fatigued he might have reacted in time. But on under four hours of sleep having been in the cockpit for several hours already there was no chance he could act quickly enough in such a rapidly unfolding situation.

Once the plane bounced these same factors contributed to the pilots’ failure to rein in the porpoising. First Officer Pino’s brain was operating slower than normal and he hadn’t landed much in recent years. This helps explain why his first reaction was an instinctive one rather than what he had been trained to do during the bounce recovery training three years earlier. Further exacerbating the problem was the fact that the special training was only required upon initial conversion to the MD-11 — pilots received it once and that was it. Perhaps if he had been drilled on bounce recovery every year it might have been familiar enough to override his instinct to pitch down.

The JTSB identified three ways that the crash could have been directly prevented two of which lay with the pilots and one with the design of the airplane. First simulations showed that adding a little bit of thrust at as low as 100 feet above the ground would have allowed a completely normal landing. The next most obvious opportunity was after the second bounce when the plane lurched high into the air. By this point the plane was high enough and far enough down the runway that a normal bounce recovery maneuver might have resulted in a runway overrun. But another option existed: going around. Had either pilot accelerated to takeoff/go-around power they could have pulled away from the runway and circled around for another landing attempt. Unfortunately it appeared that neither pilot recognized the danger they were in until it was too late to do this. Had Captain Mosley been more alert himself he might have been able to step in at the last moment and save the plane — but in the event he seemed to be totally unaware of what was going on.

Finally the JTSB identified what might have been the smallest possible change that could have prevented the accident. When the plane touched down for the first time the ground spoilers automatically deployed in order to reduce lift and push the plane into the runway. However they took 1.2 seconds to deploy and as soon as they were fully extended they started to retract again because the plane had left the ground. JTSB computer simulations showed that had the ground spoilers deployed in 0.6 seconds instead of 1.2 seconds the crash actually would not have happened! The dampening effect of the ground spoilers during those crucial six tenths of a second would have had a snowball effect that resulted in a totally different outcome underscoring just how sensitive the MD-11 was to small changes in configuration and attitude during the moment of touchdown. As a result of the findings the JTSB recommended that Boeing find a way to reduce the time it takes for the spoilers to deploy.

The JTSB also looked at why the failure of the main landing gear led to an explosion that engulfed the plane. According to FAA certification rules when the maximum load on the landing gear is exceeded the bogie must tear away from the wing without breaching the fuel tanks. However this requirement assumed an impact in an “upward and aft direction” consistent with striking an object. When exposed to a purely vertical load with almost no aft component like on the accident flight there was no guarantee that the landing gear would break away safely. The FAA stated that this was not part of the test criteria at the time the MD-11 was certified but that by 2009 it had long since started asking manufacturers to prove the gear was safe when overloaded vertically as well as horizontally. Had the MD-11 complied with the modern interpretation of this rule the gear would have sheared away on the third touchdown the left wing would have settled onto the runway and the plane probably would have stayed upright perhaps allowing the pilots to escape before fire consumed the airplane.

One year after the crash of FedEx flight 80 that exact scenario actually happened. A Lufthansa Cargo MD-11 was landing in Riyadh Saudi Arabia when it bounced and impacted the runway so hard that the aft fuselage broke. The plane slid off the runway upright and the pilots were able to escape the resulting fire with minor injuries. This was but one of several hard landings that caused major damage in the period following the Narita crash. By the end of 2010 both the JTSB and NTSB had become quite concerned about the problem: of 14 hard landings on the MD-11 which resulted in substantial damage to the airplane half of them had occurred in 2009 and 2010 alone compared to an equal number during the entire period from 1990 to 2008. Were MD-11 pilots losing their touch?

In 2010 Boeing hosted a conference of MD-11 operators to go over the series of hard landings and crashes and consider what changes might need to be made. The main outcome of this conference was increased emphasis on avoiding high sink rates on touchdown during training and in the manual. Boeing also made a number of alterations to the manual and its associated procedures such as a higher flare height and instructed pilots to go around if they bounce instead of trying to recover. On top of this FedEx introduced a number of new training elements including a module that helps pilots understand how the MD-11’s long body affects the relative motion of the different parts of the airplane improved landing training and a strict emphasis on going around in place of the bounce recovery maneuver; and installed head-up displays on all its MD-11s among other changes. The switch to advising pilots to go around after a bounced landing is especially relevant as it tackles the root cause of the issue: the failure of bounce recovery training to solve the problem of destructive bounced landings. Now instead of a procedure that is only used situationally pilots can apply a solution that is used in numerous scenarios and is practiced frequently. Since this change was implemented major bounced landing incidents on the MD-11 have virtually disappeared.

In addition to these measures and the previously mentioned point about the ground spoilers the JTSB also recommended that the MD-11 incorporate a system to indicate whether the gear is on the ground; that a more robust fire barrier be installed between the cargo area and the cockpit; and that Boeing alleviate the MD-11’s undesirable landing characteristics by any means possible including by preventing large nose-down inputs during touchdown or introducing a system to automatically initiate a bounce recovery.

Today over 100 MD-11s continue to fly all of them with cargo airlines like FedEx — the last MD-11 in passenger service was retired in 2014. Since the 2010 crash landing in Riyadh there haven’t been any more accidents — but the MD-11 remains just as tricky to fly. Back in the day pilots came up with all kinds of disparaging nicknames for it from “Death Star” to “Scud” after the erratic Scud missiles used by Iraq during the Gulf War. Improvements over the years have eliminated the most common ways to lose control outright but the plane is still sensitive slow to respond and easy to overcontrol. One might call the MD-11 a failed experiment although that’s not quite true — it probably still has a fairly long life ahead of it in the cargo industry. But at the same time the story of the MD-11 is a cautionary tale that will probably prevent a plane with similar design characteristics from being built in the future— and not necessarily just due to safety concerns. Indeed when Boeing elected to cease production of the MD-11 in 2000 it was not because the plane was unsafe but because it couldn’t compete economically with its peers. The era of long-range twin-engine jets with docile flight characteristics is doubtlessly here to stay.

debbiepage.iredellfreenews@gmail.com

The recent Troutman Town Council retreat covered a wide range of topics as officials looked to plan for future infrastructure and equipment needs as well as getting updates on ongoing projects.

WATER AND SEWER CAPACITY

With 2000 already approved new homes on the books Town Council members explored options to keep up with water and sewer needs with Town Engineer Benjie Thomas.

Thomas warned that the town will have used up its capacity when approved developments are built out.

Providing service to these new homes would require upgrades of the Westmoreland Road Pump station to double capacity as well as improvements by Mooresville to handle the future sewer flow.

To the north the I-L Creek system has limited flow and the contract with Statesville ends in July of 2023. Inflow and infiltration problems also cause rainwater to use up the capacity as well.

Thomas suggested two solutions — diverting the flow from I-L Creek to Mooresville at an estimated cost of $4 million or negotiate a new contract with Statesville and divert excess flow to Mooresville from the Massey Pump Station and upgrade the Streamwood station at a cost of about $2.2 million.

The water capacity is also in need of improvement. The town purchases half a million gallons of water from EnergyUnited per day with storage tanks holding about 1.3 million gallons.

The current maximum day demand is 500000 gallons per day but future demand at build-out of approved developments would be 1.2 million to 1.5 million gallons.

Thomas said the town will need to purchase more capacity from EnergyUnited or convert the backup Statesville water connection to regular use with improvements to sustain reliability.

In the long term at maximum current buildout of the Master Plan area in 20 years Thomas predicted that Troutman will need 3 million gallons of sewer capacity per day which will necessitate a second connection to Mooresville to increase capacity from 1 million to 2 million gallons per day.

To achieve the additional one million gallons in capacity the town could either add a second connection to Statesville and purchase it or acquire a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit to build a wastewater treatment plant on the Catawba River or Lake Norman.

Thomas warned the town must exhaust all other options before the state would consider a permit.

Water needs will also rise to 3 million gallons per day in 20 years which will require an additional storage tank and purchasing more capacity from Statesville or Mooresville or obtaining a permit to draw water from Lake Norman and construct a water treatment plant.

Town Manager Ron Wyatt suggested that the town pursue deals to increase both capacities with Mooresville or control its own destiny by pursuing wastewater and water treatment plants since Statesville does not seem to be open to future agreements.

Councilman Paul Henkel concurred saying the town needs to not be held hostage over boundary agreements with Statesville.

“We don’t have to knuckle under” he said. “It bothers me because I want to work with neighbors but not be dictated to.”

Mayor Teross Young asked Thomas to research permits and costs and report back to the council.

PUBLIC WORKS

Department of Public Works Director Adam Lippard presented a critical needs equipment replacement plan focusing on replacing a 1998 model jetting machine to maintain sewer lines as well as a plan for maintenance and replacement of submersible pumps.

The jetting truck and trailer mounted vac system would cost about $238000 much less than a $300000 large combination machine used by other municipalities.

Submersible pumps though cheaper and easier to install are not accessible for routine maintenance. According to Lippard they run eight to 12 years and then fail. Six out of 16 of Troutman’s pumps are this type.

Lippard suggested a replacement plan for these pumps recommending they be pulled at eight years and either rebuilt or replaced depending on condition to ensure the integrity of the town’s sewer system.

PLANNING DEPARTMENT

Interim Planning Director Jonathan Wells said his department is continuing its efforts to keep up with development and maintain excellent customer service with land development review and processing.

Permits seem to be picking up and Wells expects the demand to explode with the warmer weather and the lessening of the pandemic. Wyatt said that the town is advertising for a planning assistant in the next two weeks in anticipation of this influx.

Infill development on smaller tracts and empty lots is also on the uptick according to Wells.

Wells said that although 2000 new homes are officially approved to be built in Troutman he expects up to 3000 to be built by the end of the decade with the town’s population tripling.

Maintaining the Troutman Strategic Master Plan and planning for implementation was key to handling this growth according to Wells.

He suggested town officials focus on improving downtown with Lytton Street corridor development implementing Highway 21 improvements solidifying existing and proposed street connections and utilizing small area plans for areas such as Exit 42 the Lake Norman State Park gateway and the downtown area.

Wells also urged the council to explore opportunity areas such as the potential for the fairgrounds site to function as a future tourist destination venue. The town should anticipate its impact and create plans to take advantage of it.

The council should also keep the “pedal to the metal” on transportation planning and implementation to address the already congested Highway 21 corridor as well as future issues.

Wells suggested continued regional transportation engagement with the Centralina Regional Transportation Planning Organization Iredell County and CONNECT Beyond a regional mobility initiative.

He also advised refining the second tier of the recently approved Troutman Alternatives Study especially to clarify connector roads and the Exit 42 interchange redesign.

The Troutman Pedestrian Plan and Troutman Transportation Plan also need updating to reflect current planning boundaries and consolidate multi-use pedestrian and bike paths into one consolidated plan.

Pursuing transportation funding opportunities through grants low cost loans and partnerships is also essential to bringing these plans to fruition.

Getting more businesses and services to Troutman is also important to meet citizens’ needs.

Wyatt suggested rebranding the Troutman Business Council to help drive commercial development. He also plans to connect with a local business owner group that meets on Thursday mornings.

Young also suggested recruiting more smaller businesses and a Mast General Store type store to keep folks from having to go to Mooresville for basic needs though he noted that in previous surveys that residents do not want a lot of “big box” type development here.

A chain restaurant is interested in the old Fifth/Third Bank site and several local entrepreneurs are interested in opening shops on Wagner Street according to Wyatt.

Wyatt said the vacant business locations once available are quickly being snapped up in Troutman and elsewhere. The Iredell Economic Development Council was fielding six or seven business interest calls per month last year but they are now averaging 17 per month.

UPGRADES

The council also discussed several services and projects that are in need of upgrades.

Larry Power of Payroll Solutions in Mooresville presented the services that his company offers that could streamline the town’s payroll human resources job evaluations recruiting scheduling of leave and benefits.

The town can choose which services it desires and receive a proposal to provide those services.

Iredell County Food Lion and 125 other area companies use Payroll Solutions to manage these functions. Wyatt called it “a tried and true system.” He noted the company could improve employee privacy and help with mandated accountability in record-keeping.

Wyatt also presented the council with a proposal to do a much-needed redesign and update of the town’s website with GovOffice. The new website would be easier to update and be mobile friendly.

Angela Hoover who along with Parks and Recreation Director Emily Watson does most website updating suggested the council go with the Progressive Responsive Package which includes a one time $6700 website design fee with hosting maintenance security and support for three years costing an additional $5850.

The service can also be upgraded to include bulk personalized texts for citizen alerts or to push out information.

The council was asked to examine several town websites created by GovOffice at this package level and to examine the proposal more closely for later discussion.

The council also looked at a series of pictures of needed repairs to get its 153 Wagner Street property ready for prospective tenants. Repairs should come in at less than $20000 which will be covered mostly by collected rent.

Wyatt said the new mural of the town’s updated oar logo on the side of the building should be started as soon as the weather warms to two to three 60 degree days in a row.

The council also selected the proposed trailer wrap using the oar logo on the town’s 12-foot trailer and the logo color version they desire on town vehicles.",,,,,,,,,,,,

“Through our partnership with UW we will be creating endowed professorships and student scholarships to attract the best minds in the clean energy sphere” said Gene Humphrey co-founder of 9H Research Foundation in a UW release Friday.

“This will help position Wyoming as the best university for clean energy driving jobs and economic growth for the state” he added.

First Solar the largest U.S. solar manufacturer made a $300000 in-kind donation to 9H giving more than 2000 advanced thin film solar photovoltaic modules totaling nearly 1 megawatt of capacity UW said.

“The clean energy industry is set to be one of the most important industries globally in the coming decades with solar energy making up a big portion of it” said Adam Smith director of business development for First Solar. “It is our hope that these modules are the start of an illustrious story for not just the University of Wyoming but for all Wyomingites.”

The partnership between 9H and UW in the fall of 2020 with 9H sponsoring a yearlong senior design competition. 31 UW engineering seniors competed in a $5000 renewable energy design challenge. Two team winners were announced in February at a celebration event hosted by UW President Ed Seidel and attended by Gov. Mark Gordon.

They said that RND is open to the vessel being used for passengers as also for evening river cruises along the Mandovi and Zuari rivers.Given that the solar-powered vessel costs more than Rs4 crore to build the navigation department currently does not see the viability in replacing the existing diesel-powered ferry boats which cost approximately Rs60-70 lakh to build.“We are looking at two options. One is to revive the Panaji-Aldona route for passengers and we are also open to cruises along the Mandovi and Zuari rivers” said an official. “We will see the performance of the solar ferry for six months to a year and then decide what to do.”Speaking recently at the Maritime India summit captain of ports (CoP) James Braganza had said that the keel for the electric solar boat had already been laid and was expected to be completed over six to seven months. The hybrid boat will have an operational speed of 12 knots and will be able to ferry 60 passengers.In November 2018 a delegation from Goa visited Kerala which was the first to introduce solar-powered passenger vessels in India. From that visit the delegation decided to commission a solar-powered ferry boat on a trial basis in Goa.Meanwhile RND is also phasing out older conventional ferry boats and is introducing newer ferryboats along existing ferry routes. “A contract for two ferries has been given to Vijai Marine. The newer ferries are a lot safer. Many of the ferries were more than 30 years old and suffered frequent breakdowns” said a government official.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VhbGVydC5jb20vYXN0cm9ub21lcnMtaGF2ZS1mb3VuZC10aGUtZmlyc3QtZXZpZGVuY2UtZm9yLXRlY3RvbmljLWFjdGl2aXR5LW9uLWFuLWV4b3BsYW5ldNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Astronomers Have Found The First Evidence For Tectonic Activity on an Exoplanet,"You may not be all that familiar with planet LHS 3844b but it now has its own particular distinction: It's the first planet outside of our Solar System where astronomers think they might have evidence of tectonic activity.

That evidence is a set of advanced simulations based on observations of the rocky planet which is slightly larger than Earth. Importantly for this particular piece of research it doesn't look as though the exoplanet has an atmosphere.

That leaves half of LHS 3844b permanently exposed to its sun and could mean temperatures of up to roughly 800 degrees Celsius (1472 degrees Fahrenheit) on the 'daytime' side and about minus 250 degrees Celsius (minus 418 degrees Fahrenheit) on the 'night-time' side.

""We thought that this severe temperature contrast might affect material flow in the planet's interior"" says astronomer Tobias Meier from the University of Bern in Switzerland.

Based on phase curve observations of the planet's brightness and possible temperatures and computer models simulating various possible tectonic materials and heat sources Meier and his colleagues think a hemisphere-scale flow of subsurface material is happening.

Most of the simulations the researchers ran showed only upwards flow on one side of the planet and only downwards flow on the other but in some scenarios that was reversed – a surprising find and one that doesn't match tectonic movement on Earth.

""Based on what we are used to from Earth you would expect the material on the hot dayside to be lighter and therefore flow upwards and vice versa"" says geophysicist Dan Bower from the University of Bern

The underlying reason is the changing temperature of the mantle material as it moves with colder rock stiffening up and becoming less mobile and warmer rock becoming much more liquid-like as it heats up. The scientists say that shifting surface and material could lead to some rather incredible tectonic activity.

""On whichever side of the planet the material flows upwards one would expect a large amount of volcanism on that particular side"" says Bower.

As a result scientists suggest that LHS 3844b could have one entire hemisphere covered in volcanoes while the other side shows hardly any volcanic activity – all because of the intense temperature contrast around the planet.

The sort of upwelling that would cause these volcanoes does match what we see on Earth but only in specific places such as Hawaii and Iceland. In more general terms the tectonic movement that these models suggest is unlike anything in our Solar System.

As more powerful space telescopes come online and our understanding of exoplanets improves further observations and research should help confirm what's happening across the surface of LHS 3844b – and whether it really is half covered in volcanoes.

""Our simulations show how such patterns could manifest but it would require more detailed observations to verify"" says Meier.

""For example with a higher-resolution map of surface temperature that could point to enhanced outgassing from volcanism or detection of volcanic gases. This is something we hope future research will help us to understand.""

The research has been published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters."

But it’s old and for years now the U.S. Army has been looking to replace it.

Back in 2014 BAE Systems was awarded a contract for the development of M113’s successor. Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is how the company calls its product and the first batches are already out in the field performing tests. The first true operational trials though (under realistic combat conditions) will not take place before the first few months of next year according to Defense News The initial production run calls for 450 of these vehicles to be delivered with a final decision from the U.S. Army on whether to go head on for the AMPV expected to be made later in 2022.There are five versions of the AMPV envisioned by BAE. The first is the Mission Command vehicle that will be used for command control communications and computer capabilities. Then comes the General Purpose vehicle designed for resupply maintenance and casualty evacuation.Third in line is the more offensive Mortar Carrier equipped with heavy mortars that can be fired in support of offensive operations. Two medical vehicles one for evacuation and the other for treatment are also in the pipeline.“Finalizing the first AMPV for delivery marks a major milestone for the program and the U.S. Army” Bill Sheehy AMPV program director for BAE Systems’ Ground Vehicles product line said in a statement back in September 2020 when the first BAE AMPV rolled off the lines.“The AMPV is designed to meet the Army’s missions for the Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCT) and lay the foundation for the future of the battlefield.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Developed for North America on the C2 platform the Maverick features a unibody instead of a body-on-frame construction. The Ranger is superior in terms of payload and towing capacities but don’t forget the compact pickup was designed for a different demographic.Ford is targeting crossover buyers who prefer the macho looks of a pickup without any of the drawbacks: gas mileage ride quality and the sheer size of a body-on-frame pickup. The Dearborn-based automaker won’t have it easy with the Maverick though because Hyundai and Volkswagen will launch compact trucks of their own in the guise of the Santa Cruz and Tarok.Expected to arrive in showrooms across the United States by the end of 2021 as a 2022 model the smaller brother of the Ranger is probably hiding a 1.5-liter turbo under the hood. I know that sounds preposterous but three cylinders and forced induction are what you get in the Bronco Sport as well.181 horsepower and 190 pound-feet (258 Nm) enable a towing capacity of 2000 pounds (907 kilograms) in the crossover’s case. The only engine that would be fitting as an option is the Bronco Sport Badlands’ 2.0-liter EcoBoost which is rated at 245 horsepower 275 pound-feet (373 Nm) and 2200 pounds (998 kilograms).An eight-speed automatic transmission should be standard and hearsay suggests a starting price of just under $20000 excluding destination charge for the Maverick. The price point may sound ludicrous in comparison to the Ranger’s $24820 before freight and options but on the other hand it should be doable if the base trim is on the mediocre side of standard equipment.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3Rlc2xhLWZvcmQtb25seS1jYXJtYWtlcnMtaW4tdXMtbm90LXRvLWhhdmUtZ29uZS1iYW5rcnVwdC1zYXlzLWVsb24tbXVzay0xMjEwMzA2MDA1MTFfMS5odG1s0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3Rlc2xhLWZvcmQtb25seS1jYXJtYWtlcnMtaW4tdXMtbm90LXRvLWhhdmUtZ29uZS1iYW5rcnVwdC1zYXlzLWVsb24tbXVzay0xMjEwMzA2MDA1MTFfMS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Ford only carmakers in US not to have gone bankrupt says Elon Musk,"As several carmakers bleed in the US and beyond Tesla is profitable and according to Elon Musk his electric car company and Ford are the only two carmakers in the US which have not gone bankrupt.

Tesla reported another profitable quarter as revenue hit $10.74 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. In last year Tesla achieved free cash flow of nearly $2.8 billion after spending more than $3 billion on building new factories and other expenditures.

US automaker Ford last month announced to more than double its investment in electric and autonomous vehicles to $29 billion. The automaker had previously committed to spend $11.5 billion on electrifying its vehicle lineup through 2022.

""Tesla & Ford are the only American carmakers not to have gone bankrupt out of 1000's of car startups. Prototypes are easy production is hard & being cash flow positive is excruciating"" Musk said in a tweet on Friday.

Ford CEO Jim Farley responded to his tweet saying: ""Respect"".

In 2020 Tesla produced and delivered half a million vehicles. In addition Model Y production in Shanghai has begun.

Tesla this year also registered its Indian subsidiary with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) in Bengaluru on January 8.

""2020 was a defining year for us on many levels. Despite a challenging environment we've reached an important milestone of producing and delivering 0.5 million cars"" Musk had said.

On the other hand Ford's increased investment is aimed at catching up with the EV market leader Tesla and keep pace with other automakers like GM and Volkswagen.

""We are accelerating our plans right now breaking constraints increasing battery capacity improving our costs and getting more battery electrics into our cycle plan"" Ford CEO Farley said last month.

Davis drives Edsels – the Ford Motor Company’s car that was dubbed the biggest failure in all of American business history. The car that cost the automobile giant millions of dollars in losses. The car with the unique grill that Davis has been collecting for 12 years now.

“A lot of people collect cars for different reasons but I’m a history buff and a historian” said Davis the owner of Hank’s Garage on E. Mansfield St. and the used car dealership next door. “It was such a good car but it ended up with the label of being a failure a piece of junk. But that car started life about the time I did.”

Davis 63 and his wife of 44 years Debbie now have 14 Edsels in their collection which are all stored in the auto body shop. A 1958 Pacer convertible a 1958 Bermuda a 1960 Ranger hardtop (one of 295 made) and a rare ’58 Roundup which has prestigious won awards and been featured in magazines across the country.

Now the Roundup painted in popular Ember Red and Snow White and the rest of Davis’s fleet are being featured in the Wall Street Journal. The online story ran Feb. 27 while the newsstand edition was published March 4. Davis said he was thrilled to finally see the article since it had been in the works since December.

The Roundup station wagon was one of only 963 models built that year Davis said. It’s also the only “original untouched and unrestored” Roundup around that still runs complete with original paint original interior and original spark plugs he said. “That means somebody has loved it and it’s survived the test of time.”

Davis is just the second owner of the Roundup which was voted best Edsel station wagon at the International Edsel Club meet in Southfield Mich. The vintage vehicle also racked up accolades from the Antique Automobile Club of America show in the HPOF Historical Preservation of Original Features class.

Davis first became fascinated with Edsels – named for Henry Ford’s late son – 12 years ago when he picked up a 1959 Ranger two-door hardtop with the idea of cleaning it up to sell. “I drove it around for a couple days and we took it to a car show and it about drove me nuts because people just kept talking about it” he said.

“I said to my wife on the way home ‘I think I’ve got something here. You know what I’m gonna’ keep this thing.’ People are just drawn to it. You can see that car coming at you from three-quarters of a mile away. And when you show up at a car show with 400 cars and you’re in an Edsel yours is probably the only one there.”

Five of Davis’s Edsels are station wagons including a 1958 six-passenger Villager which he bought for $24000 at a Mecum Auction – the world’s largest auction for car collectors – in Harrisburg Pa. The classic car with its boomerang-shaped taillights sits on a sprawling 116-inch wheelbase like other Edsel wagons.

Hank’s Garage though is home to more than old Edsels. It’s a museum of vintage vehicles from Corvettes to Mustangs complete with antique signs gas pumps oil cans pedal cars and gas station soda machines. A 40- by 80-foot building overflowing with shiny metal memorabilia. “Automobilia” as Davis calls it.

The father of two even owns a 1958 Edsel Youngstar which he restored to match his two-tone full-size version painted Jonquil Yellow and Jet Black. The Youngstars – miniature electric cars made for children – were used as promotional giveaways by dealers after the real Edsel debuted in 1957 Davis said.

Sadly Edsel only lived for three years. What was developed to compete with Chrysler and General Motors died on Nov. 19 1959. “The last car rolled off the assembly line and that was the end of the road which was very sad for a car that wasn’t any better or any worse than anything else built at the time” Davis said.

As a tribute to the brand Davis parks a “waving” Edsel on the lawn outside of Hank’s Garage for passersby to enjoy. A ’58 Pacer four-door Sedan in Spruce and Spring Green that he decorates for the holidays. “It sits outside year-round. People stop and get their picture taken with it.”

Because every day is “E Day” for this Edsel enthusiast. “It’s funny because Edsel for all those years was laughed at and made fun of and now it’s one of the most sought-after collectible cars out there so I guess Edsel got the last laugh.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9ydHJlbmQuY29tL2hvdy10by9mb3JkLWNoZXZ5LWNocnlzbGVyLWNyYXRlLWVuZ2luZXMtb3Zlci01MDAtaHAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford vs Chevy vs Mopar: Who's Got the Baddest-Ass Crate Engines?,"As a subculture hot rodding is in danger but it's not from what you may think. Over the last 15 years—starting with the 505-hp LS7 small-block found in the Corvette Z06—the general public has been exposed to more than a few over-500-hp factory engines that are clean high-tech and well mannered. The alphabet soup of factory-offered domestics that broke the glass ceiling of supercar-level performance is astounding and includes the Z06 and ZR1 Corvette (C6 C7 and upcoming C8) Chevy Camaro ZL1 Ford Mustang GT350 and GT500 Shelby Cobra and Dodge Hellcat Demon Super Stock and Redeye—and we haven't even touched on trucks and SUVs. With so many powerful cars available a 500-plus-hp crate engine for an older car may sound like a smallish choice. More on that in a second but first let's look at the alternatives.

The Argument Against a Crate Engine Project

Factory power levels over 500 hp are now so common that even the once ballyhooed 707-hp Hellcat no longer gets regular coverage from big media because well there are just so many more powerful cars out there. Despite the OE muscle car power play or perhaps because of it the general public doesn't understand that making well over 500 hp with a vintage V-8 remains quite hard. By most yardsticks the cost of building a 600-hp crate engine—including all the ancillary needs such as fuel supply ignition cooling and machine shop bill (but not any upgraded driveline parts like transmissions or rearends)—sits at around $10K.

When considering whether to build a truly powerful engine (for our arbitrary purposes here that's 600 hp) or going with an already-built crate engine one must also consider whether it would be a better value to just buy a used ZL1 or Hellcat for the going price of $45K. Yet for some gearheads the ubiquity of such a car can leave a saccharin taste long after the sweet burnout smoke has cleared.

500-Plus-HP Crate Engine Options

So you've decided that a crate engine well over 500 hp pushes your hot button because you don't want the same thing as everybody else but your engine building skills don't quite cut the mustard. Maybe you're a great general mechanic or specialize in fabrication but don't need the hassle or the drain on your limited shop space to stock it full of engine-building stuff. A well-chosen 500-plus-hp crate engine that can hang with Detroit's new iron is going to be your go-to option but cost is still all-important. If that's you then you've come to the right place!

Brand Loyalty: Chevy Ford or Mopar?

Based on cost alone the LS or big-block Chevy will have the advantage on price. That said we discovered that Ford and Mopar options don't carry the huge ""tax"" you might think but these can still fetch 10 to 20 percent more. Block for block crank for crank piston for piston Ford and Mopar parts aren't especially expensive relative to Chevy—in fact sometimes they can be the same. The added cost is more a function of a lack of institutional knowledge that incentivizes fewer experts to then charge more. Moreover large bulk rebuilders like Blueprint and ATK don't see enough demand to build the higher-hp Ford or Mopar crate engines relinquishing the trade to specialty builders like Prestige (Ford) Muscle Motors (Mopar) Jon Kaase Racing (Ford) and Indy Cylinder Head (Mopar) to name a few. (If nothing else this story should highlight an unfulfilled opportunity for perhaps other large rebuilders.)

For the hot rodder who won't settle for the indignity of dropping a Chevy LS into a Mustang or a BBC into a Road Runner the important thing to remember is that there are engine builders who can deliver cost-effective crate engines that have the right brand on the valve cover—it just requires looking a little harder in the rarefied atmosphere of crate engines in the over-500-hp category. We found some lesser-known specialty builders filling the need for high-powered non-Chevy crate engines and they are deserving of the spotlight. First however let's look at a couple of popular 500+hp Chevy crate engines to establish the cost baseline.

Team Chevy: 620-HP ATK 415ci LS Small-Block Chevy Asking Price $8998.99

It should come as no surprise that the Chevy Gen IV LS provides the most horsepower per cubic inch of our group of engines at these higher power levels. ATK's high volume and buying power allows the company to offer a 620-hp naturally aspirated LS3-based stroker engine in long-block form at the nearly unheard-of price of $8998.99. We found ATK's LS02 (using a GM LS3 block) for sale at this price at Eastwood and it includes such beefcake as Manley forged pistons rods and crankshaft. These robust rotating components are complimented by a stout hydraulic roller cam with 240-/256-degrees duration (at .050-inch lift) and .625-inch valve lift—enough to push the output (with your carb or EFI) to the 620-hp mark. Note that you'll still need to provide an intake manifold (Edelbrock Victor Jr. part No. 350-28457 shown) and carburetion (Quick Fuel 850cfm shown) or EFI.

Team Chevy: 600-HP BluePrint Engines 496ci Big-Block Chevy Asking Price $8799

People have been preaching the demise of the big-block Chevy for years and to that end it was last produced by the factory in Gen-VI form until around 2001. In 20 years however it has lost none of its luster in performance circles. In fact some rebuilders have doubled down by casting their own big-block Chevy cylinder cases including BluePrint. That means the company can now build any kind of BBC crate engine in whatever configuration it wants brand new in whatever numbers it sees fit and without being capacity constrained by the supply of OE engine blocks. BluePrint's 496-inch behemoth includes a forged stroker kit (oddly with hypereutectic pistons) aluminum heads hydraulic roller cam (242-/248-degrees at .050-inch lift .566-inch lift) single-plane intake and Holley double-pumper—it even comes with an individualized dyno sheet. Shipping is free with no core charge and a 30-month 50000-mile warranty is included. We found the best deal here at Summit Racing.

Team Ford: Ford Performance Parts 655-HP Big-Block Asking Price $15885.99

By contrast if you need big Ford power for your ride you'll pay a premium. That said few BBFs (big-block Fords) look better than Ford Performance Parts 572ci big-block crate engine with 655 hp. This one has all the good stuff: forged rotating assembly with 10:1 compression aluminum Super Cobra Jet heads street-friendly hydraulic roller cam (259-/263-degrees duration at .050-inch lift .649-inch valve lift) Edelbrock Victor single-plane intake and Holley Street Avenger 870cfm carb.

It's our view that the crate engine aftermarket has generally not taken advantage of the stock Ford 460 block's internal real estate or the availability of better freer-flowing cylinder heads. It's easily argued that it's cheaper to DIY build a big-inch big-power Ford from scratch using a JKRE P-51 cylinder head (or to a lesser degree Trick Flow's PowerPort 325) and we've long wondered why no rebuilder (or even Ford) has stepped up to the task. Notwithstanding Ford Performance Parts' M-6007-572DF 572ci big-block crate engine sits at the head of the Ford table when it comes to big-block Ford crate engines and the overkill of its M-6010-A460 block. We found the best deal at Summit Racing.

Team Ford: Prestige Motorsports 600-HP Ford Windsor 427ci Small-Block Asking Price $11399

Taking a small-block Ford into the 500-plus-hp crate engine arena isn't for the faint of heart—a lot of critical insider tricks are needed to build a cost-effective 600-hp 351-based Windsor crate engine with the kind of mechanical elegance Prestige Motorsports has (shown on the company's eBay storefront here). As Prestige succinctly puts it ""This 427ci Windsor is a small-block that acts like a big-block"" and to make that happen you need a pile of high-quality components including a Dart SHP block forged stroker rotating assembly AFR CNC-ported heads solid-roller cam (specs proprietary) Edelbrock Super Victor intake QFT 750cfm carb and importantly the guiding hands of qualified assemblers and dyno technicians.

Called the Super Street package this combo handily breaks the 500-hp barrier by something like a gazillion hp. Dyno testing provided by Prestige shows 625 peak hp with the 500-hp mark blowing by at a lowly 4800 rpm. Regarding the difference in price between the two versions found at different places the 427ci Super Street Windsor is available with an attractive and functional accessory drive system from Billet Specialties at the $17299 eBay store price. (Prestige also sells complete driveline packages that include crate engines with transmissions.) When you need big power from a Ford in the smallest footprint possible a stroker Windsor this is the way to go.

Team Mopar: Indy Cylinder Head 500ciBig-Block Moparwith 600 HP Asking Price $10550

In the performance aftermarket there are few companies that assemble truly powerful Chrysler V-8s and of those none manufacture as many parts in-house as Indy Cylinder Head. In our Mopar spotlight today is Indy's part No. 400-C6-500-605 big-block wedge crate engine. Of note for fans of big-block Chrysler power is the fact that the big-block B/RB engine architecture allows lots of room for stroker cranks almost too much room if you ask airflow experts. This is manifested in the type's not-so-strange tendency to make gobs of torque but not so much top-end power—at least when stock-style cylinder heads are used.

Because Indy's forte is high-flowing Chrysler cylinder heads based on the Max Wedge footprint it gives them a huge leg up on building Chrysler crate engines with pleasantly high levels of power. Specs on Indy's low-deck street wedge big-block (400 deck height) show big potential with prepped 440-EZ-1 cylinder heads forged 10:1 compression Diamond pistons forged stroker internals from Eagle solid-lifter cam (.590-inch lift 247 degrees duration at .050-inch lift) single-plane Indy intake MSD ignition and 850cfm Holley carb. All this puts out a dyno-verified 600 hp on a diet of 91-octane pump gas. At a price scarcely above $10K this Indy crate engine makes a solid run at the Chevy boys. The best part: You can afford a wicked big-block with big hairy balls that's not a Chevy.

Team Mopar: Muscle Motors 422ci Small-Block Chrysler with 675 HP Asking Price $14995

To lump Muscle Motors into the same group with a bulk rebuilder might sound scandalous until you realize how few companies are building complete out-the-door Chrysler-centric crate engines in the over-500-hp ranks. A naturally aspirated small-block of any kind making close to 700 hp sounds miraculous but doing it with an LA-series small-block Chrysler is well the kind of thing Mopar guys live for. Though pricey at nearly $15K through Muscle Motors eBay store here this one-off 500-plus hp crate engine has ""no expense spared and all tricks are included.""

We know those guys and they aren't kidding: This ready-to-run crate starts with a seasoned 340 LA-series block to which Muscle Motors has added a Callies forged stroker crank and rods Diamond forged 11:1 compression pistons custom COMP solid-roller cam (.650-inch valve lift 265 degrees duration at .050-inch lift) Indy 360-1 CNC-ported heads Indy 360-1 single-plane intake QFT 830cfm carb and MSD ignition. The asking price near $15K is a lot of cake but when you've got to have something nearing the 700-hp mark in a package the size and shape of a small-block Mopar there are few better choices than this.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmMuY29tL2phc29uLWF0ZW4vZm9yZC1jZW9zLW9uZS13b3JkLXR3ZWV0LWluLXJlc3BvbnNlLXRvLWVsb24tbXVzay1pcy1iZXN0LWV4YW1wbGUtb2YtZW1vdGlvbmFsLWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS1pdmUtZXZlci1zZWVuLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford CEO's One-Word Tweet in Response to Elon Musk Is the Best Example of Emotional Intelligence I've Ever Seen,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/ford-ceos-one-word-tweet-in-response-to-elon-musk-is-best-example-of-emotional-intelligence-ive-ever-seen.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmMuY29tL2phc29uLWF0ZW4vZm9yZC1jZW9zLW9uZS13b3JkLXR3ZWV0LWluLXJlc3BvbnNlLXRvLWVsb24tbXVzay1pcy1iZXN0LWV4YW1wbGUtb2YtZW1vdGlvbmFsLWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS1pdmUtZXZlci1zZWVuLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Kind Of By Mustafa Gatollari Mar. 7 2021 Published 4:10 p.m. ET Source: ABC

The state of entertainment properties and production companies has changed a lot over the past few decades. If you take a look at the number of production studios that were releasing films between 1990 and 2020 you'll see that it has shrunk considerably. And while there are new film businesses creating inventive projects like A24 things have become homogenized for the most part. Just take a look at how much Disney owns — but does it own American Idol?

Does Disney own 'American Idol'?

While Disney has been an entertainment juggernaut for decades and decades there's no doubt it grew its powers and audience reach to new heights after it took ownership over Marvel and the Star Wars franchise. Then it seemed like The Mouse was going to gobble up all other entertainment properties like 20th Century Fox.

It's the reason why X-Men films weren't being included as part of the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe and the past few films featuring mutants felt worlds apart from the successful crop of MCU titles like the Avengers series of films and all of the standalone superhero flicks inundating theaters (and now streaming services) that get constant play.

So what parts of Fox does Disney own and what does it not own?

It's important to note that Disney doesn't own all of Fox but 60 percent of all of 21st Century Fox. According to NPR ""Disney which already owns the Pixar Marvel and the Star Wars brands will now also get Deadpool and the Fox-owned Marvel characters such as the X-Men and Fantastic Four allowing for the full Marvel family to be united. Disney also now owns former Fox television networks such as FX Networks and National Geographic Partners.""

The outlet went on to state ""Disney will also get Fox's 30 percent ownership of Hulu giving Disney a controlling share of 60 percent."" So what portion of Fox does Disney not own? Well a newly formed company Fox Corp operates as its own business entity outside of Disney's operating arms. This includes Fox News the Fox Network and other Fox TV stations. This arguably makes more sense for Disney from a political standpoint.

So who owns 'American Idol'?

When it comes to the ownership of TV shows there are a lot of different factors that come into play. Usually production companies own the rights to specific shows however networks and these companies work out deals that delineate varying degrees of ownership. American Idol may have started on Fox's network TV channel however it's now playing on ABC.

So one would assume that since Disney owns a big chunk of Fox and has stake in its properties and owns 100 percent of ABC then that should mean The Mouse officially owns all of American Idol now and the right to playing all of its episodes correct? Well it's not that simple. The show was created by Simon Fuller and is based off the British TV series Pop Idol — and it's actually produced by Fremantle North America 19 Entertainment which ""sells"" the show to a network to be aired on.

American Idol judge Simon Cowell apparently had a disagreement with Simon Fuller back in the day and left Pop Idol in order to make The X Factor but a lawsuit from Fuller claiming that parts of Cowell's popular new show ripped off of Pop Idol. They settled for Fuller to have a stake in X Factor and Cowell had agreed to appear on the U.S. offshoot American Idol.

So while Disney can now play the episodes the show's intellectual properties belong to Simon Fuller — meaning he's getting a taste of all the profits wherever the show is streamed or licensed to be a part of. Cowell at the height of American Idol's peak was earning a salary of $33 million a season. That just gives you an idea of how profitable the show is if they're giving Cowell that much per season.

Unlike the prime-time shows on CNN Fox News and MSNBC filled with partisan monologues and fiery discussions “NewsNation” would serve up unbiased news reports in a straightforward manner.

The show made its debut in September on WGN America a Chicago cable channel available in roughly 75 million households across the country. Its development was overseen by Sean Compton a top executive at Nexstar Media Group which owns WGN America. He laid out the show’s mission in a January 2020 statement: “We consistently hear from viewers who are seeking straight-ahead unbiased news reporting that is grounded in fact not opinion” Mr. Compton said. “‘News Nation’ will deliver exactly that.”

Eager journalists from across the country signed on some of them moving with their families from far away. But now six months after its debut “NewsNation” has abysmal ratings and disaffected staff members who say it has not lived up to Mr. Compton’s billing.

Kind Of By Mustafa Gatollari Mar. 7 2021 Published 4:10 p.m. ET Source: ABC

The state of entertainment properties and production companies has changed a lot over the past few decades. If you take a look at the number of production studios that were releasing films between 1990 and 2020 you'll see that it has shrunk considerably. And while there are new film businesses creating inventive projects like A24 things have become homogenized for the most part. Just take a look at how much Disney owns — but does it own American Idol?

Does Disney own 'American Idol'?

While Disney has been an entertainment juggernaut for decades and decades there's no doubt it grew its powers and audience reach to new heights after it took ownership over Marvel and the Star Wars franchise. Then it seemed like The Mouse was going to gobble up all other entertainment properties like 20th Century Fox.

It's the reason why X-Men films weren't being included as part of the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe and the past few films featuring mutants felt worlds apart from the successful crop of MCU titles like the Avengers series of films and all of the standalone superhero flicks inundating theaters (and now streaming services) that get constant play.

So what parts of Fox does Disney own and what does it not own?

It's important to note that Disney doesn't own all of Fox but 60 percent of all of 21st Century Fox. According to NPR ""Disney which already owns the Pixar Marvel and the Star Wars brands will now also get Deadpool and the Fox-owned Marvel characters such as the X-Men and Fantastic Four allowing for the full Marvel family to be united. Disney also now owns former Fox television networks such as FX Networks and National Geographic Partners.""

The outlet went on to state ""Disney will also get Fox's 30 percent ownership of Hulu giving Disney a controlling share of 60 percent."" So what portion of Fox does Disney not own? Well a newly formed company Fox Corp operates as its own business entity outside of Disney's operating arms. This includes Fox News the Fox Network and other Fox TV stations. This arguably makes more sense for Disney from a political standpoint.

So who owns 'American Idol'?

When it comes to the ownership of TV shows there are a lot of different factors that come into play. Usually production companies own the rights to specific shows however networks and these companies work out deals that delineate varying degrees of ownership. American Idol may have started on Fox's network TV channel however it's now playing on ABC.

So one would assume that since Disney owns a big chunk of Fox and has stake in its properties and owns 100 percent of ABC then that should mean The Mouse officially owns all of American Idol now and the right to playing all of its episodes correct? Well it's not that simple. The show was created by Simon Fuller and is based off the British TV series Pop Idol — and it's actually produced by Fremantle North America 19 Entertainment which ""sells"" the show to a network to be aired on.

American Idol judge Simon Cowell apparently had a disagreement with Simon Fuller back in the day and left Pop Idol in order to make The X Factor but a lawsuit from Fuller claiming that parts of Cowell's popular new show ripped off of Pop Idol. They settled for Fuller to have a stake in X Factor and Cowell had agreed to appear on the U.S. offshoot American Idol.

So while Disney can now play the episodes the show's intellectual properties belong to Simon Fuller — meaning he's getting a taste of all the profits wherever the show is streamed or licensed to be a part of. Cowell at the height of American Idol's peak was earning a salary of $33 million a season. That just gives you an idea of how profitable the show is if they're giving Cowell that much per season.

Unlike the prime-time shows on CNN Fox News and MSNBC filled with partisan monologues and fiery discussions “NewsNation” would serve up unbiased news reports in a straightforward manner.

The show made its debut in September on WGN America a Chicago cable channel available in roughly 75 million households across the country. Its development was overseen by Sean Compton a top executive at Nexstar Media Group which owns WGN America. He laid out the show’s mission in a January 2020 statement: “We consistently hear from viewers who are seeking straight-ahead unbiased news reporting that is grounded in fact not opinion” Mr. Compton said. “‘News Nation’ will deliver exactly that.”

Eager journalists from across the country signed on some of them moving with their families from far away. But now six months after its debut “NewsNation” has abysmal ratings and disaffected staff members who say it has not lived up to Mr. Compton’s billing. In recent weeks the news director and managing editor have resigned. Six people at the network who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal discussions said “NewsNation” has increasingly become a venue for right-wing views.

That's why we've put both devices head-to-head comparing their design price and features so you can pick the right one for you.

The Vivoactive 3 was released in September 2017 and the Vivoactive 4 went on sale in March 2021. However despite the four-year difference the newer watch isn't necessarily the best choice for everyone – it depends on your budget and whether you're likely to use enough of the Vivoactive 4's new features to justify its higher price.

Still can't decide? Take a look at our complete guide to the best Garmin watches to see if another device suits you better.

Summary

Summary

Often recommending the newer of two watches is a no-brainer but the Vivoactive 3 has stood the test of time well and is still an excellent smartwatch. It has some significant limitations compared to the Vivoactive 4 (more on that shortly) but it's often available for around half the price which might tip the balance in its favor if you're not likely to use those extra features.

Both watches are solid choices for runners and cyclists with accurate on-board GPS and ANT+ connectivity for devices like footpods and cadence sensors. However if you enjoy swimming you should opt for the Vivoactive 4 which is the only one of the pair that can measure your heart rate underwater.

We'd also recommend the Vivoactive 4 if you want to listen to music without your phone. The standard Vivoactive 3 allows you to control music playback on your handset but doesn't have storage for songs and there's little difference between the prices of the Vivoactive 3 Music and Vivoactive 4 so you might as well opt for the more powerful newer device.

Another of the Vivoactive 4's best features is its blood oxygen sensor. This doesn't just measure SpO2 overnight to check for signs of sleep apnea; it can also track it throughout the day and allows you to perform spot-checks making it a useful training tool.

If those tools aren't essential though the Vivoactive 3 could be your next watch despite its age. Just remember that because it's older repairs and replacements may be trickier if something goes wrong or it gets broken.

Display and design

Display

Both watches have color memory-in-pixel screens

Vivoactive 4 has higher resolution

The Vivoactive 3 has a 30.4mm display with a 240 x 240 pixel resolution. the standard Vivoactive 4 has the same size screen but a higher resolution of 260 x 260 pixels for improved clarity.

Both watches use color memory-in-pixel displays to show your workout stats. While these are designed to be clearly legible even in bright sunlight they're less vivid than the Garmin Venu which features an OLED screen.

Design

Both watches are available in polymer or stainless steel

Vivoactive 4 is available in two different sizes

The case of the Garmin Vivoactive 3 measures 43.4 x 43.4 x 11.7mm. and can be made of either polymer or stainless steel (the latter version looks smart but costs a little extra). Both models have a stainless steel bezel

The standard Garmin Vivoactive 4 is a little larger measuring 45.1 x 45.1 x 12.8mm and again can be made from either polymer or stainless steel with a stainless steel bezel.

Both devices have quick-release silicone bands (with extra options sold separately if you fancy a change).

If the 45mm Vivoactive 4 is too chunky there's also a 40mm version available for around the same price.

Features

Smartwatch features

Vivoactive 4 has slightly better battery life

Standard Vivoactive 3 can't store music

Both support third-party apps through Garmin Connect IQ

Both watches allow you to receive smartphone notifications and send text responses or reject calls with a text if you're an Android user.

You get weather and calendar apps installed by default and tou can download additional watch faces and third-party apps for both watches through Garmin Connect IQ. Both watches also allow you to make contactless payments via NFC through Garmin Pay.

Both the Vivoactive 3 and Vivoactive 4 let you make contactless purchases with Garmin Pay (Image credit: Garmin)

While you can use either watch to control music playback on your phone you can't store music on the standard Garmin Vivoactive 3. If that's something you're looking for you'll need to opt for the more expensive Vivoactive 3 Music Edition or the VIvoactive 4. Both of these watches have storage for up to 500 songs which you can stream to Bluetooth headphones.

The Vivoactive 4 has the edge when it comes to battery life but it's not a huge difference. The Vivoactive 3 can last up to 13 hours with GPS enabled and up to seven days in smartwatch mode. If you opt for the Vivoactive 3 Music you can use GPS and music playback for five hours on a full charge.

The Vivoactive 4 can keep going for up to six hours with both GPS and music enabled and up to eight days in smartwatch mode.

Fitness tracking features

Both have accurate on-board GPS

Vivoactive 4 can measure heart rate underwater

Vivoactive 4 has blood oxygen sensor

Both the Vivoactive 3 and Vivoactive 4 have on-board GPS (supplemented by Galileo and GONASS) so you can track runs walks and bike rides accurately without connecting them to your phone. They also feature ANT+ connectivity meaning you can connect them to additional sensors such as chest strap heart rate monitors and footpods for extra workout metrics.

Only the Vivoactive 4 has an SpO2 sensor though – and it's a particularly versatile one at that. Many fitness trackers can only monitor blood oxygen saturation overnight but the Vivoactive 4 also allows you to monitor it throughout the day and perform spot-checks whenever you like.

Both watches have all-day heart rate monitoring and will alert you if your heart rate becomes raised unusually high but only the Vivoactive 4 provides low heart rate alerts. If you swim regularly it's worth noting that only the Vivoactive 4 can measure heart rate underwater.

The Vivoactive 3 has activity tracking profiles for strength cardio and elliptical training plus stair stepping floor climbing indoor rowing and yoga. The Vivoactive 4 has all of those plus options for pilates and breathwork.

Both watches can track treadmill and outdoor running indoor and outdoor cycling and pool swimming. They also have dedicated modes for skiing snowboarding cross-country skiing stand up paddle boarding and outdoor rowing.

Both are capable golf watches too with features including a digital scorecard automatic shot distance measuring green view with manual pin positioning and Garmin Autoshot. However they don't come pre-loaded with the thousands of course maps you get with the Garmin Fenix 6.

Price

Price

Vivoactive 3 is cheaper than Vivoactive 4

Vivoactive 3 Music is no longer available in all countries

Look out for special deals at third-party retailers

Prices vary a little depending on while color scheme you opt for but the Vivoactive 3 is available to buy direct from Garmin starting at $249.99 / £199.99 / AU$249 for the standard edition or $249.99 / £249.99 for the music edition. The Vicoactive 3 Music is no longer available in Australia if you buy from Garmin but can be found at third-party retailers for around AU$160.

Meanwhile the Vivoactive 4 starts at $349.99 / £259.99 / AU$579. The 55mm and 40mm models are the same price in the US and Australia but the smaller version is slightly cheaper in the UK starting at £239.99.

Both the Vivoactive 3 and 4 are often available for less at retailers like Amazon (particularly around Black Friday) but because it's an older model the Vivoactive 3 is often more heavily discounted.

I’ve often wondered what to do with all of the coolness that people write and while I share a lot of it on Twitter and Facebook this is a better forum for sending it on to y’all. Most times these different streams don’t overlap so be on the lookout at all these places for good stuff!

So with that let’s get into the action!

Stuff I Found Interesting Around The Interwebs:

Here’s a not-so-small smattering of all the random things that I stumbled on while doing my civic duty to find the end of the Internet. Also there’s a few things this week that were actually from a week or two ago – I’m just catching up on this list:

1) FPV Drones Following a Golf Ball – Behind the Scenes: Even if you don’t partake in golf nor flying drones – I think you’ll find this pretty incredible.

2) Peloton’s Coming to Australia: Get ready Lama you too can own a Peloton Bike or two.

3) BikeRumor Sold to Lola Digital Media: This is part of the AllGear Media Group and covers other sports tech sites like GearJunkie. The sports and gear realm is relatively small with only a few entities in the grand scheme of things. Congrats to Tyler and his team.

4) Explaining how women’s prize money isn’t the whole picture: Good article detailing how just looking at the final prize money alone can be misleading into the larger picture at hand.

5) Popular Vacmaster fan in UK now makes a trainer mode: All because too many TrainerRoad users kept buying it since they can’t get Lasko fans here in Europe. I’ve actually been using a Vacmaster fan as well for a long time now too. Works great. mixed on whether I’d pay the premium though for the remote switch since I’d just rather use a smart connected outlet instead (since I rarely change intensity).

6) Gatorade makes a wearable patch telling you how much Gatorade to drink: Though in reality it’s not actually connected to your phone. It’s an interesting concept and I’d love to understand from a science aspect whether or not this…umm…holds water. (via Hugh)

7) The Ice Bike: I know this is like three weeks old. Four weeks almost. But gosh darn it it was in my list floating around and didn’t make it. Despite the fact that 62 million of you have already watched it here’s a link nonetheless….just in case!

8) Google measures heart rate via camera: This is slated for tomorrow to Google Pixel devices. I’ve got an OG Pixel so not entirely sure if it’ll work there. But if so – I’ll give it a whirl. My expectations are low…but I’m happy to be surprised!

Each week I quickly highlight some of the new firmware app software and website service updates that I see go out. If you’re a sports technology company and release an update – shoot me a quick note (just one-liners are perfect or Tweet it at me is even better) and I’ll make mention of it here. If I don’t know about it I won’t be able to post about it. Sound good? Oh – and if you want to get a head start on things this page is a great resource for watching Garmin Wahoo Polar and a few other firmware updates.

Others are expensive custom-built software packages armed with more sophisticated types of artificial intelligence that are capable of doing the kinds of cognitive work that once required teams of highly-paid humans.

Whether the cycle takes place over a matter of months or even decades the same principles are borne out time and again.

As anyone familiar with the five phases will know the Hype Cycle entails:

An innovation trigger A peak of inflated expectations A trough of disillusionment The slope of enlightenment The plateau of productivity

While there’s plenty of room for speculation about where on this particular graph AR currently resides – be it working its way out of the trough or even moving beyond the plateau – there’s one thing that most of us can agree on: that the pandemic accelerated that progress.

It’s arguable that the inflated expectations for AR peaked in 2016 as a result of the Pokemon Go craze that swept through countries around the world. Who can forget the news footage in the summer of 2016 as huge crowds of gamers converged on central park in New York in search of a rare Pokemon?

While many in the museum sector saw great crossover potential and an appetite for applications in arts and culture there’s no doubt that the technology has also experienced its share of disillusionment since 2016 and that widespread adoption didn’t follow in short order.

Nevertheless the last 5 years have given curators and programming teams the opportunity to experiment with AR and explore different ways to enhance and complement the traditional in-person experience. Without the hardware investment required of Virtual Reality this more straightforward and less costly approach can make use of the hardware already in a visitor’s pocket – smartphones. With the simple download of an app scanning of a QR code or similar entry point AR can be incorporated into any museum experience or virtual visit. And it is this feature that has now made augmented reality particularly appealing as institutions look towards their own post-Covid futures.

In an environment where contactless visitor experiences are in demand across ticketing shop purchases guided tours and exhibition experiences the value of AR in supporting both in-person visits and contributing to online content is almost certainly set to grow.

In fact the pandemic has served to accelerate AR to such an extent that it has now officially left Gartner’s hype cycle – making more ground in the last 18 months than it perhaps has in the previous 5 years. By this methodology the conclusion we can draw is that AR is now considered to be in a mature state. Or to use Gartner’s own explanation it has graduated from a “technology to watch” to “one to use”.

Augmenting the reality of a museum

For those less familiar with AR and its sibling technology VR it’s worth a quick recap of the difference between the two. Some of the confusion between virtual and augmented reality is logical. It’s still relatively new technology in terms of its everyday application in public settings and as the technologies develop there is often some element of overlap which takes us into the realms of using the umbrella term: XR.

The main difference lies in the delivery. Augmented reality should be considered as an ‘alternate’ version of reality whereas VR is a completely immersive experience designed to take the user away from their present reality to somewhere completely different. It is the ‘alternate’ version of reality that makes AR more flexible when considered as part of a museums suite of engagement tools. AR can add new layers to what the user can already see thereby helping deliver one of the main goals of any museum’s output – a layered experience to see hear and feel.

For museums the extra layer that of AR represents an additional dimension in which it is possible to provide complementary or supplementary information new ideas experiences and interactive elements. For example museums can use AR technology to help visitors see how a dinosaur skeleton might have looked as a living breathing animal through the lens of a smartphone. Or how about viewing a painting in person but also being able to access a 3D visualisation of the artist talking directly about the work using AR.

Whereas VR is about immersing visitors in a different world in which the exhibition exists AR exists to enhance engagement through better understanding greater access to information and digital tools to bring a subject into the visitor’s present reality.

Bringing the AR to ART

The Akron Art Museum in Ohia USA is one much lauded example of how AR can be used in a playful and community-focused way to help local residents access public art during the recent Covid-19 shutdown. Although the idea was actually dreamt up pre-Covid the museums use of AR in the launch of Interplay: Art Play for All created the perfect lockdown activity for the 200000 inhabitants of Akron.

The art gallery installed a range of freely available art posters throughout the city enabling members of the public to interact with each piece of art using a QR code. Once scanned into a tablet or smartphone each poster offers up different ways of interacting with the art on display. For example the poster by Akron artist Adana Tillman allows users to play with elements of the original design to transform the final artwork and allow the public to use their own creativity and blend it with the artistic displays created by Tillman.

Interplay: Art Play for All has proved to be an engaging way to offer up a public-platform to experience AR technology in the arts. It proved a welcome respite for culture-starved residents looking for ways to keep themselves entertained during the repeated lockdowns of 2020 and 2021. Moreover the fusion of technology and art showcased how creativity can be incorporated into AR to create a two-way sharing of information and ingenuity.

Further South the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach in Florida has also launched a new AR app to help open up its art collection to visitors. Known as Norton Art+ the app will be available to anyone wishing to explore the art work of the museum using the AR format but will be delivered through tablets loaned to visitors as part of the entrance fee.

Although not necessarily conceived as a way to create new virtual entry points into the collection of the Norton Museum of Art for non-visitors the app instead aims to enhance the visitor experience through a novel form of technology and focuses initially on a select number of artworks including ‘Soundsuit’ by Nick Cave and ‘MOONRISE. East. April’ by Ugo Rondinone

Like in Akron the app utilises AR technology to encourage users to fuse their own creativity with the displayed artwork and interact with pieces. It encourages users to play with textures or alter expressions of a sculpture’s face as well as move the piece to new settings to see how it can change the artwork itself.

It is hoped that Norton Art+ will help encourage greater engagement with contemporary art pieces and modern art in general – particularly amongst younger visitors. By transforming the gallery experience with augmented reality technology it has helped developed an interaction with the piece that is not always possible in traditional gallery settings.

Black History and AR technology

In 2020 the global drive to increase awareness of the significance of Black history has inspired a new way of helping Black voices be heard in society. The Black Learning Achievement and Mental Health (BLAM) charity is a British organisation dedicated to history education and improving mental health through the UK’s primary and secondary schools.

To assist in their mission they developed a unique AR app exploring the lives of key figures in black history that had been overlooked or misunderstood in terms of their contribution. Called History Bites the app uses AR to present virtual statues of historical black figures in key locations as well as present information about their lives and achievements to help redress what BLAM feel is the omission of black figures and their contribution to history in the national curriculum.

It is hoped by using AR to create digital representations of key figures users can engage with black history in a more accessible and digital format and hopefully opening up opportunities to learn more. Although traditionally delivered in school settings BLAM’s initiative served to accommodate the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021 in the UK. London design studio Landmrk created the app on behalf of BLAM to deliver the narratives associated with black history without detracting from the message with gimmicky or unusual technology. The app is freely available to download and offers a blend of forward-thinking digital technology with a strong educational grounding to balance a need to both engage and inform.

Bringing AR to the ‘Gram

While museums have been successfully deploying AR technology across exhibitions for a number of years now Instagram is using its own existing AR technology to help broaden access and improve visitor engagement on behalf of museums worldwide. Less of a bespoke feature and more of a broadening of its use Instagram’s Spark AR platform was launched to help brands utilise AR tech in enhancing the customer experience to drive social-led sales. The flexibility of the technology has allowed Instagram to deliver a universal software solution to arts and culture organisations interested in exploring AR through 3rd party platforms.

Spark AR has traditionally been used to create filters for beauty and cosmetics companies to allow customers to effectively ‘try on’ products and looks using the in-app camera function. Applying this to museum settings has allowed the likes of the Palace of Versailles Grand Palais and Smithsonian to offer AR functionality to millions of users through Instagram. The AR feature supports a close-up look of museum content and displays by accessing the museum Instagram profile and using the camera from its effects section. It allows users to virtually visit museums (particularly useful during the current lockdown situation) or enhance an in-person experience by drawing AR-led additional information and angles that may not be possible. All that is required Is an Instagram account to obtain an up close and personal look at the various content displayed throughout partnership museums.

The potential global application of Spark AR through the Instagram worldwide user base makes this a more universal example of AR for museums through a 3rd party application. Where it is restricted is in the level of access offered by museum partners to the likes of Instagram (owned by Facebook). Currently the number of exhibits available is limited and with museums more than likely looking to retain control over their own AR-led offerings in future it is unlikely that we will see a full opening up of all exhibits and collections to receive the AR treatment via Instagram in future.

For now however the option to use Spark has created virtual access to museums using AR tech at a time when closures threated to close off access to visitors for an indefinite period of time. It might be AR light when it comes to the number of museums and exhibits available but it’s a step in the right direction for a sector still settling into the right way to balance AR with the expectations of a visitor base it can’t wait to welcome back in full.",,,

Maryland sports betting bill on the move

Capping off a busy legislative week during which South Dakota lawmakers became the first of 2021 to send sports betting legislation to a governor and legislators in two other states approved sports betting in one chamber the Maryland House Ways and Means Committee unanimously passed an amended version of its sports betting bill. The legislation could be debated and/or voted on the House floor as early as next week.

Voters in Maryland legalized sports wagering via referendum last November and lawmakers are now seeking to establish a framework to get it up and running. HB 940 had a hearing last week during which potential operators asked for a higher cap on digital-only licenses (it’s currently set at 10) and there was much conversation about minority participation and how to fund problem gambling programs. The bill would allow for statewide mobile sports betting as well as retail wagering at existing casinos and racetracks and would set the tax rate at 15% of gross gaming revenue up to $5 million and 7.5% over that.

KS bill passes House; WY on House floor

In Kansas the Senate quickly moved SB 84 through its Committee of the Whole and on to Final Passage 26-12 on Wednesday. The bill which names the Kansas Lottery as the regulator allows for statewide mobile with three skins per operator and sets the tax rate at 5.5% of gross gaming revenue for retail wagering and 8% for digital moves on the House. SB 84 requires that digital sports betting platforms be tethered to existing casinos or sports franchises including Kansas Speedway and Children’s Mercy Park home of the MLS Sporting KC.

The amended version makes it clear that sports wagering is prohibited on any “interscholastic sports event for kindergarten or any of the grades one through 12” among other changes. The bill also allows for tribal casinos to enter into compact negotiations with the governor to add sports betting as a Class III game.

The bill does not yet have a committee assignment in the House but lawmakers have plenty of time before the May 15 adjournment date.

Two days later the Wyoming House’s Committee of the Whole approved HB 133 an online-only sports betting bill. Wyoming lawmakers are so committed to NOT having retail wagering the following amendment was added to the following to the bill:

Online sports wagering shall not include or be conducted from any physical location created by a sports wagering operator or vendor for a patron to physically visit to place a wager.

Should Wyoming lawmakers legalize the state would be the second behind Tennessee to make online-only wagering law. The bill moves from the Committee of the Whole to House floor.

The reality is what comes across our screens only scratches the surface of evil in our neighborhoods nations and hearts. Christians aren’t surprised by this. We understand the sweeping effects of our rebellion against God (Gen. 3). We know we inhabit a fallen world. We’re saddened but not surprised when our news feeds confirm our doctrine of sin.

But it seems we’re drawn to observing this fallenness. We want to watch it. And so we scroll.

Welcome to doomscrolling.

Doomscrolling’s Origins

An article at Merriam-Webster’s “Words We’re Watching” describes doomscrolling as “the tendency to continue to surf or scroll through bad news even though that news is saddening disheartening or depressing.”

When did we start doomscrolling? In some ways the phenomenon isn’t new. Digital technologies have just given us faster access to greater quantities of bad news.

But we don’t need algorithms to prove we delight in darkness. We might trace the origins of doomscrolling to the moment Eve “saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes” (Gen. 3:6). The idolatry of her heart redirected the focus of her eyes. And after feasting with her husband on what she saw “the eyes of both were opened” (Gen. 3:7)—but they no longer saw well. Their sight was now subjected to sin.

Sin also commandeered the focus of the eyes when Noah’s son Ham saw the nakedness of his father. While his brothers Shem and Japheth were careful not to stare at their father’s nakedness Ham’s sinful gaze resulted in his father’s curse (Gen. 9:25). Not long after Lot’s wife set her eyes on Sodom—despite the clear command not to look back as they fled the city that would receive God’s wrath (Gen. 19:17 26).

Their eyes were drawn to evil as are ours. With flicking thumbs and bloodstained eyes we stand with Eve Ham and Lot’s wife in being drawn to gawk at the suffering and shame of others.

Profiting from Pain

The pandemic meant that most of us spent even more time looking at digital screens last year. And much of what we saw was unpleasant.

We were glued to our screens as we read the heartbreaking news of the deaths of Kobe Bryant his daughter Gianna and seven others. We watched update after update of the spreading COVID-19 virus. We tuned in to the political drama of the impeachment and acquittal of President Trump. We watched in horror at the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd. We watched cringeworthy debates and other election-year spectacles.

As we turned the calendar to a new year—yes that was all in 2020—we watched in surreal horror as a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol. And while we did enjoy a moment of humorous Bernie Sanders memes our digital engagement has left most of us emotionally exhausted.

While it may have been fruitful to watch some of these things we also need to remember that every headline is a sales pitch crafted to grab our attention accrue clicks and make money. Media companies profit from our addiction to doomscrolling. They’re motivated to keep us doing it—drawing us constantly from one horrific headline to the next from one “can’t turn away” breaking news disaster to another.

Doomscrolling and the Disciple’s Soul

Christians should reflect on how their digital habits are helping or hindering their discipleship. What is doomscrolling doing to your soul?

Media companies profit from our addiction to doomscrolling.

For one it fuels our anger. Doomscrolling is like stacking logs on a campfire to heighten the flames. With each new article we discover new links and new outrages that increase the heat. Doomscrolling also shapes our hearts to delight in calamity. While Scripture encourages us with the vision of the demise of evil (Rev. 18) it also warns us to avoid looking on at the demise of our neighbor (Luke 10:25–37). Doomscrolling turns our neighbor’s pain into our entertainment.

As our eyes take in images and headlines of hatred and evil our minds and hearts interpret and ingest them. If we’re not careful our soul begins to be shaped by the darkness we consume.

C. S. Lewis warns us in Mere Christianity:

Every time you make a choice you are turning the central part of you the part of you that chooses into something a little different than it was before. And taking your life as a whole with all your innumerable choices all your life long you are slowly turning this central thing into a heavenly creature or a hellish creature: either into a creature that is in harmony with God and with other creatures and with itself or else into one that is in a state of war and hatred with God and with its fellow creatures and with itself. To be the one kind of creature is heaven: that is it is joy and peace and knowledge and power. To be the other means madness horror idiocy rage impotence and eternal loneliness. Each of us at each moment is progressing to the one state of the other.

Doomscrollers Repent

In Isaiah 33 God reveals the connection of our repentance and our gaze:

He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly

who despises the gain of oppressions

who shakes his hands lest they hold a bribe

who stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed

and shuts his eyes from looking on evil

he will dwell on the heights;

his place of defense will be the fortresses of rocks;

his bread will be given him; his water will be sure. (Isa. 33:15–16)

Jesus urged his followers “If your right eye causes you to sin tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell” (Matt. 5:29). Where are your eyes looking? We must take our digital habits seriously. If you gravitate toward doomscrolling repent of this habit and turn your gaze to something—or Someone—better.

Doomscrolling turns our neighbor’s pain into our entertainment.

Tony Reinke paraphrases the psalmist’s plea in Psalm 119:33–40: “God grab my head and turn my eyes from looking at worthless things; and give me life in your ways as I behold the inestimable worth of your glory.”

Jesus is better than doomscrolling. He intends for you to see and bask in the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ not in the doom and darkness of the world."

The paper ""Capitalizing on conflict: How defense contractors and foreign nations lobby for arms sales"" details how a network of lobbyists and donors steered $285 million in campaign contributions and $2.5 billion in lobbying spending over the last two decades as well as hiring more than 200 lobbyists who previously worked in government.

The amount of money at stake is immense both at home and abroad the center states on its website OpenSecrets.org. Not only is a significant portion of the Pentagon's $740 billion annual budget spent on weapons the report explains but American defense firms agreed to sell $175 billion in weapons to other countries over the last year. That includes deals to sell $23 billion in F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and drones to the United Arab Emirates and billions more in sales to Taiwan and Saudi Arabia it adds.

The practice appears unlikely to change significantly under the Biden administration. The report notes that while President Joe Biden issued an order restricting officials who leave the White House from quickly lobbying the executive branch or registering as foreign agents several of his appointees have ties to the defense industry. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for example sat on Raytheon's board before joining the administration.

And since Biden's inauguration the report states the State Department has approved the sale of $85 million in missiles from Raytheon to Chile and a $60 million deal between Lockheed Martin and Jordan to provide F-16 Fighting Falcons and services.

Foreign nations that are among the arms industry's biggest customers also spend heavily to influence U.S. policy often to the tune of tens of millions of dollars in spending covered by the Foreign Agents Registration Act. However the report notes that some nations that spend the most such as South Korea and Japan focus more on trade and commercial issues than military spending.

Australia the United Arab Emirates Taiwan and Saudi Arabia are some of the other major buyers of American weapons.

Defense lobbyists are also among the best-connected in Washington D.C. the report states. Of the 663 lobbyists working for defense contractors nearly three-quarters used to work for the federal government -- the highest percentage of any industry according to the report.

""These connections make for cozy relationships and highly useful contact lists"" the report says. ""Overworked and underpaid congressional staffers can also hope that lucrative lobbying jobs await them at the same companies who come to them pushing their own agendas.""

The so-called ""revolving door"" also exists on Capitol Hill the report adds. Over the last 30 years nearly 530 staffers have both worked for a member of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees of both houses of Congress or the Defense Appropriations subcommittees and then as a lobbyist for defense companies.

The report highlights former Defense Secretary Mark Esper as an example of the revolving door in action. Esper worked for the Senate Foreign Relations and House Armed Services committees in the late 1990s and early 2000s as well as an assistant deputy secretary of defense before moving to Raytheon's government relations office. After seven years in that job President Donald Trump made him secretary of the Army and then head of the Defense Department.

Courtesy of BAE Systems.

The popular American image of a tank is the Army’s M1A1 Abrams. While heavy main battle tanks like the Abrams have slugged it out in classic cinematic tank battles it’s the light tanks that have often been a foot soldier’s best friend. They may be smaller and no match for main battle tanks but light tanks like the M3 Stuart and the M551 Sheridan protected U.S. troops from light armored vehicles mortars and heavy machine guns throughout WWII and the Cold War.

Now U.S. Army soldiers with the 82nd Airborne Division are testing the limits of a new generation of light tanks at Fort Bragg North Carolina. The outcome of those tests—and the opinions of the soldiers themselves—will likely crown the winner of the Army’s Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) acquisition program.

With MPF the Army is looking to give its airborne and light infantry units something they haven’t had since the 1990s: a light tank to augment their firepower and help them penetrate lightly armored medium-gunned defenses in natural or urban terrain. In the 1980s and early 1990s the M551 Sheridan filled that role but it was retired and its replacement the M8 Buford was canceled later in the decade.

It has taken the Army more than 20 years to get back to providing light tank capability to its Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs). These tanks will be more lethal easier to maintain and able to keep up with an IBCT’s new Infantry Squad Vehicle transports. They’ll need to be air transportable via C-17 cargo aircraft ready to fight upon landing and capable of learning new combat tricks as they age.

After cutting through a number of proposals only two prototypes remain one from General Dynamics Land Systems (GD) and another from BAE Systems (BAE). The service eventually wants 504 of these new tanks; an initial 26 will begin production in 2022 after a head-to-head soldier evaluation helps determine a winner.

As of early 2021 each company was supposed to have already delivered a dozen of its light tank prototypes to the Army including four examples of each to Fort Bragg. General Dynamics made the deadline and BAE’s prototype isn’t far behind.

When the full complement of MPF prototypes arrives at Fort Bragg soldiers will learn their capabilities and determine whether an IBCT can consistently keep the light tanks ready to rumble. They’ll also have a fundamental choice to make—whether to recommend a light tank or an even lighter tank.

Big & Bigger

Anything that meets the definition of a tank isn’t small. But there’s a big size difference between GD’s tanks and BAE’s tanks each following a design lineage that stems from its maker’s previous vehicles. General Dynamics builds the Army’s main battle tank the 68-ton M1 Abrams which is designed to defeat enemy tanks and heavy armor. BAE builds the 28-ton Bradley Fighting Vehicle designed to transport infantry or scouts with armor protection.

Both have drawn bits of mechanical DNA from these two vehicles to bring their MPF prototypes to life.

BAE Systems BAE’s tank stems from a design conceived for the Army’s Armored Gun System (AGS) an air transportable light tank to replace the M551 Sheridan. Developed by one of BAE's corporate ancestors the result was the M8 Buford (pictured) and the first prototypes arrived at Fort Knox in 1995. But the Pentagon canceled the AGS program in 1997 a victim of unfavorable assessments and the defense draw-down of the late 90s. Though the M8 never made it into active service it forms the conceptual basis for BAE’s MPF. “We decided to stay in the same size weight space envelope that we had for the AGS program” Jim Miller BAE’s director of business development told Popular Mechanics. “We think that fits what the Army really wants.” BAE describes its MPF as somewhere between the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) and Stryker infantry carrier in terms of size. It weighs in the low- to mid-20-ton range. Size has implications for everything from thermal and electronic signatures to armor protection crew and transportability. The Army specifies that two MPFs need to fit inside a C-17 airlifter so they can be flown to airfields to support expeditionary forces. According to Miller a C-17 will hold three fully armored BAE light tanks and with its armor removed one could even fit in a C-130 Hercules the workhorse of the Army. “You can get your hands on a C-130 in a combat theater” Miller says referring to the larger number of Hercs compared to C-17s. BAE’s MPF carries a three-man crew (a commander gunner and driver) like its M8 predecessor and a small crew requires less support in the field. Added benefits of the tank’s size include a smaller profile as well as a smaller radar cross-section making it harder to target BAE says. Image: Wikimedia Commons Wikimedia Commons General Dynamics “The basic vehicle design from the chassis to the turret electronic architecture and power generation all offer growth” GD Land Systems Director Tim Reese told Popular Mechanics. Growth potential stems from the fact that the company’s MPF is large somewhere in the 30 to 40 ton range. A pair of its light tanks will fit on a C-17 as the Army requires Reese says. General Dynamics’ prototype has been described as combining a chassis based on its AJAX family (pictured) of light armored vehicles with its M1 Abrams turret design and elements of its Griffin tank demonstrator. Reese says this new tank “uses their lessons in a purpose-built vehicle” while adding what he calls a few advanced technologies “that are unique.” The size of GD’s MPF enables it to better accommodate technological growth including new sensors and protection systems the company says. It also eases incorporation of a new battery (likely lithium) and power management system. With more available space in its turret and driver's station the tank also yields better livability and division of work for its four person crew (a commander gunner loader driver) according to MPF program director Scott Stilson. “If you have to spend long periods in the vehicle warfighters should see less fatigue.” The extra real estate offers five paths of egress for the tank commander and crew including hatches in the side of the hull. “Those are lessons learned from Iraq and Afghanistan during rollover situations” Reese says. General Dynamics maintains that size helps with placing future sensors and weapons possibly including lasers. The ability to separate ammunition storage from the turret is another benefit.

Speed & Power

The speed of a light infantry brigade is generally governed by the pace at which its soldiers march and overcome opposition. But with the arrival of the air-droppable ISV forward elements of IBCTs can now move at over 60 mph cross-country.

BAE Systems The M8 Buford could do about 47 mph depending on conditions and BAE says its MPF can reach 45 mph. Reports say BAE will use a 550 horsepower turbo diesel and Miller says that MTU (Detroit Diesel) is BAE’s supplier suggesting the engine could be a version of Detroit’s 15.6 liter DD16. BAE has also considered hybrid-electric powertrains though there are no current plans to integrate one. The company won’t reveal the MPF’s range but with similar weight/size to the M8 Buford the newer tank may match its predecessor’s legs around 280 miles. BAE’s MPF rides on a traditional torsion bar suspension but uses a composite rubber track (CRT) developed by Soucy Defense (pictured) rather than a conventional steel track. The CRT yields better fuel economy braking and acceleration reduces noise and weight and produces a better ride. “We didn’t really understand the benefit of the Soucy track” Miller acknowledges. “When we started driving the vehicles we noticed a big difference. You don’t have the constant bounce and vibration of a steel track.” Image: Soucy Defense Soucy Defense General Dynamics Any light tank supporting these fast-moving troops from the 82nd Airborne will need to keep pace. But Reese is confident that his firm’s MPF (pictured) “can keep up with the formation whatever it might be doing.” The company wouldn’t say what powerplant its tank uses or what speed it can attain but reporting suggests it has an 800 horsepower turbo diesel capable of top speeds around 45 mph (depending on terrain and the level of armor). General Dynamics also wouldn’t get into details about what range the tank might have but past light tanks like the Sheridan and M8 have published ranges of 250-350 miles. Reese says that GD’s MPF has “a lot more capability than past vehicles” suggesting the range might dip below these numbers. The tank will ride on traditional steel tracks using a lighter road wheel design with improved durability and lower noise and vibration according to General Dynamics. Its advanced suspension forgoes the traditional torsion-bar set up in favor of external hydraulic suspension units which bolt to the side of the hull offering a better ride and protection. The MPF will “be a real joy to motor cross-country. Soldiers will love it. It has great top speed good tactical range” Reese says. Image: General Dynamics General Dynamics

Firepower & Protection

A light tank is essentially artillery for the IBCT.

As Brigadier General Ross Coffman director of the Army’s Next Generation Combat Vehicle Cross-Functional Team told Army Times in 2018: “There’s no precision munition to remove bunkers from the battlefield to shoot into buildings in dense urban terrain...The MPF will be used to disrupt break in and breach those secure defensive zones.”

The Army required several common elements in both competitors including the main gun. GD and BAE will use a 105 mm NATO-standard M35 low recoil cannon. Sources put its maximum range at about 8975 yards (8200 meters). Both will use a Raytheon-made second-generation FLIR sight/sensor system and both will have scalable armor capable of being installed or removed in the field.

BAE Systems BAE’s armor can be installed by its crew with onboard tools in about three hours. It’s a bolt-on bolt-off affair that allows tailoring protection to expected threats. The tank also sports a new hull design to counter IEDs that weren’t envisioned when BAE designed the M8. “The front of the vehicle is sloped in such a way and is low enough that it’s pretty hard to hit” Miller says. “If you do get a shot at it the shape and size limit the chances of damage to the vehicle.” The crew will use a 21-round auto-loader enabling fire at rates up to 12 rounds per minute. Miller says the loader also allows the crew to chamber and then return rounds to the exact location where they were in the magazine. Like its competitor BAE’s tank will have a turret-mounted 12.7-mm heavy machine gun linked with its fire control system. It also has provision for a future active protection system or APS—a radar-guided system that typically fires patterns of explosive penetrators to defeat incoming rocket-propelled grenades or anti-tank guided missiles. The flat panel-radars and launchers for such a system can be easily removed BAE says. Image BAE Systems BAE Systems General Dynamics “We leverage the V3 fire control system of the Abrams tank” Reese says. In fact GD has said that its MPF turret has the same displays architecture and power distribution as the M1 Abrams SEPV3 turret (pictured). IBCT’s don’t have Abrams crews but some of those personnel will help stand-up the new MPF complements and be part of the soldier assessment of these new tanks. Reese adds that the turret has a purpose-designed commander’s independent thermal viewer similar to one in use with the Abrams but with new features. “It’s a capability we offer that we don’t think our competitors do.” One reason for the larger crew complement may be that GD’s MPF uses a manual loader rather than an autoloader. The company would not share details on its magazine capacity (possibly larger than BAE’s owing to size) or rate of fire though a dedicated loader crewman may put it on par with BAE’s rounds-per-minute. With a future APS in mind Reese cites GD’s previous experience with Rafael’s Trophy APS system on its Abrams tank. “We have the electronic architecture power and physical ability to mount whatever APS the Army ultimately chooses [for MPF].” Image: General Dynamics LCpl Kelsey J. Green / General Dynamics

Support and Serviceability

The Army has indicated that it wants to keep its IBCTs agile and that it “does not anticipate a significant increase to IBCT field maintenance to support the MPF.” That makes serviceability incredibly important.

BAE Systems BAE says its chief goal with its MPF was to keep things “logistically simple” from its size to its composite rubber track. “You’re not constantly tinkering with it to keep it moving” Miller says. The engine is located at the rear of the tank and can be cranked out on a cradle using a hand crank or power drill. The engine can even run while on the cradle and its modular design supports component replacement. Swapping one engine for another doesn’t require removing armor from the rear of the tank which speeds up the repair process. The tank can also be recovered by the standard HEMTT trucks already incorporated within an IBCT. “This is a vehicle going to an infantry brigade” Miller says. “They don’t have heavy vehicle recovery assets. You won’t need an M88 [heavy recovery vehicle] to go get one.” Image: BAE Systems BAE Systems General Dynamics General Dynamics’ MPF (pictured) has been designed with an emphasis on line-replaceable modules with self-diagnosis capability. “Actual repairs to the modules are much easier than on most versions of the Abrams tank” Reese says. The engine resides in the front of the tank and major components of the propulsion system—the engine transmission and accessories—are located in selected positions for easy access. Stilson says that “our power pack removal and installation is very quick” comparing its quick-disconnect electrical and hydraulic interfaces to similar layouts in the Abrams and Stryker vehicles. If soldiers have worked on an Abrams in their Army tenure they’ll feel at home maintaining the MPF Reese says. “We wanted to make it very familiar for some of the other [maintenance specialists] already in the fleet.” Image: U.S. Army / Sgt. James Harvey Sgt. James Harvey

The Soldiers Decide

The Army’s Ground Combat Systems office acknowledges that personnel at Fort Bragg are “excited about being able to be the first soldiers to operate a cutting-edge new combat platform.”

The tanks that GD delivered immediately stirred curiosity Reese says. “The soldiers were climbing all over them. They were excited. They wanted to hop inside and see how they worked.”

Miller expects a similar reaction from the troops when BAE’s prototypes show up at Fort Bragg. “We’ll get sense for whether [a simplified logistic model] is valued by the crews and commanders and whether they’re willing to trade off some other things to get that footprint.”

It’s worth noting that MPF isn’t the most friendly of competitions with both players aware of what’s at stake. The winner could also win over the Marine Corps which has already decided that its M1s are too heavy for future amphibious warfare; a light tank replacement could be the perfect solution.

Whoever wins the future of infantry firepower will be fought—and found—on the fields of Fort Bragg.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5jZS1ibG9nLmNvbS9nZW5lcmFsLWR5bmFtaWNzLWVhZ2xlLXZlaGljbGVzLWhpdC0xNDJtLW1pbGVzLW9uLWl0cy1vcGVyYXRpb25zLXdvcmxkd2lkZS_SAWhodHRwczovL2RlZmVuY2UtYmxvZy5jb20vZ2VuZXJhbC1keW5hbWljcy1lYWdsZS12ZWhpY2xlcy1oaXQtMTQybS1taWxlcy1vbi1pdHMtb3BlcmF0aW9ucy13b3JsZHdpZGUvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,General Dynamics' EAGLE vehicles hit 142M miles on its operations worldwide,"The EAGLE family of vehicles which are manufactured by General Dynamics covered more than 230 million km (142 million miles) on its operations worldwide.

Bill Whitsitt of the USS Montana Committee provided details of the state’s namesake nuclear submarine to KGVO News.

“She is in the water and this is a wonderful milestone toward completion of the ship and then the commissioning in about a year into the Navy fleet” said Whitsitt. “It's been a long time getting to this point but as I say she is afloat and that's a very important milestone.”

Whitsitt provided more details about the USS Montana and her mission.

“This is a leading edge Virginia class nuclear powered fast attack submarine that has really a lot of mission capabilities that we certainly need in the world today in dangerous places whether Asia the Indo Pacific or other places” he said. “She has been under construction since 2015.""

Whitsitt said the USS Montana is being outfitted with her full weapons package and the crew has already been hard at work in their new boat.

“She will be completed with all of her weapons systems and all of the finishing to be done” he said. “She's about 92% complete as of this conversation and the crew has been under intense training on all the systems aboard the vessel. For the better part of a year they've actually even though they were onshore in a big facility they've been pulling 24/7 watches on the nuclear reactor because that has been fueled and undergoing testing for quite some time.”

It may already be known that the majority of the crew aboard the USS Montana are loyal Montana Grizzly fans as the boat itself shows.

“The Navy designers who did the emblem which is seen also on our website if you scroll down through the news blogs there's a whole piece about the emblem. But the emblem actually has a snarling Grizzly in the bow wave as the boat prepares to dive.”

Whitsitt said the captain and crew will find some way to include the Bobcats but it is well known how uncomfortable cats are in the water. There may be an effort to include a full-sized Bobcat in one of the mess areas.

Through the teaming agreement with General Dynamics Electric Boat approximately 10000 shipbuilders as well as suppliers from all 50 states have participated in USS Montana’s construction since the work began in 2015."

Let’s get one thing straight: When it comes to the best cereals Cinnamon Toast Crunch will always make our list. Over the years General Mills has released varieties like Sugar Cookie and Chocolate Churros. Soon we’ll have Dulce de Leche Toast Crunch according to Instagram account @cereallife.

Classic dulce de leche is a thick confection that’s made by slowly heating sweetened milk. The color changes and it becomes a sauce with a caramel flavor so it’s super versatile to use with a range of desserts. And now apparently it’ll be used in cereal.

Although we don’t have much detail on the new cereal based off of the packaging it’s fair to assume that the square cereal pieces swap the usual sweet cinnamon flavor for a sweet caramel-like flavor. If that’s not enough to pique your interest we don’t know what is!

Since the news broke on Instagram there’s no official information on when it’ll be hitting stores. As you can see on the box it notes that it’s a “sales sample” and “not for retail sale.” We’ll keep you updated as we learn more info on this already must-try cereal.

The issue of ethics in journalism has gained currency this week with the revelation by BuzzFeed News that New York Times op-ed columnist David Brooks failed to disclose to readers his significant financial remuneration from Weave a community-building social project of the Aspen Institute—largely funded by Facebook and Amazon—that has been a frequent subject of Brooks’ columns.

By contrast Gladwell’s star turn in GM’s commercials could hardly be more public.

The 58-year-old Gladwell who has been writing prolifically for The New Yorker since 1996 is no ordinary journalist. He’s a huge star—a famous popularizer of the social sciences and a mixed-media phenom who goes on late-night talk shows hosts podcasts co-founded his own podcast company whimsically titled Pushkin Industries serves on the board of the Rand Corporation and commands six-figure lecture fees.

And now he’s a paid celebrity endorser for GM’s “next generation” electric vehicle innovation campaign.

“We have a six-month contract for those ads and that’s the extent of our relationship with him” Stuart Fowle GM brand and digital communications manager told The Daily Beast. The automaker and defense contractor spends around $3 billion annually on advertising and Gladwell’s talent agents at WME the entertainment powerhouse presumably would have negotiated for a tasty crumb of that pie.

“We generally don’t comment on costs of things but yeah you can make that assumption” Fowle said. “I can confirm we’re paying him for his involvement in the ads.”

While Gladwell argues that he seldom writes for The New Yorker anymore—his last piece (about the safety of marijuana) was published in 2019—and thus is not bound by constraints that apply to working reporters the GM gig is raising eyebrows among journalism traditionalists.

“This would not have been allowed at any publication I worked for” said former newspaper reporter and editor Lucy Dalglish dean of the University of Maryland’s Philip Merrill College of Journalism. “Nor would Merrill College ever teach that it is okay for a staff writer to endorse commercial products of any sort.”

Prominent author Todd Gitlin a professor of journalism at Columbia University emailed The Daily Beast that Gladwell “should donate his fee to nonprofits that promote renewable energy. It’s one thing when a ballplayer accepts a fee for appearing in a commercial. The ballplayer’s prestige does not rest on his or her reputation for freedom from commercial interests—in other words truthfulness.”

Gitlin added: “A widely published journalist should not be shilling for a private company unless he is beyond suspicion of accepting payment for an endorsement. If he pockets the check he damages his reputation for being a straight shooter. Suppose for the sake of argument that something goes wrong with GM’s EVs; suppose there are recalls etc. (It’s not uncommon.) Wouldn’t Gladwell be if nothing else embarrassed?”

Gladwell for his part stoutly defended his participation in GM’s ads emailing The Daily Beast: “oh for goodness sake this is a mountain out of a molehill. i have written exactly one article for the magazine in the last five years [actually six articles]… i have moved on to an entirely different business”—namely podcasting.

Addressing Gitlin’s criticisms Gladwell noted that the podcast he hosts Revisionist History depends on advertisers just like every other podcast. (That also applies to podcasts hosted by writers at The Daily Beast.)

“The students Todd Gitlin teaches at Columbia Journalism School pay over $100000 a year for the privilege of hearing him speak. Because we do advertising the people who listen to Revisionist History and the other podcast offerings of Pushkin Industries get their podcasts for free” Gladwell emailed. “If Professor Gitlin would like to discuss the relative ethical implications of those two systems I’d be happy to oblige.”

However reading ad copy to tout a product that supports your podcast—and Gladwell says he has done more than 100 such commercials for such companies as Ziprecruiter and Hotel Tonight—is arguably different in kind and degree from a lucrative deal to lend one’s face voice and reputation to a global corporate behemoth whose subsidiaries span not only automaking but also financial services scientific research communications technology and government defense contracting.

Gladwell appears in three out of four commercials that GM rolled out in the past two weeks. He’s most prominent in the so-called “anthem” spot that opens with the writer stepping onto the bare chassis of an electric vehicle-in-development.

“Change” Gladwell intones straight to camera. “You can either resist it be left behind or embrace it and move forward.” After a series of quick cuts to other celebs and influencers including pro surfer and shark attack survivor Bethany Hamilton Peloton instructor Cody Rigsby and gamer Erin Simon Gladwell reappears to declare: “And that changes everything.”

“[D]o i think it raises ethical issues? not really” Gladwell a former colleague of this writer at The Washington Post said in a lengthy email. “i mean i spent my two previous careers at institutions supported by ad dollars. the only difference now is that the practice in my new industry is that the host does the ad him or herself. but i’m not sure why that difference amounts to an ethical distinction. when you and i worked at the post way back when our salaries were paid by [department stores] woodies and hechts!! not much has changed.”

Gladwell added: “i’m now really devoted to building pushkin… i’ve done well over 100 commercials at this point. every podcast host has. it’s how we pay the bills! i actually really enjoy doing them. and especially writing them—when i get the chance. (i wanted to be a copywriter way back when). my producer jacob smith and I did a series for ziprecruiter about the travails of horace throgbottom III (partner of the firm throgbottom throgbottom and throgbottom) that I’m particularly proud of. we also did something for hotel tonight about how psycho would never have happened if janet leigh had hotel tonight. i was inordinately proud of that one…

“i try to stick to brands i use or believe in. so tracksmith makes the best running stuff in the world and i’m a big runner. so that was a natural. [Without being identified last November Gladwell did a Tracksmith commercial’s poetic voiceover.] i’m also a MASSIVE car nut. (i spend an embarrassing amount of time in bringatrailer.com and the car and driver website). and if you are into cars then you’re into GM since they are the engineering gold standard. (i would give my eye teeth for a low mileage [Cadillac] cts-v wagon.)”

In October Gladwell also played himself opposite comedian Kevin Hart in a television commercial for the audiobook and podcast distributor Audible.

Gladwell’s commercial relationship with GM began when the company’s marketing department contacted him because of his October 2017 article about driverless vehicle technology in Car and Driver magazine.

“We knew that he was interested in this space and obviously his book The Tipping Point was all about being the tipping point for change” GM’s Fowle said noting that initial discussions with Gladwell were about his involvement in the company’s exhibit for this year’s (virtual due to the pandemic) Consumer Electronics Show—for which the writer did a video interview of GM President Mark Reuss. “That interview and Malcolm’s involvement in our CES exhibit started the conversation… and got him involved in the filming of the campaign.”

The commercials began appearing nationally on television and online in mid-February Fowle said and remain ubiquitous on TV screens.

As for The New Yorker Gladwell continues to be listed as a staff writer.

“Many of our staff writers are independent contractors as Malcolm is and are therefore free to take on outside work” said a spokesperson for the magazine. “We have no plans for Malcolm to write about the auto industry.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmNvbXBsYWludHMuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9nbS1jcmFja2VkLWRhc2gtcmVjYWxsLW5vdC1saWtlbHkuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM Cracked Dash Recall Not Likely | CarComplaints.com,"Appeals court affirms dismissal of GM cracked dash lawsuit over Cadillac Chevy and GMC models.

March 6 2021 — A GM cracked dash recall isn't likely to happen for owners of the following models after an appeals court affirmed the dismissal of a General Motors lawsuit.

2007-2014 Cadillac Escalade

2007-2014 Chevrolet Avalanche

2007-2014 Chevrolet Silverado

2007-2014 Chevrolet Suburban

2007-2014 Chevrolet Tahoe

2007-2014 GMC Sierra

2007-2014 GMC Yukon

The plaintiffs argue a GM cracked dash recall has long been needed because the automaker knew about dashboard problems based on pre-production testing that allegedly occurred in 2005 and 2006.

The plaintiffs also claim GM learned about the alleged dashboard defect because the automaker “follow[s] industry-approved engineering and quality standards” every time GM makes a change to its cars.

The GM dashboards have instrument panel part numbers 19331331 19331340 23224747 23224748 and 23224749.

Because GM changed the dashboard design for its GMT900 series the plaintiffs insist GM must have performed this testing “early in the design process” and uncovered the “safety risks associated with the changed design.”

Did GM Know About Cracked Dashboards?

But the appeals court determined the plaintiffs made no specific allegations about the results of the tests such as data or documents confirming or even suggesting whether the defect became known.

And “[j]ust because plaintiffs plead testing and the testing could reveal the safety risks alleged does not make it plausible GM knew of the existence of these safety risks.”

In fact the plaintiffs admit they never presented any “allegation that specifically says” pre-production testing alerted GM to the cracked dash defect.

The appeals court says all of this confirms the district court’s finding the plaintiffs never asserted how or why testing revealed the dashboard defect or alleged that through “this testing . . . GM somehow learned that the cracked dashboard was a risk.”

According to the appeals court the cracked dash lawsuit doesn't explain how the plaintiffs determined a cracked dash posed a safety risk ""a fact that would have helped show how either party would have gained knowledge about the risk not whether that risk existed.""

The allegations in the lawsuit merely identify the dashboards can crack and then the plaintiffs say GM could have theoretically known about the flaw. But the court says ""that’s not enough.""

GM Cracked Dash Complaints

According to the GM cracked dash class action customer complaints allegedly show GM knew the dashboard were defective including from online complaints and complaints made to the government. This includes 239 complaints filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) related to cracked dashboards.

But the appeals court found the existence of these complaints fails to show GM knew about alleged safety implications of the cracked dashboards.

""Indeed only one customer articulated that the cracked dashboard could lead to an unsafe deployment of airbags. And so while the complaints might have put GM on notice about the cracked dashboard they did not create knowledge about the safety risk alleged by Plaintiffs. That is especially true because the alleged airbag malfunction has never occurred."" — Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals

According to the plaintiffs GM reads complaints online and searches government data searching for dashboard complaints but the appeals court ruled the claims are speculative and include no supporting facts.

The court also referenced a previous Ford lawsuit where the district judge found a small number of complaints were nothing more than “a blip on Ford’s complaints-and-repairs radar” considering the millions of Ford cars on the roads.

The court ruled allegations of complaints made online and directly to Ford don't show Ford knew about possible problems with the dashboards. And nothing shows the dashboard complaints were “frequent enough that they were not lost in a sea of complaints and repairs amassing by the dozens each day.”

The appeals court also ruled the plaintiffs failed when claiming GM knew about dangerous dashboard defects based on an increase in dashboard warranty claims.

The class action alleges GM received data in 2019 about an increase in dashboard repair warranty claims. But the warranty claims don't prove GM knew about an alleged safety risk associated with alleged airbag problems.

And the appeals court says the plaintiffs ""offer no facts showing why the warranty claims informed GM of the safety hazard rather than a mere cosmetic issue.""

According to the court many GM owners allege their dashboards did not crack until after driving their car tens or hundreds of thousands of miles over many years.

""So it seems odd to say GM knew at the time of sale about a dashboard crack that developed only after a GMT900 vehicle traveled many miles over many years. Rephrased Plaintiffs’ argument implies that GM knew about the safety ramifications of that defect when it sold the cars even though the defect took time to manifest. That makes little sense.""

The GM cracked dash lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan: Smith et al. v. General Motors LLC.

According to our friends at Corvette Blogger  “the actual ending date may float somewhat depending on what happens between now and then.” The cited publication refers to a couple of issues starting with the global chip shortage that affects every automaker out there. The second problem is of course the sanitary crisis that hinders the automotive industry since 2020.Speaking on the Corvette Today podcast Corvette product manager Harlan Charles let it slip that the changeover to the 2022 model at Bowling Green “may be more of a late summer than early summer.” The latter half of July can definitely be considered late summer giving the rumor some credibility.The cited publication expects GM to offer more information on the 2022 Corvette at the Michelin NCM Bash on April 22nd and GM definitely should because everyone is looking forward to the Z06. As a brief refresher the first performance-oriented variant of the mid-engine Corvette will switch from traditional pushrods to avalvetrain and a flat-plane crankshaft.As opposed to the LT2 small-block V8 with 6.2 liters of displacement and up to 495 horsepower the LT5 in the Z06 flexes 5.5 liters and 600-odd horsepower. The high-revving motor breathes freely as well which makes a huge difference over the preceding generation's LT4 supercharged V8.Expected with a center exhaust active aero trickery carbon-fiber wheels and Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 R high-performance rubber shoes the Z06 isn’t the only addition to the Corvette range for the 2022 model year. As previously reported on autoevolution General Motors intends to roll out three new exterior colors in the form of Amplify Orange Tintcoat Hypersonic Gray Metallic and Caffeine Brown Metallic (RPO codes GC5 GA7 and G48).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8wMy9nbS1jb25zaWRlcmVkLXVzaW5nLWM3LWNvcnZldHRlLXpyMXMtbHQ1LXY4LWluLWNhZGlsbGFjLWN0NS12LWJsYWNrd2luZy_SAXFodHRwczovL2dtYXV0aG9yaXR5LmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjEvMDMvZ20tY29uc2lkZXJlZC11c2luZy1jNy1jb3J2ZXR0ZS16cjFzLWx0NS12OC1pbi1jYWRpbGxhYy1jdDUtdi1ibGFja3dpbmcvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM Considered Using C7 Corvette ZR1’s LT5 V8 In Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/03/gm-considered-using-c7-corvette-zr1s-lt5-v8-in-cadillac-ct5-v-blackwing/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8wMy9nbS1jb25zaWRlcmVkLXVzaW5nLWM3LWNvcnZldHRlLXpyMXMtbHQ1LXY4LWluLWNhZGlsbGFjLWN0NS12LWJsYWNrd2luZy_SAXFodHRwczovL2dtYXV0aG9yaXR5LmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjEvMDMvZ20tY29uc2lkZXJlZC11c2luZy1jNy1jb3J2ZXR0ZS16cjFzLWx0NS12OC1pbi1jYWRpbGxhYy1jdDUtdi1ibGFja3dpbmcvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2RldGFpbGVkLWxvb2stYmFjay1vbGRzbW9iaWxlLWFsZXJvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Detailed Look Back At The Oldsmobile Alero,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2RldGFpbGVkLWxvb2stYmFjay1vbGRzbW9iaWxlLWFsZXJvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Where you’re from/place of origin:

I grew up in Pasadena Texas (a suburb of Houston)

Where you previously studied:

Baylor University Waco TX (BSE Computer Engineering)

University of Texas Austin TX (MBA)

University of Michigan Ann Arbor MI (PhD)



Previous roles:

Before joining academia I worked as a systems consultant designing and implementing various types of forecasting budgeting and decision support systems. I joined Goizueta as the Advisory Board Term Professor of Accounting in 2017 and was named interim dean in 2020. Prior to joining Goizueta I served as the Russell E. Palmer Endowed Professor of Accounting at Michigan State University. I’ve also held academic appointments at the University of Texas at Austin and the Stephen F. Austin State University and visiting appointments at Monash University University of Melbourne Wake Forest University and the University of California at Davis.

My research into the field of performance measurement and reward systems the role of forecasting and budgetary systems within organizations and control in interorganizational collaborations involves extensive corporate engagement and has enabled me to partner across industries – health care tech financial services automotive and more. I’ve worked with Disney Amazon Genuine Parts Company Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital Microsoft Cargill and Marriott to name a few companies.

How has your business school adapted to the Covid-19 crisis and what initiatives and innovations have you implemented?

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to change how we work and learn organizations like ours have had to adapt to provide the best for our students staff and faculty but it’s also pushed us to re-evaluate our business models for a new reality.

Like many other schools over the past year Goizueta faculty pivoted to virtual teaching and were quick to adopt many new interactive tools and applications including virtual case discussions breakout room technologies virtual polling and many others. We also set up virtual forums and discussion boards for faculty to exchange tips and ideas. Many of the activities and services we traditionally deliver in-person such as career treks to San Francisco and New York or recruiting or career managment events were delivered virtually and we saw greater participation by students and corporate partners.

In 2021 it’s not just the ability to adapt that’s key. It’s the ability to embrace change identify opportunities and help define the future. The time is now to explore the benefits and possibilities of digital learning and what it means for the future of teaching. The flexibility that digital learning tools provide is a perfect fit for busy working professionals international students and individuals who have responsibilities that prevent them from coming to campus.

We’ve invested heavily in digital learning experiences and are launching next generation digital classrooms (Goizueta Global Classrooms) this spring hologram technology and virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) experiences. And now Goizueta is poised to take digital learning to the next level by providing business professionals with a true immersive dynamic experience from anywhere in the world.

Expected to be in use later this year holograms will allow Goizueta to invite guest speakers from all over the world appearing as if they are right in front of students. Holograms also would make “pop up” classrooms possible in locations around the world. This method is far less expensive than sending a faculty member into the client’s location say in far-away places like Shanghai or Rome for in-person instruction. In the long run this technology is expected to increase flexibility for new programs and create unique opportunities for innovation.

Additionally gamification or the use of game-like virtual reality (VR) simulations can pave the way for immersive learning experiences without incurring the costs of associated travel and relying on external partners to create these learning experiences. In Goizueta’s current curriculum students go to off-campus locations for experiential learning. With VR simulation students can “travel” to locations while in the classroom and have the same type of immersive learning experience.

While the pandemic has presented a number of challenges we’re really pushing ourselves to embrace change and see the opportunity within it. Digital learning offers an opportunity to expand Goizueta’s reach globally while continuing to offer the world-class educational experiences and opportunities our students have come to expect.

What do you feel are the most important skills needed for managing a business school through a crisis?

I am coming at this question from the perspective of a newly appointed interim dean. For me the most critical component of managing the business school through crisis was to quickly build the trust of the leadership team and the broader community. Key to this was signaling my desire to be transparent and then following through with that transparency.

How has your career helped to shape your leadership capabilities and your priorities for your role as Dean? Can you share an anecdote about a previous instance/moment in your career that you feel has left a lasting impact on you?

I have spent my career as a research faculty member. Stepping into this leadership role was a transformational experience for me. My priorities shifted from a focus on my own scholarly community to a focus on my school and university community.

As a faculty member engaged in critical evaluation of scholarly work (both as giver and receiver!) I constantly remind myself of a quote by editorialist and author Thomas Friedman that I find particularly meaningful

“There are two kinds of critics in life: those who criticize you because they want you to fail and those who criticize you because they want you to succeed. And people can smell the difference a mile away.”

I carried this sentiment with me to the Dean’s office. It has helped me challenge myself to think about how I treat others and remind me of the need to be humble and assume the best in others who criticize me.

What do you see as the greatest challenges and opportunities for business education in the coming years and what is your business school strategy to tackle this?

Students today demand more of their education and of their employers. They want purpose in their professional lives and they want to work for an organization that is purpose-driven. At Goizueta we build principled leaders ready to solve the biggest issues of our society.

Earlier this month as a reflection of our elevated commitment to social impact we launched The Roberto C. Goizueta Business & Society Institute. The Institute’s goal is to transform business to solve society’s challenges through cutting-edge research innovative programming and principled leadership. The belief is that business and society can work collectively to address the challenges of inequality and climate change two of the most pressing challenges facing both business and society today.

The Institute creates interdisciplinary study that explores the connections between business practices market structures and social and environmental outcomes. For example our Start: ME program offers an intensive 14-week business accelerator program to the most promising micro-entrepreneurs in underserved metro Atlanta communities including business training mentorship and early-stage financing to develop their businesses. Through this initiative we are working to create stronger communities in Atlanta and globally.

Another area of opportunity both in business education and business itself is building a student body and workforce that fully reflects the broader society. Business schools can achieve this through partnerships and unique programming.

For example late last year Goizueta MBA student Willie Sullivan spearheaded a virtual business case competition to support companies in tackling racial inequality from within. Teams from across the country examined disparities in wealth health and education and created strategies for corporations to address racial injustice. At the finals of the John R. Lewis Racial Justice Case Competition MBA teams from Emory Harvard MIT Yale and the University of Southern California presented ideas to the event’s corporate partners including HP Johnson & Johnson Salesforce Southern Company Truist and Walmart. I was so proud to see our students and partners coming together to push for critical change to strengthen business and communities alike.

Finally Goizueta places a huge value on innovation. We utilize our Executive Education courses as a testing ground for instructional innovation. Through our Experimentation Zone Fund and Innovation Fund we also invest in innovative ideas for education and community engagement from faculty students and staff. We are innovating how we deliver programming as well. As mentioned above Goizueta is poised to take digital learning to the next level by providing business professionals with a true immersive dynamic experience from anywhere in the world.

What would you say is your biggest achievement in your career so far?

While I certainly have had success as a leader in my academic field when I look back on my career I think I will look on this time as my biggest career achievement. That I was chosen for this role means I gained the confidence of our faculty after only three years at Goizueta. I stepped into the role during a time of crisis and have thus far navigated it in a way that I’m proud of.

If you could give one life lesson/piece of advice to your younger self/young female leaders what would it be?

Don’t be afraid to stretch yourself. Have confidence that you will discover within yourself the knowledge and intuition you need to meet the challenges you will face or that you will have the self-awareness to know when and from whom to seek advice. Either way you will find a way to succeed and while you should be grateful to those who helped you along the way don’t forget to own your success.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzL3RoZS10dXJuaW5nLXBvaW50LWF1dG8tY29tcG9uZW50cy1jYXItcGFydHMtc3RhcnR1cC1zcGFyZXNodWLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[The Turning Point] A personal pain point led to launch of car parts startup SparesHub,"An MBA may be a stepping stone to further one’s career for many but for Tapas Gupta it also translated into finding a co-founder for his Pune-based automobile parts ecommerce platform ﻿SparesHub﻿.





After completing management courses from Nirma University Ahmedabad in 2010 Tapas and Arijit Chakraborty continued their corporate journeys. Tapas worked with companies like ﻿Mercedes-Benz﻿ and ﻿CRISIL﻿ while Arijit gained experience at ﻿Tata Motors﻿ and Dell International.





While he was at CRISIL Tapan recalls a time when his family members were struggling to find genuine and quality spare parts for their car.

“Garages and car workshops had limited sources of buying car parts and the car owner faced delays and paid high prices” he says. He adds that this was the time when ecommerce players like Flipkart and Snapdeal were becoming popular but none of them sold car parts online.

Tapas started toying with the idea of starting an ecommerce website only for car parts which would deliver pan-India. He studied the market size and scope in India and was convinced that this was a large opportunity to tap using ecommerce.





He launched SparesHub in 2013 and got his first customer within four days of launching the website. He soon connected with his batchmate and friend Arijit and given their shared interest in the automobile industry Arijit joined the company as a co-founder.

Going the B2B way

It began by taking the B2C route but Spareshub pivoted to B2B in 2015 because car workshops started routinely buying car parts from the company. The startup now caters only to B2B customers and promises same-day delivery of genuine spare parts on competitive pricing.

“SparesHub is solving the problem of supply chain inefficiency in the auto industry using technology. We provide car parts to car service centres at affordable prices and offer delivery within three hours of placing orders” Tapas says.

SparesHub competes with traditional retails stores and other startups that sell car parts to workshops but the founders claim that the competitive pricing tech-first approach and service differentiate it from the others.





“The car maintenance industry in India has multiple problems including unavailability of parts and over-expensive parts non-standard prices of services and lack of a seamless digital customer experience. Car owners are regularly cheated in either the price of car repairs or the quality of repairs. SparesHub is working to remove these inefficiencies by using technology-focused solutions” Tapas says.





SparesHub provides genuine car parts to workshops at 20 percent lower prices than competing retail stores because it buys these parts directly from manufacturers. As of now it has a registered clientele of about 450 B2B customers across Pune Mumbai and Bengaluru.

Tapping auto expertise

In 2019 the startup launched its private label of car parts Frohlich Parts with which the company plans to leverage its existing expertise in automobile parts sourcing and share its proprietary parts catalogue to help new entrepreneurs and businessmen setup SparesHub Car Parts Stores using the franchise model.





The startup has 67 team members a current annual revenue run rate of Rs 8 crore and is cash-flow positive.





The founders started with a seed capital of Rs 17 lakh from their savings and family support.

SparesHub has raised a total of Rs 10 crore from ﻿ Indian Angel Network ﻿  Hyderabad Angels Chennai Angels and other HNIs across two rounds of investment in 2015 and 2019.

“SparesHub is working to build the next level of customer experience for car owners using a digital-first approach leveraging data and constantly raising the bar of its solutions” Tapas says.",,,,,,,,,

At a $7 billion valuation the company was briefly worth more than JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) and GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) combined. But there was one problem: Neither the company nor its merged entity HUMBL had a full-fledged operating business quite yet.

Instead the combined entity was merely an early stage startup — a dream and a series of test products put forth by its charismatic CEO and his team. Its multi-unicorn status was merely a product of its OTC share price — a number controlled by penny stock investors not by the company itself. As the firm rides a second crypto wave one thing will become apparent: The party is only getting started.

Tesoro’s rise illustrates a broader shift: Retail investors have found their way into the world of earlier-stage investing. The recent surge of SPACs initial coin offerings and OTC stocks mean that ordinary folks can now buy into companies that were once only available to angel investors and venture capitalists.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The trend won’t reverse anytime soon; big investor paydays will see to that. But as Wall Street and tech CEOs keep chipping away at accredited investor laws retail investors will find more opportunities to either make big profits or go home broke. After all removing the training wheels cuts both ways.

That means runaway stocks like Tesoro/HUMBL will happen more often. And only those who understand their anatomy can consistently profit in this wild new world of early stage investing.

TSNP Stock and HUMBL: A Marriage Made in Crypto-Land

In November HUMBL a global payments startup merged with Tesoro Enterprises in a deal worth about $10 million. Tesoro Enterprises itself was a relatively inactive company trading on over-the-counter pink sheets. Its final official SEC financial filing came in 2007 where the “value added reseller of ceramic floor and wall covering products” reported on its bankruptcy. After filing another small offering in 2010 the company went silent for over a decade.

HUMBL meanwhile was a hot startup in the payments and blockchain space. The young company founded by CEO Brian Foote was awarded the “Best North America Startup” at the 2019 World Blockchain Summit.

Why would a payments startup merge with a tile distributor? Without any apparent synergies HUMBL’s management likely did the deal so that they could access over-the-counter (OTC) capital markets – the wild west of finance.

Story continues

OTC Markets: Unimaginable Wealth and a Backwater of Bankruptcy

The Wall Street establishment tends to look down on the OTC market. With minimal reporting requirements and off-exchange dealings scam companies can often pass off as legitimate ones. It’s also where many de-listed companies go after their shares become worthless.

However the OTC market is much like visiting Grandma’s house and getting ice cream for breakfast: It offers a do-anything attitude that would make mom (i.e. the SEC) furious. Companies aren’t required to file audited financial statements making it a cheap place to do business. And OTC markets also allow companies to deal in legal grey areas. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCMKTS:GBTC) for instance trades OTC — making it the largest non-company entity on the exchange.

HUMBL Takes on OTC Markets

During ordinary times a startup like HUMBL might have ignored OTC markets altogether — raising money from angel investors and venture capital instead. It’s a well-worn path for promising young firms to access deep pockets and technological know-how. But with venture capital increasingly focused on larger later-stage deals HUMBL decided to go a riskier route.

The plan worked. After its merger in November 2020 TSNP stock rose from a penny to over 16 cents a stunning 1500% return. Much of this was from a smart investor relations campaign — the song and dance that most startups perform for their VC overlords. HUMBL did the same for penny stock investors and its early announcements created the intended result on its stock price.

But in late January things started to spiral out of control. In eight days the company announced launches in international payments e-commerce and blockchain products. Its shares immediately jumped to $1.91 an almost 20000% gain from barely two months before.

By the time the company announced the launch of its “BLOCK ETX Products” its market value of $7 billion had surpassed the two pure-play blockchain companies listed on the Nasdaq Exchange: Marathon Digital Group (NASDAQ:MARA) and Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT).

There was one problem: HUMBL was still a startup. Its products were a collection of test cases or “minimally viable products” (MVPs). VCs might have seen right through valuing HUMBL in the tens (or hundreds) of millions of dollars. But they certainly wouldn’t have paid $7 billion for the firm. (To reach that valuation the firm would have needed to look like Uber in late 2013 the year the ride-hailing firm would reportedly earn $210 million on over $1 billion of rides).

OTC investors however didn’t seem to care.

HUMBL’s Unexpected Rise

To understand how HUMBL became a $7 billion company let’s rewind to December 2020 when the company started its three-stage investor-relations push.

Act I December 2020: e-Commerce. That month HUMBL launches HUMBL Holiday Deal Days a destination for “highly curated holiday deals coupon codes and affiliate discount links in shopping verticals like electronics health beauty home fashion fitness and kids.” Investors might have initially cheered at the news. Like Grandma’s ice-cream breakfast only a killjoy could turn down “highly curated holiday deals.” But experienced VCs checking the humblpay.com site would have noted the true MVP nature of the product. Rather than deliver on the promise of “highly curated” the site instead posted links to retailers like World Market and Target as placeholders for future products.

Act II January 2021: Global Payments. HUMBL launches HUMBL Studios a “global merchant listings and web payment integrations” service. Again the “launch” is a great start for an MVP leaving room for a future payment system. A quick check on Builtwith a website that checks technology platforms and a quick call with the firm confirms that HUMBL runs Stripe as its payment processor.

Act III February 2021: Cryptocurrency. HUMBL makes its most significant announcement yet: “HUMBL Financial™ Launches BLOCK ETX Products in Over 100 Countries.” The press release sent TSNP/HUMBL stock soaring to its $7 billion market cap. And rightly so — financial firms have long tried to launch Blockchain ETFs for regular investors. The first firm to achieve that globally could become the next billion-dollar commodity ETF.

Sharp readers however would have noted that the BLOCK ETX product is still in a beta testing phase. The outcome was “not intended to be investment services or advice but rather are completely non-custodial.” In other words BLOCK ETX is a representation of an ETF not an ETF itself. (For non-crypto investors: It’s the difference between buying a $100000 sports car versus buying a $50 manual on how to build one).

The Reality Behind OTC Companies

All this might remind cynics of the Fyre Festival fiasco a luxury music festival in 2017 that ended with thousands getting stranded on an island in the Bahamas. While concert-goers were promised “a luxurious getaway on a private island of Exuma live music from top artists and partying with famous celebrities” people mostly ended up with leaking tents and Styrofoam-packed dinners. Many will fondly remember the viral photo of a cheese sandwich meant for the crew.

But VC investors and HUMBL fans would rightly disagree. HUMBL’s press releases look much like a startup pitchbook — filled with entrepreneurial dreams visions and test cases of where the products might finally fit in. But while VC investors have steeled themselves against overselling the same can’t be said of penny stock investors who sent TSNP stock to the moon.

Still More Questions

In a post-regulation world some might find this early stage investing rather exciting. TSNP stock would have made any quick-thinking penny stock investors extraordinarily rich. And virtually all VC-funded startups go through a “fake-it-til-you-make-it” cycle to raise capital and build world-beating products. It’s not clear if that’s what’s going on here. After all HUMBL’s BLOCK ETX product for instance has incredible real-world applications.

There’s also a hero element: Brian Foote. HUMBL’s CEO has probably become a billionaire thanks to his initial investment in the firm – a feat that takes most successful startup founders years not two months to achieve. (That’s of course if he bought at least 20% of the company in its penny-stock days).

But OTC investing also has costs: Those who bought at the top of the TSNP ride would have seen their wealth get torpedoed as TSNP stock sank back below $1. And Mr. Foote is under no obligation to build the products his firm has promised to bring. With virtually zero reporting requirements he could readily sell his shares and walk away from the company without anyone ever knowing. Its acquisitions of unrelated businesses might also worry investors who would rather see HUMBL build out its core crypto products.

What Can We Learn?

Audited financial statements aren’t perfect — plenty of companies stretch reality and even sometimes fake their numbers. But they’re the most objective source of truth that investors have. Since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act passed in 2002 corporate executives now face jail time for filing misleading financial statements.

Early stage investors however don’t have that luxury. Instead they’re faced with companies like HUMBL: A black box that could be the next PayPal or (very often) the next zero. Studies show the average OTC investment drops 60% every year.

So which one is it? HUMBL investors had collectively lost $4 billion since the stock peaked in early February before seeing an equally fast ride back up. But it’s only when the company re-lists on a major exchange and publishes audited statements that investors will finally find out what’s under the hood.

Until then we can all hang onto the dream that only penny stocks VC-funded companies and slot machines can provide — that magical ticket that might one day turn out to be a beautiful winner.

The survey was conducted January 22-February 5 among more than 20000 adults in 28 countries including 1000 U.S. adults. It finds that in general Americans are not optimistic that women will achieve equality with men as the country recovers from the pandemic. Fewer expect women to be more equal to men (11%) than think things will be just as they were before the pandemic (50%). The views of Americans on this matter tend to mirror public opinion in other countries.

To ensure that the post-pandemic recovery addresses the unique challenges that women face Americans and other people across the world prioritize flexible working practices such as working from home or working part-time better access to healthcare services and better mental health support services.

In the United States the pandemic economy has decimated sectors that predominantly employ women like hospitality retail and healthcare forcing women to exit the workforce at a higher rate than men. These challenges are compounded by a persistent gender wage gap that pre-existed the pandemic. According to the US Census Bureau American women make 82 cents on average for every dollar that men make.

Detailed Findings

Perceptions on addressing the gender pay gap

A plurality of Americans (49%) believe that the gender pay gap is important but that closing it should not be a top priority at the moment. Only half as many (24%) believe that it should be a top priority. Only one in ten (11%) believe that it is not an important issue.

American men and women who believe that the gender pay gap is an important issue but not one to be addressed immediately are in alignment (49% among both men and women agree on this point). However there is greater disagreement at the opposite ends of the spectrum with more women than men (27% vs. 20%) who see this issue as a top priority and more men than women who see it as insignificant (15% vs. 7%).

Compared to the rest of the world Americans are among those least inclined to view the gender pay gap as a top priority: on average across the 28 countries survey 36% say it is a top priority compared to 24% in the U.S.

Addressing the pay gap is viewed with greater urgency in all other countries except for the Netherlands and Russia.

Fewer Americans (14%) believe that media reports about the gender pay gap are “fake” than believe they are real (40%) These numbers are fairly similar to the average for all countries (18% and 41% respectively).

American men are more likely to doubt the veracity of media reports about the pay gender gap (19%) than are women (8%).

Some Americans show doubt about the pay gap in other ways with one in five (20%) saying that they believe that reports on the gender pay gap are an example of “political correctness going too far.” They are outweighed however by the 45% who say that it is a “real problem.” Again U.S. numbers are relatively close to the global average (19% and 50% respectively).

In general more Americans favor greater transparency about how much people doing the same work are paid (44%) than not (27%). However Americans are less likely to say one should have the right to know what colleagues earn than people in most other countries (the global average is 56%).

Perceptions of the kinds of roles women take on and whether their compensation is fair

Americans believe that women are most likely to hold jobs as childcare providers (such as nursery workers or nannies) nurses teachers or shop workers.

These roles are also among the top five jobs for which Americans say workers receive inadequate compensation. Teachers are most likely to be perceived as being paid to little followed by care workers nurses police officers and childcare providers.

Globally people hold similar views of which roles are mostly held by women identifying childcare providers (82%) nurses (68%) care workers (64%) shop workers/assistant (43%) and teachers (38%) as the roles most likely to be held by women. These five positions are also most likely to be perceived as inadequately compensated globally.

Perceptions on progress towards gender equality

Only about one in ten Americans (11%) believe that women will become more equal with men as the pandemic recovery occurs. Half (50%) believe things will remain the same as they were before the pandemic while 6% believe they will get worse. Just 11% of Americans believe that men and women “were already equal before the coronavirus pandemic.”

American's views on these questions mirror global public opinion. On average across all 28 countries 52% believe things will stay the same while 11% each believe that the recovery from the pandemic will result in men and women becoming more equal that it will make them even less equal and that they are equal already.

Perceptions on whether the pandemic has been better or worse for women

A majority of Americans believe that the pandemic has been equally negative for men and women (65%) when taking all the potential impacts into account such as health economic and social. However more (15%) believe that it has been worse for women than those who believe it was worse for men (6%).

Americans’ views align with those of the global public: on average 64% across the 28 countries surveyed believe the pandemic has been the same for both men and women 12% believe it has been worse for women and 10% believe that it was worse for men.

Most important issues to ensure the pandemic recovery addresses issues facing women

To ensure that the post-pandemic recovery addresses the unique challenges that women face Americans prioritize flexible working practices such as working from home or working part-time (41%) and better access to healthcare services (33%). In third Americans point to better mental health support services (30%).

The inclusion of mental health services in the top three issues among Americans represents the most significant change from global perceptions of what would best serve women during the pandemic recovery.

Globally more flexible working practices also lead the list of priorities (40%) followed by more support for women and girls facing violence and abuse (36%) and better access to healthcare services (33%).

Characteristics political leaders need to successfully address the pandemic

Among 19 different characteristics that will enable politicians to succeed at handling the pandemic recovery the three that Americans deem most important are: putting the country’s needs before politics (46%) honesty with the public (41%) and an understanding of the problems facing ordinary people (32%).

Globally the top three priorities are the same in the same order as they are in the U.S. albeit with lower percentages: on average across all countries 33% believe that politicians must be able to put their country’s needs before politics 29% believe they must be honest with the public and 28% believe they must be able to understand the problems facing their country.

About the Study

These are the results of a 28-country survey conducted by Ipsos on its Global Advisor online platform. Ipsos interviewed a total of 20520 adults aged 18-74 in the United States Canada Israel Malaysia South Africa and Turkey and 16-74 in 21 other markets between January 22 and February 5 2021.

The sample consists of approximately 1000 individuals in each of Australia Belgium Brazil Canada mainland China France Germany Great Britain Italy Japan Spain and the U.S. and 500 individuals in each of Argentina Chile Hungary Hong Kong India Israel Malaysia Mexico the Netherlands Peru Poland Russia Saudi Arabia South Africa South Korea Sweden and Turkey.

The samples in Argentina Australia Belgium Canada France Germany Great Britain Hungary Italy Japan the Netherlands Poland South Korea Spain Sweden and the U.S. can be taken as representative of their general adult population under the age of 75.

The samples in Brazil Chile mainland China India Israel Malaysia Mexico Peru Russia Saudi Arabia South Africa and Turkey are more urban more educated and/or more affluent than the general population. The survey results for these markets should be viewed as reflecting the views of the more “connected” segment of their population.

The data is weighted so that each country’s sample composition best reflects the demographic profile of the adult population according to the most recent census data.

Where results do not sum to 100 or the “difference’ appears to be +/-1 more/less than the actual this may be due to rounding multiple responses or the exclusion of “don't know” or not stated responses.

The precision of Ipsos online polls is calculated using a credibility interval with a poll of 1000 accurate to +/- 3.5 percentage points and of 500 accurate to +/- 5.0 percentage points.

Singapore (VNA) - Singapore's economy has been ranked the freest in the world this year in the Heritage Foundation's 2021 Index of Economic Freedom the second year in a row it topped the list.

The city-state scored 89.7 points with its overall score having increased by 0.3 points from 2020 primarily because of an improvement in points gained for government spending the think-tank said on March 4.

Singapore's score placed it far ahead of both the regional average for 40 countries in the Asia Pacific (60.2) and the world average (61.6).

It was followed in the rankings by New Zealand Australia Switzerland and Ireland in that order with scores ranging from 83.9 (New Zealand) to 81.4 (Ireland).

The US ranked 20th with a score of 74.8 and Germany was 29th with a score of 72.5. Thailand took the 42nd spot with a score of 69.7 and China was No. 107 with a score of 58.4.

Hong Kong which had topped the list for 25 of the last 26 years was left out of this year's Index as it has come under the direct control of Beijing the Heritage Foundation said.

After winning the average at the 2020 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo Dec. 12 at Globe Life Field in Arlington – the duo cashed in March 7 across the street at AT&T Stadium during RFD-TV’s The American.

Rogers/Bray clocked a 5.05-second time to win the four-team Shoot-out. It was the inaugural win at The American for Rogers and Bray.

“The mindset was just go catch and do the best we could on the stock they drew us” said Rogers 34. “Shoot that steer was one of the best in the herd for today and we made use of him and did what we had to do. I blocked everything out and just thought we were in the practice pen. Pretty much I hurried in there and nodded and got in there and got out of there. That was pretty much the same when we were here in (Arlington) back in December at Globe Life. It is the same atmosphere in a bigger building and it was a great feeling to be back in the spotlight like this in a big stadium and win.”

Bray 22 concurred with his partner.

“When I got the opportunity to rope with Erich (last year) I knew I just had to focus on my job and just do me” Bray said. “A guy who ropes as good as him is just going to give a young guy like me a lot of opportunities. He’s the quarterback. I’m the receiver. I’m just trying to not drop the ball and trying to catch every time. The amount of money we have won together has been absolutely outstanding. That guy is clutch.

“I’m the finisher. He sets it up. It’s the hardest thing you can do is just have to catch one for a lot of money. You get to where you think a little bit about it but he maxed the barrier out and we drew a great steer. He got on him and I went 1 2 3 and I made sure I was going to catch before I threw. He made my job easy.”

Event winners – like Rogers/Bray – earned a minimum of $100000 with $50000 counting toward the PRCA | RAM World Standings.

“Winning $100000 means a whole bunch to me” said Rogers the 2017 PRCA team roping header world champion. “It’s the greatest feeling ever and life changing for me. It also means a lot for the standings and a sigh of relief. Come August and September we don’t have to press near as hard and be sweating it.”

Rogers entered The American seventh in the world standings with $10282 and will rocket to first place with $60000-plus. Bray was fifth in the heeler charts with the same amount of money pre-American and will now be sitting atop the standings.

A year ago Rogers and Bray placed third and second in their respective world standings with $175503 each. They earned an event-best $122962 at the 2020 NFR.

At The American Rogers was riding Sandy 14 owned by Ken Bray Paden’s father. Paden was riding Slider 13.

“These are great horses” Paden said. “The ultimate goal is to get that gold buckle and get another one for Erich. Even though we have this healthy lead I’m young and dumb and I’m not going to back off.”

Other winners at AT&T Stadium were bareback rider Tilden Hooper (90.50 points on Frontier Rodeo’s Gunfire); steer wrestler Jacob Talley (3.87 seconds); saddle bronc rider Ryder Wright (91.25 points on Andrews Rodeo’s All Or Nothing) tie-down roper Shane Hanchey (7.74 seconds); breakaway roper Jill Tannner (2.65 seconds); barrel racer Hailey Kinsel (15.420 seconds) and bull rider Colten Fritzlan (90.25 points n Dakota Rodeo’s Safety Meeting).

INDIANAPOLIS Ind. – Selections for the 2020 NCAA Cross Country Championships included Arkansas men’s and women’s programs among the 31 teams named per gender on Sunday for the national championship races that will occur on Monday March 15 in Stillwater Oklahoma.

Originally scheduled for its annual date in November the NCAA Cross Country Championships were delayed due to coronavirus concerns as the season was split between fall and spring campaigns.

After the Razorbacks host the NCAA Indoor Championships this week from Thursday to Saturday on March 11-13 members of the Arkansas cross country teams will travel on Sunday for Monday races on the Oklahoma State cross country course.

Coverage of the meet will be available live on ESPNU and the ESPN app beginning at 11:30 a.m. (CT) with both championship races shown commercial free.

Without regional meets to determine qualification to the national meet a selection committee determined the 31 teams per gender along with individual qualifiers.

Arkansas women enter the meet ranked No. 1 and are the defending champions claiming its first ever national title in cross country in December of 2019. During the fall season they won four meets prior to claiming an eighth consecutive SEC title.

In the women’s field the Razorbacks are joined by Alabama and Mississippi from the SEC while no other program from the South Central region was chosen.

The top 10 women’s teams in recent national rankings include: 1. Arkansas 2. Brigham Young 3. New Mexico 4. Stanford 5. NC State 6. Colorado 7. Michigan State 8. Michigan 9. Northern Arizona 10. Boise State.

The Razorback men are ranked No. 3 after winning the SEC title in October following three meet victories. Arkansas is the lone team from the South Central region in the men’s field while Mississippi is the only other team from the SEC selected.

The top 10 men’s teams in recent national rankings include: 1. Brigham Young 2. Northern Arizona 3. Arkansas 4. Stanford 5. Tulsa 6. Oklahoma State 7. Iowa State 8. Colorado 9. Notre Dame and 10. Washington.

This is the ninth consecutive year for the Razorback men to qualify as a team for the NCAA Cross Country field which is the sixth longest active streak in the NCAA. It will be the 50th NCAA cross country competition as a team for the Arkansas men with 1957 marking its first appearance as a team.

For the Arkansas women this marks the 10th consecutive year to qualify as a team for the national championship field. It will be the Razorbacks 33rd team appearance since its initial meet in 1982.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvcmFuZ2Vycy8yMDIxLzAzLzA4L2RhbmUtZHVubmluZy1reWxlLWNvZHktaW1wcmVzc2luZy1jaHJpcy13b29kd2FyZC1pbi1iYXR0bGUtZm9yLXNwb3QtaW4tcmFuZ2Vycy1yb3RhdGlvbi_SAZwBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL3JhbmdlcnMvMjAyMS8wMy8wOC9kYW5lLWR1bm5pbmcta3lsZS1jb2R5LWltcHJlc3NpbmctY2hyaXMtd29vZHdhcmQtaW4tYmF0dGxlLWZvci1zcG90LWluLXJhbmdlcnMtcm90YXRpb24vP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dane Dunning Kyle Cody impressing Chris Woodward in battle for spot in Rangers’ rotation,"SURPRISE Ariz. — It was almost as if the Rangers set up head-to-head-to-head competition.

Three unproven starting pitchers likely vying for one spot in the rotation followed one another into Sunday’s game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Give the early edge to Dane Dunning.

“I liked the way [Dunning] competed” manager Chris Woodward said. “He didn’t get ahead of a ton of guys because his alignment was a little off and he felt like he was yanking everything. But when he needed to make a pitch he trusted his sinker and was able to get out of the inning. That says a lot for his first time. Both he and [Cody] are excited but those are good learning moments for young pitchers. Sometimes you’re going to have to get through innings not having your best stuff.”

Cody allowed four hits and a walk to account for two runs in his two innings of work one of which was stopped early because he’d reached his pitch count for the inning. Cody got ahead of only one of the eight hitters he faced. Woodward said Cody struggled to keep his delivery in line also.

“I think we like to think he’s got ice in his veins which I think he does at times” Woodward said. “But it was honestly good for him to have to kind of grind it out and see how he responds. I’m not worried about him. I think he’ll make the adjustment. I know he will get back down in the strike zone.”

Not the heat; the humidity: The Rangers are planning to install a humidor for baseball storage at Globe Life Field club officials confirmed Sunday. It is unclear however if the humidor will be approved for use by MLB for the 2021 season.

According to The Associated Press citing an MLB memo five teams were planning to install humidors for this season as part of an effort to make the flight of balls more consistent. A baseball with a too-dry center can fly farther particularly at altitude. Five teams — the Colorado Rockies Arizona Diamondbacks New York Mets Boston Red Sox and Seattle Mariners — had previously installed the moisture-controlling units.

The memo outlined MLB’s efforts to slightly deaden the baseball after a multiyear home run surge. According to the story the balls are expected to fly 1-2 feet less when hit about 375 feet. In its first season Globe Life Field played truly neutral according to the park factors formula used by Fangraphs.

Briefly: SS Isiah Kiner-Falefa lined a ball that either fooled or carried past Los Angeles’ Mookie Betts considered the best defensive outfielder in the game for a double to right. Kiner has reached six times in 13 plate appearances this spring. … Though there is no minor league camp in session the Rangers optioned RHPs Joe Gatto and Tyler Phillips to the Triple-A roster. They will remain in the major league camp but Woodward said the move would allow the pitchers to “put their minds at ease and focus on getting better.” … Though Gatto 25 had never pitched above Double-A in his six seasons in the Los Angeles Angels organization the Rangers signed him to a major league contract as a free agent. … RHP Kohei Arihara will make his second appearance on Monday against the Chicago Cubs. Arihara did not complete either of the two innings he started against the Chicago White Sox last week. … The Rangers-Cubs game on Monday will be a seven-inning game.

As economies prepare to reopen following the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations major companies are starting to reconsider their approach to office working will once the pandemic recedes.

Although it is likely to be some time before social and economic activity resumes to pre-pandemic levels the mass rollout of vaccinations in some countries has introduced companies to the possibility of reopening their offices — an attractive model for some employers.

Although the remote-work model has gained significant traction throughout the pandemic it is clear that big organisations do not unanimously embrace it. However in a recent survey conducted by Growmotely 61% of respondents said they prefer a fully remote environment.

Companies including Spotify Twitter and Goldman Sachs are taking different approaches to their future workforce arrangements. Some are embracing an all-remote workforce while others are encouraging employees to return to their office desks.

Here's what some of the top employers have said

Spotify

Earlier this month Spotify announced its transition to a permanent flexible-work model with its Work From Anywhere policy. The new occupational strategy lets its 6550 global employees choose how they want to work at the company — in an office remotely or at a coworking space that the company will pay a subscription for as Insider previously reported.

Employees will be given more choice over the town city or country they want to work from.

""This is an opportunity to scrap the idea that big cities are the only places where meaningful work can happen because we know firsthand that isn't true"" Travis Robinson the head of diversity inclusion and belonging at Spotify told Insider previously.

The company's CEO Jack Dorsey sent an email to his employees informing staff they can work from home ""forever"" if they so wish The Washington Post reported. The firm made its announcement in May last year.

According to the report Twitter's shift to a permanent remote work policy was a two-year project accelerated by the pandemic amid lockdowns.

In 2018 Dorsey sent an email to his employees encouraging them to work from home after experiencing a lift in productivity by doing so himself.

""We've already been on this path and the crisis just catapulted us into a future state"" said Jennifer Christie Twitter's chief HR officer in a blog post as reported by The Washington Post.

Salesforce

The software and cloud computing company adopted similar work-from-home policies after recently unveiling its Work From Anywhere plans. The new guidelines offer employees three options for how they'll work going forward: flex fully remote and office-based. The flex option will allow workers to come into the office up to three times a week for tasks that cannot be conducted virtually.

Not everyone is welcoming the remote work model with open arms. Speaking at the recent Credit Suisse Group AG conference the CEO of the investment bank David Solomon rejected the work from home policy stating that it ""is not ideal for us and it's not a new normal"" CNBC reported.

He said the remote-work culture is an ""aberration"" that needs to be corrected ""as quickly as possible.""

Solomon said the nature of business within the financial sector clashes with the work-from-home model. ""I do think for a business like ours which is an innovative collaborative apprenticeship culture this is not ideal for us.""

Solomon is not alone in his views. Back in mid-October Jamie Dimon the chief executive officer of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co was very vocal about what he viewed as the implausibility of remote working.

""How do you build a culture and character? How are you going to learn properly?"" he said similarly referring to junior workers as Solomon did per Financial News London.

According to Dimon ""a lot of work takes place not at the meeting but before or after the meeting when people share ideas.""

As for the streaming company co-chief executive Reed Hastings told The Wall Street Journal last year that he doesn't see any positives in a remote working environment. ""Not being able to get together in person particularly internationally is a pure negative.""

For big tech including the likes of Facebook Apple and Amazon future workforce arrangements look flexible. All three companies extended remote work policies until at least summer.

So what does the future of work look like?

Prithwiraj (Raj) Choudhury a professor at the Harvard Business School and remote work expert highlighted the key benefits of working away from the office in an interview with Insider.

He said: ""For individuals the benefit of remote work is that it offers flexibility. Individuals can save on time and live in their preferred location under different remote work models. Remote work also creates a lot of value for companies. As an example when companies allow workers to work-from-anywhere talent can be hired globally even at locations where the company doesn't have an office.""

Choudhury respectfully disagreed with Soloman's views on remote working. ""Remote work has been around for a long time and organizations such as the US Patent Office and Dell have successfully embraced remote work much before the pandemic"" he said.

He added: ""One of the models I really like is the TCS 25-25 hybrid remote work model which I have studied in detail.""

In this model all employees spend 25% of their time in the office and the entire team comes in on those ""in-office"" days. ""The other model I like is 'remote-first' where employees act as remote workers even on days that they are in the office"" Choudhury said.

John H. Krystal M.D. chief of psychiatry at Yale-New Haven Hospital discussed with Insider the drawbacks of working from home and implications for public mental health. ""The principal challenges associated with remote work are social isolation poorer communication and paradoxically reduced efficiency"" he said.

According to Krystal virtual work meetings leave little time for ""schmoozing"" — the informal social interactions that build connection and trust.

The resulting work relationships lead to weaker connections between people leaving ""more room for provocative social interactions that can further erode work relationships"" he added.

(NYSE:GS) Shares?,"Every investor in The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. We also tend to see lower insider ownership in companies that were previously publicly owned.

Goldman Sachs Group has a market capitalization of US$119b so it's too big to fly under the radar. We'd expect to see both institutions and retail investors owning a portion of the company. Our analysis of the ownership of the company below shows that institutional investors have bought into the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups to learn more about Goldman Sachs Group.

View our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goldman Sachs Group?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

As you can see institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Goldman Sachs Group. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Goldman Sachs Group's historic earnings and revenue below but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Goldman Sachs Group. The Vanguard Group Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 7.1% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile the second and third largest shareholders hold 5.8% and 5.5% of the shares outstanding respectively.

A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting too.

Insider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs Group

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.. As it is a large company we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$496m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

General Public Ownership

With a 31% ownership the general public have some degree of sway over Goldman Sachs Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Goldman Sachs Group better we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

What is your take on the Tennessee bill that would grant fathers veto power over abortions?

Two Tennessee lawmakers introduced legislation that would allow a father to deny an abortion without the pregnant woman's consent.

The bill SB494/HB1079 sponsored by Sen. Mark Pody R-Lebanon and Rep. Jerry Sexton R-Bean Station would give the man who impregnates a woman the ability to veto an abortion procedure by petitioning a court for an injunction. Pody said he introduced his bill after a Tennessee resident expressed concerns that fathers do not have a say over abortion under the current law. He said his bill would assure a father's right to make a decision about an unborn child. Under the bill a judge would be able to grant the petition as long as the petitioner proves he's the biological father of an unborn child and there is a ""reasonable possibility"" the woman would seek an abortion.

For unmarried couples the father would have to voluntarily establish his paternity but can do so without the woman's consent. Once paternity is established the father would have the ability to deny an abortion. The bill makes no exception for rape or incest.

Garrett Dickerson

“I would imagine this type of legislation has been difficult to address in the past. Pro-life supporters could be hesitant to be a voice for protecting the rights of fathers because in doing so it appears to validate the right to abort life. I am pro-life.

""In a pregnancy I believe the child has the right to be born. It’s an intriguing and promising measure our elected officials are pursuing this type of legislative action. While it falls short of protecting the rights of all lives involved in a pregnancy it certainly provides a layer of protecting all life and acknowledging the rights of all lives involved in a pregnancy.”

Catherine Brundage

“The very idea that this is even being considered would be absurd were it not for the fact that it points to archaic misogynistic beliefs being held by those who have been entrusted with the power to create and pass legislation.

""No matter the circumstance of the pregnancy the decision to carry on with or terminate a pregnancy should be that of the woman. To think a rapist could demand that a woman he violated must carry his child to term Is unconscionable. To think that the same would be true of a victim of incest is beyond the pale. This smacks of an attempt to turn back the clock on hard-won women's rights under the guise of saving unborn lives.”

Lynne Halliburton

“I do not believe any man has the right to tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her body. I do feel like a man has a say if it has been established that he is indeed the father and he is willing to be responsible for and/or take on raising the child.

""If the woman can be penalized at the court’s discretion for violating the injunction the man should also be penalized if he agrees to be responsible and does not follow through. I have serious concerns about this bill. Especially due to the fact that the bill makes no exception for rape or incest.""

Hannah Price

“I don’t believe any human should have the right to end innocent life. However I have concerns about this bill. Giving a father the ability to veto an abortion sets the precedent that a father’s involvement is optional. Only if they want the child they should have the right to keep it. So what happens if they don’t want the child and the mom does? Should the father then have the right to force an abortion? Or exclude himself from fatherly duties based on his desire or lack of to be a father?

""The desirability of a child should never determine whether he/she lives or dies but I think allowing a father to veto an abortion is the wrong way to solve the problem.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The New Hartford junior guard’s latest milestone — surpassing 2000 career points in the team’s 77-60 win over Notre Dame on Friday — moves her into some top company in Section III.

“Just being up there with (former Notre Dame standout) Emily Durr and other legends like that is a great honor” said Henderson a top recruit in the country in the Class of 2022. “(Reaching 2000 points) feels amazing. All the support I get from my teammates is amazing. It is good to be on that board with all legends.”

Henderson who is quick and has a smooth shot is now 10th on the total points list among Section III players. It is notable that Henderson reached the milestone in Notre Dame’s gym where Durr scored many of her Section III record 2445 points while playing from 2009 to 2014.

After Henderson tip-toed down the sideline made a move to create some space and converted on a layup with her left hand late in the first quarter Friday to put her over the mark the game was halted and her achievement was acknowledged with pictures with teammates and longtime coach Mike Callan. She finished with a team-best 27 points in game.

“I was a little nervous going into the game knowing that I was going to score my 2000th point” said Henderson ranked as the No. 46 prospect in the class of 2022 nationally by Blue Star Basketball Report. “Since it is over I feel a lot less pressure.""

Henderson would have cruised past 2000 points more quickly if the season had not been delayed and shortened because of the coronavirus. With two games remaining this season Henderson needs just over 400 points to match Durr’s mark. Should Henderson stay healthy she should be able to reach it next season.

While she had set the goal of reaching 2000 points as a sixth-grader she thought reaching the mark would be much more likely as a senior. She recently came across the file where she had written the goal.

“If you would have told me in sixth grade I was going to be scoring 2000-plus points (as a junior) I would have been like ‘are you crazy? What even is 2000 points in high school basketball’” she said.

Henderson is hoping for a more normal senior season and helping New Hartford have success.

“I’m more focused on winning and hopefully we get sectionals next year” Henderson said. “I feel like there’s always room to get better. That’s what I’m working toward.”

Durr who went on to star at Iowa State and is now a coach at Mohawk Valley Community College said in a tweet she’s “definitely a fan” of Henderson's play.

“Records are made to be broken can't wait for Kaia to shatter mine!” Durr tweeted.

Henderson became New Hartford’s leading scorer in 2019 and she holds at least 12 other school records according to Callan. She’s the best player he’s coached at her position he said.

“She’s a special player and a special kid” Callan said. “If anybody outworks her I would like to see it. Spring summer fall winter. She works as hard as anybody I’ve seen. Physically mentally she’s just so strong that you don’t realize until you see her play a lot.”

Henderson continues to be recruited by many schools to play at the next level. She said she’s up to about 15 offers from Division I schools including Syracuse Colgate and St. Bonaventure. She doesn’t have a timeline for her decision.

The rematch or redux arrived 359 days later.

""Waited a long time for this game waited a year"" Hartford coach John Gallagher said.

Saturday Gallagher's Hawks showed what they had planned on pulling off in 2020 — a tourney shocker.

Behind a scorching shooting performance from the backcourt duo of Traci Carter and Austin Williams fourth-seeded Hartford left Patrick Gym with a 71-65 victory ending No. 2 Vermont's conference final reign.

Vermont (10-5) which had reached the title round five years running and earned the league's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament three times since 2017 appeared out of sorts and uninspired following its two-week bye into the semis.

""I thought in the first half we looked like we hadn’t played in a while. But that’s not an excuse"" UVM coach John Becker said. ""We had plenty of opportunities plenty of good looks — we just didn’t make enough shots.

""Hartford played great — they were the better team … today.""

The Hawks (14-8) will host No. 6 UMass Lowell which upset No. 1 UMBC in the other semifinal for the league crown on March 13. The winner will earn its first NCAA tourney berth.

""For our program we are 40 minutes away"" Gallagher said.

But for Vermont Saturday's 40 minutes were largely ones to forget.

The Catamounts trailed by as many as 11 points in the second half. They went just 5 of 18 on 3-pointers including star Stef Smith's 1-for-8 effort from deep. Their shooting regressed as the game wore on — 13 of 26 in the opening 20 minutes to 13 of 32 effort in the second stanza.

""We just didn’t make shots. I thought we had good looks. We looked tentative"" Becker said.

Meanwhile Hartford — and more appropriately Carter and Williams — couldn't miss. The Hartford tandem combined to make 17 of 23 field goals and eight triples with Williams' 25 points nearly matched by Carter's 23.

The visiting Hawks finished with a 62.8% clip (27 of 43) from the floor a mark bolstered by 13-for-19 shooting out of the break.

""Right off the bat in the second half they executed what they wanted to do and we clearly weren’t able to execute our defense and we had a bunch of breakdowns"" said UVM senior guard Ben Shungu adding his team didn't show enough fight. ""A lot of times when you don’t play well it carries over. We didn’t show enough of that (fight).""

Becker: ""The defense was horrible.""

Only after Hunter Marks (nine points) drained a corner 3-pointer to beat the shot clock for a 53-42 Hartford lead with 11:18 go did the Catamounts begin to play with a desperation in hopes of saving their season.

UVM's best offense was its transition game — Hartford's 16 turnovers accounted for 20 points for the hosts — and the play of Shungu (14 points six assists).

Shungu rattled in a corner 3-pointer and then turned on the jets after collecting a loose ball to find Smith (11 points) for a fast-break layup. After another Shungu basket and a Justin Mazzulla putback UVM climbed to within 54-51 before the 8-minute media timeout.

After Williams made 1 of 2 at the foul line UVM's Ryan Davis (16 points four rebounds) the conference's player of the year and Hartford's Thomas Webley matched buckets on strong takes inside to make it 57-53 Hartford with 6:51 to go.

Then in less than a minute Hartford regained control: PJ Henry and Carter banged in 3s while Smith and Patella each missed from deep to stretch the margin back to double digits.

Vermont though summoned one more run. A Shungu-to-Davis feed inside capped a 10-2 spurt trimming UVM's deficit to 65-63 with 1:39 to play.

While Hartford's Marks couldn't handle an entry feed on the next possession UVM couldn't get the tying bucket to fall — Shungu's short jumper hit back iron.

""We had a lot rim out"" Becker said.

Then Hartford's stars on Saturday closed it out. Williams avoided a shot clock violation with a floater in the lane and after Isaiah Powell banked a jumper Carter drained a pair of foul shots with under 10 seconds to play for a 69-65 margin.

""The first thing you have to understand about coming up to Vermont is the job that John Becker does. He’s a high-major coach and he‘ll probably get a high-major job this year"" Gallagher said. ""For us to beat Vermont in this type of setting it’s very different I tip my hat to Vermont.

""We have a togetherness right now that is really great.""

In a season delayed by the pandemic and then interrupted multiple times for team pauses related to COVID Vermont only played 15 games and just five over the last 47 days. Yet Saturday's loss like any that ends a season was still hard to stomach.

""Our seniors have played in the championship game every year they have been here. It’s certainly not the way we wanted to end"" Becker said. ""But Hartford was better today and they beat us and they deserve to move on.""

If Shungu returns for another year — the NCAA has granted a free year of eligibility for all athletes — the former Rice Memorial High School star will use the semifinal defeat as an education.

""A lot of times when you win you know it’s great. And sometimes you lose it’s just a learning experience"" Shungu said. ""I think for me the wins going to the NCAA and also the losses too — it’s a learning opportunity.

""We will just take it in look at what we did wrong and we’ll get better.""

Nick Roman for 8½ years retired from service in early January and was honored with a proclamation at the Town Council’s Public Safety Committee Meeting Wednesday night.

By Ronni Newton

Off. Nick Roman said the best partner he could have imagined has ended his career with the West Hartford Police Department on a high note.

Axel a 10½-year-old black and tan German Shepherd who was born in the Czech Republic was retired from service on Jan. 8 2021 after serving as Roman’s partner for 8½ years – transitioning from a hard-working member of the West Hartford Police Department to the full-time pet of Roman’s family where he is living a life full of treats playtime with his doggie sibling in the backyard and lots of belly rubs.

“We had a really good year last year” Roman said. “He’s phenomenal. He found a ton of people.”

K-9 Axel Roman said definitely ended his career on top.

The two have been partners since 2012. Roman had not been a K-9 officer prior to receiving Axel. The two attended a nine-week Patrol and Narcotics K-9 Academy that year and have had a synergy ever since.

“I could not have asked for a better partner at work – or at home” Roman said. Although Axel is still fit he has reached the age where a K-9 typically retires. At that point the arrangement is that the dog becomes the pet of the handler.

Throughout his career Axel never had a problem transitioning between work time and home time Roman said. At home he’s always been a big baby rolling over on his back for belly rubs.

“You’d put on that leash and it’s like a light switch” Roman said. “I didn’t even need to tell him to do his job.”

While Axel gets plenty of attention at home and loves to play with Roman’s children ages 7 and 8 and their other dog he does seem to miss his job. “He is. my family buddy. He literally is my shadow” Roman said.

Now when Roman leaves for work “he sits and stares out the window.”

Mayor Shari Cantor in the proclamation she read aloud March 3 issued on behalf of the Town Council and the residents of West Hartford praised the partnership between Roman and Axel. “[T]he effective dynamic between them has led to the apprehension of felons wanted for firearms related offenses discovery of crucial pieces of evidence which contributed to the seizure of substantial amounts of cash and narcotics as well as the apprehension of numerous suspects actively burglarizing vehicles during the overnight hours in West Hartford.”

Roman will begin his 20th year with the West Hartford Police Department in July and plans to retire in 2022 so he won’t be getting another K-9 partner. Instead he said he will be back with the regular Patrol Division.

“It’s been a real busy 8½ years and I couldn’t be happier with a partner than Axel” Roman said during the March 3 virtual Public Safety Committee meeting. He said there were “countless calls where he has kept me safe and times I’ll never even know about. … He’s been an amazing dog. … He’s served the police department well and I couldn’t have asked for a better partner.”

Chief Vernon Riddick said you can’t pay the K-9 officers enough for the amount of time and resources they put into caring for and training their partners. “They spend time and resources and these partners become part of their family. It’s 24/7” he said.

West Hartford still has two K-9 teams – Off. Brian Delgrande and Lotti and Off. Andrew Teeter and Islay – who became partners in 2019.

Riddick said he is hopeful the department can continue the K-9 program. “Individuals who take these assignments with the K-9s they’re special. They really care” he said.

Sgt. Thomas Lazure who heads the West Hartford Police Department’s K-9 unit noted that through Axel’s storied career he helped arrest countless criminals and seize guns and narcotics. K-9 teams are regional resources that provide mutual aid to other departments and the list below are just some of the highlights of Axel’s work in West Hartford and elsewhere:

In 2013 one of Axel’s first apprehensions was in the Town of Simsbury where a suspect displayed a firearm and fled. Axel located said individual in a tree where he was taken into custody.

Also in 2013 there was a shots fired incident in West Hartford where a suspect fled the scene with a gun in his hand. The suspect tried carjacking someone at a nearby business but fled the area. K-9 Axel was deployed and it was discovered that the suspect broke into 3 different homes and ended up stashing the gun. K-9 Axel ended up locating the suspect inside one of the homes where he was taken into custody.

K-9 Axel assisted West Hartford officers in a drug search of a vehicle where the suspect would not consent. Axel immediately alerted to the odor of narcotics on the vehicle which was searched and heroin was recovered. Further investigation revealed a drug house in town that was subsequently taken down. Over $13000 dollars in narcotics and $10000 dollars in cash was seized.

In 2017 using just a small piece of clothing K-9 Axel located a shoplifting suspect who fled from officers.

Most recently in July of 2020 K-9 Axel was dispatched to a local business in West Hartford for a possible burglary. K-9 Axel was deployed inside and located the suspect who tried fleeing from Axel. K-9 Axel took the suspect into custody as he was trying to escape from the business by climbing up into the ceiling.

K-9 Axel has located multiple car burglars over the months including some who fled from stolen vehicles. K-9 Axel went through a few week period where West Hartford residents were getting their vehicles burglarized and stolen on a nightly basis. Throughout that few week period over 11 suspects were taken into custody as a result of K-9 Axel either locating the suspects or flushing them out to perimeter units during a track.

K-9 Axel’s last notable moment was this past November where he was dispatched to an address in West Hartford for a man who was wanted on numerous domestic violence charges. The suspect was also wanted for violation of a protective order and it was believed he may be hiding inside of the victim’s home. K-9 Axel was deployed and indicated that a suspect was inside of the attic. The lights to the attic were intentionally disabled but none the less K-9 Axel went inside. Hiding inside of the attic was the suspect who began fighting with Axel and was immediately taken into custody.

K-9 Axel was also involved in multiple multi-town search and seizure warrants executed by the DEA FBI and local narcotics Detectives. Suspects were arrested and narcotics/cash were seized.

Lazure said there were countless other calls in West Hartford and throughout the region where Axel served the public and protected Roman. The two have always had an incredible bond he said.

For The Bulletin

Lydia Huntley Sigourney was America’s first best-selling poet and the first woman in American history to make a living by her pen. Born in Norwich in 1791 she lived here until leaving for Hartford in 1814 where she published her poems thus earning the title “The Sweet Singer of Hartford.” Until her death in 1865 she held great affection for her birthplace contributing a poem to be read at Norwich’s 200th anniversary celebration in 1859.

Lydia Huntley was the daughter of the gardener for the Lathrop estate; Madame Lathrop the widow of Dr. Daniel Lathrop took great interest in this brilliant young girl and saw to it that she was educated as well as any boy first at the East District School on Upper Washington Street across from her home and then at the brick schoolhouse on the Green endowed by Dr. Lathrop now the Norwich Heritage and Regional Visitors’ Center. Lydia also educated herself by reading in the Lathrops’s library finding textbooks there with the name of an earlier pupil in that home Benedict Arnold.

She and a friend Nancy Maria Hyde opened a school for girls at the Capt. Zebulon Burnham House on Broadway at Little Plain (a plaque tells this story). In its second year the school moved to Jail Hill. Their curriculum included advanced mathematics and science rather than the domestic arts a radical move which cost them pupils. The teachers had to walk from Norwichtown causing many absences for snow days. Miss Hyde’s early death ended the school but Lydia continued teaching Sunday School including the first-ever class for the African American children of the Second Congregational Church.

In Hartford with underwriting from Madame Lathrop’s friend Daniel Wadsworth founder of the Wadsworth Atheneum her teaching methods were more willingly accepted. One of her best-loved pupils Alice Cogswell was Deaf but so eager to learn that Lydia devised a manual alphabet and taught Alice to read and write. Alice’s father Dr. Mason Cogswell traveled to France to learn the principles of sign language from Thomas Gallaudet; they returned to Hartford to create the American School for the Deaf.

In 1819 Lydia married a wealthy land developer Charles Sigourney for whom the street is named. He lost much of that money in speculation and Mrs. Sigourney’s writing became their primary source of income.

Sigourney was an international literary celebrity publishing over 30 books of poetry and prose. She traveled to England where she was received by a young Queen Victoria and met great writers of the day including her idol the poet William Wordsworth. Her literary reputation however did not survive her death: reviewers called her writing “sentimental” and “old-fashioned” and her books went out of print. Today they are available on Google Books.

Throughout her life Sigourney was a pioneer in educating the underserved: girls African Americans Native Americans the Deaf and the incarcerated. In addition to teaching she raised money for to found schools for these groups.

We live in a country where people are concerned by the gender of a toy potato. Let that sink in for a minute.

Hasbro has decided to stop marketing Mr. Potato Head as “Mr.” and now it’s going to be just “Potato Head”. But they’ll still be a Mr. and a Mrs. Potato Head just not on the packaging. I think. Hasbro kinda backtracked after it’s original announcement so I’m not altogether sure what’s going on but the country was talking about the gender of a plastic potato last week. I’m so glad we have nothing greater to worry about.

Wait we do. We’re going to ban a bunch of Dr. Seuss books. The company that manages Dr. Seuss books is pulling six of them because they allegedly contain racist images of Asians and Africans. So does that mean Dr. Seuss AKA Theodor Seuss Geisel was racist? If so why just ban the ones that demonstrate his racism? Aren’t we supposed to cancel him completely?

Disney who owns “The Muppet Show” has added a disclaimer to a bunch of episodes “This program includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures. These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now.” OK so pull them altogether if they are racist or sexist or something. Why air them at all? It’s been a long time since I’ve watched “The Muppet Show” but the most famous relationship in it is mixed-species between a pig and a frog so it seems pretty open and inclusive to me. PS. They are puppets.

I’m not a fan of clichés and I generally do not use or invoke popular-at-the-moment buzz terms but there is a “cancel culture” and I can’t keep up with the rules for it. I’m starting to think people with seven figure salaries just sit around board tables coming up with ways to appease the “woke” people without recognizing no one had a problem with any of this until they found the solution to problem that didn’t exist. If they feel the need to demonstrate they care perhaps just donate a chunk of their bloated salaries to the underprivileged and leave the rest of us out of it particularly our kids.

San Francisco is renaming 42 schools because the namesakes are associated with “slaveholding colonization or oppression”. Good ole’ Abe Lincoln is on the chopping block. Serious bro Abe Lincoln? (Am I allowed to say “bro” anymore? Well the incredibly woke “Hasbro” stands for Hassenfeld Brothers so I guess “bro” is still acceptable.) So seriously Abe Lincoln? He quite literally ended slavery in this country. According to the LA Times however a member of the board recommending the renaming said Lincoln “is not seen as much of a hero” by Native Americans. Well I’m twice as Native American as Elizabeth Warren originally claimed to be and I don’t see that board member “as much of a hero” either please cancel him or her from participating in this nonsense. California Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein is on the chopping block too the elementary school named after her will be renamed because of something she did as Mayor of the city 40 years ago. But I’m willing to bet the same people who voted to kick her name to the curb will vote for her again for US Senate in 2024 when her seat is up. She’ll be 91 years old at that time. Is it ageist of me to point that out?

Seriously you people have way too much time on your hands. States are struggling with vaccine distribution and Americans are still dying from the virus. We recently bombed Syria that’s a big deal and who knows what comes next. The economy is still in the toilet and small businesses are drowning in pandemic fallout. You care about the sex of a potato a nearly 100-year-old cartoon book the inclusivity of puppets and that America’s most influential “racial justice” president did something not nice like 150 years ago? Where do you find the time?

I lost power during the wind storm last week. 24 hours of no news. It was splendid and I had no opportunity to be annoyed by the nonsense that is sweeping across our nation our society and our culture. I think perhaps if we tune out the silliness those doing the silly stuff will stop doing it if we stop giving them any praise or attention for it. After all none of this achieves anything but making these decision-makers feel good about themselves. To be as socially impacting as they are I’m going to go play with a potato.

Here's the difference,"On Tuesday the estate of Dr Seuss decided that it will cease publishing six books by the beloved children’s author which contain offensive depictions of non-white characters. A week earlier Hasbro the manufacturer of Mr Potato Head announced that the toy will henceforth be known by the non-gendered moniker Potato Head.

An army of defenders has now risen to protect the sanctity of Mr Potato Head and Dr Seuss. Social media and conservative news outlets have been consumed with memes and hot takes declaring the dangerous overreach of “cancel culture” which they define as the process of punishing a person or product deemed offensive by some vague set of modern moral standards.

Fox News dedicated much of Tuesday to proclaiming the end of Dr Seuss at the hands of liberals. One Fox News Host Brian Kilmeade exclaimed “The cancel culture is canceling Dr Seuss … It’s out of control.” During a congressional debate the Republican California congressman Kevin McCarthy somehow worked the Seuss controversy into an argument against a bill that would expand voting rights saying “First they outlaw Dr Seuss and then they want to tell us what to say.” Congressman Matt Gaetz a Republican from Florida lambasted the rebranding of Mr Potato Head during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) blatting “Look out Mr Potato Head you’re next … I’m sorry I think now he’s going by Potato X. He can’t be Mr Potato.”

As is usual with outrage over cancel culture the discussion is devoid of facts and aimed at a phantom leftwing mob that mainly exists in conservatives’ minds. Dr Seuss and Mr Potato Head are not being cancelled they were never going to be and if anything the exact opposite is happening. Real cancel culture has existed throughout the history of the United States and much of what we are witnessing today is meaningless and inconsequential by comparison.

First and foremost neither Dr Seuss nor Mr Potato Head are being cancelled. Dr Seuss’s estate decided to voluntarily stop producing six of his books. These books contain racist imagery that Dr Seuss (real name Theodor Seuss Geisel) may too have been ashamed of. During the second world war Seuss published anti-Japanese cartoons and vocally supported the establishment of concentration camps for Japanese-Americans. Years later he sought to apologize for his actions and wrote the book Horton Hears a Who! to reflect his changed views. The books that will cease publication are nowhere near his most popular works and it is doubtful most Americans have even heard of them. Those books will not be burned; they were not forced to be removed by a horde of liberals; and the rest of his catalogue will remain untouched.

The tale of our favorite spud is much the same. Mr Potato Head is not ceasing to exist nor is his wife and assumed lover Mrs Potato Head. Hasbro the owners of the Potato Head family line of toys is simply changing the brand’s name to Potato Head which reflects the reality that it covers the Mr the Mrs and a growing family of potatoes that they seek to sprout in the near future.



And quite the opposite of cancellation is on the horizon. Dr Seuss books are seeing a boost in overall sales and the books pulled from the shelves are selling for up to $500 online. Hasbro is expecting a similar bump to sales. Its CEO has said he expects double-digit growth in the next year and the rebranding and expansion of the Potato Head line may be a part of the equation. Whether or not these were calculated marketing strategies is unknowable but they fall into a well-established pattern in which corporations try to clean up their pasts and appeal to the public in a way that won’t negatively affect their ability to reap profits.

Real cancel culture has existed in the United States and it is worth remembering what it means to be truly cancelled

What we perceive as “cancel culture” is just a fundamental function of capitalism playing itself out. Companies must adapt with the times to make money on a perpetual track of constant and infinite profit. This is why businesses engage in practices like greenwashing – packaging their goods and services in superficially environmentally friendly ways while doing little to change their real environmental impact – and pinkwashing the annual tradition of turning products pink for breast cancer awareness even for products that may cause cancer themselves. These corporations don’t have morals and don’t care about taking political or ethical stances; their bottom line is just that – their bottom line. This is how an oil company like Chevron can pat itself on the back for investing $100m in lowering emissions while simultaneously investing $20bn in oil and gas or how Baker Hughes one of the world’s largest oilfield operators can proudly distribute 1000 pink drill bits across the planet while using known and possible carcinogens at their hydraulic fracking facilities.



Real cancel culture has existed in the United States and it is worth remembering what it means to be truly cancelled. The multiple red scares in the United States involved socialist – and allegedly socialist – actors directors and musicians being spied on and blacklisted by production companies and studios for their political views. People as famous as Charlie Chaplin were accused of subversion and banned from the US while everyday Americans like the Massachusetts schoolteacher Anne Hale had their lives completely and utterly ruined. This wave of “cancellation” involved institutions like the NAACP and America’s largest labor federation the AFL-CIO pushing out communist and socialist activists. And government programs like Cointelpro – arguably an extension of the red scare – involved the harassment and sabotage of socialists and other leftwing activists including the notorious assassination of the 21-year-old Black Panther leader Fred Hampton. Million-dollar corporations in the United States can hardly be cancelled; they can simply rebrand or wait until the storm is over. Real cancel culture has the power of institutions behind it.

In an era in which corporations like Amazon are on one hand launching smear campaigns against Black workers for labor organizing while celebrating Black History Month on the other it is important for the public to understand the difference between cancel culture and corporate PR. We can cancel corporations only through actions like boycotts strikes and seizures of their property for the sake of the public good. But no one is cancelling Dr Seuss and no one is cancelling Mr Potato Head despite Hasbro’s history of allegedly profiting from child labor and other abuses. Instead of focusing on the outrage of the week we need to focus on toxic employers who mistreat workers here and abroad and consider using collective action to punish industries and corporations that have essentially cancelled the futures of entire generations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbHlsZXNtb3ZpZWZpbGVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzA2L21hcnZlbC1sZWdlbmRzLWhvdXNlLW9mLXgtbWFnbmV0by1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marvel Legends House of X Magneto figure review — Lyles Movie Files,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://lylesmoviefiles.com/2021/03/06/marvel-legends-house-of-x-magneto-review/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbHlsZXNtb3ZpZWZpbGVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzA2L21hcnZlbC1sZWdlbmRzLWhvdXNlLW9mLXgtbWFnbmV0by1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vZmxvcmlkYXBvbGl0aWNzLmNvbS9hcmNoaXZlcy80MDk3OTctYS1tYWpvcml0eS1vZi1kaXNuZXktZmFucy1kb250LXdhbnQtdG8tc2VlLXNwbGFzaC1tb3VudGFpbi1nby1wb2xsLXNheXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A majority of Disney fans don't want to see Splash Mountain go poll says,"More than half of Disney fans are opposed to the company’s move to close down Splash Mountain and other rides alleged to have racist origins and messaging according to a new poll commissioned by conservative news agency The Daily Wire. The poll which questioned 1098 adults between Feb. 26 and March 3 was conducted by Survey Monkey. It asked respondents representative of the country by party affiliation and other demographics a series of questions related to activism in pop-culture especially Disney. The poll found that overall Disney still has a very favorable image among Americans — 77% found the company favorable while 21% found it unfavorable. But according to the poll 36% of respondents who have heard something in the news recently regarding Disney say it made them feel “less favorable” about the company. A majority of those who found the entertainment megalith unfavorable cite the company’s recent actions involving actress Gina Carano and its decision to shut down certain rides for racist undertones.

The poll found that 61% of those with a “less favorable” impression of Disney point to its firing of Carano and other “cancel culture” actions the company has taken recently.

Carano was let go from the “The Mandalorian” cast after many online called for her firing over a social media post that likened the experience of Jews during the Holocaust to the U.S. political climate according to a report from The Associated Press.

Initially 58% of respondents opposed Disney’s move to fire Carano. But when the respondents were shown the post that resulted in Carano’s termination opposition to the decision grew to 72%. Broken down into demographics a majority of liberals Democrats and Disney fans still disapproved.

The poll also asked respondents how they felt about Disney World shutting down rides like Splash Mountain which is linked to a Jim Crow film and The Jungle Cruise which was subject to scrutiny over its depiction of indigenous peoples as savages. It found that 64% of the respondents were opposed including 60% of self-identified Disney fans.

In addition to Disney the poll also surveyed respondents on Hasbro’s move to change “Mr. Potato Head” to “Potato Head.” More than three-fourths of respondents believed the choice was “political correctness going too far” with 23% supporting Hasbro’s steps.

The poll has a margin of error of 3.37%.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbHlsZXNtb3ZpZWZpbGVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzA3L21hcnZlbC1sZWdlbmRzLWhvdXNlLW9mLXgtd29sdmVyaW5lLWZpZ3VyZS1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marvel Legends House of X Wolverine figure review — Lyles Movie Files,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://lylesmoviefiles.com/2021/03/07/marvel-legends-house-of-x-wolverine-figure-review/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbHlsZXNtb3ZpZWZpbGVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzA3L21hcnZlbC1sZWdlbmRzLWhvdXNlLW9mLXgtd29sdmVyaW5lLWZpZ3VyZS1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

He said he was asked to swab international travellers for COVID-19 despite receiving no training. He said he contacted his manager to raise concerns about the lack of training and to discuss why nursing staff were moving between quarantine hotels. Mr Matthew who quit last week citing bullying and harassment after he questioned protocols in the quarantine program said he wanted to speak out as it was “the right thing to do”. “I feel seriously worried about the quarantine system in Victoria” Mr Matthew said.

“I believe what is happening is not what is being presented to the public.” Loading Last month the chief executive officer of Healthcare Australia resigned after one of the company’s doctors gave two aged care residents four times the correct dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. It was later revealed the doctor had not completed the compulsory vaccination training. At the time COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria confirmed a “small group” of employees travel between the company’s St Kilda Road headquarters and quarantine hotels. Leaked emails seen by The Age show that nurses were being asked to work at multiple hotels up until last month when the Premier Daniel Andrews requested all flights to Melbourne stop as the state battled a spike of coronavirus cases.

In one email dated January 29 Healthcare Australia called for “an extra set of hands” at the Mercure Welcome on Little Bourke Street. Earlier on January 13 nurses looking to “do any additional shifts” were asked to work at the Park Royal Melbourne Airport hotel. In a third email from on December 10 nursing staff were told of a “shortfall in support” at Tullamarine Airport. “We are desperate to fill these shifts” the email said. “Shift will be assisting in temperature checks and assisting the team through the day/evening.” The email train shows that a nurse who had been working at a quarantine hotel housing returned travellers agree to work the airport shift. In a statement Healthcare Australia said it “abides by all the conditions of site exclusivity specified in its contract with CQV”.

“Our nursing staff work only at the hotel they are allocated to and requests for extra shifts are for existing staff at that particular hotel. “We maintain the highest standards of training and all our staff must compete on-site face to face practical competency training before treating residents. Site exclusivity has been maintained in accordance with the requirements of CQV.” A spokesperson for COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria tasked with operating hotel quarantine for the Andrews government said the organisation had “a clear site exclusivity policy and Healthcare Australia (HCA) staff are not permitted to work across different quarantine sites.” “HCA staff including nurses doctors and Allied Health and mental health clinicians must undergo mandatory training prior to their first shift and also undertake on-site training” the spokesperson said.

Finny Matthew says he is speaking out to avoid another COVID-19 outbreak in Victoria. Credit: Justin McManus “Their work is mostly done via telehealth with face-to-face contact with residents confined to COVID-19 testing and essential physical assessments or treatment (for example in emergency situations). “As with all on-site staff they are required to undergo daily testing and follow the program’s strict infection prevention and control measures. “Under CQV’s strengthened model there are clear pathways for any issues or concerns to be raised and we’d encourage any staff members to report matters directly to HCA or CQV.” The Age has also seen position descriptions and contracts for both doctors and nurses hired as part of the hotel quarantine program. One position description for a doctor flagged that the candidate would be required to work at multiple hotels in contradiction with a key recommendation of the Coate inquiry into hotel quarantine.

Loading The job ads were circulated via email to Melbourne doctors after many doctors working for the company quit in the first two months of the revamped quarantine program. The squeeze on the supply of doctors tightened further in February when in response to the Holiday Inn outbreak health networks said doctors could not work at hospitals if they were also working at hotels. One job ad states a doctor would work across both the Pullman and Mercure hotels. The ad also states that Healthcare Australia will accommodate doctors who are also working at other workplaces like private GP clinics. “If you are working elsewhere we will advocate for an exemption on your behalf (n/a for telehealth position)” the email states.

Loading A separate nursing contract from Healthcare Australia states: “The company may require you to transfer to another location or to perform work at other locations from time to time or on a permanent basis in accordance with the needs of the business provided such a requirement is reasonable”. Last month The Age revealed an anonymous quarantine worker had made a formal complaint to WorkSafe Victoria due to staff working at multiple sites. Mr Matthew has contacted both Work Safe and the Victorian Ombudsman with his concerns about the program. “When the quarantine project came up I thought that although it might be risky it was a great opportunity to give back to the state which has given me so much” he told The Age. “I thought I can do my best so that we don’t go back into a lockdown.”

During last year's lockdown in Melbourne Mr Matthew worked as a community nurse visiting mainly older patients and assisting with medical tasks including wound care and blood sugar checks. He said many of his patients battled mental health issues as they were stuck in their homes and felt they had no quality of life. “I wanted to help the fight so we didn’t go into another lockdown.” Mr Matthew who was a member of the Liberal Party for 12 months about six years ago said he wasn’t politically motivated and believed the Victorian government may be unaware of what was happening inside the quarantine hotels. “I am not Liberal and I’m not Labor but this system has to be right” he said. “I am so concerning that this state will not cope with another lockdown.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

HSY,Hershey's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL2xhbmNhc3Rlcm9ubGluZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvd2UtdHJpZWQtYS1jaG9jb2xhdGUtcGl6emEtZnJvbS1uZXctY2FmLWFtdXMtZS1pbi1oZXJzaGV5LWhlcmVzLXdoYXQtaXQvYXJ0aWNsZV84YTA1NWZmNC03ZDM0LTExZWItODllOS0xZjUyYTg0ZGMwZTUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We tried a chocolate pizza from new Café aMusée in Hershey; here's what it was like [photos video],"With food sometimes just the name is evocative enough to make you salivate.

""Chocolate pizza.""

Two ideas that on their own stand tall in a crowded food field. Ask any 10 people on the street what their favorite types of foods and desserts are and inevitably you will hear some variation of either ""chocolate"" and ""pizza.""

Together though? The thought nestled itself into my central cortex and wouldn't let go. The only right thing to do was drive the 45 minutes to the place where I had first seen the words on a menu at the new Café aMusée at the Hershey Story Museum in Hershey.

Café aMusée takes the place of the former Pantry Cafe at 63 W. Chocolate Ave and is connected to the Hershey Story Museum. The café which opened its doors on Feb. 15 is run by Irene Gekas and Angela Megoulas who are 18-year veterans of the food industry. The duo previously ran the Gourmet Grille and Gyro.GRK inside Hershey Park.

Contrary to popular belief and despite the shared names The Hershey Story Museum is under the umbrella of the M.S. Hershey Foundation nonprofit separate from the Hershey Company proper.

That being said you can't make a chocolate pizza in Hershey Pennsylvania without Hershey's chocolate which the café 's dessert menu is blessedly chock-full of.

There was only one hitch in my candy-coated plan - because of the immunocompromised folks in my pandemic bubble I am one of the seemingly few people who hasn't eaten inside a restaurant since the early months of 2020. In place of that I have become a voracious carryout patron or as I explain to my fiancée when I attempt to order the Route 66 spicy chicken sandwich for the third time in a week I am a ""frontline hero"" who is ""helping the local economy.""

I've traveled several miles outside of the city to bring back hot food from further out in the county – shoutout to Harvey's Main Street BBQ in Mount Joy - but I hadn't yet made a trek out specifically for desserts. Alongside the chocolate pizza on the Café aMusée menu is the equally eye-raising ""chocolate syringe"" the thought of which convinced me of the magnitude of my quest.

Though the life story of Milton S. Hershey is a fascinating one - did you know that he almost sailed on the Titanic? - I appreciated not having to buy a museum ticket to get to the sweets. While preparing the desserts I spoke briefly with co-owner Gekas who said that despite all of the snow the first week since opening has been a relative success.

She brought me a fresh chocolate pizza and dear readers I confess that I almost broke edge to eat that thing right then and there. Three things stopped me - 1. COVID-19 is well still a thing. 2. If I eat this entire pizza my fiancée will be mad at me for not sharing. and 3. If I eat this entire personal-pan sized dessert pizza my body will be mad at me. So I dutifully departed though not before also grabbing a chocolate syringe complete with some strawberries in which to drizzle it over.

While we're here confessing things I am occasionally one of those people who eats food in the car. I know it’s a disgusting - and occasionally dangerous - habit. I mention this only because the intoxicating smell of the chocolate had my hand twitching over the carryout box but reality quelled that urge.

After all this is a pizza made of chocolate. You can feel your fingers getting sticky before you even touch the thing.

The pizza features toppings such as marshmallows chocolate and vanilla chips and a healthy drizzling of Hershey's chocolate on top all contained on a standard pizza crust. This is not deep dish but it is a big bite as the marshmallows holding the pizza together make a big impression on the floor and the roof of one's mouth.

One of the calling cards of a “regular” slice of pizza is the ease in which you can finish it and move onto the next. This is not the case with the chocolate pizza where every bite gives you more than enough time to both consider the question ""Should I continue?"" and then reply to yourself with ""Duh.""

As marshmallow covered my face and my fingers took on a chocolate hue the other thought that ran through my head was ""Wow I'm happy to be in the comfort of my own home where people cannot see me make a mess of myself.""

This thought was further exacerbated by the chocolate syringe a curio that Gekas told me she first encountered at a restaurant in New York City. It's a roughly six-inch plastic syringe filled with oozing Hershey's chocolate. In other words it is a dream and a nightmare all in one. It's a dream because as a child visiting Hershey all I could think of was how I was going to get the most concentrated chocolate into my skull as quickly as possible and I can't think of a better way than via syringe. It's that same quality that can fill a mind with dangerous thoughts such as ""Do I just say to Hell with the strawberries and shoot this chocolate into my mouth in the middle of the parking lot?""

Thankfully I did not heed that advice from the devil on my shoulder because the Hershey's chocolate with the strawberries served as a great palate cleanser between bites of the chocolate pizza.

After trying the chocolate pizza I dutifully put the remaining two slices in the fridge for fear of internal combustion. You know what's coming next - that being the central appeal of a carryout order the leftovers that come in the days to follow. In recent years I've adopted the mindset of fellow LNP writer Mike Andrelczyk who once told me never to keep leftover pizza more than 24 hours.

For the chocolate pizza I tried to follow a similar thought process. To be clear there are no exact reheating instructions nor did I ask when I visited Café aMusée. That being said a few minutes in the toaster oven gave this chocolate pizza second life as a s'more's pizza complete with now-golden brown marshmallows on top.

Of course the Café aMusée menu is not entirely made up of desserts. They serve La Colombe coffee on tap and have a variety of sandwiches that do not have marshmallows or Hershey's chocolate hiding inside or at least that's what they tell me.

Though my sweet tooth had to patiently wait for me to return to Lancaster as I initially drove home with this dessert pizza it was fully satiated upon arrival. I'll probably return to learn more about Milton Hershey one day probably when it's nice enough to shoot that chocolate syringe into my face under the warm sunshine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vcGFwcmVwbGl2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8wNi9rYWtvcy1lbmRzLXBlcmtpb21lbi12YWxsZXlzLWZvdXItZGVjYWRlLWRyb3VnaHQtYmVhcnMtYmFiYi1pbi1oZXJzaGV5LWJvdW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kakos ends Perkiomen Valley's four-decade drought; Bears' Babb in Hershey-bound,"QUAKERTOWN >> It was a fast and productive time for Kelly Kakos Saturday.

A memorable one too.

Kakos achieved several goals – one of them historic – during the PIAA East AAA Super Regional at Quakertown. The Perkiomen Valley sophomore earned himself another week’s worth of post-season experience as he placed third in the 132-pound weight class in the equivalent of getting through the “blood round” of the PIAA Championships in this year of coronavirus-influenced scheduling changes.

Along with a bronze medal Kakos secured a first-time trip to Hershey’s Giant Center for the second phase of states where all qualifiers are assured medals.

The PAC’s other Hershey-bound grappler among the lowerweights is Boyertown’s Chance Babb who also placed third at 138.

The East Super Regional was contested in split sessions with the lower weights (106-138) going in the morning while the upperweights (145-285) competed in the evening.

Kakos became the Perk Valley mat program’s first state qualifier in more than four decades the previous one 1977 graduate and 285-pound champion Bill Neill.

“I was confident I could make something happen” Kakos said after picking up his latest medallion this winter. “All my goals were set.”

Kakos whose previous post-season foray ended with a 2-2 at the 2020 South East AAA Regional capped a 3-1 day by pinning Nazareth’s Dominic Wheatley in under two minutes in the third-place bout. It followed a 3:52 pin of Abington Heights’ Austin Smith in their consolation semifinal the response to a major-decision loss at the hands of semifinal-round opponent Matt Mayer of Bethlehem Catholic.

And he didn’t have to look far beyond his house to find support and inspiration for his heady post-season run.

“My family helped me a lot through the past weekend” Kelly said. “I had friends text me through the day encouraging me.”

A particular source of support came from older brother P.J. a teammate during his 2019-20 season.

“P.J. came into the (wrestling) room this week and helped coach me through the positions” Kelly recalled. “He knows what needs to be done.”

Kakos (14-1) got his big day going with a 5-2 decision of Emmaus’ Nick Velde prior to his semifinal loss to Mayer. He returned to Quakertown site of the District 1-AAA North tourney where he was a weight-class champion as the South East runner-up with hopes of making it to Hershey.

“As soon as I got off the mats it hit me” he said. “The stakes are definitely going to be higher for me the next couple years.”

The Boyertown junior Babb roared through the consolation bracket after a semifinal-round loss to Bethlehem Catholic’s Andrew Harmon pinning Northampton’s Christian Fritz in 1:48 to qualify for Hershey and a third-place duel with Kennett’s Trent Kochersperger.

His capper was a 7-5 sudden-victory duel with Kochersperger.

A key to Babb’s success is the use of his legs in matches. That was particularly evident in the bouts with Fritz and Kochersperger.

“It’s one of my strengths … a thing I look for most of the time” Babb (11-2) who came to the super regional as the South East region’s second seed said. “It’s one of the things I do better than most people.”

Babb’s state-medal qualification is several steps up from his Hershey experience as a sophomore where he was finished after a pair of losses. He admitted the day’s work took some pressure off him.

“But I’m not looking to finish eighth” Chance said. “I want to get to the top.”

Four other PAC qualifiers saw their state-level runs end shy of medal finishes. Two of them got closed out with appearances in the tourney’s 5-6 place bouts.

Spring-Ford’s Cole Smith and Boyertown’s Jay Maldonado placed sixth at 106 and 120 respectively. Maldonado saw his scholastic career end with a loss to Bethlehem Liberty’s Javien DeLeon. His bid to qualify for a state medal was thwarted by a narrow 4-3 decision by Wallenpaupack’s Gunnar Myers in their consi-semifinal.

Smith in turn finished his state-tourney run by forfeiting the 5-6 match to West Scranton’s Tyson Cook. They met in the quarterfinal round where Smith (15-3) rolled up a 7-2 decision before being edged by Abington Heights’ Luke Sirianni 6-5 and pinned by Council Rock North’s Tony Burke.

Spring-Ford’s Dominic Ortlip (113) and Boyertown’s Gavin Sheridan (106) went 0-2 in their respective brackets.

NOTES >> During the morning session District 1 representatives presented their Sportsmanship Award to Council Rock North’s Kyle Hauserman the super regional 145-pound champion. In the afternoon Bensalem’s Connor Eck – he’s competing for first place at 145 in the East super regional – was named the South East region’s Outstanding Wrestler.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmhzc24udHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL25vcndpbi13cmVzdGxlci1qb2huLWFsdGllcmktZmVlbGluZy1iZXR0ZXItY2xlYXJlZC10by1jb21wZXRlLWluLWhlcnNoZXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Norwin wrestler John Altieri feeling better cleared to compete in Hershey,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://tribhssn.triblive.com/norwin-wrestler-john-altieri-feeling-better-cleared-to-compete-in-hershey/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmhzc24udHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL25vcndpbi13cmVzdGxlci1qb2huLWFsdGllcmktZmVlbGluZy1iZXR0ZXItY2xlYXJlZC10by1jb21wZXRlLWluLWhlcnNoZXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3g0My5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9saWZlL2FuaW1hbHMvaGVyc2hleS1jb3VwbGUtY2hhbGxlbmdlLXJhaXNlLW1vbmV5LXJldGlyZWQtbWlsaXRhcnktZG9ncy81MjEtMDBiNzk5MWQtODk3Yi00OGYxLThhMDYtNzg2MThiYzFkZTEy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hershey couple participates in rigorous challenge to raise money for retired military dogs,"Georgie and Tyler Harner have entered into endurance athlete's David Goggins' 4x4x48 exercise challenge to raise funds and awareness for retired military dogs.

HERSHEY Pa. — Georgie Harner could not wait to tell her husband Tyler Harner about the retired navy seal and endurance athlete David Goggins' exercise race.

So much so that she quickly signed them up.

""We're like a big dog family we've always had dogs love dogs. So we decided if we would do this we'd want to pick a charity of some sort that benefits dogs.""

The couple chose to support Paws of Honor a non-profit that partners up with several veterinarians and dog food companies to provide resources to retired dogs who have assisted law enforcement.

""We with paws of honor are featuring one dog per workout leg and so there's 12 legs of the 4x4x48 says Harner ""so they're kind of showcasing dogs just to educate people of the services you know the dog has provided.""

FOX43 had the chance to speak with a dog handler Lt. Gregory Bottom of Navy District Washington.

Bottom explained some of the tough defenses the dogs have to exert in aiding in protection.

""The basics of obedience and patrol which is like finding people biting people chasing people down.""

Today he is a titan of Los Angeles’ finance sector a billionaire and a pioneer in several paradigm-changing approaches to deal-making.



Gores is the founder of the eponymous Gores Group a major investment firm based in Beverly Hills. The company started in 1987 has been at the vanguard of private equity trends since its inception from carve-outs in its early days to special purpose acquisition companies — or SPACs — today.



Each step of the firm’s evolution has been informed by Gores’ personal experiences. Born to working-class immigrant parents the private equity mogul rose through the business world by studying the successes and the failures of those around him. He applied those lessons to his business putting his firm ahead of the curve for a number of major trends.



This forward-thinking approach was thrown into the limelight again last year amid the boom in SPAC deals. The vehicles accounted for a majority of the U.S. initial public offering or IPO market last year with 248 SPACs raising more than $83 billion according to SPACInsider.



Gores first used the approach in 2015 years before virtually any other major institutional investor. He has since become one of the biggest names in SPACs and is often credited with helping bring the investment approach into the mainstream.



Gores set the record for the biggest SPAC deal in history last fall when he merged his firm’s fifth SPAC with the nation’s largest wholesale mortgage lender at a $16 billion valuation. Despite the flood of SPAC deals that record held until last month.



After a string of successes Gores can now add the title of the Los Angeles Business Journal’s 2021 Businessperson of the Year to his long list of wins.



Despite a hectic week of deal-making — and running on only a few hours of sleep — Gores made time for a virtual sit-down with the Business Journal to discuss his career his approach to business and more.



To start can you tell us a bit about your early background? How did a degree in computer science in Michigan lead to a career in private equity?

We don’t come from any money. I was the oldest of six kids. I was the first to go to college of any generation (in my family). I started my first company right out of college in Flint Mich. I was selling mini-computers to small businesses. It was just me and no employees. This was 1978 when everyone was doing things manually.



That must have been a hard sell. Did you pick up any key lessons from that work?

Yes. Because I was selling (computers) to all these entrepreneurs I got to see how they ran their businesses. I got to learn from them because I was just a computer guy. I sold to maybe 300 businesses over that time. It was like going to school for free while selling computers.



And how did that transition into private equity?

I sold my first business Executive Business Systems when I was 33 for $2 million. I ended up using that money to buy a company that had some problems and cleaned it up and sold it.



So you went straight from running a computer business to private equity dealmaking?

I was an operator. I didn’t know how to do deals. I created this model where we would go in and fix up the operations at a company and then sell it. I was early on in private equity before everyone knew that it was private equity.



Did you have a particular approach or focus during that time?

I created this process of buying divisions from big companies — because there is a good chance that you are going to get screwed up being part of a big company. So I ended up doing carve-outs for the next 10 years.



Were there any big things you took away from that period in your career?

I got to see how people were messing up their companies. I got to see what people were doing wrong (and what not to do).



How did your firm start gaining traction? Were there any pivotal deals that helped establish Gores Group as a major player?

The two big ones that put us on the map were the Learning Co. (carve-out) from Mattel and VeriFone (Systems carve-out) from HP. Those were in the early 2000s.



I took all the lessons I had had previously from my business experience and applied it to those (companies). We took the Learning Co. from loss-making to profitable in like 75 days.



The Siemens (Enterprise Communications carve-out) was also big. Those successes brought in a lot more deals.



You started focusing on SPACs around 2015 — way before this current boom that we’re in now. What were your initial feelings about SPACs?

At first it took me some time to agree to go with this thing (SPACs). But once we landed on it I really loved it. I love it more than private equity.



It’s fun. Everything is fast. It’s my speed. I’m kind of ADD. The speed and velocity keeps you awake seven days a week.



Anything specific that appealed to you about the process?

You are partnering with companies you are partnering with investors partnering with entrepreneurs and you are all coming together to make this thing work. Also you get to write a big check alongside it.



For me personally I can talk to some 25-year-old entrepreneur that wants to go public and talk to him about the deals I did and things I learned when I was 25. That is the thing I love the most (about SPACs).



You’ve been very successful in the SPAC space closing the biggest SPAC deal in history last fall with United Wholesale Mortgage. Why has Gores Group’s SPAC business performed at such a high level?

It starts with the relationships you build with people. We have a lot of really strong relationships. Also because of our reputation we get a lot of inbound opportunities and can choose the best ones.



I had to build my own business and learn the hard way. I had to do the due diligence build the relationships do everything myself. I’m applying everything I ever learned to these deals from understanding entrepreneurs to the importance of transparency to doing the due diligence. Everything I’ve learned over 40 years I’m applying that. I call it the Gores way.



What are your thoughts on the current SPAC boom we are in? Do you think the market is oversaturated or about right for the level of demand?

I think there is saturation in the market but I don’t lose sleep over that. It actually creates more opportunities for us.



How does more competition create more opportunities for you?

It reminds me of my first business when I was selling computers. When I called businesses talking about computers they would almost hang up on you. I had to do so much education (about what computers were).



Nobody knew what a SPAC was when we started doing this. Now all these other SPAC guys help do the education for us. Once (a company) has the education once they get serious then we show up. I’ve got so many customers I win the business every time.



So it sounds like you’ve settled into an approach that works for your SPAC deals.

We’re not staying still. We’re always trying to think of ways to improve this product. Our playbook continues to evolve every day.



Do you have any thoughts on how Covid has played into the SPAC boom? The timing of the two coincided pretty closely.

I really couldn’t tell you. There were a couple of other big deals that happened around that time that probably helped. For me it’s been great — I’ve been able to do all of these deals right out of my home.



Do you think SPACs are going to continue to be your focus for the foreseeable future?

Yes right now there is so much business. We will be busy doing this for a long time. We’re not raising one or two SPACs. We are building a real franchise here.



Your brothers Tom and Sam are both big names in the local business community as well. Any thoughts on how you three all ended up having such a meteoric rise from Michigan to where you are today?

We are very blessed; we had great parents. They embedded in us honesty fairness and hard work. They taught us that you get what belongs to you but you also don’t take what doesn’t belong to you what you haven’t earned. They taught us how to make money the honest way.



A lot of us have had some pretty big life changes under Covid this last year. Has anything significant changed about your work or lifestyle since the lockdowns began?

I think I’ve learned efficiency. It’s so much more efficient to work from home. You can really avoid 80% of travel. Especially where I am in life I can really do everything through Zoom. I can use my reputation and all the relationships I have. If you’re young it’s different because you need to travel and make those relationships in person.



In some ways Covid has been a blessing because I get to spend more time with my family and my kids. It’s been a great excuse not to go anywhere. In the future I think we can avoid a lot of travel.



Stepping away from work do you have any hobbies or projects that you work on for fun?

No I don’t have that many hobbies. My work is my No. 1 hobby. I love what I do. I’ve golfed a little bit but the problem with golf is that I’ve worked my whole life and so I don’t have a lot of time to practice. So I’m not very good at it.



I don’t think I’m a workaholic though. I used to be a workaholic but now I do it because I enjoy it.



What about family life? Are you able to make time for your family with all that work?

I spend a lot of time with my family. I have six kids I have a wife (and) I have five grandkids. My youngest is a 20-month-old baby.



What do you usually do together? Do you have any favorite family activities?

We’re pretty simple. We like just getting together on Sundays for dinner. We watch a lot of sports — football basketball. We also have a house on Lake Michigan and we go there a lot. With the family that’s probably my favorite thing to do.



What about philanthropy? Are there any causes you give to or are passionate about that you would highlight?

There are quite a few but I don’t talk about it. I’m not someone that wants to put my name on a building. I give directly. I do it for one reason: to help not to get any credit.



What is your outlook for Los Angeles businesses in 2021?

First of all we need to get Covid over with. I’m hoping by the fall things can get back to somewhat normal.



I think once things get back to normal with Covid things will come back pretty fast because people will be hungry. They’ll be wanting to get back to eating out going to the movies.



The key thing is Covid though. I don’t know when this whole Covid thing is going to end.

Key Deals That Shaped Gores Group

Gores Group has been involved in many major deals since its founding more than three decades ago. These have ranged from carve-outs — the firm’s focus in its early years — to special purpose acquisition companies. Today SPACs are the core of Gore’s business. Here are three deals that played outsized roles in the firm’s development.

2000: The Learning Co.

The Learning Co.: One of Gores’ earliest major successes was its purchase of a struggling software business from Mattel Inc. The business had operational problems and was hemorrhaging $1.5 million daily according to Gores. His firm aggressively cut costs consolidated redundant units dropped unprofitable product lines and made the Learning Co. profitable in 75 days. Gores sold the company’s entertainment division to French video game developer Ubisoft Entertainment in 2001. Later that year it sold Learning Co.’s education assets and name rights to Irish education technology company Riverdeep Interactive Learning today part of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Co.

2001: VeriFone Inc.

VeriFone Inc.: Gores acquired the Santa Clara-based electronic payments company from computing giant Hewlett-Packard Co. (today HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise). Hewlett-Packard had bought the company in 1997 for about $1.2 billion but shed the asset only four years later due to a worse-than-expected performance. Gores Group turned VeriFone around in less than a year helping it reach $350 million in annual revenue with strong profitability according to Gores. The firm sold VeriFone to Chicago-based private equity firm GTCR in 2002.

2015: Hostess Brands Inc.

Hostess Brands Inc.: Gores’ transition to SPACs began with this deal. The firm raised $375 million in a public offering for its first SPAC Gores Holdings and used that capital to purchase the iconic company in a $2.3 billion deal. Although that figure has since been dwarfed by Gores’ other record-setting SPACs the size of the transaction and Hostess’ high profile helped put Gores on the map as one of the first major institutional SPAC investors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ncS5jb20uYXUvc3VjY2Vzcy9maW5hbmNlL3RoZXNlLTEwLWZlbWFsZS1zZWxmbWFkZS1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZXMtd2lsbC1pbnNwaXJlLXlvdS10by1hY2hpZXZlLXlvdXItZmluYW5jaWFsLWdvYWxzL2ltYWdlLWdhbGxlcnkvYTExMTlkOTI1OTVhOWJjZWE5NzIyMWIwOWFkMzdhODfSAbEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ3EuY29tLmF1L3N1Y2Nlc3MvZmluYW5jZS90aGVzZS0xMC1mZW1hbGUtc2VsZm1hZGUtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmVzLXdpbGwtaW5zcGlyZS15b3UtdG8tYWNoaWV2ZS15b3VyLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1nb2Fscy9pbWFnZS1nYWxsZXJ5L2ExMTE5ZDkyNTk1YTliY2VhOTcyMjFiMDlhZDM3YTg3P2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 10 Female Self-Made Billionaires Will Inspire You To Achieve Your Financial Goals,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.gq.com.au/success/finance/these-10-female-selfmade-billionaires-will-inspire-you-to-achieve-your-financial-goals/image-gallery/a1119d92595a9bcea97221b09ad37a87 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ncS5jb20uYXUvc3VjY2Vzcy9maW5hbmNlL3RoZXNlLTEwLWZlbWFsZS1zZWxmbWFkZS1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZXMtd2lsbC1pbnNwaXJlLXlvdS10by1hY2hpZXZlLXlvdXItZmluYW5jaWFsLWdvYWxzL2ltYWdlLWdhbGxlcnkvYTExMTlkOTI1OTVhOWJjZWE5NzIyMWIwOWFkMzdhODfSAbEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ3EuY29tLmF1L3N1Y2Nlc3MvZmluYW5jZS90aGVzZS0xMC1mZW1hbGUtc2VsZm1hZGUtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmVzLXdpbGwtaW5zcGlyZS15b3UtdG8tYWNoaWV2ZS15b3VyLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1nb2Fscy9pbWFnZS1nYWxsZXJ5L2ExMTE5ZDkyNTk1YTliY2VhOTcyMjFiMDlhZDM3YTg3P2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzL2Z1dHVyZS1vZi13b3JrLWxvZ2lzdGljcy1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW5zLWZ1dHVyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Future of Work: The future of supply chains depends on frictionless logistics with collaboration,"Coming together at ﻿YourStory Media﻿Future of Work 2021 a panel of logistics experts discussing the future of supply chains concurred that data-driven technology adoption and seamless integration among myriad logistics stakeholders can solve the problem of India's fragmented supply chains.





The panel comprised R Raghuraman Head of Supply Chain Strategies ITC; Vishal Sharma CEO India and Sub-Continent DB Schenker; Vikram Janakiraman Partner and Managing Director BCG; and Swapnil Shah Founder and CEO ﻿Freight Tiger﻿.

According to BCG's Vikram Janakiraman India's supply chains are unorganised and the network problem leads to high friction in the market such as trucks running empty or sitting idle.

""These are inefficiencies which cost the economy big time. To fix this we need common platforms that leverage data to integrate logistics participants and drive information and transparency. Getting to Logistics 4.0 will be a completely data-led transformation"" he said.

DB Schenker's Vishal Sharma corroborating this view said business across India are looking for seamless integrations with other companies and customers. ""In terms of logistics they realise they cannot do everything in-house or outsource everything. They need a hybrid model to utilise supply chains in a holistic manner"" he said adding:





""The thought is to build more resiliency in supply chains and not leave things to chance. Perhaps stress testing of supply chains in various scenarios was not enough in the previous era of rapid expansion.""





The panellists touched upon several key trends in the Indian logistics space including a rise in digital-savvy businesses adoption of end-to-end automation adoption of high-end technology for quick decision making and route optimisation and more.





Freight Tiger's Swapnil Shah cautioned software and logistics solution builders that without on-ground experience and an existing ecosystem and network of stakeholders the software doesn't have much value. ""Only technology can lead the way when the problem is large but there needs to be trust and inclusion among stakeholders at all levels right from managers to truckers"" he said.





Dubbing the new data-driven roles of these stakeholders like that of ""logisticians"" ITC's Raghuraman said data-driven logistics solutions can help expand the boundaries of a business' operating zone.

""By doing so you can analyse and remove inefficiencies anticipate problems in advance and prevent them before they happen.""

With the Indian logistics market expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.7 percent between 2020-2024 businesses and brands only stand to boost growth by leveraging cutting-edge technologies. Moving forward in 2021 several trends will drive growth and all will involve the adoption of technology.

According to a report by Statista the global AR VR and mixed reality market is forecast to reach $30.7 billion this year and rise close to $300 billion by 2024.

Ashwin said that AR/VR has revolutionised everything including the way we design and work. Some of the key trends he highlighted while speaking about ‘VR/AR and the future of work’ include:

Utilising technology at the planning stage

Within the realm of an enterprise AR and VR technologies help companies and founders visualise and articulate their goals and vision said Ashwin. He gave an example of the design and architecture industry wherein a virtual reality literally allows designers and architects to “walk inside their designs”.





Ashwin also spoke about automobile designers who have been using clay models while designing and developing cars which is an expensive and tedious affair. “These take a lot of time and money but with AR and VR you can swing your arms and create something in thin air.”





Ashwin highlighted how this technology is gaining popularity in the manufacturing sector and said “A lot of factories are creating 360 virtual tours of their space. This will help the person building it walk through the entire factory understand the processes better and ultimately bolster better decision-making.”

Execution across various sectors

One of the things highlighted by Ashwin was the dynamic and expansive scope of AR and VR across multiple sectors including the entertainment and gaming industries.

He said “Hollywood uses AR and VR a lot. They help in deciding camera angles and a host of other things even before the shooting starts.”

The visualisation tools of these technologies help in tracking progress taking the right measurements and can even help in planning the future better.

Using AR/VR in ‘DIRE’ circumstances

Ashwin said that these technologies are most useful in DIRE situations - an acronym for dangerous impossible rare and expensive.





“It is very hard to prepare an individual or a company for a rare event like a fire earthquake etc. There is no way you can predict emergency situations” he said.





Ashwin gave the example of a project he worked on for Netherlands-based oil and gas giant Shell where they developed techniques and tools using VR to mitigate fire in their plants.





AutoVRse has also aided automotive companies by building a VR software that can be deployed at the design stage as well as at key customer touchpoints such as the showroom.

The future

Ashwin also spoke about a project he did for Australian wine company Jacob’s Creek where the products could be scanned from the website with the help of a QR code and the same could be placed on an individual’s dining table or to get an idea of the look and feel.





Ashwin said he is very bullish about the utilisation of AR and VR technologies in the ecommerce industry.

“The time is not far when they are going to become a staple on every ecommerce website. For example while shopping you can place a handbag next to you and see if it matches your outfit.”

However one challenge that he pointed out before concluding the session was the need to come up with lighter and more comfortable hardware while deploying AR and VR.





“A lot is happening in this space and it is gradually gathering momentum” he said.

Everything from text to images and voice to video — live or non-live — qualifies as content. You could be in sectors as disparate as gaming and teaching and still be called a ""content creator"" .





But when hundreds of millions of people create tonnes of content every day the challenge especially for businesses that make money off it is to make it stand out.





How do they do that especially at a time when content volumes have exploded?





At Future of Work 2021 ﻿YourStory Media﻿flagship product-design-tech conference Mukul Rustagi Co-founder and CEO of ﻿Classplus﻿ and Piyush Kumar Founder and CEO of ﻿Rooter﻿Sports Technologies shared key insights on creating distributing and monetising content in education and gaming respectively.

Content matters because ""our culture is built around content and Indians are gluttons for content"" Piyush says. ""The new internet user's first point of contact on the web is content.""

Classplus Founder Mukul Rustagi and Rooter Founder Piyush Kumar at Future of Work 2021

Edtech startup Classplus which describes itself as a ""Shopify for teachers"" is in the business of disseminating and monetising content for teachers and educators.





Mukul says

""Educators are great content creators. We enable them — academic or non-academic — to launch their coaching centre online. We have built functionalities to help these creators engage with their students better and also disseminate their content faster.""

Classplus which was founded in 2018 grew at a rapid pace during the pandemic and also saw tutors and teachers from Tier III and IV towns joining the platform.





""Good content creators stand out. Last year we saw someone generate lots of money out of their content. The monetary power also allows them to re-invest in the quality of content and get a team to build more quality. We also saw people from Tier III and IV towns gain a handsome following from across the country"" he explained.





While Sequoia-backed Classplus is focused on the dissemination of content live game-streaming platform Rooter looks at both creation and distribution.

Rooter Sports is one of India's largest game streaming platforms

Piyush shares ""Our game is both content creation and distribution. We've built tools needed to stream the gaming content well and we also help top gamers create content around battle royale games which their community wants to learn from.""





Rooter's focus is on tapping into vernacular communities to help local gamers expand their reach. The platform is available in 10 Indian languages besides English.





He explains

""When we pivoted in March-April 2020 we started building gaming communities in Tamil and Telugu and it is insane how gamers followed the top streamers in their community. Within 30 seconds 15000 concurrent viewers were live to watch a Free Fire game streamed.""

""It is about how people create content to build their communities. If they create content in vernacular they become indispensable. The way to win the market is to enable these streamers make more money than on YouTube"" Piyush adds.





Classplus' Mukul concurs on the importance of vernacular content on the Indian internet. ""More than nine-tenth of the content that gets created on our platform is vernacular. It works very well and gets adopted faster"" he reveals.

""Short videos also work well but in our case text content works better. You would be surprised by the kids' affinity to consume text content versus watching videos or slides"" he adds.

Despite operating in very disparate segments both Classplus and Rooter reckon content needs ""community"" to fly. Platforms need evangelists and ""product champions"" to scale in a cluttered content space.





Piyush says ""We have 40000-50000 game streams happening per day. In India we always have the volume; we just have to build tech to scale that volume. And if you build the right community teams the right content will always win.""





""At the end of the day content creators know best what works for them"" he adds.

Recent Hilton Cleveland Downtown troubles raise red flags,"CLEVELAND Ohio — Recent financial trouble involving the Hilton Cleveland Downtown Hotel raises a number of questions none larger than this one: Should governments be in the hotel business?

It’s a question that’s no longer really relevant in Cleveland – that decision was made years ago and taxpayers are now facing the consequences: County coffers have been tapped for an unexpected $22 million to make debt tax and insurance payments for the hotel for 2020 and 2021.

That’s on top of the $10 million annually that the county has been paying for years to reduce the debt on the $272-million Hilton which opened in 2016 a companion to the adjacent Huntington Convention Center of Cleveland also built with taxpayer dollars.

There are more than a dozen publicly owned hotels in the United States and many others that have received substantial public funding to be built.

All are facing severe financial distress caused by the dramatic downturn in travel because of the coronavirus.

“This is the worst disaster that could possibly befall these hotels” said Thomas Hazinski managing director at HVS a hospitality consulting firm in Chicago. “They were basically shut down not generating any income.”

Both privately owned and publicly funded hotels have been fighting to survive in recent months negotiating with creditors to forestall debt payments because of a lack of revenue.

“Every hotel owner is having to dip into their savings to pay their mortgages” said David Sangree president of Hotel & Leisure Advisors a Cleveland-based hospitality consultant. “All the downtown hotels are doing terribly.”

It’s unclear however how many government-owned hotels have had to tap into general tax revenue to pay debt as the Hilton Cleveland did in both 2020 and 2021.

The 2014 agreement between the county and the Hilton includes certain financial triggers that commit county taxpayers as a last-resort option for debt and other payments. Those specific triggers are considered proprietary and were blacked out in a media-reviewed copy of the contract.

This is the first time since the hotel opened that the county has had to provide the extra payments according to Walter Parfejewiec director of the county’s office of management and budget.

He said he was aware of no discussions that would require the Hilton to repay the county once the tourism industry rebounds.

The timing for the additional public subsidy couldn’t be worse – as local governments face funding crises of their own and residents and businesses suffering during the economic downturn turn to government for help.

Even so Hazinski said Cuyahoga County could not reasonably have let the hotel default on its portion of the debt an outcome that would have resulted in both a distressed property and a reduction in the government’s credit rating.

“The decision to pay the debt while probably unpopular is in the best interest of the government” said Hazinski.

The publicly-owned Hilton Columbus Downtown Hotel has not had to rely on county general fund dollars to meet its financial obligations. Instead the hotel owned by the Franklin County Convention Authority has tapped a $36 million reserve fund to make debt payments on the hotel open since 2012.

The reserve account is funded by rent the authority collects from property it owns in the neighborhood between downtown and Ohio State University.

“We believe those reserves will be sufficient to carry us into next year” said Don Brown executive director of the authority which also owns the Greater Columbus Convention Center and Nationwide Arena. “We see occupancy and the financial performance of the hotel is on the rebound now. As conventions and meetings and other events return we will be able to come out on the other side.”

The authority is in the middle of building a major addition to the Hilton Columbus expected to open in 2022 which will bring the total number of rooms to 1000 and make the hotel the largest in the state.

Before financing the addition he said “We did some shock scenario testing. We never anticipated the shock scenario would hit us so soon.”

Indeed the pandemic has roiled the hospitality industry in ways that no one could have predicted. Hotel occupancy nationwide last year was record low 44% down from 66% in 2019. In downtown Cleveland it was a dismal 31%.

In Columbus taxpayers in Franklin County and the city would have been on the hook for part of the shortfall if the reserve fund hadn’t covered the losses said Brown. “We’re confident in our ability to remain self-sustaining in the future” he said. “We want to preserve our perfect record.”

Larry Trabulsi executive vice president at CHM Warnick a hotel asset management firm near Boston cautioned against comparing the details of public financing deals calling it “apples and bananas.”

“Every hotel bond deal has unique elements” said Trabulsi who helped negotiate the Cuyahoga County-Hilton deal. “We did the best we could to minimize what [the county] had to put in it. Unfortunately it’s what had to happen.”

A change in tax law in the late 1990s expanded the ability of government to publicly finance hotels with municipal debt making it a popular option for communities that wanted to boost tourism to their downtowns and couldn’t entice private developers to gamble on big convention-center oriented hotels.

Chicago Houston Denver Dallas Austin and Baltimore among other cities all have publicly owned hotels.

Ideally governments shouldn’t want to be in the hotel business said local consultant Sangree. “They’re competing against privately owned hotels. It’s really not fair.”

At some point Sangree said the county could seek to sell the Hilton to a private buyer. “When they built this hotel my hope was that they were hoping to sell it at some point” he said.

He cited the sale of the Sheraton Grand Phoenix owned by the city of Phoenix to Marriott International in 2018. The city sold the 1000-room hotel for $255 million considerably less than the $350 million the city paid to build it a decade earlier.

Publicly owned hotels aren’t expected to be major profit centers said Hazinski. They’re built as economic development generators – to boost tourism to generate convention center business and to strengthen downtowns. “The benefits go beyond the monetary return on the hotel” he said.

Indeed numerous local government and tourism officials believe that the Hilton Cleveland was key to attracting numerous high profile events to the city in recent years including the Republican National Convention in 2016.

Even so Hazinski said governments officials would be wise to take a second look at any project in the future and build in more safeguards as a result of the problems facing Cleveland and other communities.

“This sets another standard for worst case scenario” he said.

Hotel occupancy in Cleveland plunges to 37% in 2020 and the worst may be yet to come",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8wNi9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS91czQwbS1oaWx0b24taG90ZWwtdG8tZ2VuZXJhdGUtb3Zlci0yMDAtam9icy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US$40M Hilton hotel to generate over 200 jobs,"The project summary for the planned US$40 million Hilton-branded hotel at Houston that will see over 150 local construction workers hired to build the facility and an additional 70 persons hired full time once it is up and running.

According to the summary which has been released by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the Hilton Garden Inn and Homewood Suites will see a 289 key hotel built near the Houston Guyana Shore Base Inc. (GYSBI).

Addressing local content the summary states the development of the Hilton is expected to employ 150+ locally sourced construction workers with an additional 70+ locally sourced employees required to run the completed hotel. It adds that around US$10 million is expected to be spent across 25 local contracts during development

One of the hotel’s principals is Lars Mangal of TOTALTEC Oilfield Services and who is part of a partnership with the GYSBI consortium.

The project summary describes him as coming with “28 years of experience in the international oil and gas industry while working with Schlumberger and Welltec.” He is now CEO and Chairman of TOTALTEC Oilfield Services.

In a statement Mangal had said “This will be a great addition to Guyana boosting the development of local capacity in support of its indigenous oil and gas sector along with offering additional room capacity to serve the tourism sector.” He added “Our development will not only create jobs in the construction sector but also create several opportunities for plus 25 Guyanese contractors and suppliers to be involved in another world class development for Guyana. We will see investments being made in the training and development of staff to serve in hospitality and catering departments as the construction phase nears completion on this fast track development concept.”

This newspaper understands that EPA permission was granted for the construction as no Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was needed for the construction. “Hotels for example are standard construction and do not require the detailed studies of other projects such as a road passing through swamps or a forest the laying of pipelines as in the case of the gas to shore project…and those sorts of first time or ‘unknown’ projects” former Director of the EPA Dr. Vincent Adams had told the Stabroek News.

“A lot of the requirements are subjective and not quantitative. But you look at risks of the project assess. Hotels as I said before are standard construction and where it is built” he added.

Central Housing and Planning Authority City Hall and the Fire Department permissions are also needed and will serve as a guide to construction oversight codes.

According to the project summary “The Hilton Garden Inn and Homewood Suites development will … also support an additional 19000 sq. of commercial space restaurants bars meeting rooms as well as a gym and a pool”.

The summary states that the development partners have acquired the rights to purchase the three acre development site and have received outline planning permission.

The Miami based RAD Architecture has completed full architectural renderings for design and construction of the hotel. “RAD has designed several hotel and hospitality projects across the Caribbean” the document states.

In addition companies Americaribe and Deluxe Modular are both tendering for construction of the project having submitted fixed price proposals for construction and development of the hotel. “Both companies have extensive construction experience in the Caribbean” the summary states.

Explaining financing for the hotel the summary states that equity investors for the hotel “leading European and Caribbean investment firms have committed to funding the project (subject to finalization of debt financing). Debt financiers are completing their final stages of due diligence.”

In November of last year three months after the PPP/C took office and following a call by the Irfaan Ali government for expressions of interest a deal for the construction of Hilton Garden Inn and Homewood Suites Hotel was announced along with three other hotel projects.

Guyana’s Office for Foreign and Local Investment (G-Invest) and the Ministry of Commerce signed Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with the representatives of each of the four chains.

Head of G-Invest Peter Ramsaroop had subsequently told this newspaper that the developers of the Hilton Garden Inn had already received the requisite approvals to begin construction as he underscored local content commitments.

Key management

The project summary gives profiles of its “Key management” personnel.

They are: Jonathan Murphy who the document says comes with 12 years of experience investing in managing and developing real-estate. “Jonathan is a Director of Portland JSX a US$300 million private equity fund focused on investing in the Caribbean and Latin America.”

There is also Darren Law who brings “25 years of experience in global hotel and resort management and asset management. Darren has managed resort developments in North America the Caribbean and the Middle East including Santa Barbara Beach and Golf Resort and a US$1.5 billion luxury resort in Riyadh Saudi Arabia.”

Others include Eric Hertha who is said to have 30 years of experience in the international hospitality industry. “Eric has worked with brands such as Fairmont Sheraton and Wyndham and was previously Senior Director of Operations Finance at Hilton while overseeing the centralization of Hilton’s Caribbean back-office and development of a 503-key hotel development in Sao Paulo Brazil” according to the project summary.

Venture capitalist Neil Passmore is another on the management team and he the document says has 15 years of experience in the global capital markets. “Neil has raised over US$30 billion in capital and is now CEO and Co-Founder of Hannam & Partners a FACE authorized natural-resources focused investment bank based in London.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9mb3ItbWlubmVzb3RhLWhvdGVsLWluZHVzdHJ5LW5vcm1hbC1jb3VsZC1iZS1hLXllYXItb3ItbW9yZS1hd2F5LzYwMDAzMTA5MC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For Minnesota hotel industry normal could be a year or more away,"Jim Alderman was set to fly from North Carolina to Minnetonka a year ago to start his new role as chief executive of Radisson Hotel Group Americas when the phone rang.

""I got a call March 10 saying the governor was shutting the state because of COVID"" Alderman recalled. ""So on my very first day as CEO we closed the [headquarters] office and told everyone to come and take what they needed home.""

As COVID infections spread nationwide Radisson's guest bookings plummeted. ""By mid-March we took a real punch in the mouth. Business was down 80% overnight"" Alderman said. ""Devastating isn't enough of a word. ... God. It's been terrible.""

Radisson with 39 hotels in Minnesota and 613 in the Americas wasn't alone in being pummeled by COVID-19. Hotel owners nationwide are wishing hard for a recovery but few expect it will be swift even as vaccinations rise and state-imposed gathering restrictions loosen.

""The hospitality industry was hit extremely hard by this"" said St. Paul-based Hospitality Minnesota board Chairman Howard Anderson. ""We are hopeful we will get back to normal in 2022 or 2023.""

One billion hotel rooms went unsold helping ""2020 set a record for the worst performance by U.S. hotels"" according to a new report by hotel analytics firm STR. COVID-19's damage even surpassed the Great Recession which left 786 million hotel room nights unsold.

Last year U.S. hotel revenue plunged 49% as guests filled only 39% of all available rooms.

The Twin Cities has fared far worse. Hotel occupancy in the metro tumbled to 21% last year and dropped again — to 14% in January the state's Explore Minnesota agency reported.

Guest visits were so weak STR said Minneapolis and St. Paul hotels recorded ""the lowest occupancy among the Top 25 markets"" in 2020.

The hotel slowdown is expected to cost Minnesota about $173 million in lost state and local tax revenue for the year according to the American Hotel & Lodging Association and Oxford Economics. Few are surprised.

""We saw the cancellation of over 400 events"" in Minneapolis last year including the 2020 NCAA Division I wrestling championship that was supposed to bring 40000 fans to U.S. Bank Stadium in downtown said Melvin Tennant chief executive of the city tourism bureau Meet Minneapolis. ""For 2020 we saw devastation.""

Twelve of 47 Minneapolis hotels temporarily closed. While a majority have reopened it's unclear when the Crowne Plaza Northstar Delta Hotel Minneapolis Northeast Le Meridien Chambers and Sheraton Minneapolis Midtown might reopen their doors Tennant said.

Now as vaccination efforts begin to ramp up the area's open hotels still face an uphill climb.

The Intercontinental Hotel Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport received some financial assistance from the Metropolitan Airports Commission last spring and is currently negotiating for more.

Marriott and Hilton hotels both recently reported losing hundreds of millions of dollars to the pandemic.

Worker layoffs and furloughs flourish. Last year more than 116429 Minnesota leisure and hospitality workers lost their jobs to COVID including the 41100 shed in December the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) reported.

Still industry watchers said there are small signs of progress.

Hotels near Lake Superior and the North Shore report doing well. The half-built Courtyard by Marriott hotel that was burned by arsonists last year in downtown St. Paul is being rebuilt and will open this year.

Next year United Properties still expects to open Minneapolis' first five-star hotel — the Four Seasons — at Washington and Hennepin avenues in downtown.

Blocks away the Rand Tower hotel on S. 6th Street and Marquette Avenue just celebrated its Dec. 2 grand opening — after a $110 million renovation that converted the historic art deco office building into a hotel.

Business in December proved a dud but ""it's getting better. We've gotten creative"" said Rand co-owner Nick Peterson.

To pull in guests the 26-story Rand now offers private six-course dinners for up to six people with contactless ""knock and drop"" service.

It is catering intimate birthday parties for COVID-weary families and hosting themed whiskey-tasting nights.

The extra pamperings have helped nudging bookings above 25% some days. ""We are just plugging away"" Peterson said noting that he and his partners are prepared to ride out COVID's storm.

The Radisson Hotel Group temporarily shut 20% of its North American hotels last year ""because the occupancy was so low"" said CEO Alderman. All but 10 reopened but business is still off.

""January to be candid was a bit disappointing"" he said. Americans ceased traveling due to bad weather and worries about new coronavirus strains from England Brazil and South Africa.

Even so ""my crystal ball is so bright"" Alderman said. ""We're seeing some really good green shoots across our portfolio especially with last-minute bookings.""

He's thrilled the Radisson Blu Mall of America was 94% full Valentine's Day weekend. Destination places such as Duluth and the North Shore benefited as city dwellers dashed to rural areas and outdoor adventures.

Bookings in Duluth and at Radisson's rural Country Inn & Suites properties did much better its urban hotels he said.

""We are looking at very possibly the best six to seven months of travel starting from late May or June"" Alderman said. ""There are some people who will get out and will travel saying 'I can't take it anymore.' There's a lot of pent-up demand.""

Radisson Hotel Group is betting big he is right. It will soon open new hotels in Florida the Dominican Republic and Aruba.

Anderson who is also operations vice president of ZMC Hotels said his crystal ball is bit more ""murky.""

He expects lodging won't return to normal levels until late 2022 or 2023 — after most people are vaccinated and families feel safer venturing out.

Business is down 50% at the five hotels ZMC owns in Hibbing Duluth and Superior Wis.

The draw of Lake Superior as a COVID fatigue reliever is credited for preventing a steeper decline.

But full recovery will require more than a lake. It needs the return of Duluth's adored concerts festivals sporting events and firework displays Anderson said.

Tennant at Meet Minneapolis is also yearning for his city's ""demand drivers."" Events at U.S. Bank Stadium Target Field TCF Stadium Orchestra Hall and Hennepin Avenue and other venues typically draw 30 million-plus visitors a year. They will return he said.

""People are ready to get out"" Tennant said. ""We are [predicting ] a huge resurgence once that all-clear sign is given.""

An estimated 500 gulls have taken up part-time residency in an empty field near Del Taco and Gators Sports Bar & Grill in the Victor Valley Town Center shopping complex on Hesperia Road.

The colony of gulls were recently seen soaring over stores and nesting on the ground as they ate and squawked warnings to keep five curious ravens at bay.

Environmental Scientist Samantha Przeklasa with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife told the Daily Press the gulls' presence in the Victor Valley is due to their migration pattern.

“It is common for migrating gulls to travel through the High Desert this time of year” Przeklasa said. “The reason it probably seems like more than normal is due to the high winds. You may see many birds seeking shelter on the ground away from those winds.”

The gulls are known to rest in large parking lots and vacant land adjacent to shopping centers because there they have easy access to food and open flat terrain that allows for a mass congregation which allows the birds to look out for potential dangers Przeklasa said.

“It's an amazing sight to watch hundreds of these beautiful birds fly overhead and come in for a landing” said Paula Nelson who lives in Hesperia. “It’s also strange to see so many of these seagulls living in the High Desert.”

While Nelson called the gulls a desert oddity and flying marvels businessman and former Victorville Mayor Ryan McEachron said they are a “messy nuisance” that regularly bombards his office with bird droppings.

McEachron’s ISU Insurance Services - ARMAC Agency on Yuma Street — which has been splattered with fecal matter in recent days — is situated adjacent to the bird field.

“They fly over our building and do their dirty deeds all over the property” McEachron 48 said. “Our employees can’t even wash their cars for fear the seagulls will poop on them.”

During a tour of McEachron’s property hundreds of gulls squawked as they came in for landings to join the rest of the colony.

McEachron said he was “shocked and angered” when he visited the gull’s desert sanctuary next door and discovered that a woman had been feeding the birds.

“For the sake of our business and the surrounding neighborhood we’re asking people to stop feeding the birds” said McEachron who recently purchased a humane bird deterrent the Bird-B-Gone Bird Chase Super Sonic.

The programmable bird deterrent is used in commercial industrial and residential settings to deter birds from large open spaces by emitting the distress and predator calls of over 22 types of birds the company said.

“Even with the machine the seagulls still come and go” said McEachron one of several longtime High Desert residents who said they have noticed an increase in the number of gulls.

Tom Matthews 72 who lives in Apple Valley said he's spotted one or two gulls over the last 30 years — “nothing like what I've recently seen.”

“Last month I saw hundreds of seagulls in the field over between Target and Jess Ranch” Matthews said.

In February Matthews and his wife Margie had just gotten out of their Toyota pick-up truck in the Target parking lot when he said they were targeted by the birds.

“When we got there we saw a group of seagulls near an empty parking space” Matthews said. “The birds scattered when we parked there. Before we got out we started chatting about our shopping list and boom! Our windshield gets hit with bird poop.”

In Apple Valley gull colonies have also been spotted at both Stater Bros. supermarkets. Elsewhere in the High Desert residents have seen them in the new Kaiser Permanente Hesperia Medical Office and near the Home Depot on Roy Rogers Drive in Victorville.

Security guard John Ford 40 shared his thoughts on the birds as he monitored the Victor Valley Town Center.

“I haven’t seen anything like this here in the High Desert” Ford said. “Why are they so far away from the beach and way out here Victorville? Something is not right.”

Ford said that years ago his grandmother told him that a large earthquake would one day strike California and sink a portion of the state into the Pacific Ocean.

“She said that after the earthquake the High Desert would have beachfront property. Maybe these birds are telling us something” Ford said jokingly.

Przeklasa said these particular California gulls are traveling across the High Desert to Mono Lake where they’ll form one of the largest rookeries in North America with a population of roughly 50000.

She said their breeding season begins in April at Mono Lake which is located near Yosemite National Park in Northern California.

The California Gulls breed on sparsely vegetated islands and levees in inland lakes and rivers.

Their habit is mainly marine areas including mudflats estuaries deltas and beaches but they are frequently seen in any open area where they can find food including garbage dumps scrublands pastures orchards meadows and farms.

Several waterways and meadows are located within 2 ½ miles of the gull field near McEachron’s storefront including the Mojave River and the lakes at Mojave Narrows Regional Park Spring Valley Lake and Victor Valley College.

During the winter the California gull mixes with other gull species and forages along the Pacific Coast.

California gulls are omnivores and will run fly and swim to find food. On breeding grounds they often run through swarms of flies with their bills open according to Przeklasa.

They are an opportunistic species too eating just about anything they can find including fish garbage grasshoppers mayflies brine shrimp earthworms small mammals bird eggs and carrion.

Everything has changed over the past year.

That includes the way people react to so many things.

Somehow even fresh air smells and even tastes a little fresher.

Somehow even the prospect of fast food seems less an expedient and more a warm inviting surprise.

Perhaps you won't have noticed then that your McDonald's your Chick-fil-A and your Burger King are costing a little more than they used to. Or in relative terms a lot more.

Restaurant Business Online quoting federal data reported that fast-food menu prices have gone up 6.2% during COVID-19times. That's more than double the increase at full-service restaurants. And some customers are certainly beginning to notice.

Delivery Delivers New Charges.



Now you might think that technology has something to do with this. Doesn't it always?

Many fast-food restaurants appear to have raised their prices because the demand has simply been far greater. When you're working on relatively thin margins and you feel you suddenly have a far more captive market of course you're going to take advantage.

Moreover hiring staff hasn't exactly been a picnic-level activity so wage costs are rising.

And then there's the sonorous brouhaha at McDonald's where the company is trying to change the way franchisees pay for all the fancy new technology -- such as smart menu boards -- that McDonald's is rapidly introducing. For quite a while the company and many of its franchisees weren't on speaking terms. Not even via WhatsApp.

Drifting through all of this though is the joy and menace of delivery. The minute apps came along you knew someone would want to be the Uber of food delivery. Uber for example.

The likes of Chick-fil-A and Popeyes already charge more for third-party deliveries. Sometimes in the double-digit percentages more. Well the delivery apps' exorbitant charges have crushed many restaurants with some cities even trying to limit how much UberEats DoorDash and friends can charge.

Restaurant Business Online mentions that a delivery order for a family can cost as much as a visit to a sit-down Mexican restaurant.

A couple of weeks ago my wife and I had friends come for a drink and ordered delivery from Domino's (we're great hosts). Two large pizzas three salads and a so-called taco cost $114.76. Including tip.

Welcome To A More Dynamic Future?



I though am most moved by the prospects for the future.

The revelation that prices have risen at McDonald's Chick-fil-A and the rest stimulated a robust debate about the whole restaurant industry.

The restaurant industry insiders at The Restaurant Manifesto perhaps looking enviously at what the fast-foodists have done offered this bleak view on Twitter: ""Pricing power will be a challenge going forward for the full-service end of the business. After a year in the hole many dine-in restaurants will not have the luxury of raising prices significantly to make up for lost revenue and to catch up on unpaid invoices.""

In stepped Nick Kokonas one of the most enterprising restaurant owners and creator of the reservation system Tock.

He wondered if the dynamism of fast food shouldn't exist across the whole of the restaurant world: ""Why can't they raise prices if demand returns as I expect it will when it is safe to return to public activities?""

So here's the tantalizing prospect for the future should you ever manage to go out to dinner again: Perhaps Fridays will be more expensive.

As Kokonas put it: ""I've seen that operators are afraid to experiment with pricing but customers are surprisingly adaptive *if* the food and experience are great. The real key is to move prices in two directions by day of week and time. Cheaper Tuesday. More on Saturday. Few do that. It works.""

The fancier restaurants might worry if they can do this. Some will surely try it. People may even get used to it and even understand it.

But I'd like to take the idea a little further. What if your experience at McDonald's Wendy's et al becomes more of a dynamically priced affair too?

What if the Big Mac you eat after you've been clubbing on Saturday night costs a dollar or two more than the one you had for lunch on Thursday? Would you even notice? There seems no real sign that fast-food customers have noticed their Big Macs and chicken sandwiches might be more expensive currently. There aren't sufficient signs of mass rebellion certainly.

And technology has reached the point where McDonald's is testing robots taking orders at drive-thrus in Chicago. So why wouldn't every McDonald's restaurant be able to change pricing instantly -- even car-by-car at the drive-thru?

The real worth of a meal is the value you place on it at any given moment. Sometimes you're so desperate for a particular meal -- a McFlurry comes to mind -- that you really would pay more for it.

As McDonald's Burger King -- and most recently Taco Bell -- invest in tech companies that suck up and serve up data with enormous detail and equally enormous potential effect why wouldn't they even offer different prices to individual customers?

Oh that might cause a fight or two right?"

Despite a slight dip in net income the company maintains a strong balance sheet with increased EBITDAre.

Recent acquisitions signal a forward-looking growth strategy amidst a challenging economic landscape.

On May 3 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) a premier owner of luxury and upper-upscale hotels reported its first-quarter financial results through the 10-Q filing. The company's portfolio predominantly located in the United States consists of 77 properties with a strong presence under the Marriott and Starwood brands.

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management. However the company must address the decline in net income manage its brand partner dependencies and

Additional detail on the Company’s results including data for 22 domestic markets is available in the First Quarter 2024 Supplemental Financial Information on the Company’s website at www.hosthotels.com.



James F. Risoleo President and Chief Executive Officer said “Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023 which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition we delivered net income of $272 million a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2% as a result of tough comparisons the impact of Maui and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.”

Risoleo continued “Subsequent to quarter end we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

(1) NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel revenues are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally comparable hotel results and statistics include adjustments for dispositions acquisitions and non-comparable hotels. See Hotel Operating Data for RevPAR results of the portfolio based on the Company's ownership period without these adjustments.

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

BALANCE SHEET

The Company maintains a robust balance sheet and completed several transactions in March and April of 2024. These transactions include:

Net draws of $215 million on the revolving credit facility (including a $300 million draw in March as well as a $65 million draw and $150 million repayment subsequent to quarter end).

The following are the results for transient group and contract business in comparison to 2023 performance for the Company's current portfolio:

Quarter ended March 31 2024 Transient Group Contract Room nights (in thousands) 1314 1103 172 Percent change in room nights vs. same period in 2023 (1.9 %) 4.1 % 7.5 % Rooms revenues (in millions) $ 456 $ 324 $ 35 Percent change in revenues vs. same period in 2023 (4.7 %) 5.3 % 18.2 %

Under U.S. GAAP costs to develop units for resale are considered an operating activity on the statement of cash flows and categorized as inventory. This spend is separate from payments for capital expenditures which are considered investing activities.



Under the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program the Company received $2 million of the expected full year $9 million of operating guarantees in the first quarter of 2024 to offset business disruptions.

2024 OUTLOOK

The 2024 guidance range continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Comparable hotel Total RevPAR $352 to $359 2.7% to 4.6% 2.9% to 5.8% (60) bps Comparable hotel RevPAR $214 to $218 2.0% to 4.0% 2.5% to 5.5% (100) bps Total revenues under GAAP (in millions) $5650 to $5753 6.4% to 8.3% 5.2% to 8.1% 80 bps Operating profit margin under GAAP 15.4% to 16.1% (20) bps to 50 bps (40) bps to 70 bps (10) bps Comparable hotel EBITDA margin 29.3% to 29.8% (80) bps to (30) bps (120) bps to (40) bps 30 bps

Based upon the above parameters the Company estimates its 2024 guidance as follows:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Net income (in millions) $719 to $775 $708 to $794 $(4) Adjusted EBITDAre (in millions) $1640 to $1700 $1590 to $1680 $35 Diluted earnings per common share $1.00 to $1.08 $.99 to $1.11 $(0.01) NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share $1.97 to $2.05 $1.92 to $2.04 $0.03

_______________

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

For a discussion of items that may affect forecast results see the Notes to Financial Information.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

The acquisition price represents a 12.6x EBITDA multiple or a cap rate of approximately 7.4 percent on the property’s 2024 estimated results. Other terms were not disclosed.

The property is expected to be among Host’s top-25 assets based on estimated full year 2024 results with expected combined RevPAR of $275 total RevPAR of $435 and EBITDA per key of $585502 further improving the quality of the company’s portfolio.

“We are excited to add the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown to our portfolio and establish a presence in one of the country’s most exciting cities"" Host Hotels & Resorts President and CEO James Risoleo said in a statement. ""The newly built property has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had an impressive RevPAR CAGR of 7.7 percent from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply. A major leisure destination and the #2 ranked convention destination in the United States Nashville also has a recently expanded airport and a new stadium that is expected to attract more entertainment and sporting events. With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the Property will generate outsized growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders.”

The newly built LEED Silver property opened in 2022 and is located two blocks from numerous live music and entertainment venues in Nashville’s famed Lower Broadway entertainment district. The Property stands directly across from the Music City Convention Center adjacent to the Bridgestone arena home of the NHL Nashville Predators and within a 10-minute drive of Nissan Stadium the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum Vanderbilt University Tennessee State University and Centennial Park. The MCCC has continued to set record attendance numbers by attracting larger events and it has promising definite bookings in future years. The new Nissan Stadium home of the NFL Tennessee Titans is also expected to generate increased demand as the stadium’s dome will allow for year-round activation beginning with the 2027 season. In addition the Nashville International Airport is the fastest growing airport in the United States with current passenger traffic 33 percent above 2019. The recent $1.5 billion airport expansion added six international gates and eight satellite gates and another $1.5 billion expansion is already underway with completion expected in 2028.

The Property has a combined 721 oversized rooms that average approximately 500 square feet with a 75 percent suite mix. It offers seven separate food and beverage outlets including Harriet’s Rooftop which provides guests with exclusive views of Music City’s skyline in an elevated nightlife setting. Among other amenities the property has a Bamford Wellness spa with six treatment rooms two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space including a 9400 square foot ballroom and 9300 square feet of pre-function space.

Supply growth is expected to continue in Nashville with most projects in the planning stages and in the select service chain scale. Host believes the Property is differentiated from the future supply as a result of its central location and diversified product offerings that provide distinct value propositions to customers. The company expects the Property to stabilize between approximately 10-12x EBITDA3 in the 2026-2028 time frame."

HPQ,HP Inc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbGFidXNpbmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvYnVzaW5lc3MtcGVyc29uLXllYXItMjAyMS1hbGVjLWdvcmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Businessperson of the Year: Alec Gores Still Leads the SPAC Pack,"Four decades ago Alec Gores was selling computers out of his basement in Flint Mich. Today he is a titan of Los Angeles’ finance sector a billionaire and a pioneer in several paradigm-changing approaches to deal-making.



Gores is the founder of the eponymous Gores Group a major investment firm based in Beverly Hills. The company started in 1987 has been at the vanguard of private equity trends since its inception from carve-outs in its early days to special purpose acquisition companies — or SPACs — today.



Each step of the firm’s evolution has been informed by Gores’ personal experiences. Born to working-class immigrant parents the private equity mogul rose through the business world by studying the successes and the failures of those around him. He applied those lessons to his business putting his firm ahead of the curve for a number of major trends.



This forward-thinking approach was thrown into the limelight again last year amid the boom in SPAC deals. The vehicles accounted for a majority of the U.S. initial public offering or IPO market last year with 248 SPACs raising more than $83 billion according to SPACInsider.



Gores first used the approach in 2015 years before virtually any other major institutional investor. He has since become one of the biggest names in SPACs and is often credited with helping bring the investment approach into the mainstream.



Gores set the record for the biggest SPAC deal in history last fall when he merged his firm’s fifth SPAC with the nation’s largest wholesale mortgage lender at a $16 billion valuation. Despite the flood of SPAC deals that record held until last month.



After a string of successes Gores can now add the title of the Los Angeles Business Journal’s 2021 Businessperson of the Year to his long list of wins.



Despite a hectic week of deal-making — and running on only a few hours of sleep — Gores made time for a virtual sit-down with the Business Journal to discuss his career his approach to business and more.



To start can you tell us a bit about your early background? How did a degree in computer science in Michigan lead to a career in private equity?

We don’t come from any money. I was the oldest of six kids. I was the first to go to college of any generation (in my family). I started my first company right out of college in Flint Mich. I was selling mini-computers to small businesses. It was just me and no employees. This was 1978 when everyone was doing things manually.



That must have been a hard sell. Did you pick up any key lessons from that work?

Yes. Because I was selling (computers) to all these entrepreneurs I got to see how they ran their businesses. I got to learn from them because I was just a computer guy. I sold to maybe 300 businesses over that time. It was like going to school for free while selling computers.



And how did that transition into private equity?

I sold my first business Executive Business Systems when I was 33 for $2 million. I ended up using that money to buy a company that had some problems and cleaned it up and sold it.



So you went straight from running a computer business to private equity dealmaking?

I was an operator. I didn’t know how to do deals. I created this model where we would go in and fix up the operations at a company and then sell it. I was early on in private equity before everyone knew that it was private equity.



Did you have a particular approach or focus during that time?

I created this process of buying divisions from big companies — because there is a good chance that you are going to get screwed up being part of a big company. So I ended up doing carve-outs for the next 10 years.



Were there any big things you took away from that period in your career?

I got to see how people were messing up their companies. I got to see what people were doing wrong (and what not to do).



How did your firm start gaining traction? Were there any pivotal deals that helped establish Gores Group as a major player?

The two big ones that put us on the map were the Learning Co. (carve-out) from Mattel and VeriFone (Systems carve-out) from HP. Those were in the early 2000s.



I took all the lessons I had had previously from my business experience and applied it to those (companies). We took the Learning Co. from loss-making to profitable in like 75 days.



The Siemens (Enterprise Communications carve-out) was also big. Those successes brought in a lot more deals.



You started focusing on SPACs around 2015 — way before this current boom that we’re in now. What were your initial feelings about SPACs?

At first it took me some time to agree to go with this thing (SPACs). But once we landed on it I really loved it. I love it more than private equity.



It’s fun. Everything is fast. It’s my speed. I’m kind of ADD. The speed and velocity keeps you awake seven days a week.



Anything specific that appealed to you about the process?

You are partnering with companies you are partnering with investors partnering with entrepreneurs and you are all coming together to make this thing work. Also you get to write a big check alongside it.



For me personally I can talk to some 25-year-old entrepreneur that wants to go public and talk to him about the deals I did and things I learned when I was 25. That is the thing I love the most (about SPACs).



You’ve been very successful in the SPAC space closing the biggest SPAC deal in history last fall with United Wholesale Mortgage. Why has Gores Group’s SPAC business performed at such a high level?

It starts with the relationships you build with people. We have a lot of really strong relationships. Also because of our reputation we get a lot of inbound opportunities and can choose the best ones.



I had to build my own business and learn the hard way. I had to do the due diligence build the relationships do everything myself. I’m applying everything I ever learned to these deals from understanding entrepreneurs to the importance of transparency to doing the due diligence. Everything I’ve learned over 40 years I’m applying that. I call it the Gores way.



What are your thoughts on the current SPAC boom we are in? Do you think the market is oversaturated or about right for the level of demand?

I think there is saturation in the market but I don’t lose sleep over that. It actually creates more opportunities for us.



How does more competition create more opportunities for you?

It reminds me of my first business when I was selling computers. When I called businesses talking about computers they would almost hang up on you. I had to do so much education (about what computers were).



Nobody knew what a SPAC was when we started doing this. Now all these other SPAC guys help do the education for us. Once (a company) has the education once they get serious then we show up. I’ve got so many customers I win the business every time.



So it sounds like you’ve settled into an approach that works for your SPAC deals.

We’re not staying still. We’re always trying to think of ways to improve this product. Our playbook continues to evolve every day.



Do you have any thoughts on how Covid has played into the SPAC boom? The timing of the two coincided pretty closely.

I really couldn’t tell you. There were a couple of other big deals that happened around that time that probably helped. For me it’s been great — I’ve been able to do all of these deals right out of my home.



Do you think SPACs are going to continue to be your focus for the foreseeable future?

Yes right now there is so much business. We will be busy doing this for a long time. We’re not raising one or two SPACs. We are building a real franchise here.



Your brothers Tom and Sam are both big names in the local business community as well. Any thoughts on how you three all ended up having such a meteoric rise from Michigan to where you are today?

We are very blessed; we had great parents. They embedded in us honesty fairness and hard work. They taught us that you get what belongs to you but you also don’t take what doesn’t belong to you what you haven’t earned. They taught us how to make money the honest way.



A lot of us have had some pretty big life changes under Covid this last year. Has anything significant changed about your work or lifestyle since the lockdowns began?

I think I’ve learned efficiency. It’s so much more efficient to work from home. You can really avoid 80% of travel. Especially where I am in life I can really do everything through Zoom. I can use my reputation and all the relationships I have. If you’re young it’s different because you need to travel and make those relationships in person.



In some ways Covid has been a blessing because I get to spend more time with my family and my kids. It’s been a great excuse not to go anywhere. In the future I think we can avoid a lot of travel.



Stepping away from work do you have any hobbies or projects that you work on for fun?

No I don’t have that many hobbies. My work is my No. 1 hobby. I love what I do. I’ve golfed a little bit but the problem with golf is that I’ve worked my whole life and so I don’t have a lot of time to practice. So I’m not very good at it.



I don’t think I’m a workaholic though. I used to be a workaholic but now I do it because I enjoy it.



What about family life? Are you able to make time for your family with all that work?

I spend a lot of time with my family. I have six kids I have a wife (and) I have five grandkids. My youngest is a 20-month-old baby.



What do you usually do together? Do you have any favorite family activities?

We’re pretty simple. We like just getting together on Sundays for dinner. We watch a lot of sports — football basketball. We also have a house on Lake Michigan and we go there a lot. With the family that’s probably my favorite thing to do.



What about philanthropy? Are there any causes you give to or are passionate about that you would highlight?

There are quite a few but I don’t talk about it. I’m not someone that wants to put my name on a building. I give directly. I do it for one reason: to help not to get any credit.



What is your outlook for Los Angeles businesses in 2021?

First of all we need to get Covid over with. I’m hoping by the fall things can get back to somewhat normal.



I think once things get back to normal with Covid things will come back pretty fast because people will be hungry. They’ll be wanting to get back to eating out going to the movies.



The key thing is Covid though. I don’t know when this whole Covid thing is going to end.

Key Deals That Shaped Gores Group

Gores Group has been involved in many major deals since its founding more than three decades ago. These have ranged from carve-outs — the firm’s focus in its early years — to special purpose acquisition companies. Today SPACs are the core of Gore’s business. Here are three deals that played outsized roles in the firm’s development.

2000: The Learning Co.

The Learning Co.: One of Gores’ earliest major successes was its purchase of a struggling software business from Mattel Inc. The business had operational problems and was hemorrhaging $1.5 million daily according to Gores. His firm aggressively cut costs consolidated redundant units dropped unprofitable product lines and made the Learning Co. profitable in 75 days. Gores sold the company’s entertainment division to French video game developer Ubisoft Entertainment in 2001. Later that year it sold Learning Co.’s education assets and name rights to Irish education technology company Riverdeep Interactive Learning today part of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Co.

2001: VeriFone Inc.

VeriFone Inc.: Gores acquired the Santa Clara-based electronic payments company from computing giant Hewlett-Packard Co. (today HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise). Hewlett-Packard had bought the company in 1997 for about $1.2 billion but shed the asset only four years later due to a worse-than-expected performance. Gores Group turned VeriFone around in less than a year helping it reach $350 million in annual revenue with strong profitability according to Gores. The firm sold VeriFone to Chicago-based private equity firm GTCR in 2002.

2015: Hostess Brands Inc.

Hostess Brands Inc.: Gores’ transition to SPACs began with this deal. The firm raised $375 million in a public offering for its first SPAC Gores Holdings and used that capital to purchase the iconic company in a $2.3 billion deal. Although that figure has since been dwarfed by Gores’ other record-setting SPACs the size of the transaction and Hostess’ high profile helped put Gores on the map as one of the first major institutional SPAC investors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9yYXV0aG9yaXR5LmNvbS9uZXdzLzExMzE0NzRfMjAyMS1yYW0tMTUwMC10cngtc3RyYXBwZWQtdG8tZHluby1wdXRzLW91dC01ODMtaHAtYXQtdGhlLXJlYXItd2hlZWxz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Ram 1500 TRX strapped to dyno puts out 583 hp at the rear wheels,"The 2021 Ram 1500 TRX boasts a factory-quoted 702 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque but that's as measured at the crank not the wheels. Hennessey Performance Engineering tried to measure how much power the TRX makes at the wheels by strapping one to a dyno but only ran numbers for the rear wheels.

The dyno test showed 538 hp and 570 lb-ft of torque at the rear wheels. That represents around 17% driveline loss which isn't unusal for a pickup truck. Hennessey previously recorded 20% driveline loss at the rear wheels when it tested a 2019 Ford F-150 Raptor.

The TRX is full-time four-wheel drive so you might be wondering how Hennessey got dyno results for the rear wheels only. Company founder John Hennessey told Motor Authority that four-wheel drive was temporarily disabled by disconnecting the front driveshaft.

2021 Hennessey Mammoth 1000 1500 TRX

While the TRX was designed for off-roading the amount of power produced by its 6.2-liter supercharged Hellcat V-8 makes this truck pretty quick on pavement. Ram says it will do 0-60 mph in 4.5 seconds.

Inevitably that wasn't enough for Hennessey. The company has developed more powerful versions of every Hellcat-powered vehicle and it's doing the same with the TRX. Dubbed the Mammoth 1000 Hennessey claims its take on the TRX will boast 1000 hp will do 0-60 mph in 3.2 seconds and run the quarter mile in 11.4 seconds.

To achieve those numbers Hennessey plans to equip the Mammoth 1000 with an upgraded supercharger pulley and air intake stainless-steel headers high-flow exhaust piping (retaining the catalytic converter) and new engine mapping. The price for the complete truck is $135350 and Hennessey only plans to build 200 this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9ydHJlbmQuY29tL2hvdy10by9mb3JkLWNoZXZ5LWNocnlzbGVyLWNyYXRlLWVuZ2luZXMtb3Zlci01MDAtaHAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford vs Chevy vs Mopar: Who's Got the Baddest-Ass Crate Engines?,"As a subculture hot rodding is in danger but it's not from what you may think. Over the last 15 years—starting with the 505-hp LS7 small-block found in the Corvette Z06—the general public has been exposed to more than a few over-500-hp factory engines that are clean high-tech and well mannered. The alphabet soup of factory-offered domestics that broke the glass ceiling of supercar-level performance is astounding and includes the Z06 and ZR1 Corvette (C6 C7 and upcoming C8) Chevy Camaro ZL1 Ford Mustang GT350 and GT500 Shelby Cobra and Dodge Hellcat Demon Super Stock and Redeye—and we haven't even touched on trucks and SUVs. With so many powerful cars available a 500-plus-hp crate engine for an older car may sound like a smallish choice. More on that in a second but first let's look at the alternatives.

The Argument Against a Crate Engine Project

Factory power levels over 500 hp are now so common that even the once ballyhooed 707-hp Hellcat no longer gets regular coverage from big media because well there are just so many more powerful cars out there. Despite the OE muscle car power play or perhaps because of it the general public doesn't understand that making well over 500 hp with a vintage V-8 remains quite hard. By most yardsticks the cost of building a 600-hp crate engine—including all the ancillary needs such as fuel supply ignition cooling and machine shop bill (but not any upgraded driveline parts like transmissions or rearends)—sits at around $10K.

When considering whether to build a truly powerful engine (for our arbitrary purposes here that's 600 hp) or going with an already-built crate engine one must also consider whether it would be a better value to just buy a used ZL1 or Hellcat for the going price of $45K. Yet for some gearheads the ubiquity of such a car can leave a saccharin taste long after the sweet burnout smoke has cleared.

500-Plus-HP Crate Engine Options

So you've decided that a crate engine well over 500 hp pushes your hot button because you don't want the same thing as everybody else but your engine building skills don't quite cut the mustard. Maybe you're a great general mechanic or specialize in fabrication but don't need the hassle or the drain on your limited shop space to stock it full of engine-building stuff. A well-chosen 500-plus-hp crate engine that can hang with Detroit's new iron is going to be your go-to option but cost is still all-important. If that's you then you've come to the right place!

Brand Loyalty: Chevy Ford or Mopar?

Based on cost alone the LS or big-block Chevy will have the advantage on price. That said we discovered that Ford and Mopar options don't carry the huge ""tax"" you might think but these can still fetch 10 to 20 percent more. Block for block crank for crank piston for piston Ford and Mopar parts aren't especially expensive relative to Chevy—in fact sometimes they can be the same. The added cost is more a function of a lack of institutional knowledge that incentivizes fewer experts to then charge more. Moreover large bulk rebuilders like Blueprint and ATK don't see enough demand to build the higher-hp Ford or Mopar crate engines relinquishing the trade to specialty builders like Prestige (Ford) Muscle Motors (Mopar) Jon Kaase Racing (Ford) and Indy Cylinder Head (Mopar) to name a few. (If nothing else this story should highlight an unfulfilled opportunity for perhaps other large rebuilders.)

For the hot rodder who won't settle for the indignity of dropping a Chevy LS into a Mustang or a BBC into a Road Runner the important thing to remember is that there are engine builders who can deliver cost-effective crate engines that have the right brand on the valve cover—it just requires looking a little harder in the rarefied atmosphere of crate engines in the over-500-hp category. We found some lesser-known specialty builders filling the need for high-powered non-Chevy crate engines and they are deserving of the spotlight. First however let's look at a couple of popular 500+hp Chevy crate engines to establish the cost baseline.

Team Chevy: 620-HP ATK 415ci LS Small-Block Chevy Asking Price $8998.99

It should come as no surprise that the Chevy Gen IV LS provides the most horsepower per cubic inch of our group of engines at these higher power levels. ATK's high volume and buying power allows the company to offer a 620-hp naturally aspirated LS3-based stroker engine in long-block form at the nearly unheard-of price of $8998.99. We found ATK's LS02 (using a GM LS3 block) for sale at this price at Eastwood and it includes such beefcake as Manley forged pistons rods and crankshaft. These robust rotating components are complimented by a stout hydraulic roller cam with 240-/256-degrees duration (at .050-inch lift) and .625-inch valve lift—enough to push the output (with your carb or EFI) to the 620-hp mark. Note that you'll still need to provide an intake manifold (Edelbrock Victor Jr. part No. 350-28457 shown) and carburetion (Quick Fuel 850cfm shown) or EFI.

Team Chevy: 600-HP BluePrint Engines 496ci Big-Block Chevy Asking Price $8799

People have been preaching the demise of the big-block Chevy for years and to that end it was last produced by the factory in Gen-VI form until around 2001. In 20 years however it has lost none of its luster in performance circles. In fact some rebuilders have doubled down by casting their own big-block Chevy cylinder cases including BluePrint. That means the company can now build any kind of BBC crate engine in whatever configuration it wants brand new in whatever numbers it sees fit and without being capacity constrained by the supply of OE engine blocks. BluePrint's 496-inch behemoth includes a forged stroker kit (oddly with hypereutectic pistons) aluminum heads hydraulic roller cam (242-/248-degrees at .050-inch lift .566-inch lift) single-plane intake and Holley double-pumper—it even comes with an individualized dyno sheet. Shipping is free with no core charge and a 30-month 50000-mile warranty is included. We found the best deal here at Summit Racing.

Team Ford: Ford Performance Parts 655-HP Big-Block Asking Price $15885.99

By contrast if you need big Ford power for your ride you'll pay a premium. That said few BBFs (big-block Fords) look better than Ford Performance Parts 572ci big-block crate engine with 655 hp. This one has all the good stuff: forged rotating assembly with 10:1 compression aluminum Super Cobra Jet heads street-friendly hydraulic roller cam (259-/263-degrees duration at .050-inch lift .649-inch valve lift) Edelbrock Victor single-plane intake and Holley Street Avenger 870cfm carb.

It's our view that the crate engine aftermarket has generally not taken advantage of the stock Ford 460 block's internal real estate or the availability of better freer-flowing cylinder heads. It's easily argued that it's cheaper to DIY build a big-inch big-power Ford from scratch using a JKRE P-51 cylinder head (or to a lesser degree Trick Flow's PowerPort 325) and we've long wondered why no rebuilder (or even Ford) has stepped up to the task. Notwithstanding Ford Performance Parts' M-6007-572DF 572ci big-block crate engine sits at the head of the Ford table when it comes to big-block Ford crate engines and the overkill of its M-6010-A460 block. We found the best deal at Summit Racing.

Team Ford: Prestige Motorsports 600-HP Ford Windsor 427ci Small-Block Asking Price $11399

Taking a small-block Ford into the 500-plus-hp crate engine arena isn't for the faint of heart—a lot of critical insider tricks are needed to build a cost-effective 600-hp 351-based Windsor crate engine with the kind of mechanical elegance Prestige Motorsports has (shown on the company's eBay storefront here). As Prestige succinctly puts it ""This 427ci Windsor is a small-block that acts like a big-block"" and to make that happen you need a pile of high-quality components including a Dart SHP block forged stroker rotating assembly AFR CNC-ported heads solid-roller cam (specs proprietary) Edelbrock Super Victor intake QFT 750cfm carb and importantly the guiding hands of qualified assemblers and dyno technicians.

Called the Super Street package this combo handily breaks the 500-hp barrier by something like a gazillion hp. Dyno testing provided by Prestige shows 625 peak hp with the 500-hp mark blowing by at a lowly 4800 rpm. Regarding the difference in price between the two versions found at different places the 427ci Super Street Windsor is available with an attractive and functional accessory drive system from Billet Specialties at the $17299 eBay store price. (Prestige also sells complete driveline packages that include crate engines with transmissions.) When you need big power from a Ford in the smallest footprint possible a stroker Windsor this is the way to go.

Team Mopar: Indy Cylinder Head 500ciBig-Block Moparwith 600 HP Asking Price $10550

In the performance aftermarket there are few companies that assemble truly powerful Chrysler V-8s and of those none manufacture as many parts in-house as Indy Cylinder Head. In our Mopar spotlight today is Indy's part No. 400-C6-500-605 big-block wedge crate engine. Of note for fans of big-block Chrysler power is the fact that the big-block B/RB engine architecture allows lots of room for stroker cranks almost too much room if you ask airflow experts. This is manifested in the type's not-so-strange tendency to make gobs of torque but not so much top-end power—at least when stock-style cylinder heads are used.

Because Indy's forte is high-flowing Chrysler cylinder heads based on the Max Wedge footprint it gives them a huge leg up on building Chrysler crate engines with pleasantly high levels of power. Specs on Indy's low-deck street wedge big-block (400 deck height) show big potential with prepped 440-EZ-1 cylinder heads forged 10:1 compression Diamond pistons forged stroker internals from Eagle solid-lifter cam (.590-inch lift 247 degrees duration at .050-inch lift) single-plane Indy intake MSD ignition and 850cfm Holley carb. All this puts out a dyno-verified 600 hp on a diet of 91-octane pump gas. At a price scarcely above $10K this Indy crate engine makes a solid run at the Chevy boys. The best part: You can afford a wicked big-block with big hairy balls that's not a Chevy.

Team Mopar: Muscle Motors 422ci Small-Block Chrysler with 675 HP Asking Price $14995

To lump Muscle Motors into the same group with a bulk rebuilder might sound scandalous until you realize how few companies are building complete out-the-door Chrysler-centric crate engines in the over-500-hp ranks. A naturally aspirated small-block of any kind making close to 700 hp sounds miraculous but doing it with an LA-series small-block Chrysler is well the kind of thing Mopar guys live for. Though pricey at nearly $15K through Muscle Motors eBay store here this one-off 500-plus hp crate engine has ""no expense spared and all tricks are included.""

We know those guys and they aren't kidding: This ready-to-run crate starts with a seasoned 340 LA-series block to which Muscle Motors has added a Callies forged stroker crank and rods Diamond forged 11:1 compression pistons custom COMP solid-roller cam (.650-inch valve lift 265 degrees duration at .050-inch lift) Indy 360-1 CNC-ported heads Indy 360-1 single-plane intake QFT 830cfm carb and MSD ignition. The asking price near $15K is a lot of cake but when you've got to have something nearing the 700-hp mark in a package the size and shape of a small-block Mopar there are few better choices than this.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL2Jpei9hcmNoaXZlcy8yMDIxLzAzLzA2LzIwMDM3NTMzMDjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Largan settles IP suit against Ability,"Largan settles IP suit against Ability

By Angelica Oung / Staff reporter





Largan Precision Co (大立光) the nation’s biggest supplier of camera lenses has settled a lengthy litigation battle with smaller rival Ability Opto-Electronics Technology Co (先進光電) according to statements that the companies filed with the Taiwanese Stock Exchange yesterday.

“We have signed a confidential settlement agreement” Largan said in its statement. “Per the agreement we will withdraw all litigation against Ability.”

Details of the settlement are not to be disclosed to protect the privacy of individuals involved the Taichung-based firm added.

Largan Precision Co CEO Adam Lin is pictured on Jan. 10 last year. Photo: CNA

In 2012 and 2013 Largan sued Ability for allegedly stealing trade secrets.

In 2017 the Intellectual Property Court ruled in Largan’s favor ordering Ability to pay NT$1.52 billion (US$53.76 million at the current exchange rate) in compensation.

The court’s ruling was upheld on Jan. 28.

Largan hotly pursued the litigation even requesting the court for the provisional seizure of Ability property on Tuesday last week.

In 2013 Chinese-language magazine Business reported that Largan saw defending its “more than 500” pieces of intellectual property as key to maintaining its position as No. 1 in Taiwan’s opto-electronics market.

Four engineers left Largan for positions at Ability and started filing patents related to production automation that Largan alleged infringed on its intellectual property leading to the lawsuit.

Over the years Largan has also sued Samsung Electronics Co Newmax Technology Co (新鉅科) and HP Inc for patent infringement. Largan settled out of court with all parties except for HP.

News of the settlement caused the price of Ability shares to jump 10 percent the maximum daily increase to NT$42.15.

The price of Largan shares initially dipped NT$65 before recovering and ending the trading day at NT$3360 slightly lower than the opening price of NT$3375.

Separately Largan yesterday posted consolidated revenue of NT$3.21 billion for last month down 12.44 percent from NT$3.67 billion in February last year.

That represented a monthly decline of 30 percent from NT$4.61 billion in January as the Lunar New Year holiday reduced the number of working days.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvYnJhYnVzLTQ0NC1ocC1tZXJjZWRlcy1hbWctYS00NS1zLWlzLWEtanVpY3ktaG90LWhhdGNoLWZsZXhpbmctbW9ub2Jsb2NrLXdoZWVscy0xNTcyNTMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brabus' 444 HP Mercedes-AMG A 45 S Is a Juicy Hot Hatch Flexing Monoblock Wheels,"Sure enough Stuttgart’s automaker did hit that sweet spot with the A 45 S but Brabus’ B45 is where the real party’s at!

Since the company’s foundation back in 1977 the German aftermarket architects over at Brabus never ceased to amaze the automotive realm with their graceful wizardry. The sheer level of refinement that’s gone into making each and every exploit come to life is truly outstanding so it’s no wonder this ambitious enterprise rose to the very top of Europe’s tuning food chain.If you ask me these folks are the real MVPs when it comes to honoring your four-wheeled companion with a generous dose of custom magic. As time went by we visited the firm’s inventory on several occasions to admire a few of the tastiest machines bred on their premises. Among these entities you’ll run into a Mercedes- G 63 that keeps things looking sinister and the “ Rocket 900 ” - a reworked GT 63 S with no less than 888 wicked ponies on tap.This time around we’ll be having a closer look at Brabus’ accomplishments on the Three-Pointed Star’s beloved hot hatch the A 45 S. In stock form the car’s 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four powerplant will be more than happy to supply as much as 415 hp at about 6750 rpm. On the other hand a vicious torque output of up to 369 pound-feet (500 Nm) will be achieved at 5000 revs.The M139 engine’s untamed force is distributed to a 4Matic all-wheel-drive system by means of an eight-speed AMG SpeedShift transmission. Ultimately this state of affairs enables Daimler’s hatchback to accelerate 0-62 mph (0-100 kph) in just 3.9 seconds while top speed is electronically governed at 168 mph (270 kph). Without going into any other technical details it’s fairly safe to conclude that Stuttgart’s A 45 S means business alright?Sure enough this sexy beast is a genuine showstopper straight off the production line and it doesn’t exactly need any sort of aftermarket enhancements to be outstanding. However this didn’t prevent the Brabus crew from casting their spells on the Merc to take things to an entirely new level. Let’s take a minute to examine what’s at hand here shall we?As you’d expect the original badge is gone in favor of the company’s very own unmistakable counterpart. In typical Brabus fashion the fresh item is joined by a pair of red stripes on the front grille while the vehicle's rear fascia received an assortment of classy emblems to round it all out. To be quite frank this is discrete customization done right!When you step inside the cabin you will stumble upon a few minor tweaks complementing those found on the exterior such as fresh aluminum pedals velour floor mats bearing the tuner’s logo and tasteful leather upholstery to name a few. Oh and would you just look at those illuminated scuff plates?The whole structure rides on 20-inch Monoblock Z wheels from Brabus’ own range enveloped in gloss black paintwork. Ground clearance has been reduced by 1.2 inches (30 mm) thanks to a set of adjustable coilover springs that’ll handle suspension duties without breaking a sweat.Last but not least the team fiddled with the turbocharged inline-four mill to extract a modest power output bump. As such the leviathan will now produce 444 hp and 406 pound-feet (550 Nm) of twist at optimal revs allowing the A 45 S to reach 62 mph (100 kph) from a dead stop in a mere 3.7 seconds. The “ B45 ” package as Brabus calls it is priced at an eye-watering €89131 ($106205 as per current exchange rates)."

The nuclear submarine has been under construction in Newport News Virginia for about five years and the ship isn’t expected to be commissioned into the Navy until early 2022.

According to Huntington Ingalls the USS Montana — currently known as SSN 794 — is about 92% complete.

The Virginia class nuclear-powered fast-attack sub is the first submarine in the U.S. Navy to ever bear the Montana name. The only other Navy ship christened “Montana” was an armored cruiser commissioned in 1908.

A replica of the original bell from the first USS Montana will be presented to the current crew when the submarine is commissioned and some Montanans will get the chance to see the bell up close when the USS Montana Committee travels across the state this year giving presentations about the ship and its mission.

THE TEAM behind the USS Montana had been steadily building toward the submarine’s launch into the James River since 2015. According to Huntington Ingalls it took 10000 shipbuilders and suppliers from all 50 states to build the Montana.

It’s certainly no small feat since the 7800-ton state-of-the-art nuclear vessel is expected to sail the seas for approximately 30 years.

“For our shipbuilders launching Montana signifies five years of hard work commitment and dedicated service” said Jason Ward Newport News’ vice president of Virginia-class submarine construction. “We look forward to executing our waterborne test program and working toward sea trials and delivering the submarine to the Navy.”

Footage of the launch is available on Huntington Ingalls’ website at https://newsroom.huntingtoningalls.com/releases/montana-ssn-794-launched.

ALTHOUGH THE submarine itself will never make it to Big Sky Country there’s been a concerted effort to connect the ship’s crew with local supporters.

Under the guidance of Bigfork resident Bill Whitsitt the USS Montana Committee has organized support for the ship such as a state historical display that will be set up on board.

Capt. Michael Delaney and various crew members including a few who call Montana home have gone on multiple visits throughout the state.

“Our exceptional young sailors want all Montanans to know that in their training and the fulfilling of their operational responsibilities they are energized by the support they feel from Big Sky Country” Delaney said. “The same will be true when they are eventually deployed aboard the USS MONTANA in defense of our nation.”

“We’re all committed to making Montana proud as we work toward taking the state’s namesake warship to sea for the first time later this year” Delaney added.

The country’s National Science Foundation predicts that 80 percent of jobs in the next decade will require STEM skills and IBM estimates that STEM careers will offer 24 percent higher pay and longevity in the future.

What a great opportunity or so it would seem. In reality women make up about 50% of STEM graduates but only 34% of the workforce in India’s information technology industry highlighting a gap between women’s education and careers.

A recent study by IBM STEM for Girls and Quest Alliance found that most young educated girls in India have high aspirations to get into STEM careers like medicine engineering agriculture and scientific research. However converting their aspirations into actual career pathways poses a challenge due to societal stereotypes and family pressure (23%) lack of organizational support (19%) and the difference in abilities (10%).

As the leaders of STEM for Girls we find ourselves thinking about how we can empower our girls in India for the careers of the future – especially today on International Women’s Day. More opportunity for our girls is not just good for India but also for the world. An estimated 18 million Indians are living (and working) abroad making India the largest diaspora in the world.

STEM for Girls is an initiative launched in India by IBM in 2019 to improve education and career pathways for girls in government high schools. Our vision is to prepare over 200000 high school girls here in India across multiple states through a 3-year program to pursue and understand their potential in STEM careers.

IBM has joined forces with partners Quest Alliance and American Indian Foundation Trust to take this program to government schools in select cities. In the last two years IBM has reached over 140000 students through 1200 schools.

The STEM mindset: Empowering our girls

Through this experience we’ve seen the emergence of a vital mindset necessary for success. STEM subjects are often inter-linked and need to be learnt holistically. The curriculums of mainstream educational organizations are yet to incorporate professional skills training as a priority and often teach subjects in a siloed manner. It results in a significant skills gap among the youth which can be addressed by cultivating a STEM mindset among students.

A STEM mindset has its roots in scientific temperament marked by a nuanced understanding of the subjects and their application in everyday life. It’s a mindset that drives students to become change makers steering social development. Cultivating a STEM mindset is about becoming critical thinkers problem solvers experimenting and challenging the status quo using technology as a tool.

It’s important that a STEM mindset is instilled among students especially girls at a very early stage in the education system to dispel biases. There’s a strong need for cultivating STEM skills and mindset among girls to ensure gender parity.

Enabling success with STEM

An exploration of the current education system shows that life skills like problem solving critical thinking and entrepreneurship could be better incorporated in school curriculums – by offering practical hands-on work to develop conceptual understanding and problem-solving approaches rather than blindly following trends like coding languages.

The industry also needs to support and enable this change by acknowledging the need for a STEM mindset and collaborating with academia to develop skills-based curriculum and experiential learning based courses.

Through our partnerships with Quest Alliance and American Indian Foundation Trust we seek to do just that. STEM for Girls offers agency building life skills career counseling and mentoring to instill the value of lifelong learning and expand opportunities for workplace success.

We have seen girls amplify their understanding and start to develop necessary negotiating skills which will be useful in advocating for themselves. We have seen these amazing students dream big and grow their skills for the jobs of tomorrow. There is much more work ahead but by fomenting a STEM mindset and expanding possibility we hope to shape the education and careers of women by starting with our girls.

A crowdsourced collection of slang and cultural phrases the Urban Dictionary did its job a little too well. Soon Watson was swearing up a storm and had to be restored to its previous unhip state.

IBM’s experience was hardly an isolated incident. As natural language processing has advanced toxic output has become a growing problem for pre-trained language generation models. This led a team of computational linguists at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) and the University of Washington to want to better understand the problem.

The result of their work “RealToxicityPrompts: Evaluating Neural Toxic Degeneration in Language Models” was recently published in Findings of EMNLP 2020 and highlights several issues with language generation obscenity and bias. This problem with toxicity arises in part because of how predictive language models are produced using enormous sets of human-generated text as their training data. Combined with deep learning techniques this allows them to complete sentence fragments based on pre-existing content. An example of this might be an initial phrase such as “So I’m starting to think he’s full …” Several pre-trained language models will regularly generate toxic text when completing that sentence.

As one of the researchers Suchin Gururangan explains “There’ve been a lot of people anecdotally identifying problems saying things like this autocomplete application or that API can generate a lot of hateful things whether it be racist or sexist or what have you. We realized there wasn’t a systematic way to evaluate how much toxicity a particular model should be expected to have when you deploy it.”

To address this problem the team created an evaluation framework and testbed for measuring toxicity in language generation systems. They began by establishing a baseline measuring the degree and frequency of toxicity produced without prompts for a given number of generations in a pre-trained language model. They then compiled a dataset of 100000 naturally occurring prompts from the Open WebText Corpus a large collection of Reddit text which attempts to reproduce the dataset used to train OpenAI’s GPT-2.

Using Google’s Perspective API toxicity scores were generated that measured how much toxic degeneration each of the studied language models produced. Different detoxification methods were then tested and while some were found more effective at reducing toxicity none of them could completely eliminate it.

“We’re not just looking at individual swear words and trying to see if the model outputs that” said researcher Maarten Sap. “It’s a machine learning algorithm that takes in the whole sentence and predicts the toxicity score.” To demonstrate the concept the researchers created several interactive visualization tools which are available on AI2’s web site.

The development of large-scale language models that use deep learning to generate human-like text like CTRL and GPT-3 is progressing rapidly. In fact these systems are becoming so good that for certain applications it’s very difficult to discern that it’s machine-generated text. These models are already being tapped to build new tools or improve existing ones like auto-complete and help systems. Without better understanding and controlling the output however this is likely to create as many problems as it solves.

We’re not just looking at individual swear words and trying to see if the model outputs that. It’s a machine learning algorithm that takes in the whole sentence and predicts the toxicity score.

Because it’s currently not feasible to create enough training data from scratch the needed datasets have mostly been generated from existing bodies of web-based text. Even when filtered for specific offensive words and phrases “non-negligible” amounts of biased and otherwise toxic language are routinely produced by these systems hindering their safe deployment.

“No detoxification methods are foolproof” noted Samuel Gehman one of the study’s authors. “Ultimately we find that all models are able to generate toxicity under our framework.”

To this point the study found a strong correlation between the toxicity of the training data and the output of the model itself. Perhaps it’s not surprising then that certain models even generated some of the more vitriolic language of our recent highly divisive political season.

Computers don’t yet understand the language they’re processing which is a big part of the dilemma. Because they’re using predictive methods based on a large collection of existing text — also known as a corpus — all kinds of toxic language and views can be unintentionally generated. While the corpus and model used play a big role in just how much toxicity is outputted the complex and subtle nature of language makes preventing such toxic degeneration especially challenging.

This is concerning given that natural language generation models like GPT-3 are starting to be used to develop a wide array of services and products. While the resulting tools and ecosystem could have huge potential for business it’s easy to see how toxic degeneration could easily lead to public relations nightmares.

The problem goes beyond word filters and using machine learning to train systems to know what to steer away from. Toxicity and bias can be subjective in nature and what is offensive to one person or group may be acceptable or innocuous to another. Additionally according to the authors various methods for controlling the text output can render it incoherent or instill other forms of unintended bias.

“A very small amount of toxicity in the training data can have a very large effect on the model’s behavior” said Gururangan. “Right now a lot of decisions are being made by small groups of people who are designing these models and they’re interacting with millions of people and they could have harmful effects. So we need to figure out how to make this process more democratic and include more people.” But while this an important objective the scale of the data needed combined with the subjective nature of language would make certain solutions like having committees audit the training datasets beforehand a huge challenge.

Nevertheless looking ahead the team behind RealToxicityPrompts believe their tools could help establish standards that would ultimately improve how future datasets and models are validated and trained helping to steer them away from generating offensive and biased language. That’s important because given the many ways these language models will soon be used in business and other settings — from help desks to automated attendants to digital assistants — we need to ensure that natural language generation improves our communications rather than hindering them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbG9yYWRvLmVkdS9lbmdpbmVlcmluZy9ub2RlLzUxMjPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Choose to Challenge: Hope Michelsen | College of Engineering & Applied Science,"Professor Hope Michelsen joined the CU Boulder faculty just over a year and a half ago. She is an associate professor in the Paul M. Rady Department of Mechanical Engineering. Her research focuses on soot from flames and atmosphere and their effect on the environment.

She became passionate about this research in an unconventional way. While at Sandia National Laboratories they told her that the only way she could have a lab was if she studied soot research many others had dismissed.

“There have been many times that I have had a plan and hit a roadblock"" she said. ""Each time that’s happened I have taken whatever opportunity was available and it’s almost always worked out to be better than my original plan!”

Highlights Earned degrees from Dartmouth College and Stanford University

Experiences at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory Sandia National Labs and IBM

Associate professor in mechanical engineering and environmental engineering

Research focuses on soot and its effects on environment

Encourages others to “imagine difficult people as characters in a sitcom” to cope with challenging situations

Prior to Sandia when she was a postdoctoral researcher she received a National Science Foundation fellowship to work at Harvard University. When she arrived at Harvard however her postdoctoral advisor told her that he could not support her to do research and suggested that she spend her postdoc reading papers. She switched groups and instead focused her time on modeling on atmospheric chemistry with an added bonus of working with great scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

There weren’t always roadblocks. When reflecting on the people who made a difference in her path to engineering she immediately mentioned her academic advisor. She was one of the few women in her undergraduate engineering program at the time and her advisor encouraged her to sign up for a machine shop class. The course was empowering and was her first step into engineering.

After graduation she had experience working at Sandia and IBM where she was again in a minority of women at the company. Throughout her time at the companies she found support from her managers. This support has motivated her today as an educator who will encourage her students. She is involved with diversity equity and inclusion efforts at CU where she hopes to bring a more creative and healthier environment for the university.

A perspective that she wishes she had when entering STEM is “the world has a cultural perspective of you; when you don’t conform to expected roles it’s uncomfortable for some people and they may respond negatively.” She advises those in this situation to “imagine themselves in a sitcom. ... If you can laugh about it in any way it makes you feel so much better.”

She says her favorite sitcom is Big Bang Theory with her favorite character being Amy Farrah Fowler.

In addition to her research she enjoys practicing yoga and hiking with her husband and two dogs Rishi and Moksha.

Marks interviewed mathematician and computer scientist Gregory Chaitin. Yesterday we noted his comments on the almost supernatural awareness that the great mathematicians had of the foundations of reality in the mathematics of our universe. This time out Chaitin recounts how he (almost) met the eccentric genius Kurt Gödel (1906–1978):

This portion begins at 12:42 min. A partial transcript Show Notes and Additional Resources follow.

Robert J. Marks: You mentioned that you read the article about Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem in Scientific American I also know that you had a near brush with Gödel and I’ve heard the story from you. But I’ve never seen it published. I wonder if you could share that.

Gregory Chaitin (pictured): I think the story is somewhere maybe in a paper based on a lecture. Well I had been in Argentina for a number of years and IBM sent me to the US. In the early 1970s I was invited to be a summer visitor at the IBM Watson Research Center. I was living in the YMCA in White Plains. I had the proofs of one of my first papers on incompleteness from IEEE Transactions on Information Theory. And I sent him the proofs. Well I looked up Godel’s phone number in the telephone book and called him up.

Robert J. Marks: So you cold called him then.

Gregory Chaitin: Yeah. Out of the blue. Instead of basing my work on the paradox of the liar Epimenides’ paradox my approach is based on the Berry paradox. And Godel answered “Well it doesn’t matter which paradox you use.” He had said that in his 1931 paper. I was familiar with his paper. So I said “Of course but this suggests to me” I don’t remember what I said something like a whole new approach. I don’t know. What did I say? “I would very much like to talk to you about and get your reaction.”

So he said “Okay send me a paper of yours on this topic. I’ll take a look at it. And if like it maybe I’ll give you an appointment to visit.” So I sent him the proofs. I had the proofs of that IEEE paper. It was my second IEEE Information for Transactions paper actually.

Note: Epimenides’ Paradox Also called the Liar’s Paradox: The paradox of a man who states “I am lying.” If he is lying then he is telling the truth and vice versa. Wolfram’s Mathworld Berry Paradox: “The least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables” is itself a name consisting of eighteen syllables; hence the least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables can be named in eighteen syllables which is a contradiction. Wolfram’s Mathworld

Gregory Chaitin: I called him up and I think I remember he said “Very interesting. Your notion of complexity is an absolute notion.” Now this was a distinction he made between the idea of what you can compute is absolute. It doesn’t depend on the axioms whereas what you can prove does. So he had taken a look at it and immediately perceived a crucial aspect of the definition of complexity that I was proposing. And he gave me an appointment.

I did some research to figure out. I was without a car. I would take the train into New York City. From New York City I would take the train out to I don’t know Princeton Junction or something. I would get there. Nothing could stop me right?

Gregory Chaitin: I was all set for the great day — and it snowed! And this was the week before Easter. So that’s unusual a spring snowstorm but it wasn’t a big snowstorm. Nothing was going to stop me from visiting my hero. So there I am in my office at the IBM Watson Center about to leave. I figured out how much time I needed. About to leave and unfortunately — very unfortunately — the phone rang. It was Gödel ’s secretary saying Gödel is very careful with his health. And because it snowed he’s not coming in to his office today. And therefore your appointment is canceled.

So that was a surreal experience. And there was no way to reschedule because I was going to leave just in a few days heading back to Argentina to Buenos Aires. But actually this surreal story actually fits better Gödel and his legend because for example when Gödel died they found lots of answers typed up to letters he received but were never sent. They were never mailed. So there was a surreal quality to Gödel and to communicating with Gödel.

Robert J. Marks (pictured): He was a quirky guy and a germophobe if I recall correctly.

Gregory Chaitin: Yeah. He was from what at the time was the Austro-Hungarian Empire. And he didn’t accept being made a member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. He never went back to Europe never visited Europe. He turned down the offer to be a member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. So he’s an interesting guy.

One of the books I like about Gödel is in French it’s called Gödel’s Demons Logic and Madness. And this was by a gentleman in France who actually went through the Gödel archive at Princeton. Half the book was also devoted to Emil Post a forgotten genius.

Note: Emil Post (1897–1954) was a Polish-born American mathematician and logician who is best known for his work on polyadic groups recursively enumerable sets and degrees of unsolvability as well as for his contribution to the unsolvability of problems in combinatorial mathematics. – MacTutor

Next: How Kurt Gödel destroyed a popular form of atheism We don’t hear much about logical positivism now but it was very fashionable in the early twentieth century. Gödel’s incompleteness theorems showed that we cannot devise a complete set of axioms that accounts for all of reality — bad news for positivism.

The previous podcast in this series with Gregory Chaitin: Chaitin on the great mathematicians East and West: Himself a “game-changer” in mathematics Chaitin muses on what made the great thinkers stand out. He discusses the almost supernatural awareness some mathematicians have had of the foundations of our shared reality in the mathematics of the universe.

The pandemic appears to have negatively affected women in much higher proportions than men. While statistically more men are dying of COVID-19 it’s the women who are suffering more economically.

Women have lost more jobs—in fact more than 5 million jobs have been lost about a million more than men—largely due to more women working in harder-hit industries such as hospitality services and domestic work. Women are dropping from the workforce to care for children who are not in school. This leads to more food insecurity and poverty disproportionally affecting women especially single-parent homes.

Additionally 70 percent of healthcare workers and first responders are women putting them at higher health risk as the pandemic lingers. And enormous increases in domestic violence due to prolonged lockdowns also put women at high risk.

Choose to challenge

We must challenge the factors that lead to these inequalities for women and the 2021 theme for International Women’s Day could not be more apt. #ChooseToChallenge means that as we all observe or experience inequalities we must speak up for change. While we choose to celebrate women’s achievements raise awareness against bias and take action for equality we must also choose to be more alert and aware of women’s situations and choose to challenge them.

While International Women’s Day is a global event celebrated on March 8 the call to support and act for the social economic cultural and political achievements of women is year-round.

IBM answers the call

IBM is well known for its longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion. In IBM Lab Services and IBM Garage we work every day with clients helping them with their business and IT challenges. And as we offer our expertise diverse backgrounds and experiences we are also committed to improving and advancing women’s equality. We strive every day to uphold IBM’s values of diversity and inclusion and for International Women’s Day we invited our team to take a stand on how they will choose to challenge for their colleagues families and all women.

As the International Women’s Day statement says “A challenged world is an alert world and from challenge comes change.” So let’s all choose to challenge—today and every day. Together we can make 2021 and beyond better for all women.

On that day in November of 2019 the 100th anniversary of Kalashinkov’s birth a number of events took place in Russia including museum displays a biopic and of course the inevitable patriotic lessons Times of Israel reported.

Such was the respect for the man born in a Siberian village who created one of the greatest most reliable and deadly attack rifles in history.

Kalashnikov who died in 2013 at the age of 94 is seen in Russia as a national hero and symbol of the country’s proud military past.

Today Russia manufactures fifth-generation Kalashnikov rifles — the AK-12 and the AK-15 — and there are an estimated 100 million AK-47s in circulation.

And now they have a new entry.

Russia’s Kalashnikov Group (a subsidiary of Rostec state corporation) unveiled its new Lebedev PLK compact pistol at the IDEX 2021 defense show held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) last week EDR Magazine reported.

The PLK is a striker-fired weapon that is built on an aluminum slide and features ambidextrous firing controls including bolt catch safety and magazine release button.

Unlike the renowned Makarov PM pistol firing 9×18 ammunition the Lebedev sidearm is chambered for 9×19 Parabellum cartridges the report said.

Fitted with an ergonomic grip the PLK pistol is 180 mm long and carries a 92 mm barrel.

The firearm is fed by a 14-round metal dual-column magazine with clear windows allowing a shooter to control ammunition consumption the report said.

The Lebedev pistol weighs 0.71 kg with empty magazine. The lower part of the pistol slide is equipped with a Picatinny rail for tactical flashlights and target designators.

“This firearm has successfully completed its state trials in the Russian Federation and has already proven its reliability in harsh environments” Dmitry Tarasov the Kalashnikov Group CEO told EDR.

Born in a Siberian village on November 10 1919 Kalashnikov had a tragic childhood during which his father was deported as a “kulak” (prosperous peasant) in 1930 TheHindu.com reported.

Wounded during a bloody battle with Nazi forces in 1941 Kalashnikov was given a leave during which he thought up the first versions of the rifle.

In 1945 a prototype was entered into a competition and the design was eventually recommended for use in the Soviet army.

It quickly became prized for its simplicity cheapness and sturdy reliability.

AK-47’s name stands for “Kalashnikov’s Automatic” and the year its final version was designed 1947.

Though it wasn’t especially accurate its ruggedness and simplicity were exemplary: it performed well in sandy or wet conditions that jammed more sophisticated weapons such as the American M-16.

“During the Vietnam war American soldiers would throw away their M-16s to grab AK-47s and bullets for it from dead Vietnamese soldiers” Kalashnikov said in July 2007 at a ceremony marking the rifle’s 60th anniversary.

The weapon’s suitability for jungle and desert fighting made it nearly ideal for the Third World insurgents backed by the Soviet Union and Moscow not only distributed the AK-47 widely but also licensed its production in some 30 other countries.

Some have even called it the “weapon of the century” placing it as the deadliest and most game-changing weapon in the history of military warfare.

The gun’s status among revolutionaries and national-liberation struggles is enshrined on the flag of Mozambique.

The moment that firmly set his course was in the 1941 battle of Bryansk against Nazi forces when a shell hit his tank Times of Israel reported.

Recovering from wounds in the hospital Kalashnikov brooded about the superior automatic rifles he’d seen the Nazis deploy; his rough ideas and revisions bore fruit five years later.

“Blame the Nazi Germans for making me become a gun designer” said Kalashnikov. “I always wanted to construct agricultural machinery.”

In 2007 President Vladimir Putin praised him saying “The Kalashnikov rifle is a symbol of the creative genius of our people.”

Over his career he was decorated with numerous honors including the Hero of Socialist Labor and Order of Lenin and Stalin Prize. But because his invention was never patented he didn’t get rich off royalties.",,,,,,,,,,,,

David was born on Jan. 5 1962 in Evanstan Ill. to Joseph and Shirley Jefferson. He grew up in Lexington Mass. while dividing his time between Lexington and the family summer home in Harpswell Maine. David attended Lexington High School and graduated from the University of Southern Maine with a B.A. in English. David was employed by L.L.Bean for 18 years in multiple positions starting on the sales floor. By the time he left L.L.Bean David was regularly traveling to Japan and Hong Kong for his work. David also spent a year living and working in France for the sporting goods company Decathlon. He also worked for Idexx Laboratories for 11 years in sales. He enjoyed that position immensely and made many friends. Loving husband uncle brother friend David is survived by his wife of 18 years Christine Kiley of Portland. Throughout their marriage Dave and Christine shared a treasured love and friendship along with countless mutual interests; daily hikes with the dogs books bee-keeping island camping winemaking canoeing boating gardening traveling and exploring the coast of Maine. Acadia National Park held a special place in Dave’s heart. Even after 19 years together David never began or ended his day without wishing his wife a good morning and good night. Dave’s kind nature curiosity about the world and dry sense of humor were infectious. He made friends easily and maintained lifelong friendships. Several of these friends went out of their way to spend memorable time with David as his health declined. It brought him tremendous comfort and joy that these friends still sought him out despite increasing physical limitations. Always interested in the lives of others David would become excited as he recounted a new acquaintance that he had met. He often left fruit and vegetables from his yard on the doorsteps of neighbors. Dave also had a tremendous love and respect for animals dogs in particular. Many canines in the neighborhood went crazy with joy when they spotted him. He was also the funny uncle who delighted in surprising his nieces and nephews. A voracious reader with a photographic memory Dave was very knowledgeable on a variety of topics from world history to sailing sports geography politics and the natural world. His wife would often joke that she did not need Google; she had Dave. Throughout his life Dave enjoyed backcountry downhill and X-country skiing sailing motorcycle touring hiking river rafting and cycling. Locations ranged from the United States to Europe and Asia. In his late 40s Dave learned to play ice hockey by joining the local Men’s Early Morning Hockey League. He considered this league to be a brotherhood and played until illness made it impossible. David stayed in close contact with this group until his passing. David’s strength and grace over the past five years were remarkable. He never once complained about his diagnosis or the physical or mental challenges that came along with it. He simply lived life to the fullest of his ability and focused on the things that he was still able to do. He will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved him. David is also survived by his siblings Joanne Havener of Litchfield Park Ariz. Peter Jefferson of Van Burien Wash. William Jefferson of Bath; and six nieces and three nephews. Due to Covid-19 a private burial and service will be held this summer. Instead of flowers the family asks that donations in David’s name be made to:ASPCA (The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) at ASPCA.org

Here’s how it works

This is the eighth part of our Intel Evo vs Apple Silicon series where we're taking a look at what each side can do better than the other. The MacBook Pro 13 Razer Book 13 Razer Core X Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Samsung T7 Touch SSD and CalDigit Thunderbolt 3 dock were provided by Intel. All opinions expressed are a result of our own testing and experience.

It's been a long road getting from there to here but it's time to wrap it up. This has been one of the more fun reviews that I've done in a while just because it's been a journey. Eight articles is a lot so let's take a look at where we landed on everything.

Hardware

The first thing I took a dive into in this series was hardware because frankly it was the easiest. There's not much to test. I just had to plug things in and see if they worked. On top of that the results are incredibly easy to predict. Intel is better at hardware compatibility.

And why is that? Simple it's because the entire computing industry is built around Intel right now. Up until last year macOS has only supported Intel processors and up until 2017 Windows only supported x86/x64 instruction sets. This is the message that Intel wanted to send out when it sent this hardware to reviewers. Everything works with Intel. There might be some things that are better about Apple Silicon but the ecosystem isn't there.

The key example for me is that Apple's new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro don't support dual external monitors. And yes I know I've said it a million times something that a number of people have joked about in the comments but it's important. Even if you don't use dual monitors you might want to during the lifetime of the PC. The problem for Intel is that this will undoubtedly be solved by the next generation.

The other thing is more niche but there's no support for external GPUs on Apple Silicon. It's cool to have a single-cable solution that can connect an eGPU to a laptop that turns a Windows PC into a gaming rig. With the Razer Book it was wild to be suggested Ultra settings on Forza Horizon 4.

Other than that most things worked. Intel warned me that Xbox controllers wouldn't work and I didn't find that to be true. It's only the Xbox Series X|S controller that currently doesn't work and that's getting fixed. Intel also sent me a Samsung Touch T7 SSD and that worked fine too.

Probably the other key thing that won't work is biometrics such as with the Logitech Brio webcam. You can't use the IR camera to log into the Mac. You have to use Touch ID. Naturally all of this stuff works on Windows.

And of course Windows has a broader array of hardware to choose from just when it comes to the PC selection. There are beautiful and unique designs like the HP Spectre x360 touchscreens convertibles with pen support tablets and more.

Software

Intel does better with software than Apple Silicon does for the exact same reason. All desktop software is built for Intel. Some of it has been recompiled for ARM on Windows and Mac but literally all of it runs natively on Intel.

So the real question is what are you missing out on with Apple Silicon? I'd say the biggest one is Boot Camp or a decent Windows experience. Before you discount this idea keep in mind that Apple even used to boast that its PCs could run Windows.

The only way to run Windows now is through virtualization in Parallels. And it's problematic. Most of Microsoft's built-in apps are 32-bit ARM apps and the Apple M1 doesn't support 32-bit ARM apps. After all it's been ages since there's been a 32-bit ARM app in Apple's ecosystem. You can't open the Microsoft Store Photos and so on.

The Apple Silicon Mac can run Intel apps using Apple's Rosetta 2 and it usually ends up working pretty well. A lot of these apps seem to take super-long to launch but at least they work so you're not actually losing them.

The problem of native apps is a short-term one though. This can only get better over time. Adobe has a bunch of native ARM64 apps in beta with more on the way. You can also choose to run the Intel versions of Adobe apps side-by-side with the betas; for example the betas of Premiere Pro and Media Encoder don't support MP3 files so unless your audio track is WAV you need to convert it. You can use the Intel app for that.

Performance

It's easy to look at hardware and software ecosystems that were literally built for a world where Intel wasn't just the dominant PC chip vendor but it was the only one. After all this is precisely why Intel sent these products out to highlight its strengths which are completely legitimate.

Now let's talk about performance of the chip itself. First of all like I said in my MacBook Pro review they feel the same in day-to-day usage. For productivity work both Intel's 11th-gen processors and Apple M1 feel the same. Now that that's out of the way we can go beyond anecdotal evidence like that.

Apple M1 native 3:13 Apple M1 Rosetta 3:09 Razer Book 13 4:00 Lenovo ThinkPad P17 1:48

Video renders faster on the M1 than it does with the Core i7-1165G7 that was in the Razer Book. I took a two minute 13 second 4K 60fps video imported it into Premiere Pro and exported it getting the results in the table to the right. It's clear that Apple Silicon smokes Intel's Iris Xe graphics at least as far as that's concerned. I also added the ThinkPad P17 which is clearly way out of the MacBook Pro's class but I wanted to show what's possible with a top-end Nvidia Quadro RTX GPU. I feel like Apple Silicon is being reported as a home run and that it punches well above its weight class. That's not true. If anything it wins in its weight class.

There are also things that are faster on Intel Evo. App launching is faster in almost every case and opening documents tends to be a lot faster. The problem is that I don't have rendering times for stuff like that like I do for video rendering. There are parts of the UI where Apple Silicon just feels plain sluggish.

Apple wins on benchmarks too though. I was only able to use Geekbench and Cinebench which only test the CPU. Sadly that tells a very one-sided part of the story; however if you're interested in graphics performance you can go by the video rendering times.



The MacBook Pro does well here but it does particularly well in multi-core performance. Depending on your work flow this can make a big difference.

Conclusion

Intel wins when it comes to the hardware and software ecosystems but Apple wins in performance so what does this all add up to? Personally I'd say just wait a year or even two if you can. All of the issues around Apple Silicon right now are short-term problems. Apple Silicon will support multiple external monitors at some point and developers will compile their apps to run natively boosting things like startup time.

The M1-powered MacBook Pro is good really good. But throughout the time I was using it my main thought was about how much I liked it and how much of a shame that is because it has so many deal-breakers built into it.

Right now Intel still wins and it's not because of performance. It's because Apple can't check all of the boxes necessary even if it checks the ones that are right for certain users.

It's a hell of a start from Apple though and the Cupertino firm should feel proud of what it's accomplished here. Now it's up to Intel. Most of my complaints about Apple Silicon will be solved over one generation maybe two. Intel has to use that time to figure out how to compete in terms of performance.

Details about Intel's Alder Lake platform have already leaked most-recently courtesy of a Geekbench listing for an eight-core SKU. Most leaks about Alder Lake have concerned Intel's desktop product stack but @9550pro has now revealed the company's Alder Lake Mobile stack.

Incidentally the leak precedes the release of many 11th Gen Core series processors including the Core i5-11400H Core i7-11800H and the Core i9-11980HK. Undoubtedly Alder Lake Mobile processors will utilise Intel's Hybrid technology which has also been in desktop counterparts. Intel has already delivered hybrid processors with the Lakefield architecture but Alder Lake will bring this technology beyond low-power chipsets.

According to the leaked image Intel has separated its Alder Lake Mobile stack into three packages: Alder Lake-M Alder Lake-P and Alder Lake-S-BGA. The latter should not be confused with Intel's desktop Alder Lake processors though. The same picture shows that Intel has added three new processor segments to its mobile portfolio too from the Alder Lake-M M5 (5 W/7 W) to the Alder Lake-P U28 (20 W/28 W) and the Alder Lake-S-BGA H55 (45 W/55 W).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2ludGVsLWNvcmUtaTctMTE3MDBrLTgtY29yZS1yb2NrZXQtbGFrZS1jcHUtcmV2aWV3LXZlcnktaG90LXNsb3dlci10aGFuLWFtZC16ZW4tMy1yeXplbi01MDAwL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2ludGVsLWNvcmUtaTctMTE3MDBrLTgtY29yZS1yb2NrZXQtbGFrZS1jcHUtcmV2aWV3LXZlcnktaG90LXNsb3dlci10aGFuLWFtZC16ZW4tMy1yeXplbi01MDAwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i7-11700K 8 Core Rocket Lake CPU Review Published By Anandtech – Very Hot Consumes More Power Than Core i9-10900K & Slower Than AMD In Core-To-Core Tests,"The first proper review of a retail Intel Core i7-11700K 8 Core Rocket Lake Desktop CPU has been published by Dr. Ian Cutress of Anandtech. The tech outlet managed to get their hands on one of the retail chips from a manufacturer who probably broke the NDA like MindFactory and started to sell the CPUs a full month before the official launch on the 30th of March.

Intel Core i7-11700K Rocket Lake 8 Core CPU Review Shows That It's Very Hot Power Hungry & Hardly Catches Up To AMD's Zen 3 Based Ryzen CPUs

What's interesting about these results than the one we have seen leak out before is that it is based on the retail sample. The Intel Core i7-11700K is going to be placed against the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X which is AMD's fastest 8 core offering based on the Zen 3 core architecture. The Core i9-11900K will be the top-dog but based on its pricing it should be competing against the Ryzen 9 5900X with the same 8 core configuration but higher clock frequencies.

You can read the full review of the Core i7-11700K at Anandtech over here!

Intel Core i7-11700K 8 Core & 16 Thread Rocket Lake Desktop CPU Specs

The Core i7-11700K features the same core configuration as the Core i9-11900K of 8 cores and 16 threads but comes with reduced clock speeds. The chip is said to feature a boost clock of 5.0 GHz on a single & 4.6 GHz across all of its 8 cores. The CPU will even carry the same amount of cache so nothing has changed but the main difference should come from the clocks and power limits. This lower-binned chip will sit at around 225-250W (PL2) limit while the PL1 limit will be standard at 125W. The PL1 rating has a TAU duration of 56 seconds while the PL2 rating has a TAU duration of 2.44ms.

It will be interesting to see how Rocket Lake CPUs overclock since the minute difference between the Core i9 and Core i7 chips can be overcome by a small overclock. As for pricing the Core i7 will also be cheaper than the Core i9 variant but we don't know yet how Intel will price its 8 core Rocket Lake-S Desktop CPUs yet. There are reports that Intel could aggressively price the chips at around $400 US for the Core i9 and $300 US for the Core i7 which could prove to be a great decision if they really want to go against AMD's Zen 3 based parts in the sub-$500 US segment.

Intel Core i7-11700K 8 Core & 16 Thread Rocket Lake Desktop CPU Benchmarks

The Anandtech test results were carried out on an undisclosed platform that could be featuring a Z590 motherboard. Other test equipment included ADATA's 16 GB DDR4-3200 (CL22) memory kit and a True Copper heatsink with dual SST-FHP141-VF fans. Both the Rocket Lake and Zen 3 CPUs were tested with the same memory configurations while Comet Lake was tested with DDR4-2933 & Coffee Lake was tested with DDR4-2666 MHz memory. The test results could be seen below:

As you can see in the results above the AMD Ryzen 5800X is faster in almost all of the CPU-specific performance benchmarks that were used. The only saving grace for Intel is AVX-512 but that leads to an unprecedented rise in power consumption making the Rocket Lake Intel Core i7-11700K far more inefficient than it already was. Anandtech reports that the single and multi-thread floating-point performance sees a 19-19.5% increase but the integer performance has gone up only by an average of 10%.

When it comes to gaming performance the Intel Core i7-11700K lacks severely against the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X and even its Comet Lake-based predecessor. Anandtech tries to explain that the increased L3 cache cycles could be a reason for this adverse performance in games. According to our sources Intel is already working hard to fix some of these issues through a micro update that was supposed to be available to board partners by mid of March but has since been delayed. It is likely that Intel will fix some of these cache-related issues through BIOS updates but that's something we have to keep an eye out in the long term as early reviews of the 11th Gen Desktop CPU lineup will showcase this kind of performance.

Lastly we have the power and temperature data. At stock out-of-the-box operation the Intel Core i7-11700K Rocket Lake CPU hits up to 81C with a power consumption of 225W. But with AVX-512 it shoots up to 104C and so does the power consumption which hits a shocking max of 290 Watts. It is more power-hungry than the Ryzen Threadripper CPUs when running AVX-512 instructions. So overall we can see that Rocket Lake is going to be really hot and power-hungry and will definitely require you to invest in a beefy AIO liquid cooler and also a solid PSU.

SiSoftware has also posted their own test results of the Intel Core i7-11700K Desktop Rocket Lake CPU and found it to be slower than AMD's Ryzen 7 5800X more inefficient than Skylake & power-hungry too.

Summary: A long due upgrade with great (+40% improved) performance: 9/10 We’ve really been waiting way too long for this – endless Skylake (SKL) derivatives (Gen 6 7 8 9 and 10) then finally IceLake (ICL) and TigerLake (TGL) but for mobile (ULV) only. RocketLake (RKL) is not quite what we expected as it’s not on 10nm litography but “back-ported” to 14nm+++ and also using the older ICL cores (not TGL) but at least compatible with the 400-series (LGA 1200) platform. With AMD making steady improvements with Ryzen (series 2000 3000 and now 5000) the top end i9 10900K CometLake (CML) could not really keep up thus we really needed a new contender from Intel. We were also waiting for PCIe 4.0 already supported by AMD 2 generations ago and by all modern GP-GPUs and NVMe SSDs; perhaps not quite needed but with mass-market gaming consoles (Sony PS5 Microsoft XBox SS/XS) using NVMe/PCIe4 storage – it became a bit of an embarrassment for top-end PCs to lack it. 2 of 9 RocketLake (RKL) i7 (1170K) does not increase number of cores (still 8C / 16T) nor speeds (rated / turbo) but AVX512 + arch improvements (larger caches TLBs etc.) make it about 50% faster than CFL/CML and with optimisations (and higher speed memory) likely higher. TDP (Power) is higher at 125W and being still at 14nm RKL will need a lot more (~155W?) to maintain top clocks. Existing 400-series boards should also support RKL after a BIOS update but naturally no PCIe 4.0 (as we had with AMD Ryzen 3000/5000 and 400-series boards). You will need a 500-series board which is not unexpected but still disappointing. We have not touched on the Iris Gen12 graphics in this article which is a *huge* upgrade over the really old EV9.x graphics but at this level (i7+) it is likely that dedicated graphics will be used. As we’ve seen with TGL the G7 96 EU versions are pretty powerful. 2 of 9 Despite the listed misgivings – it is a pretty much compelling upgrade for anybody buying today – not much point buying the old Skylake-based derivatives (e.g. Cometlake) unless the price is very much reduced. If you have a workload (virtualization?) that requires more cores then 10C/20T CML or many-core SKL-X/KBL-X can still make sense.

Expect to see more information on the processors in the coming weeks along with pricing updates on when and where you can buy these chips for your 400 and 500-series motherboards.

Side-channel attacks take place when attackers are able to observe how a system operates —in this case a computer processor— and then infer what data the system is processing based on small variations in its parameters.

Side-channel attacks targeting modern CPUs have been disclosed on a yearly basis for the past two decades. Academics and security researchers have analyzed various parts of a processor's architecture and have looked for leaks that they could exploit to extract data that was being processed inside the CPU.

Past attacks have looked at CPU temperatures fan noises transfer errors and —in the vast majority of previously published papers— the CPU's internal cache architecture.

First side-channel attack looking at the CPU bus

But in a research paper published tonight and titled ""Lord of the Ring(s): Side Channel Attacks on the CPU On-Chip Ring Interconnect Are Practical"" UIUC researchers looked at a part of modern multi-core CPUs that hasn't been analyzed before —namely the ring interconnect.

Also known as the ring bus this is essentially what its name says it is; a physical circuit in the form of a ring that connects all CPU cores and CPU components allowing for coordination and data transfer between cores and other CPU elements.

Also see the video below for a basic explainer on the ring interconnect.

The CPU ring bus has never been analyzed for side-channel leaks before primarily because it's been scantly documented before.

The UIUC team said that part of their research they performed a ""thorough reverse engineering of the sophisticated protocols that handle communication on the ring interconnect"" and found that they could create contention between operations on the CPU ring bus behaviors that they could later study and abuse for side-channel leakages.

In practical tests researchers said they were able to extract ""key bits from vulnerable EdDSA and RSA implementations"" but also infer ""precise timing of keystrokes typed by a victim user.""

Intel CPUs are vulnerable

Practical tests were performed on Intel Coffee Lake and Skylake CPUs but the attack should theoretically work on any Intel CPU with a ring bus.

The attack was not tested on AMD CPUs since they used a different proprietary technology (named Infinity Fabric) to interconnect processor cores.

Also not vulnerable are recent models of Intel server and high-grade processing (HCP) processors which due to the very large number of cores have switched from a ring bus to a mesh interconnect.

However researchers said that ""the techniques we [used] to build our contention model can be applied on these platforms too"" a task they'll leave for future research on the topic.

Intel's response

But despite the novelty of this attack Intel played down the issue.

""Intel classified our attack as a 'traditional side channel' (like TLBleed Portsmash etc.) and they treat this class of attacks differently than the class of 'speculative execution / transient execution attacks' (like Spectre Meltdown etc.)"" Riccardo Paccagnella one of the researchers told The Record.

""That is they do not officially consider traditional side channel attacks as significant value for an attacker and they already published guidance on how to mitigate them in software here and here.""

However the recommended defenses require that developers follow constant-time programming principles when writing their code.

""Truly constant-time code may be difficult to implement in practice"" Paccagnella told The Record.

The research team's paper will be available for download later today and its findings will also be presented in August at the USENIX Security conference.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9pbnRlbC0xMnRoLWdlbi1jb3JlLWFsZGVyLWxha2UtbW9iaWxlLWxpbmV1cC1oYXMtYmVlbi1sZWFrZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Intel 12th Gen Core ""Alder Lake Mobile"" lineup has been leaked","Intel Alder Lake Mobile to add a new performance segment with 55W

A known leaker HXL has leaked Intel’s upcoming 12th Gen Core series even before the full 11th Gen Core lineup has been announced.

We have been hearing about Alder Lake mobile for a while now. It is a new product stack featuring Intel’s innovative Hydrid Technolgy essentially copying ARM’s big.LITTLE approach to computing. Intel has already launched its Lakefield series based on this technology however but those were designed only for ultra-low power devices.

Alder Lake M

According to the leaked slide Intel’s 12th Gen core mobile lineup will be divided into three main categories and five performance segments each meant for a different product. Starting with Alder Lake M the series will be split into M5 and U9 series which are 5W and 9W respectively. Those will be used for tablets and ultra-thin designs. According to the leaked product stack the Alder Lake-M5 will offer 1 big core and up to 4 small cores a similar configuration to Lakefield. The U9 series will feature up to 2 big cores and up to 8 small cores.

Alder Lake P

The performance segment will be split into U15 U28 and H45 performance segments each indicating power targets for the devices. It is revealed that the U15 series will be offered with up to 2 big cores and up to 8 small cores. The U28 power segment is a new addition to Intel mobile lineup. Those will feature up to 6 big cores and up to 8 small cores. All three planned SKUs would offer 96 Graphics Execution Units.

Alder Lake-H45 series is likely to replace the current Tiger Lake-H35. Those are targeted at portable gaming laptops. According to the leaked slide Intel would offer up to 6 big cores and up to 8 small cores. Each of the three SKUs would also get 96 Execution Units indicating that they are also meant to be used without discrete GPU.

Alder Lake-S

The new high-end performance segment with TDP ranging from 45W to 55W described in the slide as the ‘Muscle’ segment will pack up to 8 big cores and up to 8 small cores. Each of the three SKUs would offer 32 EUs which means that those are designed for gaming machines with discrete GPU options.

The whole lineup confirms that Intel has big plans for its new Hybrid Technology-based series. Intel Alder Lake is expected to future a combination of high-performance “big” cores based on Golden Cove architecture and high-efficiency “small cores” based on Gracemont core architecture. Intel will also be launching Alder Lake for desktops with similar configurations to the mobile H45 and H55 series depending on the segment.

Stocks seem to be at a fork in the road.

After hitting fresh highs in mid-February they've balked at rising interest rates as another stimulus package stokes further inflation fears and increasing vaccination rates give hope of a full economic reopening in the near future.

With valuations still overextended by many measures are stocks due to slide further? Or will investors learn to tolerate the rising rate environment? Or are rates due to take a break lifting stocks higher?

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Ask 48-year market veteran David Hunter and he'll tell you it's the third scenario that will play out in the months ahead. Hunter who is the chief macro strategist at Contrarian Macro Advisors told Insider on Wednesday that last week's pullback in stocks was a temporary break in a broader melt up that will continue in the months ahead.

Hunter said that 10-year Treasury notes are oversold right now (yields rise when bond prices fall). And in the few months ahead he expects their yields to reverse course and fall to 1.15-1.2% from current levels above 1.5%. In the same timeframe he predicts stocks will see huge gains: the S&P 500 will rise to 4600 the Dow Jones Industrial Average to 37000 and the Nasdaq to 17000.

But that's when things will take a turn for the worse. Hunter said he thinks that sometime in the second quarter inflation will surge as the economy opens back up. That would cause the Fed to begin to tighten its policy sending 10-year yields to 2.5% and 30-year yields to 3%.

But the sudden series of events in a broader economic backdrop that remains fragile will send stocks tumbling to the tune of an 80% drop in the months afterward he said adding that the Fed's actions would ultimately risk pushing the global economy into a deflationary bust.

""You're going to see as we open up the economy more signs that things are overheating actually. It's ironic because we were in recession a year ago"" Hunter said attributing his prediction to fiscal and monetary stimulus efforts.

""Right now if you listen to Jay Powell they say 'Oh we don't think we have to tighten anytime this year'"" he continued. ""I think that's going to be fast-forwarded by the time you get to the middle of the year because they're going to be looking and saying 'Wow inflation's moving up a lot faster than we expected. Wow the economy is actually showing signs of overheating. And wow the market's at 4600 and we've got junk bonds people piling in.'""

Hunter added that ""we're in a very unusual situation"" because of the potential for economic overheating ahead as a result of stimulus while the economy is at the same time fragile with relatively high unemployment. He said this fragility will make the economy and markets more sensitive to Fed tightening.

But Hunter said the same thing that will trigger the drawdown — the Fed's monetary policy moves — will also contribute to presenting investors with an enormous opportunity on the other side of it.

He said the potential drop in stocks and the economic bust will lead to monetary and fiscal stimulus efforts that are even greater than those of the last year. This will send share prices soaring he said and begin an industrial-driven economic recovery.

""The easiest part of my forecast is predicting how the politicians and the central bankers are going to react"" he said.

Hunter is also bullish on gold and silver amid the inflationary environment he expects. He said he thinks gold will rise to $2500 per ounce and silver to $45-50 per ounce ""maybe as soon as the second quarter."" By 2030 he said he believes gold will reach $10000 and silver to $300.

Hunter's views in context

While many may not share Hunter's prediction for an 80% drop in stocks his views on inflation and speculation about the Fed tightening earlier than expected are now mainstream.

For example Morgan Stanley economists explored in a March 3 note how the Fed might respond to rising yields going forward and found that while Federal Open Markets Committee members haven't signaled they're ready to tighten policy yet they could do so if conditions overheat.

Fed intervention will likely come via communication and if necessary downsizing their balance sheet the economists said. Still they argued intervention is unlikely and the federal funds rate will stay at current levels through 2023.

But there is still the possibility a tightening scenario occurs if things get out of hand in the months ahead. And if they do stocks could have a long way to fall.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9hdi93b3JsZC1ldXJvcGUtNTYzMDA1MTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The ballerina dancing on ice for a real 'swan lake',"The ballerina dancing on ice for a real ‘swan lake’

The stock market's inflation fears may be overblown if explosive economic growth comes to fruition to create a perfect ""mix"" for more gains according to James Paulsen Chief Investment Strategist of The Leuthold Group.

In a letter to investors on Friday Paulsen said that although inflation may be on the rise that hasn't always meant poor returns for the stock market as long as real economic growth is strong.

And with the post-pandemic reopening in sight many analysts are arguing real economic growth will be impressive in the second half of the year.

In fact a monthly Bloomberg survey of economists showed annual GDP expectations nearly double to 5.5% from what experts were predicting just two months ago.

In his letter Paulsen highlighted the two components that have made up nominal GDP since 1950: annual real GDP growth and annual inflation growth.

The strategist illustrated how a perfect ""mix"" of these components has led to significant stock market gains in the past. He also said that even when inflation rates are high the stock market has been able to deliver strong returns as long as real economic growth remains strong.

""Regardless of the inflation environment if real growth is Low High or Super High negative annual market returns are not that prevalent"" Paulsen said.

According to Paulsen it's only when real growth slips to the ""super low"" level that returns begin to fall.

Contrary to popular belief inflation isn't always a bad thing for equity markets. According to Paulsen when real economic growth is ""super-high"" inflation has ""simply not been important.""

Instead what's important is the ""mix"" of annual inflation growth and real GDP growth.

The strategist said fears of inflation wreaking havoc on the stock market are not ""acute"" ""because real economic growth is poised to be spectacular creating a Mix that has historically been supportive for stocks.""

About two weeks ago the Nigerian stock trading app offered an exchange rate of about N484 to $1.

The green-colored trading app known for allowing local-based Nigerians to invest in stocks listed on the world’s biggest stock market (New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ) is currently offering its users a premium of more than 20% compared to the official exchange rate set by the Nigerian apex bank.

That being said Nairametrics’s most recent research observed Chaka. ng offers the lowest exchange rate charge of N480 to 1$ other Nigerian-based stock trading apps that include Trove and Risevest currently offer their clients N491.68 and N486 to $1 respectively.

In addition other leading fintech platforms reviewed by Nairametrics also presently offer exuberant rates as high as about N519 to a dollar thereby adding more transaction costs on a significant number of Nigerians hoping to trade such financial assets.

A growing number of Nigerians are currently increasing their exposure to the U.S stock market taking to the current bearish trend that is being witnessed in the Nigerian Equity market and growing urge in hedging against the weakening local currency.

Consequently a lot of Nigerians are flocking the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on the account it has about 2800 companies listed while the NASDAQ has about 3300 stocks listed. This gives Nigerian investors numerous options where they can invest their money. It is also why the US economy attracts billions of dollars in portfolio investments annually.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

(CN) — A federal judge said he rejected a proposed $40 million class action settlement against financial software company Intuit because it “is not fair reasonable and adequate” for those taxpayers who were allegedly misled into paying for tax preparation services rather than the company’s free services.

Intuit faced a class action from customers who used the company’s online tax preparation software TurboTax. In a deal with the IRS the company agreed to offer the services for free for low-income taxpayers and active military.

But the plaintiffs allege the company duped eligible taxpayers into using its paid services instead paying about $100 a year between 2015 to 2020.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer of the Northern District of California denied preliminary approval of the settlement on Dec. 17 last year but held off on issuing an opinion at the request of the parties to reach a new settlement deal.

Since both sides have been unable to agree upon a deal to date Breyer released his opinion on Friday calling the proposed settlement unfair to consumers.

“In particular the proposed settlement provides class members with inadequate compensation and sets forth opt out procedures that unduly burden all class members but especially those who have already begun to pursue claims through arbitration” he wrote in a 20-page opinion.

The company made a motion in 2019 to compel arbitration a motion Breyer denied due to Intuit’s online contract failing to give adequate notice to users. Intuit appealed the decision and the Ninth Circuit reversed it last August.

Since then more than 100000 customers have filed individual arbitration requests costing the company tens of millions of dollars. Under the settlement customers would only receive an average of $28.

As part of the proposed settlement customers would not be able to go forward with their arbitration requests unless they opted out of the settlement.

Judge Breyer said in Friday’s opinion that he found that to be unacceptable.

“In particular the proposed settlement provides class members with inadequate compensation and sets forth opt out procedures that unduly burden all class members but especially those who have already begun to pursue claims through arbitration” he wrote.

At the Dec. 17 hearing Judge Breyer offered Intuit attorney Rodger Cole of Fenwick & West no sympathy for the company which has had to pay millions in arbitration costs and unsuccessfully sued arbitration claimants in California asking the state court to move such claims to small claims court.

“You knew what the rules of arbitration were. You knew all these things. And you elected you elected to go to arbitration” Breyer said. “And you fought fairly vigorously and it turns out correctly that you had this right to insist on arbitration. Now you come in when you see how it is unfolding and say ‘Not so fast. Now we want to turn and do something else.’”

Judge Breyer also emphasized how little customers would have received under the settlement terms.

“It also bears emphasizing that here that harm is significant. Mostly low-income class members suffered at least $100 in damages” he wrote. “For class members who paid filing fees over multiple years the harm was much more. And for a family or individual with limited disposable income $100-per-year can have a material effect. It might be the difference in whether someone can pay rent for a month or buy groceries for a week.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvdGhlLW9yaWdpbmFscy1qb3NlcGgtbW9yZ2FuLWRhbmllbC1naWxsaWVzLWVlcmlseS1wcmVkaWN0ZWQta2xhdXMtZWxpamFoLWRlYXRocy5odG1sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Originals': Joseph Morgan and Daniel Gillies Eerily Predicted Klaus and Elijah's Fates,"The eerie way Joseph Morgan and Daniel Gillies may have set up Klaus and Elijah's death in 'The Originals.'

The Vampire Diaries universe has a knack for creating supernatural sibling factions.

Klaus and Elijah Mikaelson Damon and Stefan Salvatore and Josie and Lizzie Saltzman all made their mark in their respective shows. But the Mikaelsons proved to be an exceptional bunch. Werewolf vampire and witch flowed through their original bloodline and as with the Salvatores so did their undying bond.

When The Originals wrapped the final scene was Klaus and Elijah dying together a move that came as a surprise to many. But years before the TV show ended actors Joseph Morgan and Daniel Gillies seemingly predicted their characters’ deaths — and they were eerily correct.

How Klaus and Elijah died in ‘The Originals’

After five seasons The Originals signed off in 2018 with the tear-jerking deaths of Klaus and Elijah Mikaelson. When Klaus was introduced on The Vampire Diaries he was a feared unhinged serial killer who acted on impulse. He killed Aunt Jenna a deed that some fans found hard to forgive.

But for many he turned into a hybrid baddie they grew to love and most of the final Originals season found Klaus on a redemptive arc. Always and forever kept the Mikaelson clan connected through love pain betrayal and sibling rivalry. It’s also what led Elijah to sacrifice himself along with Klaus for Klaus’ daughter Hope’s sake.

Fans watched as Elijah split the white oak dagger in two and said to Klaus “I intend to die by your side.” With tears rolling down their faces they vowed to face the afterlife together — and staked each other. Their embers floated away into the ethers. The end.

Joseph Morgan and Daniel Gillies foresaw Klaus and Elijah’s end

TV actors often embody their characters to the point they can intuit their decisions and sometimes their downfalls. In the case of Klaus and Elijah Morgan and Gillies had some sort of sixth sense when it came to foretelling the brothers’ last days on Earth.

During an appearance on The Originals panel for 2015’s San Diego Comic-Con event a fan asked them how they wanted their characters to die in the show. That caught them off guard but the two were on the same accord.

“I know how I want to go” said Morgan. “Out in a blaze of glory killed by Elijah in a giant sword fight.” Gillies thought that was a great idea and Morgan gestured “Maybe it could be a double sort of like — you stab me in the heart but I stab you in the heart.”

Gillies chimed in and said “It’s true though. I’d want to be murdered by Klaus.” Their wish would later come true but without the murderous intent.

Before they spoke showrunner Julie Plec joked that she would take notes about their answers. But afterward she said Klaus and Elijah’s sad fates were already written and locked in a box. That too was a clue.

MARIE — Escanaba dodged a potential trap game with little trouble cruising past the Sault Ste. Marie Blue Devils 66-24 in a non-conference boys basketball game Friday night.

Jared Hanson scored 16 points to lead a balanced effort for the U.P.’s No. 1-ranked Eskymos who improved to 10-0. Trevor Brown scored 13 points while Carter Hudson had 11 points and six rebounds.

Esky led 34-13 at halftime and was able to sub freely in the second half. With a big Great Northern Conference game coming up against Kingsford Saturday Esky coach Tracy Hudson was happy to get a comfortable lead and be able to use his full lineup against the Blue Devils.

Escanaba swept the home-and-home season series over the Sault.

“The Sault is young and building” coach Hudson said. “They are well-coached and play hard so I was a little nervous about this game. We did what we needed to do and came away with a road win. While the Sault is putting things together with some new guys on varsity we have our core team back from last year and we’re where we want to be. Our talent kind of took over.

“Once we got the lead we wanted to limit everyone’s minutes” Hudson said. “We shut some guys down to save them for tomorrow with a top-five matchup coming up against Kingsford. Beyond that we have a lot of tough games coming up.”

The Blue Devils kept it close through the first quarter. The game was tied at 7 before Esky closed the quarter with a 12-8 lead. The Eskymos pulled away in the second quarter shutting down the Sault offense. Esky went on a 22-5 run to take a 34-13 lead into halftime.

“We didn’t come out right away and pressure them the way we wanted but we eventually got into them with our press” Hudson said. “We had to ramp it up and we got some deflections with our 1-3-1 zone to get some things going. We shared the ball really well.

“We talked about going inside and attacking the rim and our guys did” Hudson said. “Jared Hanson shot the ball really well. He was kind of our hot hand tonight.”

Carter Oshelski Bennette Swanson and Ryan LaPlaunt scored four points apiece for the Blue Devils (2-8). Sault High was finishing a stretch of three games in three days.

“I liked the way we came out of the gate” Sault High coach Mike Fitzner said. “We came out and made some plays. But then they got into a rhythm in the second quarter and started to do what they do. We were on our heels from that point on.

“Escanaba’s legit. They look like a team that can go a long way in the tournament” Fitzner said. “I think this is the best team that Tracy (Hudson) has had. They have all the pieces this year.”

The Eskymos continued to break the game open in the third quarter outscoring the Sault 23-5. Nine players contributed points in the game for the Eskymos. Connor Smale scored nine points while Colin Hudson had five points five assists four rebounds and two blocks.

Esky shot 25-of-55 from the field overall and 9 of 23 on 3s. Hanson connected on four 3-pointers and Smale had three to lead the shooters from distance.

Escanaba defeated Sault Ste. Marie 57-34 in the junior varsity game. Escanaba also beat the Sault 70-35 in the freshman game.

Escanaba visits Kingsford Saturday.

As you explore each biome you’ll find a vegvisir runestone that puts the biome’s boss’ summoning altar on your map. At that altar you’ll sacrifice something — usually a resource or drop from the biome — to summon the boss and then you’ll fight them. You’ll find Eikthyr in the meadows biome The Elder in the black forest biome Bonemass in the swamp biome Moder in the mountain biome and Yagluth in the plains biome.

This guide is a list of Valheim’s bosses in order tips for fighting them and information about their associated biomes. We’ll include links to full biome walkthroughs and dedicated boss guides too.

Table of contents

Eikthyr | Meadows biome

Eikthyr is the first boss you’ll face in Valheim after arriving in the meadows biome. You’ll craft some flint weapons and leather armor before the fight.

You’ll find Eikthyr’s vegvisir runestone in the sacrificial stones where you first spawn. To summon him you’ll need two deer trophies.

Keeping the stag’s limited moveset in mind will make the fight much easier:

When Eikthyr rears up in a quick motion it’ll come back down with a large lighting bolt that shoots in a straight line in whatever direction it’s facing. When boss kicks up its legs move to the side avoiding the lighting bolt attack and rush in for an attack.

When boss kicks up its legs move to the side avoiding the lighting bolt attack and rush in for an attack. Look for a similar movement where Eikthyr rears up but hangs in the air a bit longer . It’ll crash back down with a bubble of lightning . If you see the boss kick up its legs for more than a second keep your distance. Once the ball of energy dissipates go in for a strike.

. It’ll crash back down with . If you see the boss kick up its legs for more than a second keep your distance. Once the ball of energy dissipates go in for a strike. Attack Eikthyr from the side. Whenever you meet the boss head on there’s a chance it’ll make a quick swipe at you with its massive horns. When in doubt approach with your shield drawn to absorb the blow.

Eikthyr drops an Eikthyr trophy plus some hard antlers. Return to the sacrificial stones and place the creature’s head on the corresponding stone slab (the one furthest to the left near the red stone you interacted with earlier).

Mounting Eikthyr’s head will unlock your first Forsaken power which temporarily boosts your stamina and movement abilities. The antlers that Eikthyr drops also let you create the antler pickaxe which is perfect for learning how to mine smelt and make metal tools.

The Elder | Black forest biome

After Eikthyr you’ll head into the black forest biome and where you’ll meet Valheim’s second boss The Elder.

In the black forest you’ll make your first metal bronze and craft new tools weapons and armor. You’ll also learn to farm and make new foods.

You’ll find The Elder’s vegvisir runestone in an abandoned structure somewhere in a black forest biome. To summon The Elder at his altar you’ll need three ancient seeds — a drop from greydwarfs and greydwarf nests.

When summoned The Elder has three unique attacks to recognize.

Foot stomp. This has a slow windup and deals tons of damage in a small area around The Elder.

This has a slow windup and deals tons of damage in a small area around The Elder. Shooting branches. This is a two-step attack. First the Elder puts his hand forward (which is your cue to move away quickly) and then it shoots branches at you. This attack moves quicker than most in Valheim and deals extremely high damage.

This is a two-step attack. First the Elder puts his hand forward (which is your cue to move away quickly) and then it shoots branches at you. This attack moves quicker than most in Valheim and deals extremely high damage. Root summons. The Elder waves his arms and summons roots near your location. This ability isn’t too threatening right away but if you get close enough for the roots to hit you they’ll still do plenty of damage. Each root has a health bar. Killing them is usually the best option as long as you can do it safely.

After several minutes of attacking dodging and burning you’ll take down The Elder and gain access to his rewards. The Elder drops the swamp key which will let you open sunken crypts in the game’s swamp biomes — which is where you’ll find iron to progress to the next section of the game. Taking the Elder Trophy back to the sacrificial stones unlocks The Elder’s Forsaken Power that makes chopping down trees faster.

Bonemass | Swamp biome

With The Elder’s swamp key it’s time to head into the swamp biome and prepare to face Valheim’s third boss Bonemass.

In the swamps you’ll encounter poison-spewing enemies (there’s a mead for that) and skeletons as you fight your way to sunken crypts to mine for iron. With some new weapons and armor you’ll be ready to take on Bonemass.

Bonemass’ vegvisir runestone will be in one of the sunken crypts. To summon him you’ll need 10 withered bones — which also come from sunken crypts conveniently.

Bonemass has three attacks to learn and recognize.

A slow swipe to his front with his right hand . Getting hit by this will deal heavy damage and poison you but it’s pretty predictable and slow making it easy to dodge.

. Getting hit by this will deal heavy damage and poison you but it’s pretty predictable and slow making it easy to dodge. Bonemass pulls slime off of his body and throws to make blobs that join the fight against you . This animation is very long and can’t hurt you so get several hits in during it. Kill the blobs that spawn quickly ensuring that they don’t overrun you later in the fight.

. This animation is very long and can’t hurt you so get several hits in during it. Kill the blobs that spawn quickly ensuring that they don’t overrun you later in the fight. Bonemass rocks forward and backward and unleashes poison all around himself. This area-of-effect poison ability is also slow but it hits hard so don’t get too greedy while he’s casting it.

After the very long and slow fight you’ll eventually take Bonemass down. Once he dies he’ll drop the Bonemass trophy which you can use at the summoning circle for a new resistance power. Every player in the party also gets a wishbone which lets you know when there’s silver (and other buried treasure) nearby.

The Bonemass trophy unlocks a new Forsaken Power at the sacrificial stones. This one reduces the amount of physical damage you take.

Moder | Mountain biome

From the swamps a quick trip to Moder’s — Valheim’s fourth boss — sacrificial stone will tell you it’s time to head for the mountain biome.

In the mountains you’ll deal with cold weather mine silver and obsidian and craft a cold-weather armor set.

Moder’s vegvisir runestone will be in a mountaintop abandoned structure (probably protected by skeletons and drakes). To summon her you’ll need three dragon eggs.

Moder has three kinds of attacks — one that she uses while she’s flying and two that she uses when she lands.

Moder shoots several shards of ice at a player’s location from the air. The ice crystalizes on contact and freeze whatever they hit. Absolutely do not get hit by this ability. Each shard moves slowly which makes them easy to dodge but if you get hit by two or three of these in a row you die.

Absolutely do not get hit by this ability. Each shard moves slowly which makes them easy to dodge but if you get hit by two or three of these in a row you die. Moder swipes with her front talons hitting anything in front of her. This is Moder’s most traditional attack and her quickest. If you see her bring her claws back run away immediately or prepare to dodge.

This is Moder’s most traditional attack and her quickest. If you see her bring her claws back run away immediately or prepare to dodge. Moder shoots a freezing breath attack in front of her. This ability does lots of damage but it can dash to the side just before it comes out to avoid its cone of damage.

There are two ways to kill Moder. The most effective is to hit her with needle or poison arrows while she’s in the air causing a meager amount of damage and then rush up to her when she lands and use your sword. For this method you have to be very careful to dodge her attacks because taking just one hit means you need to retreat and heal.

The far safer (but much more time-consuming) option is to stay as far away from Moder as possible and only use your bow to hurt her. For this you only need to dodge her ice shards attack which should keep you fairly safe. However this method takes a very long time to complete and burns through tons of food and arrows.

Moder drops dragon tears that let you build a new crafting table (the artisan table). Taking her trophy back to the sacrificial stones unlocks a Forsaken Power that grants favorable tailwinds while sailing.

Yagluth | Plains biome

After the mountains you’ll head into the early access version of Valheim’s final biome the plains biome where you’ll prepare to face Yagluth.

The plains biome is a bit of a jump in difficulty. The mobs are tougher and deadlier you’ll be raiding villages and you’ll be spending a lot of time wandering. In the plains you’ll find a new type of metal — black metal expand your farming operations make new armor and weapons and expand your camp.

Finding Yagluth’s vegvisir runestone is a bit of an undertaking. It’ll be in a stone circle near a fuling village but it seems to have a disappointingly low spawn rate. When you do eventually find his summoning altar you’ll need five fuling totems.

Yagluth has three attacks to learn:

Yagluth’s fist glows blue and he raises it into the air before slamming it down and dealing damage in a small area around him. This ability is really slow and easy to dodge.

This ability is really slow and easy to dodge. Yagluth’s fist glows red and he summons a rain of meteors that target players. These aren’t too hard to dodge as long as you start running as soon as he summons them and don’t stop until the rain is over.

These aren’t too hard to dodge as long as you start running as soon as he summons them and don’t stop until the rain is over. Yagluth rears his head back and shoots fire in a straight line and slowly rotates. This can technically be blocked by a shield for a short time but you’re much better off running to the side of it. Don’t try to run away because the range is extremely long. You can use the pillars of his summoning platform to block the fire but the beam of fire destroys other terrain like rocks as soon as it hits them.

You’ll mostly need to fight Yagluth up close. Use your shield and sword and focus on getting three hit combos. He has plenty of health but the fight shouldn’t be as long as others in the game.

Yagluth drops a trophy and three “Yagluth thing” items. These are placeholder items and currently have no use. Taking the Yagluth trophy to the sacrificial stones unlocks a Forsaken Power that gives you extra resistance to elemental damage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9zZWFnYXRlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktcm9hZG1hcC0yMDIx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seagate: 100TB HDDs Due in 2030 Multi-Actuator Drives to Become Common,"Seagate is on track to deliver ~50TB hard disk drives by 2026 ~100TB HDDs by 2030 and 120TB+ units early next decade according to the company's recently revealed product and technology roadmaps. To hit capacity targets Seagate will have to adopt new magnetic recording technologies. To ensure the high performance of its future drives the company plans to leverage its multi-actuator technology more broadly. This tech doubles the performance of its hard drives and it could become a standard feature on some of the company's product lines.

Boosting Capacity

Seagate says that it is on track to build a 50TB hard drive sometime in 2026 and a 100TB HDD in 2030. Right now Seagate is shipping its 3.5-inch 20TB HDDs based on heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) to select customers and as parts of its Lyve storage systems. HAMR will enable Seagate to increase the areal density of its platters at a 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) which means larger steps forward for hard drive capacities.



""As we approach the maximum useful capacity of PMR technology each successive drive increases by 1TB or 2TB at a time"" said Jeff Fochtman Seagate's SVP of Business and Marketing at the company's Analyst Meeting. ""With HAMR technology it allows us to jump in steps of 4 terabytes 6 terabytes or even 10 terabytes at a time.""

(Image credit: Seagate)

In a bid to build a nine-platter 40TB hard drive Seagate needs to increase the areal density of its media to around 2600Gb/in2 (2.6Tb/in2). Seagate has already achieved such areal density though it is unclear whether the company already has prototypes of hard drives running such platters or only tests them on spinstands.



In any case Seagate already has media technology that will power its products several years down the road. But it is going to take from three to five years before HDDs with platters featuring a 2600Gb/in2 (2.6Tb/in2) density will be ready for primetime as the company still needs to polish off the media technology as well as develop the appropriate head drive controller and other electronics.

(Image credit: Seagate)

Modern hard drives based on perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) technology use aluminum or glass platters with CoCrPt–SiO2 nanogranular magnetic films. Hard drives featuring HAMR rely on glass platters with magnetic films featuring high magnetocrystalline anisotropy to ensure very small grains. In particular Seagate uses an iron platinum alloy (e.g. L10–FePt).



Today's HAMR media is expected to enable drives featuring 80TB ~ 100TB capacity according to developers. But for 3.5-inch HDDs with a ~105TB capacity and 5 ~ 7Tb/in2 areal density new ordered-granular magnetic films will be needed as grains will get very small and tracks will get very narrow. But ordered-granular media is expected to be a relatively short stop before 'fully' bit patterned media (BPM) technology comes into play with an 8Tb/inch2 areal density.

(Image credit: Seagate)

""We see an opportunity to scale this design space with granular media into the range of 4 Tb/in2 to 6Tb/in2 at which point we plan to add patterning in one dimension through the use of ordered grain media"" said John Morris Chief Technology Officer of Seagate.



""This we expect to be a steppingstone in media to open up the range of 5Tb/in2 to 7 Tb/in2. Then we will transition to fully patterned media to open up densities to 8Tb/in2 and even higher. With the areal density CAGR just introduced we have a path to 10TB per disk by 2030. This then represents our outlook for technology limits over the next 10 to 15 years.""

Boosting Performance

Advancing the capacity of hard drives at a rapid pace is important to keep Seagate's HDDs competitive but capacity is only a part of the equation. Sequential read/write speeds as well as random IOPS-per-TB performance are also important. While read/write speeds are getting higher along with areal density IOPS-per-TB performance drops as the capacity of hard drives increases. Datacenter operators want hard drives to offer more or less similar IOPS-per-TB performance since this affects their Quality-of-Service. If IOPS-per-TB declines data centers have to mitigate it somehow which requires additional investments.



A straightforward way to increase the IOPS-per-TB performance of an HDD is to use more than one actuator with read/write heads and this is exactly what Seagate is set to do. Using two actuators instead of one can almost double throughput as well as IOPS-per-TB performance which is tremendously important for data centers. Furthermore doubling the number of actuators also halves the time Seagate needs to test a drive before shipping as it is faster to inspect eight or nine platters using two independent actuators which lowers costs.

(Image credit: Seagate)

For now Seagate's dual actuator Mach.2 technology is used for experimental drives based on PMR that are available to dozens of customers but it will eventually be used in commercially-available HAMR HDDs. When Seagate's nearline and enterprise hard drives hit capacities higher than 30TB dual actuator technology will become a must-have feature in a bid to guarantee IOPS-per-TB performance on current (~16TB HDD) levels.



""Although Mach.2 is ramped and being used now it is also really still in a technology-staging mode"" said Fochtman. ""When we reach capacity points above 30 terabytes it will become a standard feature in many large data center environments.""

Like all the other technologies HDDs are getting more complex and therefore manufacturing costs increase. Nonetheless Seagate is confident that HDDs will be cheaper than SSDs on per-GB and TCO metrics for years to come.



""We believe that the TCO for hard disk drives and SSDs will stay approximately in equilibrium"" said Morris. ""Both SSDs and hard disk drives will continue to improve their value proposition and storage demand for both will continue to grow. They are both critical enabling technologies for the growing datasphere and their synergistic relationship in the data center infrastructure will persist.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vZWFybHlnYW1lLmNvbS9nYW1pbmcvdmFsaGVpbS1iZXN0LWJvdy1hbmQtYXJyb3dz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Valheim: The Best Bows and Arrows to Use,"That's right it glows in the dark! (Credit: Iron Gate AB)

Valheim is a dangerous place and a good bow and arrow is vital for surviving the different biomes. There are many bow and arrow choices to wade through though so today we are taking a look at which bow & arrows you should be using.

Where to Get The Best Bow in The Game

The Draugr Fang has the highest damage out of all other bows with 47 piercing and 5 additional poison damage. In order to get this bow you need to collect crafting materials from both the Swamp and Mountain biomes.

The Draugr Bow:

10 Ancient Bark

20 Silver Bars

2 Deer Hide

10 Guck

This means you need to kill the 3rd boss before you can craft it as you need silver ore.

Bows are an essential weapon in Valheim (Credit: Iron Gate AB)

A strong second choice and easier to get bow is the Huntsman Bow. It deals less damage than the Draugr Bow but still deals 42 piercing damage.

The Huntsman Bow:

10 Fine Wood

20 Iron Bars

10 Feathers

2 Deer Hide

We strongly recommend one of these two bows as the arrow drop-off is far less than with other bows. That means it is easier to hit a target from further away. If you can hit targets that do not see you it will also deal bonus damage.

What Are the Best Arrows to Use?

Deathsquitos drop the crafting material but are hard to kill (Credit: Iron Gate AB).

There are 3 choices of end-game arrows in Valheim. The highest damage dealing arrows are either Frost Arrows or Poison Arrows but they both require a lot of materials to make. Needle Arrows deal lower damage but are easier to farm if you can kill the Deathsquitos in the Plains. With that let's look at what's needed to craft each arrow.

Needle Arrows:

4 Needles

2 Feathers

The Plains is the last biome you will go to in your Valheim adventure. So getting Needle Arrows will not be easy unless you have the Wolf Armor set or a good shield made of Iron or Silver.

The Meadows are so peaceful and mellow... (Credit: Iron Game AB)

Frost Arrows:

8 Wood

4 Obsidian

2 Feathers

1 Freeze gland

Frost Arrows require a lot of materials to make. Keep in mind that you will collect a lot of Obsidian and Freeze Glands whilst exploring the Mountains making these arrows a great choice.

Poison Arrows:

8 Wood

4 Obsidian

2 Feathers

2 Ooze

Poison Arrows require you to kill Blobs for their ooze which is really annoying because of their poison attack. To safely farm Blobs without dying you need a poison resistance potion and enough patience to navigate the Swamp itself. These factors make Poison Arrows less than ideal given the other easier-to-farm options.

Which Arrows Should You Use in the Early Game?

Before you get the best arrows you need something else to let loose on your enemies. We recommend either Fire Arrows or Obsidian Arrows which are both easy to make in bulk. Do not make arrows from Bronze or Iron as this is a waste of hard-to-farm resources. Make these arrows instead:

Fire Arrows:

8 Wood

8 Resin

2 Feathers

Obsidian Arrows:

8 Wood

4 Obsidian

2 Feathers

If you are looking for Feathers they can easily be farmed from Gulls that appear near shorelines or in open spaces.

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""

From thousands of stocks 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5 Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand soaring 2022 earnings estimates and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares retail investors could jump in at any time.

This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Jacobs

West Manchester Township

An op-ed was recently published from Ron Ruman of West Manchester Township regarding the sale of the York City wastewater treatment plant. As a former supervisor from West Manchester Township I agree that the suburban user municipalities should continue to oppose the sale and the associated rate hikes that will accompany it. I am also happy to see that the current Board of Supervisors at West Manchester Township have already taken this position from the onset of this issue to protect their residents from future excessive rate hikes.

However Mr. Ruman's op-ed goes on to state that this issue shows ""how little ongoing cooperation and discussion of regional issues and sharing of services happen among these neighboring communities."" I know from my prior 10 years (seven as chairman) of West Manchester Township Board of Supervisors and with some cursory research on current regional cooperation initiatives that Mr. Ruman's opinion is misinformed and just not factual.

The following is just a partial list of the types of intergovernmental cooperation efforts that have been going on in York County for years and is ever increasing. Municipalities share various emergency services through regional police departments and mutual aid agreements with fire departments. West Manchester Township specifically participates in the school resource officer program with the West York School District and the Metropolitan York Police Testing Consortium with nine other municipalities in the recruitment testing and hiring of municipal police officers.

More:OP-ED: Regional group to protest York City wastewater plant sale

In addition West Manchester Township has representation on the York County Quick Response Team which provides specialized tactical police service to other departments for high-risk police situations.

The West Manchester Township Fire Department has agreements with six municipalities to provide fire service if and when needed. There are also various joint purchasing consortiums for road services and insurance such as the Intermunicipal Insurance Cooperative which even extends to municipalities in Lancaster County.

There is the sharing of information and facilities through organization such as the York County Municipal Administrators Association the York County Zoning Officers Association the Government Finance Officers Association and the York County Chiefs of Police Association that meet monthly to discuss issues of common interest.

West Manchester participates in the York County Stormwater Consortium and the Regional Chesapeake Bay Pollutant Reduction Plan the York Area Metropolitan Planning Organization for transportation planning and various other regional organizations such as the county-wide board of assessment and the Uniform Construction Code Board of Appeals.

West Manchester Township participated in the drafting of the York County Economic Action Plan with the county and private businesses to help and provide a sustainable equitable and dynamic economy that benefits all of York County and has a representative on the Pennsylvania State Association of Township Supervisors' Township Mangers' Committee to provide opinions and guidance on statewide municipal issues.

In additional to these and several more the township has many informal agreements with neighboring municipalities that benefit our township and its residents.

Many of these aforementioned efforts save time save money increase efficiency and generally provide a forum for the sharing of ideas and problem-solving which is invaluable. I believe it is apparent that the municipalities Mr. Ruman references in his op-ed are already doing what he suggests and more and have been doing so with increasing frequency for years.

There is always more that can be done and I have faith that as in the past more and more cooperative efforts will continue to emerge where they make sense for each participating municipality. It is just uniformed or disingenuous to say otherwise.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzA2L3NlY3JldC1iZWhpbmQtamFjb2ItZGVncm9tcy12ZWxvY2l0eS1kZWZ5aW5nLXN1Y2Nlc3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Secret behind Jacob deGrom defying the velocity odds,"WEST PALM BEACH Fla. — The college pitching coach looking to help his charges tapped an old connection for some wisdom.

“I wanted to see if I could take a nugget to pass along to these kids” Mike Pelfrey working at his alma mater Wichita State said in a recent telephone interview. “Jake’s at the top of his profession. I noticed how much his velocity has increased. I asked him ‘What are you changing?’ ”

Yes even one of Jacob deGrom’s fellow Mets Opening Day Pitchers Club members wants to know: What’s the key to the amazing spike in his four-seam fastball velocity?

On Saturday at The Ballpark of the Palm Beaches deGrom made his 2021 Grapefruit League debut and rode a bunch of fastballs most of them clocking 99 miles per hour to a pair of shutout innings picking up the win in the Mets’ 6-1 defeat of the Astros. He allowed one hit walked one and struck out three over 29 pitches. The ballpark’s radar gun measured one first-inning pitch to Yuli Gurriel at 100 mph although a second gun on site did not.

It served as just another work shift for deGrom officially and unshockingly tapped by Mets manager Luis Rojas on Saturday as the starter for the April 1 season opener in Washington. His four-seamer averaged 98.6 mph last year remarkably the fourth consecutive season the 32-year-old has turned up the gas dating back to his jump from 93.9 mph in 2016 to 95.1 mph in 2017. As MLB.com reported last year no other pitcher has sniffed such a dramatic velocity elevation especially to such heights since the birth of pitch-tracking data in 2008.

“If I knew how to keep increasing it I think I would keep trying to increase it even more” a smiling deGrom said on Saturday after his outing.

Jacob deGrom Corey Sipkin

The two-time National League Cy Young Award winner added: “I honestly think that it’s being more comfortable with my delivery. … For me it was really learning my delivery and being able to repeat that. For me it’s trying to stay as smooth as I can on the mound.”

Mets pitching coach Jeremy Hefner agreed with that analysis saying recently “All of the things you attribute to his velocity add on the ability to repeat his delivery.”

The ability to expertly repeat one’s delivery can stem from natural gifts mental work and physical work. DeGrom checks all three boxes. Start with his athleticism. Much like Hall of Fame closer Mariano Rivera whom the Yankees often jokingly called their best center fielder deGrom a college shortstop faces an easier task than many because of his gifts.

As Hefner said of deGrom’s pretty mechanics “Some of them he knows some he does naturally.”

Then move to his self-awareness of his delivery. Said Hefner: “I think just in general Jake is an expert at his mechanics. He continues to get better.”

DeGrom noted on Saturday: “My first live [batting practice] and my second live I threw [this spring] I didn’t feel like this. And instantly I could tell that I was a little off.”

The physical commitment to such delivery mastery requires the most time and effort and might carry a velocity bonus. For years now deGrom has been throwing off a mound twice between starts defying the current conventional wisdom and honoring the belief system of Cy Young Award winners and Hall of Famers from a generation ago.

“For practical purposes if the mound is our office Leo used to say ‘If you want to work get in your office’ ” John Smoltz the MLB Network and Fox analyst said in a telephone interview. “ ‘Don’t pound the pavement.’ ” Smoltz was referring to Leo Mazzone the longtime Braves pitching coach who following the wisdom of his mentor Johnny Sain oversaw the rise of Smoltz Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux to a total of six NL Cy Young Awards (Maddux also won one with the Cubs) and three Cooperstown inductions.

“If I pitched on a Monday then Wednesday and Thursday were my side sessions” Smoltz said. “I’d throw 10 minutes for each side session. I got familiar with all of my pitches and connected with my mechanics.

“You felt like you were pitching in a four-man rotation because you were fresher. When I got out there on that fifth day that helped me throw strikes. I had to hone in and get my athleticism back on the mound in repetitive fashion.”

Smoltz and deGrom discussed this a few years ago.

“I explained to him what we had done and the purpose of what we did. It was obviously a different set of standards back then” Smoltz said. “The premise is any pitcher that can repeat his mechanics has the opportunity to get better as time goes on. That’s what Jacob does so well.”

Two days after a start deGrom throws only fastballs usually 10 of them to the glove side (outside to a righty hitter). The next day he clocks a more traditional full bullpen session.

DeGrom mentioned this routine to Pelfrey and when Pelfrey asked deGrom how this routine made him feel come the dog days of August and September deGrom replied “I’ve never felt better.”

“Throwing twice in between starts works for some guys and for others maybe not” Hefner said. “For Jake he certainly found the recipe to be a generational pitcher.”

If modern-day baseball science doesn’t authoritatively support the notion that throwing off a mound more leads to better velocity “The mental side of finding the routine that works for you the comfort in that has got to be something” Hefner said. “Baseball players are very ritualistic. The more they can stay in their routines that freedom can help them be more athletic when the lights turn on.”

The lights will turn on April 1 as will the radar guns. DeGrom good health permitting will get to work on both his personal and team goals. And if his fastball ticks up some more? It’ll make his saga all the more compelling the buzz around each start all the more tantalizing and the secrets to his success all the more intriguing to others desiring to tap into his magic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL2VsZWN0aW9uLWFuZC1jYW1wYWlnbnMvaGFycmlldC1qYWNvYi1hLWZyZWUtd29tYW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harriet Jacobs' Story: A Slave Narrative,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.laprogressive.com/election-and-campaigns/harriet-jacob-a-free-woman on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL2VsZWN0aW9uLWFuZC1jYW1wYWlnbnMvaGFycmlldC1qYWNvYi1hLWZyZWUtd29tYW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdGl6ZW4uY28uemEvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2Rlc2lnbmluZy11bmZvcmdldHRhYmxlLXNwYWNlcy1qb2huLWphY29icy1hLXRvcC0xMDAtaW50ZXJpb3ItZGVzaWduZXIv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2l0aXplbi5jby56YS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZGVzaWduaW5nLXVuZm9yZ2V0dGFibGUtc3BhY2VzLWpvaG4tamFjb2JzLWEtdG9wLTEwMC1pbnRlcmlvci1kZXNpZ25lci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Designing unforgettable spaces – John Jacob’s a top 100 interior designer,"Designing unforgettable spaces – John Jacob’s a top 100 interior designer

The talented local interior designer has appeared in the Andrew Martin Interior Design Review as one of the world’s top 100 designers for 2020.

One of South Africa’s best-known interior designers John Jacob Zwiegelaar’s passion and drive for creating beautiful spaces has received international acclaim.

Recognised once again by the Andrew Martin Interior Design Review as one of the world’s top 100 designers for 2020 this accomplishment is no easy feat even though he has appeared three times before.

Zwiegelaar said he was always interested in making amazing spaces spaces that could uplift people as he knew the world of creativity was where he was meant to be.

His path didn’t necessarily begin like this he started at a culinary school in Ireland after he matriculated. In the grand scheme of things he wanted to be in the restaurant and hotel industry.

“I realised during my studies at university that my interests were more in design and the designing of spaces. It wasn’t a complete 180 degree change of how my life would work out. It happened quite easily I fell into the right thing almost immediately.”

His company John Jacob Interiors’ work is quite broad ranging from contemporary to traditional styles including architectural design custom furniture design and the decoration of the interiors.

“If you look at all my projects together you wouldn’t say the same person made the designs because they are so different. For me the design isn’t about a look or a particular look it’s more about putting things together in a way that is harmonious and works nicely together.”

For the talented luxury interior designer this is his key approach putting things beautifully together. The same is done when he’s working with clients’ inspirations or ideas. A collaboration of making their “dreams come true” he adds “to make something that would be amazing and have that experience when they walk into their homes”.

Using an analogy of clothing Zwiegelaar is the friend who wants you to look great at all times never allowing you to walk out looking less than your best. The way your outfit is put together is important so give him a style and he will do his magic.

Having achieved so much in his career the accolade of appearing in the Andrew Martin Interior Designer Review for the fourth time he said it’s still pretty cool.

“I am more excited for my clients because of their projects their dreams get published in this international directory. Their hard work money that they put into it their time working on the design they like then it gets recognised internationally I love that feeling for them.”

Being in an industry where it is easy to fall into the latest trends and most talked-about styles the interior designer tries to avoid this as much as possible doing the opposite of the trend – on purpose.

The colours of gold emerald green and dark tones has been on trend for some time. Zwiegelaar says he wouldn’t choose these colours rather a contrast to this – such as monochrome.

“Something that is created special should not be pirated from what’s going around it. My job is making something that is almost weird to look at it ends up having much more power it’s more unique and its own thing. It almost looks more sophisticated more bespoke.

“If you walk into something that you have already seen before it’s not going to be special is it?”

The effects of the pandemic were felt by many businesses but John Jacob Interiors has never been busier. There was a huge upsurge in people wanting to redo their homes. The designer says his client base is a niche and wealthy market.

“It is such a small percentage of people those people generally always have money. What I have found is during lockdown people have become so much more accustomed to their spaces their houses and we are now spending more time in our spaces. They are much less interested in leaving their homes as they have gotten used to staying indoors.”

The more people stay at home the more likely they want to retouch or redo their spaces. He’s learning more about the technical side of design understanding the construction aspect not just applying finishes and adding colour.

“Those things matter but what you ultimately experience when you walk into a building is spatial proportions ceiling heights door heights and what the building looks into. ”

His advice for people looking to redecorate or change up their homes is first to look at the space you have what the views are what the spaces feel like and what should be expanded or closed up.

This is where one should start before picking the furniture.

“Those small architecture touches often make things look so much more expensive and classier.”

Constantly looking for ways to build on the next project improve and do better on each Zwiegelaar’s consistency shows in his stunning designs.

Running back Duke Johnson announced his retirement Sunday after playing eight seasons in the NFL.

Drafted in the third round by the Cleveland Browns in 2015 out of the University of Miami where he became the school's all-time leading rusher Johnson played for four NFL teams. He last played in the league in 2022 when he appeared in a game for the Buffalo Bills.

""8 Years 4 teams with 1 goal in mind create a better life for my family"" he posted to Instagram. ""I never dreamed of being the all time leading rusher of my dream school or being somewhere on the list of all time players to come out of South FL. I just wanted an opportunity to play a game to provide a better life for my family and I was able to do just that. I want to thank each team for giving me the chance to play and represent your organization and all the fans that supported me through the highs and lows.""

He added: ""Last but DEFINITELY NOT LEAST I want to thank my GOD for allowing me to take this journey and end it in the same health I started it in. With that being said I'm officially retiring from the NFL. I hope I left a greater impression on y'all that's bigger than football.""

Four men in black tactical gear pinned him his face to the concrete to cuff his hands behind his back.

He did not resist. He couldn’t. He was so gravely dehydrated he would be dead by their next shift change.

House Speaker Mike Johnson continues to oversee one of the narrowest House majorities in history leaving little margin for error as he navigates his conference and faces threats to his leadership.

Republicans control 217 seats while Democrats control 213 after Democratic Rep. Tim Kennedy of New York was sworn in Monday evening. There are currently five vacant seats.

That breakdown leaves Republicans with a one-vote margin which means they can only afford one defection from within their conference to still pass legislation on a party-line when all members are present and voting. A tie vote in the House is a fail.

In addition to the tight margin there is always the possibility that absences can further impact the vote math.

The tight vote margin means that any individual member has the potential to exert outsized influence and Johnson has frequently felt pressure from his right flank.

The extremely narrow margin has forced the speaker to put high-profile bills directly onto the floor under a procedural move known as suspension of the rules in certain instances as his right flank has increasingly taken to tanking rule votes on the floor in a show of protest.

But that strategy compels the need for a two-thirds majority to pass bills requiring significant Democratic support and further alienating Johnson from the right wing of his conference.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ290cmlidW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA2L2pvaG5zb24tcHVsbHMtcGxhbnMtbWlncmFudC1zaGVsdGVyLTExdGgtd2FyZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Johnson reverses course on moving migrants from downtown to proposed shelter in 11th Ward after stiff opposition ...,"Mayor Brandon Johnson announced Monday he is pulling his proposal to move migrants from downtown to a new shelter in the South Side 11th Ward before the Democratic National Convention in the face of stiff opposition from the local alderman and the building’s owners the latest setback in the administration’s attempts to house asylum-seekers.

The change came after the owners of the property said Johnson never informed them of his plans to use the building at 3951 S. Canal St. for a shelter. When the Tribune asked the city about that apparent disconnect the Department of Family and Support Services released a Monday statement saying the city is “no longer considering” doing so.

“We were surprised to hear news reports of the City’s plan to possibly use our property as a migrant shelter” Bajaj Medical the pharmaceutical company that owns the building in the New City neighborhood said in a Sunday statement. “Bajaj Medical has not been contacted by City officials and has not approved and does not intend to approve any public use of this property.”

DFSS’ statement acknowledged that was true but clarified that “while City staff had not had conversations with the owner there were conversations held with the owner’s broker of the property and our vendor.”

Representatives with Bajaj Medical which lists Ram Chakroborty as its registered agent in state business records did not respond to a request for further comment on Monday.

Ald. Nicole Lee 11th told the Tribune earlier on Sunday that the “pretty shocking” communication breakdown points to a larger pattern of the Johnson administration’s shaky leadership on the migrant crisis.

“What’s going on? What’s going on that nobody was in touch with the owners?” Lee said. “This shines a big light and calls into question how this is being managed and the people that we have working for the city … That just is mind-blowing to me.”

Reached for comment Monday after the plan was killed Lee said she was “pleased and grateful.” But her blistering critiques from the previous day reflected new levels of frustration from the alderman who represents Chinatown and Bridgeport after being appointed by Mayor Lori Lightfoot and then winning a full term.

Lee had said the proposal to house migrants in an industrial area surrounded by train tracks elicited environmental and safety concerns. But what most disappointed her was the administration’s explanation that the move was because of the planned closure of a downtown migrant shelter before the Democratic National Convention comes to Chicago in August she said.

“I was told that the location would need renovations that they needed to get everything done and ready for a July 1 move-in ahead of the DNC” Lee said Sunday. “It was pretty disturbing. … It seemed that they were down a path and I’m hoping that we’ve as a city learned a lot of lessons from all of the experiences in the last year with opening shelters.”

The fate of the 41000-plus asylum-seekers who have arrived in Chicago since 2022 has been an ongoing quandary for Johnson who has struggled with how to move expeditiously to house them in shelters without angering the city’s 50 aldermen a role that comes with being territorial over ward matters. Attempts to place asylum-seekers in sites from the Far Northwest Side to Roseland have run into a seemingly never-ending cascade of grumbles from council members across the political spectrum.

One of the most high-profile conflicts concerned Ald. Julia Ramirez 12th a freshman progressive who ultimately prevailed in seeing a proposed winterized base camp for 2000 migrants scrapped after Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration yanked funding away due to environmental concerns. Other aldermen have been less successful.

Lee is more of a political moderate within the City Council and endorsed Johnson’s runoff opponent Paul Vallas after her chosen candidate Lightfoot was knocked out of the running. However she has voted with Johnson to give him some slim City Council wins: She backed the Gaza cease-fire resolution that prevailed in a tie-breaker vote cast by the mayor and Johnson’s recent move to allocate another $70 million in city funds to address the migrant crisis.

On Sunday the alderman signaled those days may be over: “The city has been spending an inordinate amount of money in response to this. … I see what we’re getting in return. We’re paying Ritz-Carlton rates for Motel Six service.”

Johnson’s team has been vexed by the aldermanic pushback with his chief of staff Cristina Pacione-Zayas often stressing in reporter briefings that the city is in crisis mode and council members need to step up and meet the administration halfway.

The DFSS statement on the shelved 11th Ward proposal on Monday said “As part of our commitment to foster transparency and inclusivity Ald. Lee was given notice early in the process in an effort to gather feedback and information about this potential site. This site was under preliminary consideration and a site visit by various City departments had not been conducted.”

Bajaj Medical has contributed $1001 to Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart and $2800 to the 11th Ward Democrats according to state campaign finance records.

Complicating the matter further still is the mayor’s task to showcase Chicago’s strengths — including its reputation as a pro-immigrant city — on a national stage at the DNC. Johnson has long pointed to the way his own election energized young progressives and reflected the party’s leftward shift as proof Chicago is the perfect place to celebrate President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign.

Republicans though have highlighted past scenes of migrant families sleeping outside Chicago police stations to make the case Biden is weak on immigration and the nation’s eyes will be on the United Center as well as the downtown business district during the affair. The latter area is home to the Standard Club shelter 320 S. Plymouth Court where over 900 migrants live. Johnson wanted to move the Standard Club residents to the Canal Street building according to Lee.

So far a sudden escalation of migrant buses sent north from Texas has not repeated itself but few within Chicago government are counting on that reprieve to last as the Democratic Party event draws near.

Johnson meanwhile dodged questions Monday on the botched 11th Ward shelter plans by blaming Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for sending migrant buses to Chicago.

“We have to be prepared for things that we don’t have control of one of which is the behavior of the governor of Texas” the mayor told reporters before making a reference to the recent rap beef between artists Kendrick Lamar and Drake. “Now I’m not quite sure if he’s auditioning to come up with a diss track for the state of Illinois or the city of Chicago but the fact of the matter is his behavior has caused chaos around this country.”

As the largest bank in the U.S. with more than $3.3 trillion in assets JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.78%) may be hard to fathom as a candidate for continuing growth. But the bank has lots of opportunities to expand geographically and within its various business lines. In fact the bank announced back in January that it plans to increase its investments in its operations from $10 billion in 2020 to roughly $12.4 billion this year.

JPMorgan CFO Jennifer Piepszak spoke about those investments in a little more detail at the recent Credit Suisse Financial Services Forum. Let's take a look at what Piepszak said and dig into JPMorgan's growth areas.

1. Market expansion in the U.S.

A few years ago JPMorgan began launching retail branches in cities and markets in the U.S. where it didn't have a brick-and-mortar presence. It may surprise you to know that up until a few years ago the largest bank in the U.S. didn't have a single retail branch in major U.S. cities like Boston Pittsburgh the District of Columbia and Philadelphia. Expansion in these cities has already been successful with JPMorgan quickly building up strong deposit balances at many of its new branches.

Piepszak said the bank expects to be in all of the lower 48 U.S. states soon and I imagine the bank will keep bulking up its retail presence where it sees opportunities. Although most banks are shrinking their branch footprints a right-sized branch can create a lot of value for a bank by bringing in new deposits and new banking relationships with consumers and businesses. Piepszak said that adding a physical branch presence in new states enables the bank to bring in business it couldn't have otherwise.

2. Wealth management

JPMorgan Chase's asset and wealth management division had a great year in 2020. The unit which has more than $2.7 trillion in assets under management generated $14.2 billion in total revenue and delivered a 28% return on equity in 2020. But Piepszak believes the unit particularly the wealth management segment is capable of so much more with its existing clients. She noted that JPMorgan serves 50% of households with a net worth between $1 million and $10 million yet only 5% of those customers invest with JPMorgan.

3. Asset management

Although JPMorgan reports its asset and wealth management in one division they are two separate business operations. Wealth management focuses on an individual or family's overall financial well-being through services such as retirement planning tax planning insurance and more. Meanwhile asset management is more focused on clients strictly investing money in stocks bonds mutual funds and other financial instruments to grow wealth although the lines between wealth and asset management can certainly get blurry at times.

In recent years as the industry has dealt with higher expenses and lower management fees the asset management industry has become ripe for consolidation to add scale. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has not been shy about wanting to participate in that consolidation so look for the bank to grow its asset management business to essentially make it more efficient and profitable within the bank.

4. Wholesale payments

Piepszak said she sees opportunities in the bank's consumer and wholesale payments businesses. Wholesale payments include merchant services which offers merchants payment-processing capabilities including fraud and risk management and data and analytics. Through merchant services businesses of all sizes can accept payments via credit and debit cards and payments in multiple currencies. Wholesale payments also includes treasury services which help businesses manage their transactions investments and information services. Obviously these are all services for businesses so branch expansion in the U.S. and global growth will bring in new business clients to the bank that can help further fuel this business line.

5. Consumer payments

A few months ago JPMorgan acquired several parts of a private company called cxLoyalty including the company's tech platforms travel agency gift card and points businesses. It seems like a weird time to be buying a travel loyalty credit card program but the bank obviously believes travel will soon rebound. JPMorgan is one of the largest issuers of credit cards. By owning the travel rewards companies it will be able to offer existing and new credit card holders special deals related to travel.

6. China

China is beginning to ease some of its trading and banking restrictions as it looks to encourage more foreign investment in the country. In June of last year the China Securities Regulatory Commission ruled that JPMorgan could fully own and operate a futures subsidiary in China making it the first completely foreign-owned futures business in the country. JPMorgan is looking to do something similar in China with wealth management as well. Wading further into one of the world's largest economies is sure to provide plenty of growth opportunities for JPMorgan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlY2xpbWF0ZW5ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvMDcwMzIwMjEvYWdyaWN1bHR1cmUtYmFua3MtY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2UtZW1pc3Npb25zLW1lYXQtZGFpcnktYmxhY2tyb2NrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big Banks Make a Dangerous Bet on the World's Growing Demand for Food,"As global banking giants and investment firms vow to divest from polluting energy companies they’re continuing to bankroll another major driver of the climate crisis: food and farming corporations that are responsible directly or indirectly for cutting down vast carbon-storing forests and spewing greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.

These agricultural investments largely unnoticed and unchecked represent a potentially catastrophic blind spot.

“Animal protein and even dairy is likely and already has started to become the new oil and gas” said Bruno Sarda the former North America president of CDP a framework through which companies disclose their carbon emissions. “This is the biggest source of emissions that doesn’t have a target on its back.”

By pouring money into emissions-intensive agriculture banks and investors are making a dangerous bet on the world’s growing demand for food especially foods that are the greatest source of emissions in the food system: meat and dairy.

Agriculture and deforestation largely driven by livestock production are responsible for nearly one quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. By 2030 livestock production alone could consume nearly half the world’s carbon budget the amount of greenhouse gas the world can emit without blowing past global climate targets.

“It’s not enough to divest from fossil fuel” said Devlin Kuyek a senior researcher at GRAIN a non-profit organization that advocates for small farms. “If you look at emissions just from the largest meat and dairy companies and the trajectories they have you see that these companies and their models are completely unsustainable.”

Those trajectories could put global climate goals well out of reach.

The American banks that are the four leading financiers globally of fossil fuels —JP Morgan Chase Wells Fargo Citigroup and Bank of America—all to varying degrees have made climate action more of a priority. But these and other major global banks continue to funnel dollars into companies that trade in “soft commodities”including beef soy timber and palm oil that are linked to the destruction of forests and critically important ecosystems.

A battery of recent analyses by sustainable investment and environmental advocacy groups has tracked the dollars. JP Morgan Chase for example has directed more than $450 million since 2016 to leading Brazilian meat packers that environmental groups claim have direct ties to deforestation and to recent devastating fires in the Amazon. BNP Paribas and HSBC are among the banks that have committed to stop funding deforestation from agriculture but still continue to provide billions to companies that have not.

Though they have promised to address climate change Rabobank Morgan Stanley Barclays and Goldman Sachs continue funding agribusinesses directly or indirectly involved in deforestation or high-carbon agriculture.

The banks either declined to comment for this article or did not respond to requests for comment. HSBC and Morgan Stanley pointed to their sustainability commitments online.

“We’re still trying to get the banks to recognize that the land-use sector is part of the climate problem” said Hana Heineken a senior campaigner with the Rainforest Action Network an advocacy group that has extensively tracked how banks have financed deforestation. “As things stand right now there is still a disconnect between banks saying they’re going to address climate change in their portfolios and what they’re going to do about financing.”

The world’s largest asset managers—BlackRock Vanguard and State Street—sell investment funds marketed as “sustainable.” But some of these funds contain agribusiness companies blamed for cutting down tropical forests. And the asset managers are among the biggest investors in major meat and dairy companies including JBS the world’s largest beef producer. None of these asset managers has a formal policy on deforestation environmental groups say.

When reached for comment the asset managers pointed to their sustainability platforms online and noted increased efforts to address deforestation and climate impacts from agriculture in their portfolios. In early 2020 BlackRock acknowledged the climate impacts of certain agribusiness practices and said it would push for greater disclosure of sustainability measures from companies in its funds.

The world’s food system needs to feed a population expected to hit 10 billion by 2050 meaning that the system will have 3 billion more people to feed than it did a decade ago. Global investors and banks see an opportunity in these numbers and in some cases are doubling down.

The climate impact of this could be disastrous with emissions from the food system projected to rise by nearly 60 percent if they stay on their current path.

Faced with these dire numbers some critics are increasingly calling for divestment from the food and agriculture companies with the biggest climate impacts—especially giant livestock and grain companies—much as they’ve called for divestment from fossil fuel companies.

Others are simply calling for more vigilance in policing destructive farming practices and the financial institutions that support them. They’re also pushing for more support for farmers and farming methods that use fewer resources emit fewer greenhouse gases and replenish soils.

“We need food” said Moira Birss climate and finance director for Amazon Watch. “And we don’t need fossil fuels.”

As demand for food rises the world’s banks and investors will ultimately determine whether an increasingly taxed food system fuels a climate collapse.

Big Banks Have Big Impacts

Agriculture is the biggest driver of deforestation globally responsible for half of all recent tree loss and more than 90 percent in the tropics.

Palm oil soy and cattle are the largest commodities behind that loss with cattle accounting for from half to two-thirds as agribusiness interests or their suppliers cut down or burn forests to open up more pasture to graze the animals or cropland to feed them. These commodities known as “soft commodities” because they are grown not extracted pose the most significant risks to forests.

They are also the keys to profit for the agriculture and food industries.

Clearing forests releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide and destroys their ability to store carbon. It’s also a major cause of soil erosion and biodiversity loss which create yet more risk to the global food supply and to public health as the coronavirus pandemic has so clearly illustrated. With the destruction of large ecosystems biodiversity plummets. The species that survive tend to be the ones that harbor and spread disease.

While the burning of fossil fuels remains the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions emissions from agriculture would have to be slashed to stay within the 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius targets of the Paris climate agreement. That’s even if the rest of the economy including the energy and transportation sectors adequately decarbonized.

Stopping deforestation is one of the fastest ways to limit carbon emissions. Yet the world’s biggest banks and asset managers are fueling the problem instead.

The UK-based group Global Canopy examined the companies with the greatest exposure to deforestation including financial institutions. It found that despite making commitments to stop deforestation by 2020 as of 2018 not a single company was on track to cut deforestation from its supply chains. These included a range of companies that rely on commodities tied to deforestation including McDonald’s and PepsiCo.

Banks Global Canopy concluded were the biggest laggards: “Financial institutions are behind companies in setting commitments and policies on deforestation. Of the 150 financial institutions assessed nearly two thirds had no financing policy for any of the four key forest-risk commodities” their report said. In its 2020 analysis the group found 63 percent of financial institutions still did not have deforestation policies.

This despite the banks’ outward claims and commitments to tackling climate change.

In fact the world’s major banks are accelerating their funding of commodities tied to deforestation in Latin America Africa and Southeast Asia. Among the top banks funding “forest-risk” commodities—those potentially responsible for deforestation —are JP Morgan Chase and Rabobank the world’s leading agricultural bank which has said it does not fund deforestation in any areas of Brazil.

Many of their commitments—public and much applauded—have come since the Paris climate agreement. Yet as with the funding of fossil fuels the money they are investing has ballooned since the historic accord. Overall global banks have increased their lending to commodities linked to deforestation by about 40 percent funneling $154 billion in credit from December 2015 when the agreement was signed to April of last year.

Most of these forests are being converted into cropland to grow grain to feed livestock or to pastureland to graze cattle. The conversion doesn’t just destroy forests releasing carbon dioxide in the process it multiplies the number of animals that emit methane an especially potent greenhouse gas.

Financial think tanks and green investment groups in report after report have found that major global banks have made promises to stop financing deforestation but have not lived up to them. Not a single major bank that has committed to stop financing deforestation from soft commodities has done so completely or quickly enough according to a December report from BankTrack.

And no American bank has required its clients to adopt no-deforestation policies.

JP Morgan Citigroup and Bank of America are among the top US-based creditors of American commodities giants Cargill Bunge and ADM which supply major American food businesses from McDonald’s to Walmart.

These grain traders have made commitments to stop deforestation but continue to come under fire for their vast soy plantations one of the largest drivers of deforestation in South America.

Cargill and Bunge did not respond to requests for comment.

Edel Bach a spokesman for JBS said the company has a “zero-tolerance approach to illegal deforestation” and “has made extensive investments… to monitor its entire Amazon value chain to ensure it is illegal deforestation free by 2025.”

Jackie Anderson a spokeswoman for ADM explained that the company has a no-deforestation policy is a signatory to a moratorium on deforestation in the Amazon and is a founding member of the Soft Commodities Forum an effort to stop deforestation and land conversion in the soy supply chain.

Recent research has found that despite making these commitments the major grain traders are still producing commodities that are tied to deforestation in areas of Brazil beyond the Amazon. These same companies continue to be blamed for deforestation linked to palm oil in Southeast Asia much of which ends up in products made by top international consumer goods companies.

The Role of the Asset Managers

The biggest asset managers led by BlackRock are also significantly invested in the meat and dairy industries and in other commodities linked with deforestation.

Though meat and dairy account for less than 1 percent of their total assets under management BlackRock Capital Group and Vanguard are the meat and dairy industries’ largest shareholders according to Feedback Global.

Blackrock and Vanguard are also JP Morgan’s largest shareholders.

BlackRock Vanguard and State Street—“The Big Three” asset managers— have $12 billion invested in producers linked to deforestation including the major grain traders ADM Bunge and Cargill and the meatpackers JBS Marfrig and Minerva according to a recent analysis by Friends of the Earth. ADM Bunge Cargill and JBS in turn indirectly and directly supply some of the world’s biggest consumer goods companies including PepsiCo Nestlé and Unilever.

The report puts much of the blame on the big asset managers. “Powerful investors have consistently undermined meaningful action by agribusinesses and the consumer goods sector writ large” the analysis said.

The asset managers say they have no control over the companies in their funds because the majority of their investment products are passively managed index funds. These types of funds follow a major market index like the S&P 500 which means the index manager actually controls which companies are in the fund.

“Every dollar that BlackRock manages belongs to our clients and more than 90% of our equity assets are invested in index-based funds that our clients choose” a spokesman for BlackRock responded in an email. “We cannot selectively divest from individual companies in indexes that may present sustainability risks.”

A Vanguard spokesperson said that while there is “no industry acknowledged specific exclusion regarding deforestation” Vanguard’s sustainability funds track an index that filters out companies that fail to align with principles outlined by the United Nations. (These do not explicitly mention deforestation.)

State Street and Capital Advisors pointed to their sustainability statements online.

But critics say that the Big Three and other major asset managers are getting a pass and that they could exclude certain companies from their basket of investments if they implemented no-deforestation policies or structured their products differently.

“They could put in place explicit screening tools” said Matthew McLuckie managing partner at Posaidon Capital a London and Zurich-based green investment firm. “If you are going to support a net-zero transition or Paris alignment how can you be holding companies chopping down tropical forests?”

In emailed responses to questions about their deforestation practices McDonald’s Nestlé Unilever and Walmart said that they had made commitments to source their products only from deforestation-free areas: McDonald’s said it would eliminate deforestation from its supply chain by 2030; Nestlé said it would stop sourcing soy and palm from deforested areas by 2022 and stopped buying Brazilian soybeans from Cargill in 2019; Unilever said its supply chains would be deforestation-free by 2023; Walmart said it would stop sourcing beef in deforested areas of Brazil by 2022 among other commitments. PepsiCo did not respond to a request for comment.

Disclosure is Voluntary

Over the last decade investors and regulators have pushed companies including financial institutions to disclose their carbon emissions.

Disclosure is a key first step toward giving investors and banks the information they need to make informed decisions about where to put—or not to put— their money.

Guidelines like those outlined by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and platforms including the CDP (formerly the Climate Disclosure Project) have prompted greater responses from a growing number of companies that see climate change as a risk.

Without disclosures banks and investors aren’t equipped with information about the greenhouse gas impacts of the companies including banks that they invest in or support.

But these disclosure requirements are voluntary and critically they don’t comprehensively reveal the extent of deforestation or other climate risks in companies’ agricultural supply chains.

The TFCD guidelines the most robust and widely used explicitly say that banks don’t have to disclose emissions from agriculture. Rather the task force “suggests banks define carbon-related assets as those assets tied to the energy and utilities sectors.”

That means for banks at least in the framework of the TCFD agriculture isn’t a “carbon-related” asset so banks don’t have to reveal the extent to which they finance them.

Critics say this allows banks and the companies they finance to hide behind their supply chains. JP Morgan’s first report using the TCFD guidelines for example contains no mention of the bank’s investment in commodities with ties to deforestation.

Most of the emissions from agriculture and food companies come from their “Scope 3” emissions—emissions not from their direct operations but from their supply chains. Nearly 90 percent of food and agribusiness company emissions fall into this category experts say but only a fraction of the companies report them. Of the world’s top food and beverage companies only 16 percent disclose emissions from their agricultural supply chains.

Many companies don’t report on the deforestation in their supply chains at all. Those include Domino’s Pizza and Mondelez. And even those that do disclose may not depending on the company include a complete picture of emissions from deforestation or importantly the conversion of land from forest to pasture or cropland.

A Domino’s spokesman said the company provides information on sourcing for its U.S. products on its website and is currently developing a climate strategy. Mondelez did not reply to a request for comment.

Part of the problem is not just the general murkiness of supply chains but a lack of common principles for measuring emissions from land conversion and deforestation.

“In greenhouse gas accounting of Scope 3 emissions it’s challenging to get high quality data because they don’t have a lot of transparency in their supply chains” said Cynthia Cummis a greenhouse gas accounting expert with the World Resources Institute. “The science behind land-based emissions is challenging and there isn’t agreement on the best methods.”

Companies can take advantage of that critics say. The data self-reported to CDP by the companies is not audited by a third party and critics say CDP’s rating system rewards companies for having a policy on deforestation even if that policy is weak.

“In effect you’re taking a company’s word” said McLuckie. “Investors are left largely in the dark.”

‘This is Just About Money’

Demand for “green” investments that meet environmental standards has grown in recent years as progressive investors pressure companies to address climate change. “Impact investing” has gained traction with investors and sustainable funds now control more than $1 trillion in assets doubling according to a 2020 analysis by Morningstar over the three years before the study.

A 2019 report from the Croatan Institute found that impact investing now accounts for more than $17 trillion—or one in three dollars—of the more than $51 trillion in assets under professional management a 42 percent increase over 2018.

In a January 2020 commentary BlackRock acknowledged that agribusinesses have a significant climate impact especially because of their links to deforestation and said that the company would engage with those companies to improve their performance.

“Amongst other things we ask companies to disclose any initiatives and externally developed codes of conduct e.g. committing to deforestation-free supply chains to which they adhere and to report on outcomes ideally with some level of independent review” the company reported.

But some of BlackRock’s sustainable investment funds contain large agribusiness companies with ties to deforestation. For a company to be included in the fund it needs to provide an inventory of its greenhouse gas emissions but not its Scope 3 emissions.

“You have huge agroindustrial companies —chemical fertilizer seed monopolies— in these so-called sustainability funds” said Mark Campanale executive director of Carbon Tracker. “If they’re the answer we’re asking the wrong questions.”

Giant fund managers establish criteria for the risk they’ll take on in their portfolios but because of the lack of transparency and uniform standards on disclosure they may not know the extent of the emissions from any given company.

Companies with supply chains linked to deforestation often defend themselves by saying that the supply chains are too complicated to monitor effectively and that doing so would be prohibitively expensive.

Some companies notably Unilever are investing millions to clarify their supply chains so investors and consumers know exactly where their products are sourced. But many companies hide behind their supply chains some analysts say.

“They try to do everything they can to be intransparent in their supply chains” said Gerard Rijk senior equity analyst with Profundo a Netherlands-based research group that tracks supply chains and investing. “It’s clear they’re not trying hard enough. This is just about money.”

One initiative the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) created a system that enables financial institutions to assess their “financed emissions.” Like supply chain emissions a financial institution’s loans and investments are Scope 3 emissions and represent the vast majority of their emissions.

In July Morgan Stanley became the first U.S. banking giant to join PCAF. It was followed soon after by Bank of America and Citi. As of February 2021 PCAF included 101 financial institutions representing more than $21 trillion in assets.

But PCAF’s methodology a work in progress does not yet encompass carbon emitted from land-use conversion when land is changed from forest to crop or pastureland one of the biggest sources of emissions from agriculture.

Doubling Down

To feed 10 billion people by 2050 the world needs to produce 50 to 70 percent more food.

For investors those are appealing figures.

“Demand is going up and there’s a lot of money to be made” said Merel van der Mark coordinator of the forests and finance coalition for the Rainforest Action Network.

In a 2018 report Valoral Advisors said there were roughly 440 funds in the food and agriculture sector up from 38 in 2005. Those funds managed around $73 billion in investments. “The last 10 years have seen the emergence of the global F&A sector as an institutional asset class with increasing interest from private and institutional investors alike” Valoral said referring to the food and agriculture sector.

Indeed investors seem to be doubling down in part because they’re getting a strong message about future demand. That’s true for food of all kinds but especially for meat and dairy as appetites and incomes rise in developing countries.

A marked uptick in agricultural investing occurred after the 2008 financial crisis when global food prices spiked and investors began seeing opportunities especially in farmland.

“Within the financial sector there’s just been an evolving and growing effort to find returns wherever they can and it’s moving beyond your traditional investments” said Kuyek of GRAIN. “That’s part of the reason you’re seeing investment in agriculture.”

The profits to be made from meat and dairy are especially enticing largely because of rising demand but also because low grain prices have made it increasingly cheap to produce beef and milk at lower costs.

“There’s been a meat-ification of diets particularly in the US Europe Brazil and Australia and increasingly China” said Daniel Jones a senior campaign manager with Feedback. “We know that meat and dairy is a climate issue but why is it that meat and dairy continues to grow? Is it an insatiable human appetite for meat? Probably not.”

Saying but Not Doing

As investors increasingly move toward investing in sustainable investment funds and impact investing grows shareholders and green-focused asset managers have been pushing companies to tackle their climate impacts.

They do this through a range of actions including putting forward shareholder resolutions requesting climate action.

Because the giant asset managers are often the largest shareholders in corporations—including banks—their votes can determine whether a resolution passes or not. And for the most part even asset managers that have committed to addressing climate change often have failed to support climate-related resolutions. In 2020 for example BlackRock and Vanguard voted against climate-related resolutions more than 80 percent of the time.

On agriculture-specific resolutions the numbers are even lower.

In cases where BlackRock did vote with shareholder proposals in favor of climate action the companies it targeted were largely energy companies not those with agricultural supply chains and links to deforestation. Since 2012 the Big Three have voted against or abstained from 16 shareholder proposals aimed specifically at deforestation. (In a notable exception BlackRock voted in 2020 to support a shareholder proposal at Procter & Gamble that asked the company to report on its efforts to eliminate deforestation in its supply chain).

“There’s absolutely a big gap full-stop” said Jessye Waxman shareholder advocate with Green Century Funds. “I think this speaks to the broader questions about what it really means for a firm to be addressing climate risk comprehensively. If you want to address climate risk you need to address agriculture.”

Feedback Global and other critics contend that engagement—from appealing to companies directly to shareholder resolutions—isn’t working. They’re now calling for divestment from carbon-intensive agricultural and livestock companies.

Still other critics say that banks and investors have an opportunity to influence companies toward more sustainable forms of agriculture.

“Our call isn’t for full and immediate divestment from the agriculture industry as it essentially is for fossil fuels” said Birss of Amazon Watch. “It’s not the same. We can’t say it’s all terrible.”

But she added “If irreparable harms to the climate come from the production of food those who are carrying out the production of that food and the people providing the one necessary ingredient —finance—have a responsibility to ensure those irreparable harms aren’t happening.”

Elon Musk’s net worth plunged last week as tech stocks got hammered and Tesla shares’ stunning rise quickly unraveled.

Wall Street is growing increasingly nervous about rising bond yields which could make borrowing more expensive. That could eat into corporate profits which is why investors have begun to reverse some of the positions they took over the past year in high-growth but risky tech stocks like Tesla.

Tesla’s (TSLA) stock fell 11.5% last week. Musk who owns nearly 18% of Tesla’s (TSLA) shares bore most of the brunt of that massive sell-off.

Musk’s wealth fell by $27 billion last week according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index. The decline in his net value is roughly equal to the entire fortune held by Dyson founder James Dyson – the 52nd richest person in the world according to Bloomberg.

Musk and Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos have been swapping places atop Bloomberg’s list of richest people in the world since January. But Musk now sits in a distant second place: $157 billion compared to Bezos’ net worth of $177 billion. Musk remains $21 billion ahead of Microsoft (MSFT) founder Bill Gates who remains the third-richest person on the planet.

Tesla’s stock gained 743% in 2020 propelling it to No. 5 on the list of most valuable companies on the stock market. And the stock continued to climb in the early weeks of of 2021 gaining another 25% to a record high close of $883.90 on January 26. But shares have lost nearly a third of their value since then placing them firmly into bear market territory.

The decline sent Tesla’s market value to No. 7 behind Facebook (FB) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) but ahead of JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Friday it closed below $600 a share for the first time since early December. Shares were down an additional 3% in premarket trading Monday.

Even if Tesla’s stock continues to sink Musk still stands to become much richer in 2021 and beyond.

He received four grants to buy 8.4 million Tesla shares each in 2020. Each of those was worth $4.5 billion at Friday’s closing price after taking into account the $70 per share excerise price Musk will have to pay. Musk will probably receive three additional options grants this year each as large and as lucrative as those he received in 2020.

Musk has not exercised any of his options. Executives typically exercise them when they are due to expire or to free up cash. Musk has never sold Tesla shares.

Musk also is the largest shareholder at privately-held SpaceX. The company completed a new funding round in February. While it has not disclosed the details numerous published reports say the $850 million that it raised increased the valuation of that company 60% to $74 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVlcC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvYnVzaW5lc3MvY29sdW1uaXN0cy9jYXJvbC1jYWluLzIwMjEvMDMvMDYvam9obnNvbi1qb2huc29uLWNlby1ncm93aW5nLXVwLW1pY2hpZ2FuLWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmVzLXdoYXRzLW5leHQvNjkwMTc0NjAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Johnson & Johnson CEO on growing up in Michigan vaccines what's next,"Your subscription supports:

HOLLAND — A pilot project using recycled packaging for roofing material has been completed at Holland's Kraft Heinz manufacturing plant.

The project announced Thursday Feb. 25 was intended to demonstrate the use of roof board made from recycled flexible packaging. The test was made possible by the company's participation in Materials Recovery for the Future (MRFF) a nonprofit research group that aims to prove the economic feasibility of collecting sorting and recycling plastic packaging.

Through the project Kraft Heinz used material made from post-consumer flexible plastic to install roofing at manufacturing plants in Holland and Beaver Dam Wisconsin. Installation was completed in late 2020.

Kraft Heinz uses flexible plastic packaging across its product portfolio. The pilot project will be monitored for performance against standard building materials. If the recycled material performs as well or better than the standard materials Kraft Heinz will consider standardizing the use of recycled material in the future.

“It was a privilege being part of MRFF which not only helped identify ways to curbside collect and recycle flexible packaging but also identified end markets that we could leverage within our facilities"" said Senior Principal Packaging Engineer Erik Groner.

""Our test project highlights the company’s commitment to sustainable packaging and the priority it places on its environmental social and governance commitments. Kraft Heinz continues to search for ways to make our packaging recyclable and to incorporate recycled content within our supply chain.""

The project is part of a larger effort to create packaging that cuts waste conserves natural resources and ensures food safety and quality according to the company. From 2017 to 2019 Kraft Heinz eliminated about 13 million pounds of packaging through nearly a dozen initiatives with brands like Lunchables Kool-Aid and Miracle Whip.

Heinz has maintained a presence in Holland since 1897. Today the plant at 431 W. 16th St. has more than 250 employees.",,,,,,,,,,,,

All you need to do in the morning is grab the box break a package open and drop the delicious packets of pastry in the toaster while you’re making your coffee. And the toaster is even optional if you’re running late.

Plus there are so many delicious flavors available in stores. With yummy choices such as pink lemonade and s’mores just to name a couple of the newest flavors on the shelves the hardest part of having toaster pastry is deciding which one you like best.

Now Kroger is jumping into the ring with a new contender for the top toaster pastry choice. Say hello to Kroger’s Unicorn Toaster Treats.

What makes Kroger’s new unicorn toaster treats so special? First of all it has the mythical color scheme down pat. On top of the flaky pastry is a thick layer of pink frosting with sprinkles in blue pink and purple.

But it’s not just the frosting that makes a toaster pastry sing to you in the morning. It needs to have a filling that is irresistible. So Kroger decided to stuff its toaster pastry with cake-flavored filling in a lovely shade of pale blue. A cake frosting-filled pastry? It’s like bringing together pie and cake for breakfast. Only a unicorn could manage such yummy magic.

If you can’t wait to get your hands on the Kroger frosted unicorn toaster treats then you’re in luck. Many Kroger family stores (including Fry’s QFC and Ralph’s) are already carrying the eight-pack boxes in their stores for just $1.50.

Unicorn-inspired treats have been a food trend for a while now and the magical snacks just keep coming. Smucker’s just announced a new Unicorn Magic Shell dessert topping for ice cream. The shell has a white cupcake flavor with pastel purple blue and pink sprinkles throughout.

If snack cakes are more your style Little Debbie still makes their unicorn cakes too.

Are you ready to give any of these unicorn treats a try?

One bewildering fad replaced another at breakneck speed.

And this new app didn’t seem like it would ever inspire teenagers to do anything creative or useful – like say cook dinner.

Or so we thought.

In February 2019 the same month that TikTok reached a billion downloads worldwide Finnish food blogger Jenni Häyrinen (liemessa. fi) published a recipe on her pasta blog oven-baked feta cheese.

It gave it a hashtag: #uunifetapasta (oven feta pasta).

Jokingly she asked her readers: “Have you tried this viral pasta? I have this morning when I came up with it”.

She had no idea she had just shared a prophecy.

TikTok celebrates 'International Uunifetapasta Day'

Last month TikTokers celebrated International Uunifetapasta Day cooking for their families and boosting feta cheese sales around the world.

The recipe is a simple one – basically Greek “bougiourdi” (baked feta) with pasta: Place a block of feta and a few handfuls of cherry tomatoes in a baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and top with chilli salt and pepper. Bake and mix the creamy goodness with some cooked pasta and basil.

The bougiourdi is a unique delicacy for those who love cheese. Made in the oven utilizing a small ceramic pan the main ingredients are feta cheese yellow hard cheese green pepper and spicy green pepper tomato oregano and olive oil.

Häyrinen knew it was a good recipe but never could she have imagined that the simple dish would go on to impact sales of feta cheese as it did first in Finland and then riding a viral wave on TikTok two years later worldwide.

Her original blog post in Finnish has over 2.7 million views. To put that into perspective consider that Finland is a country of 5.5 million people.

Still those numbers are nothing compared to what happened after American blogger MacKenzie Smith (grilledcheesesocial.com) translated the recipe. Seeing it go viral on her Instagram she then posted a video tutorial to TikTok in January.

Yumna Jawad (feelgoodfoodie.net) liked it and posted it too using the hashtag #fetapasta which now has over 600 million views.

“It’s overwhelming” Häyrinen who loves Greek food says in an email. “I knew it was going viral in the States but the final confirmation was when I was contacted by newspaper US Today and they told me it was viral after big accounts posted it. After that I decided to join TikTok too”.

The Wall Street Journal reported that feta sales at supermarket chain Fresh Market Inc. went up 45%.

Walshe Birney who oversees the specialty-cheese counters at US supermarket chain Kroger was quoted in the New York Times saying that “This is the largest and most geographically broad interest and sales increase in a product that I have personally ever seen.”

While in Europe feta cheese is a PDO (protected designation of origin) product meaning that only cheese made in Greece with milk from ewes and goats may be called feta that’s not the case in the US and American cheesemakers have seen a huge increase in demand of their product.

However Krinos Foods chairman Eric Moscahlaidis reported to the New York Times that they were also able to persuade some supermarkets (Walmart and Costco) to run trial sales of real Greek feta due to the TikTok trend.

“I only use authentic Greek feta in my baked feta pasta and my kitchen” says Häyrinen. “The feta sold in Finland is imported from Greece. It does make a difference.

“In Finland there is also a similar cheese that is often called ‘salad cheese’ but it’s not the same at all. It does not melt in the same way and the taste is not that good. It is a simple recipe so that I would pay attention to the quality of the ingredients.”

As a protected designation of origin (PDO) product in Europe the production of Greek feta follows the strict European specifications under which a product can be certified as PDO. The specifications identify the quality or characteristics of the product which are essentially or exclusively due to a particular geographical environment with its inherent natural and human factors and the production steps which also take place in the defined geographical area.

Feta has been produced traditionally in Greece since the 8th century BC exclusively from sheep’s milk or a blend of sheep’s and goat’s milk.

There are over 6000 species of plants that sheep and goats graze on and of the 6000 species 15% are unique to Greece which accounts for the delicious complexity of flavour in real Greek Feta.

Feta is never made from cow’s milk.

White brined cow’s milk cheeses often chalky and tasteless should never be confused with the creamy flavourful real PDO Greek feta.

Sells Las Vegas Properties For $6 Billion,"Las Vegas Sands Corp. is leaving Las Vegas and aiming for Asia.

The company that had been run by Sheldon Adelson until death in January has agreed to sell the Venetian casino and resort and two other Vegas properties for $6.25 billion.

The buyer is Apollo Global Management according to the Wall Street Journal.

Apollo partner Alex van Hoek said the move “underscores our conviction in a strong recovery for Las Vegas” and the global hospitality and gambling business as a whole according to the report. The hospitality industry has been decimated by the pandemic although strong gains last month put share prices of publicly traded hotel companies back up to pre-Covid levels.

In addition to the opulent Venetian the other two properties sold were the luxury casino and resort Palazzo and the Sands Expo Convention Center.

Sands Corp. plans to keep its headquarters in Vegas and executives have said the company has considered expansions in New York and Texas.

But it is pivoting its business to Asia planning to invest more heavily in its Singapore and Macau properties. Those two places accounted for 85 percent of its revenue as of 2019 the report showed.

The company had been soliciting offers for its Vegas properties at least as early as October 2020 three months before its founder Adelson died at 87.

Sands Corp. paused dividends last year amid the pandemic; the sale to Apollo might lead the company to pay some of the proceeds to shareholders a Jefferies analyst told the Journal.

The Vegas tourism industry meanwhile is heavily dependent on foot traffic and many casino and hotel operators are feeling the financial pressure of Covid. Some operators came up with incentive packages to draw foot traffic to their properties but gambling revenue dropped 31 percent from 2019 to 2020 the Las Vegas Sun reported.

(Tim Atkins)

Whole fish sashimi is among the items that will be featured at Estiatorio Milos' raw bar. (Tim Atkins)

“I have great news” says Estiatorio Milos’ chef and owner Costas Spiliadis who is on the phone from Montreal where he’s been waiting out the coronavirus pandemic for the past year.

“We’re opening on the 15th of March our new baby — our new beautiful restaurant at The Venetian which was always my dream.”

Spiliadis who operates outposts of the Greek seafood restaurant in New York Miami Montreal London and Athens Greece closed Estiatorio Milos in The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas in October to concentrate on building a new home for it at The Venetian and Palazzo’s restaurant row. And while COVID-19 travel restrictions have prevented him from overseeing its progress in person he’s been following it via Zoom meetings and video calls.

“I’m extremely excited and extremely happy with the way it’s turned out” he says.

The new location encompasses over 13000 square feet. Designed by architect Alain Carle it incorporates marble from Mount Pentelicus outside Athens (the same marble used to build the Parthenon) and oak imported from Denmark. While it’s large enough to accommodate almost 400 people seating will be limited to about 175 even after COVID-19 occupancy restrictions are lifted.

“I wanted it to be a more intimate experience not just a massive restaurant with hundreds and hundreds of chairs” Spiliadis explains.

The new spot will have several features the chef has not had before in his restaurants. They include a 35-seat raw bar with oysters sashimi and crudo (some with a Greek twist).

“I’ve only touched on raw fish in my previous restaurants” he says. “In this one I want to emphasize the quality of the fish and the characteristics of the different fish in their raw form. To do that we’ve built a very imposing beautiful raw bar at the entrance of the restaurant.”

Other plans include a room where authentic Greek yogurt will be made in front of customers using the traditional thickening method of straining it through cheesecloth. Alongside the restaurant’s signature seafood market will be a fruit and vegetable market where customers can choose the produce for their meal.

“As soon as you finish visiting the fish market and selecting your fish you move to the fruit and vegetable market and pick out your vegetables. You’ll say ‘Let me have this’ and then ask for a certain way for it to be cooked. For instance you could say ‘I would like that steamed’ or ‘I would like that grilled’ or ‘I would like you to fry me some of that.’ ”

The new restaurant also will have new menu items and a program to cure and age fish on-site — after Spiliadis once again is able to travel to Las Vegas.

The heart of Milos’ menu will remain its unrivaled selection of fresh seafood. COVID-19 has resulted in some hiccups in the restaurant’s seafood supply chain which is known for getting fish from the Mediterranean to your plate in Las Vegas within 36 hours. Once things normalize however that seafood pipeline will be more efficient than ever thanks to a new packaging plant in Athens that Spiliadis had built shortly before the pandemic. He also plans to beef up the restaurant’s Greek wine program to better showcase the strides made in that nation’s vineyards over the past 30 to 40 years.

Spiliadis hopes all of these new additions will take him a step further in achieving the goal he’s had since opening the first Milos over 40 years ago.

“The reason for me ever being involved in the restaurant Milos was to undo or correct the image people had of Greek food. And I think I have done that quite a bit. There’s still a lot of room to cover but we are on the way.”

The final notes of “Don’t Stop Believin’” never subside. They just go on and on and on and on …

You’re welcome for the earworm from Journey and also the stage show “Rock of Ages.” The 1980s rock musical is once more hitting “Play” in VegasVille. The show is all but signed dotted-line style for the former Cabaret space at Planet Hollywood Resort.

That’s why you might have spotted co-producers Scott Prisand and Matt Weaver at the hotel last weekend. The joyous revival is likely to move into the space in December where fans will kick it up again with a shot of Dennis Dupree’s Good Time Juice.

The vision again is to expand the “Rock of Ages” concept to include the popular Bourbon Room nightspot. The club which featured live performances and rowdy MTV videos did silly business when the show was at The Venetian from 2012-16.

Bourbon Room actually ran for several weeks after the show closed at the hotel. That space is now The Dorsey.

Following its time on the Strip “Rock of Ages” moved to the Rio for a year until closing Jan.1 2018 (I remember the night well when an usher chided me for trying to take a pic of the cast’s final bow. I am such a problem).

Since producers have been in talks with The Strat (officials from that hotel caught the show’s premiere in Hollywood in January 2020) Hard Rock Hotel/Virgin Hotels Las Vegas and MGM Resorts International.

We really enjoyed the downsized mobilized “RoA” that ran pre-pandemic on the Sunset Strip. The late Nick Cordero seized the show as club operator Dupree. Cordero whose credits included “Bullets Over Broadway” and “Waitress” on Broadway died last June of complications of COVID-19. That man was a real star.

More down the line certainly from this title which also featured a column fave name-checked in the next note …

EJY ‘Cocktail’ return

Eric Jordan Young returns with inventive musical mash-up “The Cocktail Cabaret” for dinner shows at 3 and 6:30 p.m. Sunday at Italian American Club. The production’s cast is still intact. EJY as we refer to him in shorthand is back in his killer role as emcee.

The cast is requisitely talent-laden featuring Niki Scalera and Maren Wade with a guest appearance form James D. Gish. Philip Fortenberry leads the band filled out by drummer Mark Pardy bassist Josh Jones and sax man Eric Tewalt (who in just a week’s time will have played IAC and also Allegiant Stadium with Santa Fe & The Fat City Horns).

Young is also performing his first solo show at The Space at 6 p.m. March 13. Tickets are sold for in-person and livestream access (go to thespacelv.com for the specs). Fortenberry again accompanies on piano.

The two-man showcase arrives a year to the day after EJY was laid off from his job in Tampa Florida as a director of “Footloose” on Norwegian Cruise Line.

“I’m taking all the things I did over the past year the virtual shows and performances and throwing it into a personalized moment” Young says. “I’m sharing what I’ve discovered about myself and the industry and Las Vegas.”

He’d certainly welcome a return to “Rock of Ages” as a part he co-starred in the show at The Venetian and Rio along with his directorial stints in L.A. and on Norwegian.

“I can only hope the producers would reach out to me in a directorial role” Young says. “It’s a very exciting concept if it’s cool and immersive like it was in Hollywood. I really love that show.”

Totally Vinny

Las Vegas magic practitioner Vinny Grosso says of his new show at Notoriety “It’s just me a one-man show. It’s the right opportunity for what I want to do and where I am in my life too.”

Proving again that the sun never sets on magic shows in Vegas Grosso’s “Totally Mental” has opened at Notoriety at Neonopolis. So has ex-Tropicana Theater headliner David Goldrake’s “M Is For Magic.” The two swap performance times Fridays through Sundays (go to neonopolislv.com/notoriety to drill for the specifics).

Goldrake has been scanning the city for venues for more than a year before landing at Notoriety. Grosso was led to Ken Henderson’s second-level annex by prolific Vegas producer Adam Steck of SPI Entertainment.

“I said ‘I have a show that can work with a small audience and is a small production’ and he said ‘That’s great I know just the room for you’” Grosso says. “The space is beautiful it’s gorgeous and I love what they’re doing downtown with all the artistic changes.”

Grosso is among the many “America’s Got Talent” alums plying their craft in Vegas and has twice fooled Penn & Teller on the duo’s “Fool Us” show. Grosso also produced “Over The Air” magic online during the pandemic.

Grosso has also earned a bachelor’s degree from Villanova University with a degree in mechanical engineering where he learned to create his own original illusions. He’s able to pull off his mentalist act by using innovative methods allowing audience members to be a part of the show while safely adhering to social distancing.

Of his new performance platform Grosso says “With Circa going up a lot of great energy the vibe downtown is great. I am excited about it.” Notoriety on the top level of Neonopolis helps spark that energy.

The synthwave genre has evolved a lot in the past decade. Retro blast-beat pop songs from the 1980s were retroactively cool but it wasn’t until the release of 2011 movie Drive which really pushed the genre into cult status. The seminal soundtrack from Cliff Martinez encompassed the retro-themed distant future of cherry sunsets palm trees and a bygone era of Americana that might not have even existed. What followed was a boom in synthwave and retrowave bands and artists who pointed to Drive as the inspiration behind their ethereal calming and picturesque vibe. British synthwave band Wolfclub risked becoming just another wave in the ocean of digital music but have since proved how determined they are to recreate the genre. Bandmembers Steven Wilcoxson and Chris Paul-Martin recently sat down with Express.co.uk to exclusively give some insight into their work their history and their brand new album Just Drive - Part 1.

Wolfclub have worked hard on their image over the past four years

Just Drive is an ambitious venture for the duo who have already committed to creating a second part creating “the next lineage” of their work. This isn’t an unusual tactic for them however as Steven pointed at the band’s previous records as all being part of the same narrative. He said: “I guess the first three albums with [record label] New Retro Wave Infinity Frontiers and Runaways felt like a whole. A trilogy of albums.” The aforementioned records even had their artwork created by the same artist - James White otherwise known as Signal Noise. White has produced some of the biggest synthwave acts’ album artwork including Gunship Arcade High and even Muse. Signal Noise also designed the poster for Drive. Steven continued: “But then this next album we wanted to go quite a different direction but continue with that narrative that story. “Most of our songs are usually about escape - which everyone needs at the moment - driving away great nights skies stars. All of that imagery that gets pushed a little further.” READ MORE: Wolfclub Just Drive Part 1 album review: Versatile genre-defining hits

Wolfclub release Just Drive Part 1 this month

READ MORE Andrea Bocelli sings Hallelujah duet with daughter Virginia – WATCH On what inspires him to continue delving into the almost happy-go-lucky tones of the synthwave genre Steven thought: “It’s aspirational it’s a dream-like quality isn’t it? “I guess the genre is very filmic so there’s that element to it… I guess we all grew up on films that are based [on that aesthetic]. There’s something about it that’s otherworldly. It’s timeless. It’s kind of like a great place to escape to.” Chris the lyricist and singer for the band agreed and pointed at Drive’s “unbelievable soundtrack” as inspiration for getting him started in the synthwave scene (as well as Saved By The Bell). Wolfclub are not only inspired by film but have contributed to it as well. Last year the band provided some tracks to the score of Joshua Caldwell’s film Infamous. starring Bella Thorn. Even now Chris found it amusing how he received the invitation to get involved over an Instagram DM before learning of Bella Thorn’s involvement in the project. A huge get for a relatively small band at the time. The pair explained how at first they were commissioned to provide two songs for the US box office-topping film but went on to give six to the entire soundtrack. Looking back Chris sees Wolfclub’s 2020 album Runaways as a companion experience for the movie.

Wolfclub are keen to get back out on stage

Another cornerstone of the genre’s distinctive sound is the inclusion of saxophone. Heavy hitters in the industry such as The Midnight and Gunship built their reputation on screaming saxophone solos with almost primal riffs. Conversely Wolfclub’s Just Drive - Part 1 is the band’s first real foray in using the instrument a decision they didn’t take lightly. Chris sighed: “It’s easy to overkill the sax. I think we’ve been quite good sort of not going with the quintessential ‘loads of sax’. We’ve not had sax on our last four albums so it’s been cool just to sort of bring it in this one. “And not just powerhouse solos! There’s a bit of a mix. There are some powerhouse solos but also some floaty really vibey sax as well. “But I do listen to a lot of synthwave and wonder… ‘Is there really any need for sax right there in that bit?’ But hopefully we’ve got the right balance on that.” Do they feel pressure from the industry to include the instrument in their music? Steven shook his head: “To be honest not really.

“The only song we’ve had [with sax] before was Sunset Drive which was on our first album and then to be honest all the other tracks we’ve had… nothing really seemed like it was crying out for - or had space for - a saxophone solo.” Deciding to bring the sax into their next collection of albums simply felt “right” to them (“I just felt it could massively benefit from a massive guitar solo or a sax solo”) and Wolfclub are confident enough in their sax work that they have placed it front and centre in the first two tracks of their new album - Just Drive and A Sea of Stars. The release of Just Drive - Part 1 has already prompted fans to ask for Part 2 (which will be coming out “hopefully in summer 2021”) - but after that? Fans might get a Part 3. Steven laughed: “For a moment we toyed with the idea of a Part 3! But I don’t know if that would work because I think - given the sort of direction of the latest few demos after Part 2 - I’m not entirely sure if it would fit. “But you know we might do! It’s a good way of keeping the releases going and keeping on top of things.”

“I’m just going to have the pleasure of being his mother and I’m going to let him live and be exactly who he wants to be.”

Sutta said her bandmates had advised to her to “just to enjoy it”.

She added: “You know it’s a beautiful experience. The first trimester I was sick. I was sick the whole time and I was eating crackers and pasta. And it was just ugh. But after that it was just exciting.

“To feel something inside you moving and you just connect and it’s like this overwhelming sense of love and protection.

“You’re just like ‘Oh my God I can’t wait to meet you and hold you and kiss you and just spoil you’.”

Sutta dismissed speculation online that her pregnancy would mean the upcoming Pussycat Dolls tour would not go ahead.

The group – Kimberly Wyatt Nicole Scherzinger Ashley Roberts Carmit Bachar and Sutta – had to postpone their comeback shows after Covid-19 halted live performance in March 2020.

“This is such an exciting time in my life and I’m so happy to share it with all of you” she wrote on Twitter.

“To all the people thinking the tour isn’t going to happen and spreading negativity on one of the most beautiful life events for me that’s simply not true…

“This show will go on once this global pandemic subsides and it’s safe to do so hopefully by this summer/fall.

“I was under the couch” Gilbert groans. “I’d never done two shows in one night before and it was horrendous. Elton and Kiki came back after the first one and there I was under the couch with my eyes closed trying to get my voice working again. “That showed my lack of experience” he continues. “Gary Barlow worked the clubs; he learned his craft.” He mentions Gary because they’ve just released a duet of his 1972 hit Alone Again (Naturally) “recorded over Zoom live in different studios” he tells me. “It’s had 2.2million views in the last week.”

He shakes his head and adds “I haven’t even got a mobile phone!” In 1972 O’Sullivan sold more UK singles than any other male solo artist seeing off such stellar challengers as Elvis Michael Jackson David Cassidy and Sir Elton himself. Never conventional Gilbert devised his own eccentric look and initially refused to tour. With his pudding basin hair Depression era flat cap and a school tie that was frequently askew he looked a scruffy urchin. “I arrived in London in 1967” he recalls. “It was the height of flower power; everyone looked the same. I decided to create an image that was different…like the Beatles had done. I came up with a Just William character with a Charlie Chaplin look.” He hired the clothes from theatrical suppliers Berman’s. “They’d ask ‘What production is this for?’ and I’d say it’s for me over the weekend to look in the mirror… “I looked like a freak with my short back and sides” he laughs. “It was deeply unfashionable. Everyone in the business told me to grow my hair and look like James Taylor but I was determined to do it” he says. “Despite everyone hating it.”

Gilbert's songs have famously been covered by Michael Bublé Neil Diamond and Nina Simone

Everyone included his first manager Gordon Mills the late Welsh Svengali who masterminded the careers of Sir Tom Jones and the surprisingly un-knighted Engelbert Humperdinck. “When he saw the pictures he threw them in the bin” Gilbert 74 smiles. “But he loved the songs. It showed the dichotomy between how I looked and how I sounded. I had great faith in my songs; I knew I was going to make it. “I always say you might not be as good as you think you are but thinking you are is good. I know people who had talent but needed someone else to say they were good. I’d walk in to a publisher’s and say ‘Listen to this it’s great.’ It was a healthy arrogance.” Nothing Rhymed justified it. The lead single from Gilbert’s 1970 debut album Himself introduced the phrase “Bonaparte shandy” (for brandy) into the lingo and was the first of twelve hits two of them Number Ones. Crazy times? “Not for me” he says. “I was always a home bird. I didn’t mix. and for the first two years I didn’t tour. I’d go to Germany to record a TV show go to Holland for the radio and be back in Surrey by 7pm.

“I spent most of my time at home. I didn’t party. I had girlfriends but I had a pretty normal life at home.” Critics praised his songs for their Englishness and likened his writing to Paul McCartney and Ray Davies. “I’m proud of my Irish roots but all of my background stems from growing up in Swindon… we won’t talk about football. “It’s flattering to have those comparisons. I think it’s because we use colloquial English and reflect working class lives. Ray is a fantastic songwriter and so are Squeeze their songs are imbued with Englishness.” In the mid-70s Andy Williams wanted to record Gilbert’s We Will but asked to change a line because he didn’t understand it. “The line was ‘I bagsy being in goal’” he laughs. “A very English expression. I let him.” O’Sullivan’s award-winning songs combine strong melodies with conversational lyrics the waggish ironies delivered deadpan. Different countries have different favourites. In the UK it’s his 1972 chart-topper Clair written about Gordon Mills’ daughter (who he used to babysit).

2018's Gilbert O'Sullivan compilation album saw him back in the Top 20

“In Holland it’s Nothing Rhymed in Germany Get Down and in America it’s Alone Again…” – which shot straight to the top of the US charts and stayed there for six weeks so Gilbert had to give in and tour the States. “A disaster” he groans. “They put me into arenas and it went badly wrong. It got pulled before it reached the West Coast.” His musical journey began as a drummer in Rick’s Blues formed by Rick Davies later of Supertramp – both attended Swindon Art School. Striking out alone Gilbert left a demo for Cat Stevens’ producer Mike Hurst but panicked when he wanted to start recording straight away. After dallying with CBS Gordon took over the managerial reins. Their friendship ended in the mid-70s with a legal battle over song ownership that put his career on hold for years. The court ruled in Gilbert’s favour in 1982 and awarded him £7million. In 1991 he took action against rapper Biz Markie for sampling Alone Again (Naturally) without permission. Both cases were seen as important victories for artists’ rights.

In 1972 O'Sullivan sold more UK singles than any other male solo artist

Fans are generally friendly. His worst encounter was in Spain with three well-oiled senoritas “who wouldn’t believe I wasn’t Leo Sayer we had to leave the restaurant” he says. “Luckily Jersey is a small island and a healthy environment. We haven’t been hit badly by Covid. I’ve had the Pfizer jab and no side effects. It’s good to have some form of normality to look forward to.” His grown-up daughters Tara and Helen Marie beaver away behind the scenes leaving Gilbert free to concentrate on writing songs. “Tara does my social media” he says. “They get me to do things that I want to do and stop me from doing silly things” – like writing peevish letter to reviewers. O’Sullivan records his new album next month after his second jab and is planning a full tour next year. A concert in Dublin he filmed in Dublin in 2019 will be streamed live on St Patrick’s Day. He’s delighted with the Gary Barlow duet and its harmonised final verse. His first duet was with the late jazz icon Peggy Lee in 1991.

It was 40 years ago that Queen headed off down to South America to tour Argentina with their new album The Game. And now Brian May has shared how Freddie Mercury’s Love of My Life had a profound effect on the audience in those iconic 1981 concerts. The song is believed to have been written for Freddie's girlfriend Mary Austin who celebrates her 70th birthday this weekend. May shared in a new interview how the response brought tears to the eyes of the band.

Speaking with La 100 May said: “I think it’s the moment when we first realised that they knew Love of My Life. “Not only knew it but would sing it. And not only would they sing it but would sing it with a passion that brought tears to our eyes. “It was a monumental thing because that song wasn’t the biggest thing in the rest of the world.” The Queen guitarist went on to share how much he appreciated the Argentinian fans’ enthusiasm.

Freddie Mercury and Brian May performing back in the day

Speaking exclusively with Express.co.uk May said: “Well it has to be Love of My Life.” The ballad written by Freddie originally featured on Queen’s 1975 album A Night at the Opera. On performing it today the 73-year-old explained: “I have my solo spot which is a moment where I really climb off my pedestal and get close to the audience; which I love to do. “It’s nice to be a rock star zooming around on stage but it’s lovely to do the opposite and go down and be very intimate.” DON'T MISS

The paper ""Capitalizing on conflict: How defense contractors and foreign nations lobby for arms sales"" details how a network of lobbyists and donors steered $285 million in campaign contributions and $2.5 billion in lobbying spending over the last two decades as well as hiring more than 200 lobbyists who previously worked in government.

The amount of money at stake is immense both at home and abroad the center states on its website OpenSecrets.org. Not only is a significant portion of the Pentagon's $740 billion annual budget spent on weapons the report explains but American defense firms agreed to sell $175 billion in weapons to other countries over the last year. That includes deals to sell $23 billion in F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and drones to the United Arab Emirates and billions more in sales to Taiwan and Saudi Arabia it adds.

The practice appears unlikely to change significantly under the Biden administration. The report notes that while President Joe Biden issued an order restricting officials who leave the White House from quickly lobbying the executive branch or registering as foreign agents several of his appointees have ties to the defense industry. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for example sat on Raytheon's board before joining the administration.

And since Biden's inauguration the report states the State Department has approved the sale of $85 million in missiles from Raytheon to Chile and a $60 million deal between Lockheed Martin and Jordan to provide F-16 Fighting Falcons and services.

Foreign nations that are among the arms industry's biggest customers also spend heavily to influence U.S. policy often to the tune of tens of millions of dollars in spending covered by the Foreign Agents Registration Act. However the report notes that some nations that spend the most such as South Korea and Japan focus more on trade and commercial issues than military spending.

Australia the United Arab Emirates Taiwan and Saudi Arabia are some of the other major buyers of American weapons.

Defense lobbyists are also among the best-connected in Washington D.C. the report states. Of the 663 lobbyists working for defense contractors nearly three-quarters used to work for the federal government -- the highest percentage of any industry according to the report.

""These connections make for cozy relationships and highly useful contact lists"" the report says. ""Overworked and underpaid congressional staffers can also hope that lucrative lobbying jobs await them at the same companies who come to them pushing their own agendas.""

The so-called ""revolving door"" also exists on Capitol Hill the report adds. Over the last 30 years nearly 530 staffers have both worked for a member of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees of both houses of Congress or the Defense Appropriations subcommittees and then as a lobbyist for defense companies.

The report highlights former Defense Secretary Mark Esper as an example of the revolving door in action. Esper worked for the Senate Foreign Relations and House Armed Services committees in the late 1990s and early 2000s as well as an assistant deputy secretary of defense before moving to Raytheon's government relations office. After seven years in that job President Donald Trump made him secretary of the Army and then head of the Defense Department.

Pratt & Whitney the maker of the F-35’s F135 engine announced yesterday that the Royal Danish Air Force’s first F-35A had “recently” performed its first high power engine run. Lockheed Martin released a photograph of the F-35A tail number L-001 in afterburner during the static test.

While neither company provided an exact date and time the presence of the national markings show that the test took place after the completion of L-001’s paint scheme. Danish Defence announced on Monday that L-001 had completed its painting process which was said to have taken over four weeks due to the precision required. Unusually for an F-35 operator all Danish F-35As will sport high visibility national markings with both the Dannebrog flag tail flash and the Danish roundels in full color as on L-001. According to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force Command Jan Dam there were two considerations that drove the selection of high visibility markings. The first was to make Danish F-35s easily recognizable when on a runway among other operators’ F-35s and the second was to highlight that the F-35s were not just new combat aircraft for Danish Defence or the Air Force but would “benefit and protect all of Denmark”.

The high power run is part of a series of comprehensive tests being carried out to confirm the system functionality of L-001. Other tests will verify the performance of L-001’s other mechanical systems as well as its electronic systems. Once these tests are successfully carried out four test flights will be made with L-001. The first two test flights will be made by Lockheed Martin test pilots with the remaining two made by pilots from the US military due to the transfer of the aircraft to the F-35 program. Following these tests a team of Danish specialists will conduct their own inspection of L-001 to confirm the results of the tests.

It is currently planned for L-001 to be transferred to Danish ownership at a Roll Out ceremony on 7 April. The aircraft will then go to Luke Air Force Base the current training hub for F-35A operators where it will be used for the training of Danish pilots and ground crew. The first F-35s to be permanently based in Denmark are expected to arrive in 2023 where they will operate from Skrydstrup Air Base the home of the Royal Danish Air Force’s Fighter Wing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlYWNvbmpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8wMy8wNy9ha3Jvbi1haXJkb2NrLWZpbGxlZC1tZW1vcmFibGUtbW9tZW50cy80NjAxNjIxMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Akron Airdock is filled with memorable moments,"No commitment required.

The single-seat twin-engine all-weather multi-role combat aircraft was developed as an air superiority fighter with precision strike capability by China's Chengdu Aerospace Corporation (CAC). It entered service in March 2017 and the first J-20 combat unit was formed the following February.

Currently there are only a few combat-ready fifth-generation fighter aircraft models in the world. Two of those are American-built and include Lockheed Martin's F-22 Raptor which entered service with the United States Air Force in 2005; and the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II which entered service in 2015. While the Russian Sukhoi Su-57 finally entered service in December 2020 China's People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) has operated its own fifth-generation fighter since 2017 the J-20.

China's Stealth Fighter but with a Flaw

It is the Chengdu J-20 – also known as ""Mighty Dragon."" The single-seat twin-engine all-weather multi-role combat aircraft was developed as an air superiority fighter with precision strike capability by China's Chengdu Aerospace Corporation (CAC). It entered service in March 2017 and the first J-20 combat unit was formed the following February.

However when it was introduced it relied on the Russian-produced AL-31F engines though earlier in January Beijing announced that it would cease using those imported engines in favor of an upgraded and domestically-produced WS-10C engine a modified version of the WS-10. While going with domestically-produced technology was part of the equation another was that Moscow had pressured Beijing to purchase additional Su-35 fighter jets as part of the AL-31F deal – and the Chinese military was unimpressed with the radar navigation system and other electronic components on the Su-35 reported the South China Morning Post.

The decision to go with the WS-10C also came about due to failures with China's own WS-15 engines which proved unreliable in its final evaluation in 2019.

With its improved engines the J-20 can reach a reported Mach 2.0 and has a range of 6000 km and a ceiling of 20000 meters.

How to Fix it?

The change of engines has delayed the widespread adoption of the aircraft but the Covid-19 pandemic also affected the engine modifications last year. Despite the setbacks the modified version – the J-20B – entered mass production in June 2020. CAC now reportedly has four production lines working on the lines and each has capacity to produce a jet a month. According to the Economic Times as of this month at least 40 J-20s have been produced to date and China could reach its goal of having around 200 of the fighters in service by 2027.

China will potentially export the J-20 to countries in the Middle East Latin America South East Asia and Africa. Pakistan has been named as one of the nations that have expressed interest in buying the J-20.

Larger than the Sukhoi Su-57 the J-20 has been described as having many characteristics of the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. Some have argued that the original Chinese prototype looked like a cross between those other two aircraft. It features a blended fuselage with a low radar cross-section low jet engine intakes and a canard delta configuration.

The J-20 utilizes a modern fly-by-wire (FBW) system which is equipped with fire control and engine management subsystems. The aircraft also employs an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar to assist the pilot with target information which is transmitted back to the fire control system.

The Chinese fighter has four weapons bays including two smaller bays on the sides of the engine intakes that can accommodate short-range air-to-air missiles such as the PL-10; while the two larger bays are placed beneath the fuselage and according to different reports can carry a total of four long-range air-to-air missiles. The J-20 also has four external hardpoints that can carry additional ordnance or fuel tanks.

It has now been a decade since the J-20 took its first flight and Beijing has clearly gone on in on steadily improving the aircraft. The next step will whether it can meet the production demands to get more of the fifth-generation fighters in service and in the air.

Now is a good time to look at the evolution of stealth starting with the Lockheed Martin F-117 Nighthawk . That aircraft was retired in 2008 but would the F-117 still be useful today?

The answer is that against most mid-range threats like Iran absolutely. But against higher-end threats like Russia or China not so much. Technology has advanced since engineers first dreamed up the F-117 “stealth fighter” concept.

Developed in the 1970s and declared operational in complete secrecy in 1983 the F-117 ushered in a new era that would enable the United States to dominate warfare for decades to come. Ironically the equations that ultimately enabled the United States to develop the Nighthawk have their origins in the Soviet Union with a paper titled Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction . An obscure Russian scientist by the name of Pyotr Yakovlevich Ufimtsev wrote the paper in 1962. While the Soviet Union more or less dismissed Ufimtsev’s work as being wildly impractical Lockheed Skunk Works engineer Denys Overholser saw potential in the Russian physicist’s equations.

Overholser’s work resulted in a concept that many at the Skunk Works—including the legendary Kelly Johnson—derisively called the Hopeless Diamond. But soon it became apparent that the ungainly diamond shape was incredibly effective at reducing an object’s radar cross section. As such the Pentagon immediately awarded Lockheed a contract to develop a demonstrator called the Have Blue as part of its Experimental Survivable Testbed (XST) program. The Pentagon was forging ahead full steam to defeat the Warsaw Pact’s increasingly potent air defenses at the time. That was because it was increasingly apparent that NATO air forces would suffer horrific losses if the Cold War turned into World War III.

Lockheed was successful in developing the ungainly Hopeless Diamond design into a barely flyable design thanks to then new fly-by-wire technology. The resulting aircraft which used a faceted design to defeat enemy radar—and resembled a subscale version of its F-117 successor—first flew in December 1977. While both of the prototypes were destroyed the Have Blue program was a stunning success. As such the Air Force decided to go ahead with the development of the follow-on F-117.

The F-117 first flew in 1981 and eventually entered service in 1983. Lockheed was able to develop an operational aircraft quickly as the company built the jet out of existing components already in use on other planes. The fly-by-wire controls came from the F-16 while the engines were non-afterburning versions of the F/A-18A’s General Electric F404 turbofans. Additionally unlike later stealth aircraft the F-117 was constructed using conventional aerospace aluminum—which made building the jet easier. Lockheed ultimately built a total of fifty-nine F-117As and five YF-117As developmental prototypes.

The F-117 made its debut in secret over Panama in 1989 but its performance was lackluster. However the F-117 performed spectacularly well over Iraq during the first Gulf War in 1991. It also served in several subsequent conflicts including the second Gulf War during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. The Air Force ultimately retired the Nighthawk in 2008 as a cost saving measure as the service struggled to pay for the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. At the time the Air Force claimed that with the advent of the air superiority-oriented Raptor—and eventually the F-35—meant it no longer needed the F-117.

During its time in service only one F-117—flown by Lt. Col. Dale Zelko—was lost over Yugoslavia in March 1999 during Operation Allied Force. Zelko’s experience over Kosovo was the first inkling that the wider public had that stealth aircraft were not invincible nor are they invisible to radar and infrared. Military and national security professionals have never had such illusions but during the 1990s many grew overconfident in the capabilities offered by low observable aircraft. But stealth is mere delayed detection and tracking—the idea is one releases their weapons before the enemy is aware of you. Stealth is not a magical cloak of invisibility.

But the Air Force had always known that stealth aircraft are not invisible or invincible. In fact during Operation Desert Storm contrary to popular belief U.S. Army AH-64 Apache gunships made the first air raids on Iraq rather than the F-117. Those attack helicopters had one mission—that was to eliminate Iraqi low frequency early warning radars operating in the VHF and UHF-bands. Those radars can detect and track stealth aircraft like the F-117 which are designed to operated against radars operating in the C X and Ku-bands. The Apaches cleared a path for the stealth fighters to proceed to their targets deep inside Iraq undetected.

Subsequent stealth aircraft like the F-22 and F-35 are also designed to operate against high-frequency fire control radars. The concept behind fifth-generation fighters—which in some ways are the direct successors to the F-117 tactical stealth attack aircraft—is that they operate with the enemy potentially knowing that something is present in their air space. The enemy just can’t do anything about their presence however—putting it basically—or so the theory goes. But despite its public stance the Air Force has never operated its stealth aircraft without the presence of Navy electronic warfare aircraft like Prowler or jammers.

Stealthy strategic bombers like the B-2 however are designed to operate more like submarines—that is they operate without their presence being noticed. The massive bombers are optimized for “broad band all-aspect” stealth which means they are able to remain unnoticed even in the presence of low frequency radars by hiding in the background noise and clutter. But even then the Pentagon didn’t fully anticipate how quickly the Russians and Chinese would develop low frequency radars with performance to threaten even the B-2. “We've had the ability to map our threats in real time in the B-2 for a while with our Defense Management System (DMS)” said an Air Force official. “But the growth in the EW [electronic warfare] spectrum wasn't reasonably anticipated and thus precipitated an upgrade into a new DMS.” But even the B-2 is not going to be able keep pace with the evolving threat that’s why the new Air Force LRS-B will be optimized to defeat those low frequency systems.

But the Air Force official’s statement also highlights why the F-117 is no longer relevant in the ultra high-end fight. Not only is the subsonic light bomber optimized to defeat high frequency radars it also does not have the ability to map out threat emitters and manage its signature in real time like the F-22 and F-35. Nor does it have the performance to survive when it is detected and confronted.

But that’s the real advantage of the F-22 and F-35 over not only the F-117 but also the Russian PAK-FA and Chinese J-20 and J-31. The F-117 was entirely dependent on an autorouter to map out its course to avoid threats before each mission. Both the F-22 and the F-35 have the ability to map out threats in real time and are equipped with pilot vehicle interfaces that can make sense of that information for the pilot. In that respect the Joint Strike Fighter is head and shoulders above the Raptor thanks to years of technological advancements.

Multiple Air Force and industry sources confirm that the Raptor has a lower radar cross section over a wider range of frequencies than the F-35 (as the Air Force maintained for nearly decade till 2014) but the newer aircraft is far better at managing its signature thanks to an incredibly advanced electronic warfare suite. That is likely why retired Air Combat Command commander Gen. Mike Hostage told Breaking Defense : “The F-35 doesn’t have the altitude doesn’t have the speed [of the F-22] but it can beat the F-22 in stealth.” The operative word there is can. As current ACC commander Gen. Hawk Carlisle told National Defense Magazine : The F-35 has much better “passive capability to determine who’s out there [and] its ability to manage its own signature.”

Ultimately it’s the pilot vehicle interface the United States has developed over the decades at great expense that affords it the edge over Russia and China’s upstart programs—as Carlisle himself told me a few years ago at the Pentagon. Nonetheless the United States will have to keep developing new technology to stay ahead.

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- A young man was gunned down while at work in South Philadelphia and police need the public's help to find his killer.

Monday October 5 2020 was a workday for 21-year-old Daejour Smith. He was at the Lowe's on Columbus Boulevard in South Philadelphia.

""He was assisting customers handling the carts and things like that"" said his mother Deborah Smith.

It was shortly after 1 p.m. when his mother said a car pulled up to Daejour.

""What the detective has shared thus far is he didn't stand a chance. That the car just drove up somebody got out the car and they came to him and approached him"" Deborah said.

That is when police said Daejour was shot multiple times. He died later at the hospital.

Parks and Recreation was one of the most-loved comedies of its time during its seven-year run. The show starred plenty of familiar faces including Amy Poehler Rashida Jones and Rob Lowe. Ultimately though neither Lowe nor Jones made it to the show’s final season. But why was Lowe’s character removed from the show?

‘Parks and Recreation’ won several awards during it’s run

The sitcom starring Amy Poehler first launched back in April 2009. The first season actually wasn’t well-received but its creators who had received similar criticism after the first season of The Office were determined to make it work. The show came back refreshed for season 2 and from there the accolades started pouring in.

Over the years Parks and Rec earned several award nominations. The show received more than a dozen Emmy and Golden Globe nominations as well as nominations for the Television Critics Association Awards. In 2014 Poehler won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy TV Series though the show never took home an Emmy despite plenty of nominations. Time also named the show its top television show of the year in 2012.

Rob Lowe left the show before its final season

Rob Lowe who played Chris Traeger left the show about halfway through its sixth season. On set he was married to Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) and the two exited the show at the same time. Their storyline had them moving to Michigan after starting a family but in reality Lowe wanted to explore other opportunities.

“We had the idea creatively to sort of move in that direction and it totally dovetailed and aligned with what the two actors envisioned for themselves in their careers” executive producer Mike Schur said in 2013 according to HuffPost. There were rumors that Lowe left the show because producers wanted to cut costs but Schur made it clear that it wasn’t about the money. “The more we talked about it the more it felt like maybe this was the way that [Lowe and Jones] get moved off in the next phase of their lives.”

Jones parted ways with the show at the same time as Lowe but both cast members left on great terms.

Despite that Parks and Rec ended back in 2015 the cast has remained close. When the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020 the show’s producers decided to host a virtual reunion special where the fictional characters were living through the pandemic as well.

Lowe was present for the show’s reunion special as was Jones and they were video-calling in from Ann arbor Michigan where the fictional characters moved during season 6.

The reception to the smooth record has been quite good. But how did the duo come together and decide to make an album? They sat down with Zane Lowe on Apple Music to discuss the details about it. “There’s a song on the album that we started in 2017 that was on tour. And it was just a little phrase that we had that we were joking around going back and forth about. And when we got to the studio I actually called him on his birthday and I said “I think I figured out that little hook we had. Come to the studio.” He’s like “It’s my birthday.” So he came drunk. After every take he was on fire” said Bruno about their initial sessions.

They also talked about how making music together in person has a special charm to it. “These days you get so many collaborations where a lot of it’s done through email you never meet the person it’s texts. It’s like a play. It’s all this sh-t and people don’t understand when you get in and you can jam with someone and other artists that could hold it down and you’re bouncing that’s different. That’s the difference and you’re really creating a groove from scratch. You guys are trying to figure out what’s going to work. What’s the math behind this that’s going to get everybody feeling good? What is it? Is it too heavy? Is it not heavy enough? And especially with this song it’s a song that requires so much patience” said .Paak.

Further Bruno also spoke on his hiatus from music (he hasn’t released an album since the blockbuster 24K Magic in 2016).

“Zane if it ain’t fun for me no more – I don’t care. Try to find something that’s fun. To me that’s what success is: being able to provide doing what you love and that’s what I’ve been doing. But if this has ever not fun for me if this ever feels like it’s- Mundane. I’m out because that means that love is gone. That monster inside of me is gone. When you’re a kid all you want to do is be the best. I’m going to be the best. I’m want the best songs. I want this. I want that. That’s still in me I still got more to prove.

Lowe made the remarks on Monday this week after touring Pyxus’s Mpale Farm as well as some groundnuts fields of some smallholder farmers at Madisi in Dowa who are growing different improved varieties of groundnuts using modern technologies under contract farming agreement with the company.

“I would like to commend Pyxus Agriculture for their initiative to venture into legumes production as well as value addition of such crops so that they can be sold on international markets especially in Europe and even in other countries globally. This is a commendable initiative and as government we are very much impressed with this development” said Lowe.

The Agriculture Minister also said that he was particularly impressed with the company’s decision to engage various smallholder farmers to grow some improved varieties of groundnuts and other legumes on contract agreement saying the initiave will greatly improve the social-economic potentials of the farmers due to the availability of markets for their crop.

According to Lowe majority of farmers in the country fail to realize enough profits from their legumes farming due to lack of better markets as well as continuous dependency of growing some old varieties of groundnuts which do not give high yields per hector.

“I’m particularly impressed with Pyxus’s resolve to engage our local smallholder farmers here in Dowa to grow groundnuts on contract agreement with the company something which government is also interested with as it helps the farmers to have a ready market for their crops even before cultivation” said Lowe.

In his remarks Pyxus Agriculture Limited Managing Director Ron Ngwira said his company has put in place various mechanisms that would help the locally produced legumes such as groundnuts and Soya bean among others to attract some international markets around the globe through value addition.

Ngwira said currently most locally produced legumes particularly groundnuts fail to attract international markets due to lack of some needed value addition mechanisms. He added that most locally produced groundnuts need to be value added before it can be exported to other countries as that would eliminate any availability of afflotoxins that may be found in it.

“So far we are working with over 6000 contracted smallholder farmers who are growing different improved varieties of legumes especially groundnuts across the country and our aim is to do value addition here in Malawi and be able to sell final products to other countries through exports” said Ngwira.

He disclosed that so far his company has invested about $1.2 Million dollars for a legumes processing plant which will go a long way in the value addition mechanism drive for most produced legumes in the country.

He further disclosed that his company has been working hand in hand with the department of research in the Ministry of Agriculture to come up a new groundnut variety called CG-15 which is believed to be giving high yields when cultivated across the country.

Ngwira said so far his company through its Agricultural Field Technicians is teaching the local smallholder farmers to embrace some new technologies of cultivating groundnuts in order for them to get high yields per hector during harvesting season.

“Through our Field Technicians who are deployed across the country we are teaching these smallholder farmers some farming methods of growing legumes such as applying fertilizer among many others” said Ngwira.

Leather is a maker’s dream material. It cuts well; it holds a stitch; it can be dyed stamped or tooled; it’s warm but breathable; it’s strong but flexible.

But it has a heavy environmental footprint. Modern tanning uses chromium salts to cross-link collagen fibers creating large quantities of wastewater. And of course the hides mostly come from the meat and dairy industry which many people consider environmentally unsustainable.

A concern for sustainability is a common thread among the entrepreneurs who are working to bring leather alternatives to market. These aren’t the synthetic pleathers found in cheap shoes and purses. Leatherlike textiles made from nonanimal sources sometimes called vegan leathers are positioned as premium products for high-end goods.

C&EN collected several samples and they are in a word convincing. Plants and mushrooms are being made into materials that effectively mimic leather. The tough softness slight tack and heavy feel of leather are there. And each has a sustainability story to tell one that some brand owners think customers will find compelling.

The overall market for bulk leather is around $80 billion annually according to Nicole Rawling executive director of the Material Innovation Initiative a nonprofit working to advance next-generation materials. Sales of finished leather goods total more than $400 billion. Even a small slice of those markets would be a win for alternative leathers.

Tiffany Hua an analyst at Lux Research says leatherlike materials made from plants are the most advanced partly because manufacturing is relatively simple. She predicts they will reach $1 billion in sales by 2025. The next to rise will be mushroom leather followed by cell culture leather. “The issue is scale” she says. “A lot of these technologies are on the smaller scale and can’t really be adopted on the mass market just yet.”

But investors are taking notice. Rawling counts more than $200 million in public investments in nonanimal-leather start-ups in recent years led by Bolt Threads one of C&EN’s 10 Start-Ups to Watch in 2015 which raised $123 million in 2018. Internal investments at established firms bring the total much higher.

“The ideal time to invest in alternative leathers is now” Hua writes in a recent market report. “There is ample opportunity for clients to spread their bets by partnering with near-term players and investing in disruptive long shots.”

Of the alternative leathers those made from plants are conceptually the most straightforward. Blend low-cost natural fibers with polymers and form them into sheets. Getting from that basic recipe to a leatherlike material made at commercial scale however requires careful chemistry and engineering.

Luke Haverhals ties scale-up at his company Natural Fiber Welding (NFW) to sustainability. With renewable feedstocks and an efficient process NFW’s leather alternative has a carbon footprint one-fortieth that of cow leather he says. It’s also recyclable and biodegradable. There’s no waste Haverhals says because cuttings can be folded back in at the beginning of the process.

“NFW is making its bet that nothing out-scales photosynthesis” he says. The firm takes agricultural lignocellulose waste such as cork dust or sawdust and combines it with biopolymers to create a leatherlike material it calls Mirum. Haverhals has patents on key chemical tools such as biobased curatives and vulcanizing agents for natural polymers as well as methods for tuning texture and stiffness.

NFW is growing fast going from 20 employees at the start of 2020 to more than 90 today. Thanks in part to an investment from Ralph Lauren it’s building a factory in downtown Peoria Illinois that will turn out millions of square meters of Mirum and other chemically upcycled fabrics per year. And the firm just announced a $2 million investment and supply deal with the sustainably minded shoe company Allbirds.

Another company Desserto is using nopal cactus for its leather alternative. The cactus also known as prickly pear is a perennial crop that grows without irrigation or pesticides in the dry soils around Desserto’s headquarters in Guadalajara Mexico. “Cactus is a great solution because any farmer—with or without access to water with or without access to chemistry—they can grow it” cofounder Adrián López Velarde says.

The ideal time to invest in alternative leathers is now. Tiffany Hua analyst Lux Research

The cactus has a long history in the region as a food crop. But price fluctuations in recent years drove many farmers out of the business leaving fields fallow. By bringing those acres back on line Desserto has been able to source its cactus at good prices avoid clearing new farmland and stimulate an economically depressed area Velarde says.

Desserto blends powdered cactus leaves with a biobased polyurethane. It’s not as simple as it sounds. Velarde says it took a lot of trial and error to get to a material that behaves well and feels good to the touch. “I’m not a chemistry degree person but I love working with them” Velarde says. “When we finally cracked the formulation and were able to make it work it was fantastic.”

Desserto can make about 25 million m2 of material per year which it mostly sells to the footwear and fashion industries at prices that Velarde says are competitive with cow leather. Its R&D team is working on replacing the biobased polyurethane with plant-based and fully biodegradable resins while Velarde and cofounder Marte Cázarez are expanding the firm’s customer base. In late February the fast-fashion brand H&M said it will include products made from Desserto in its Science Story collection launching March 18.

Though plant leather is at the largest scale today mushroom leather is getting more headlines. Most “mycoleather” makers use the root structure of mushrooms—called mycelium—though a brand called MuSkin uses the caps.

Chitin is the main structural material in mycelium says Matt Scullin CEO of the start-up MycoWorks. He named his leather alternative Reishi after the mushroom species his company uses. A patent the firm holds describes treating the mycelium with polyols such as propylene glycol to impart flexibility and with glutaraldehyde pyrogallols or catechols—which are also used in chrome-free cow leather tanning—to add strength and resilience by cross-linking the chitin fibers.

MycoWorks has gathered $62 million in investments and opened a 2300 m2 facility in Emeryville California last year that grows mycelium in trays. It employs around 80 people. “We’re still at relatively small scale but we’re definitely out of the lab and in production” Scullin says.

Bolt Threads is also pursuing mycelium leather which CEO Dan Widmaier views as a natural outgrowth of the firm’s work making spider silk in genetically engineered yeast. In addition to similar culturing methods he says they share a customer base. Many of the designers he’s shown the silk to ask him for a leather replacement that is similarly vegan.

Widmaier isn’t worried about the competition. In part he’s confident in Bolt’s technology and team. But more than that he thinks there’s plenty of room in the market. “There could be an order of magnitude more biomaterials companies and the space would still be happy because scale takes time” he says.

Bolt Threads is building a plant that will be able to make 93000 m2 of its Mylo mushroom leather per year. The firm employs around 100 people Widmaier says and “is growing hand over fist.”

Mylo like Reishi Desserto and Mirum is intended to be a full-market replacement for cow leather. But Bolt is starting with apparel accessories and footwear. Widmaier says Bolt’s existing supply relationships with Lululemon Athletica Stella McCartney Adidas and the Karing family of brands consume all its output. Automotive and upholstery are “giant giant markets asking for huge volumes” he says. “We aspire to be there.”

Even leather made from fish skins is growing in market share according to Lux. Though it’s not vegan like the rest it can displace exotic leathers made from snakes or alligators which unlike fish are often killed just for their skins says Benjamin Malatrait CEO of the fish leather start-up Ictyos.

A few firms including Modern Meadow and VitroLabs want to go beyond mimicry by making a leather material out of lab-grown collagen. It’s cutting-edge stuff which may be why the firms declined to be interviewed for this article.

Despite the early-stage risk and secrecy Lux’s Hua is watching cell culture leather closely. The tanning is the same but not having to deal with fat hair or the meat industry “could be pretty disruptive” she says. “It is a risky bet but I think it’s worth investment. It could be really revolutionary.”

Michael Maines of the leather goods maker LVX Supply says his customers are “absolutely” interested in vegan alternatives.

Officers booked Jonaven Perkins-Sinapati Saturday afternoon for allegedly firing a gun out of a moving vehicle in Kaneohe.

Officials say no one was hurt.

Police say Perkins-Sinapati is the same man who was driving a sedan being chased by HPD in Makaha in 2021.

That pursuit led to a crash leaving the 38-year-old in a coma for weeks.

A civil lawsuit from Sinapati blamed HPD for the wreck that also injured five others.

In February - Honolulu’s city council approved the settlement.

The criminal trial for the four HPD officers accused in the case is scheduled to start in June.

All have pleaded not guilty and are on restricted duty.

Perkins Sinapati has not yet been charged for the latest gun offenses.

Ron DeSantis barred the sale of lab-grown meat in the Sunshine State.

DeSantis signed the legislation called SB 1084 into effect on May 1 casting it as a bid to stop the World Economic Forum’s goal of forcing the world to eat lab-grown meat and insects “an overlooked source of protein” according to a news release.

Rather “Florida is increasing meat production and encouraging residents to continue to consume and enjoy 100% real Florida beef” the governor’s office added.

DeSantis previously has blasted “the global elite’s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals.”

4 Jeff Bezos and his fiancée Lauren Sanchez moved to Florida mere months before announcing a $60 million investment into lab-grown meats via the Amazon founder’s Bezos Earth Fund. Bezos Earth Fund

The move comes about a month after the Bezos Earth Fund chaired by the Amazon founder and Sanchez announced a hefty investment into sustainable protein including plant-based fermented and cultivated meats — part of the organization’s larger $1 billion commitment to expanding food production Fortune earlier reported.

“We need to feed 10 billion people with healthy sustainable food throughout this century while protecting our planet. We can do it and it will require a ton of innovation” Sanchez wrote in a statement announcing the $60 million investment.

Lab-grown meats differ from its slaughter-free counterparts like Impossible Foods in that they are grown from real animal cells that are replicated scientifically eliminating the need to farm animals.

Impossible burgers and other vegan proteins such as Beyond Meat meanwhile are made using alternative protein sources like tempeh tofu seitan and beans among other products.

According to science magazine Scientific American the US Department of Agriculture granted its first-ever approval of cell-cultured meat produced by two companies GOOD Meat and UPSIDE Foods last June — less than a year after the Food and Drug Administration declared the companies’ products safe to eat.

Bezos and DeSantis’s clashing opinions on the lab-grown meat industry are coming to light shortly after the 60-year-old tech billionaire moved from Seattle near Amazon’s headquarters to Miami closer to his space exploration firm Blue Origin’s home base.

In October 2023 it was revealed that Bezos had purchased two mansions on Florida’s exclusive “Billionaire Bunker” the man-made island formally known as Indian Creek Island.

Last month he added a third multimillion-dollar estate to his sprawling Miami portfolio in an off-market transaction reportedly worth $90 million.

For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

Recent Hilton Cleveland Downtown troubles raise red flags,"CLEVELAND Ohio — Recent financial trouble involving the Hilton Cleveland Downtown Hotel raises a number of questions none larger than this one: Should governments be in the hotel business?

It’s a question that’s no longer really relevant in Cleveland – that decision was made years ago and taxpayers are now facing the consequences: County coffers have been tapped for an unexpected $22 million to make debt tax and insurance payments for the hotel for 2020 and 2021.

That’s on top of the $10 million annually that the county has been paying for years to reduce the debt on the $272-million Hilton which opened in 2016 a companion to the adjacent Huntington Convention Center of Cleveland also built with taxpayer dollars.

There are more than a dozen publicly owned hotels in the United States and many others that have received substantial public funding to be built.

All are facing severe financial distress caused by the dramatic downturn in travel because of the coronavirus.

“This is the worst disaster that could possibly befall these hotels” said Thomas Hazinski managing director at HVS a hospitality consulting firm in Chicago. “They were basically shut down not generating any income.”

Both privately owned and publicly funded hotels have been fighting to survive in recent months negotiating with creditors to forestall debt payments because of a lack of revenue.

“Every hotel owner is having to dip into their savings to pay their mortgages” said David Sangree president of Hotel & Leisure Advisors a Cleveland-based hospitality consultant. “All the downtown hotels are doing terribly.”

It’s unclear however how many government-owned hotels have had to tap into general tax revenue to pay debt as the Hilton Cleveland did in both 2020 and 2021.

The 2014 agreement between the county and the Hilton includes certain financial triggers that commit county taxpayers as a last-resort option for debt and other payments. Those specific triggers are considered proprietary and were blacked out in a media-reviewed copy of the contract.

This is the first time since the hotel opened that the county has had to provide the extra payments according to Walter Parfejewiec director of the county’s office of management and budget.

He said he was aware of no discussions that would require the Hilton to repay the county once the tourism industry rebounds.

The timing for the additional public subsidy couldn’t be worse – as local governments face funding crises of their own and residents and businesses suffering during the economic downturn turn to government for help.

Even so Hazinski said Cuyahoga County could not reasonably have let the hotel default on its portion of the debt an outcome that would have resulted in both a distressed property and a reduction in the government’s credit rating.

“The decision to pay the debt while probably unpopular is in the best interest of the government” said Hazinski.

The publicly-owned Hilton Columbus Downtown Hotel has not had to rely on county general fund dollars to meet its financial obligations. Instead the hotel owned by the Franklin County Convention Authority has tapped a $36 million reserve fund to make debt payments on the hotel open since 2012.

The reserve account is funded by rent the authority collects from property it owns in the neighborhood between downtown and Ohio State University.

“We believe those reserves will be sufficient to carry us into next year” said Don Brown executive director of the authority which also owns the Greater Columbus Convention Center and Nationwide Arena. “We see occupancy and the financial performance of the hotel is on the rebound now. As conventions and meetings and other events return we will be able to come out on the other side.”

The authority is in the middle of building a major addition to the Hilton Columbus expected to open in 2022 which will bring the total number of rooms to 1000 and make the hotel the largest in the state.

Before financing the addition he said “We did some shock scenario testing. We never anticipated the shock scenario would hit us so soon.”

Indeed the pandemic has roiled the hospitality industry in ways that no one could have predicted. Hotel occupancy nationwide last year was record low 44% down from 66% in 2019. In downtown Cleveland it was a dismal 31%.

In Columbus taxpayers in Franklin County and the city would have been on the hook for part of the shortfall if the reserve fund hadn’t covered the losses said Brown. “We’re confident in our ability to remain self-sustaining in the future” he said. “We want to preserve our perfect record.”

Larry Trabulsi executive vice president at CHM Warnick a hotel asset management firm near Boston cautioned against comparing the details of public financing deals calling it “apples and bananas.”

“Every hotel bond deal has unique elements” said Trabulsi who helped negotiate the Cuyahoga County-Hilton deal. “We did the best we could to minimize what [the county] had to put in it. Unfortunately it’s what had to happen.”

A change in tax law in the late 1990s expanded the ability of government to publicly finance hotels with municipal debt making it a popular option for communities that wanted to boost tourism to their downtowns and couldn’t entice private developers to gamble on big convention-center oriented hotels.

Chicago Houston Denver Dallas Austin and Baltimore among other cities all have publicly owned hotels.

Ideally governments shouldn’t want to be in the hotel business said local consultant Sangree. “They’re competing against privately owned hotels. It’s really not fair.”

At some point Sangree said the county could seek to sell the Hilton to a private buyer. “When they built this hotel my hope was that they were hoping to sell it at some point” he said.

He cited the sale of the Sheraton Grand Phoenix owned by the city of Phoenix to Marriott International in 2018. The city sold the 1000-room hotel for $255 million considerably less than the $350 million the city paid to build it a decade earlier.

Publicly owned hotels aren’t expected to be major profit centers said Hazinski. They’re built as economic development generators – to boost tourism to generate convention center business and to strengthen downtowns. “The benefits go beyond the monetary return on the hotel” he said.

Indeed numerous local government and tourism officials believe that the Hilton Cleveland was key to attracting numerous high profile events to the city in recent years including the Republican National Convention in 2016.

Even so Hazinski said governments officials would be wise to take a second look at any project in the future and build in more safeguards as a result of the problems facing Cleveland and other communities.

“This sets another standard for worst case scenario” he said.

Working in the professional services and consulting is a popular career starter for graduates across the world and in Australia it is no different. A global study conducted by Universum in collaboration with Consultancy.org (based on the views of over 250000 graduates worldwide) found that consulting owes its popularity to a number of reasons.

Particularly the possibility of working across a breadth of assignments across different clients (and at most consultancies: in different industries as well) serves as a key factor for the high popularity. This provides graduates with a high level of challenge in their work and a steep learning curve. A large percentage of graduates also relishes the opportunity of working on high-impact issues – projects that can make a difference or reach the national headlines.

Second on the list: a strong focus on professional and personal development. Consulting firms are well-known for their extensive training and development programmes supported by on-the-job learning through counselling on projects by senior team members. In addition at consultancies graduates can undergo their professional development journey with a cohort of likeminded peers which is perceived as a strong benefit for the industry’s attractiveness.

Graduates further value the high degree of intellectual challenge – the bar for landing a job in consulting is high meaning that many of Australia’s top graduates work in the industry. Rounding off the top five drivers for consulting’s popularity are the strong reputation of many leading consultancies in the business landscape and the compelling career opportunities – professionals with consulting on their curriculum vitae are in high demand in other industries.

Australia’s top consulting firms for graduates

Demonstrating the popularity of consulting in Australia one-fifth of the top 100 graduate employers by GradConnection and AFR are either consulting firms or professional services firms with a consulting business. The analysis was based on the views of around 70000 students finishing degrees at universities across the country including those in Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Perth Adelaide Hobart and Darwin.

Based on the data from GradConnection and Consultancy.com.au’s own database of graduate preferences (which leverages behavioural analysis of over 40000 graduates seeking a consulting job over the past year) here are Australia’s top 25 consulting firms for graduates:

However because they’re also among those that have been hit hardest by the global health crisis Mastercard announced its ‘Strivers Initiative’ as a platform to help elevate the visibility of Black female businesses in America.

Tapping J-Hud to serve as its face the initiative includes a grant program in partnership with Fearless Fund that supports Mastercard’s previously announced $500 million commitment to amplifying Black businesses and communities over the next 5 years.

To kickstart the campaign the songstress teamed again with producer-performer extraordinaire Will.i.Am to give the 1967 classic Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell hit ‘Ain’t No Mountain High Enough’ a 2021 twist.

Hear it inside:



﻿

Speaking on the Strivers Initiative Hudson shared her appreciation for being involved with such a forward-thinking program.

“I am fortunate to have been influenced and inspired by so many incredible Black female role models as I’ve pursued my dreams but that’s not always the case for all Black girls and women” Hudson stated. “Entrepreneurship has always been a part of the American Dream and the work that Mastercard is doing to elevate these visible strong Black Women business owners and highlight the support they’re providing our communities is hugely important to me and to the impact of future generations.”

The initiative will be complemented by a multi-city educational road show to help build awareness of the state of women and minority-owned business in cities across the U.S.

Advertising Read more

South African club Mamelodi Sundowns ended the 74-match unbeaten home record in African competitions of Democratic Republic of Congo team TP Mazembe with a 2-1 CAF Champions League victory Saturday.

Set-piece specialist Lyle Lakay scored direct from a free-kick with 20 seconds of regular time remaining to earn the Pretoria outfit a famous win in southern Congolese city Lubumbashi.

Namibian Peter Shalulile put 2016 African champions Sundowns ahead on 67 minutes as Mazembe players appealed for offside in a spectator-less stadium due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Veteran Tresor Mputu widely regarded as one of the greatest African footballers never to play in Europe levelled on 82 minutes by punishing defensive hesitancy from Mosa Lebusa.

""We prepared extremely well for this match against great opponents"" Sundowns joint head coach Manqoba Mngqithi told AFP after becoming the first South African club to win in Lubumbashi.

""The boys entered the match brimming with confidence born out of going 22 domestic and international matches without defeat since last October.

""I am unsure why we were not awarded a goal in the first half after putting the ball in the net"" added the successor to Pitso Mosimane who joined Egyptian and African giants Al Ahly last September.

Five-time African champions Mazembe last lost a home CAF match in October 2009 going down 2-0 to Al Hilal of Sudan in a Champions League semi-final.

Since that shock loss the Ravens won 61 matches drawn 13 scored 166 goals and conceded 34 in Champions League Confederation Cup and Super Cup matches before facing Sundowns.

- Good day for South Africa -

Success took Sundowns to a maximum nine points from three matches at the halfway stage in Group B while Mazembe Hilal and CR Belouizdad of Algeria have two each.

On a good day for South Africa third-place Kaizer Chiefs won for the first time in Group C with goals from Eric Mathoho and Happy Mashiane delivering a 2-0 victory over Angolan visitors Petro Atletico.

Zamalek who lost to Ahly in an all-Egyptian 2020 Champions League final had Ahmed el Fatouh sent off on 58 minutes after being yellow-carded twice as they fell 3-1 away to Esperance of Tunisia.

El Fatouh cancelled a goal by Ivorian William Togai before Mohamed Ali Ben Romdhane scored on the stroke of half-time and again early in the second half for the Tunis club.

Esperance top Group D with seven points Mouloudia Alger of Algeria have five after a 1-0 win at bottom-of-the-table Teungueth of Senegal and Zamalek only two.

Surprise Group A frontrunners Simba of Tanzania followed up a home victory over defending champions Ahly by drawing 0-0 with Al Merrikh of Sudan in Omdurman.

Merrikh bottom of the table with only one point from three outings sacked Tunisian coach Nasreddine Nabi after the match.

Ahly host V Club of DR Congo later Saturday and will lack winger Mahmoud Kahraba who has been suspended for one month and fined $12500 (10500 euros) after reportedly clashing with Mosimane.

Adam Cole Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly immediately came onto the scene as some of the most magnetic performers in recent NXT memory and their faction made them essentially the total package. Looking back on their time together you would be hard pressed to find matches or moments that were not involved with some of the core elements of NXT's programming in one way or another. In their time together the Undisputed Era was essentially the face of NXT. While each member had their own spectacular matches representing the group this list is to showcase some of the best times they had worked together. In honor of the fact they are imploding and going their separate ways to the next phase of their respective careers it's time for a walk down memory lane. Read on for our picks for the seven best Undisputed Era matches in their time together on WWE NXT. There are too many great moments to completely list here so let us know your favorite matches or moments in the comments!

Adam Cole and Kyle O'Reilly vs. Pete Dunne and Roderick Strong vs. The Authors of Pain (Photo: NXT) You can't really talk about the best Undisputed Era matches without talking the most transformative for the faction overall. The match between these teams was already a fantastic final to that year's Dusty Rhodes Classic alone as part of NXT TakeOver: New Orleans but Roderick Strong turned on partner Pete Dunne (or ""Peter Doone"" as O'Reilly once famously joked) to help O'Relly and an injured (and fresh North American Championship winner) Adam Cole to secure the victory. After weeks of attempting to recruit him seeing Strong finally give in and join the Undisputed Era was one of the most satisfying moments in NXT history. prevnext

Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly vs. The Revival (Photo: WWE) This match sort of came out of nowhere to become of the best tag team matches ever shown on NXT. This match between Fish O'Reilly and the then known as Dawson and Wilder wasn't on one of the big shows but it felt big. The four worked together so well that it was pretty much a clinic on tag team wrestling. The four of them even earned a ""Tag Team Wrestling!"" chant in the middle because just of how many surprises the four of them were able to pull off. And it was all just on a weekly episode of NXT! prevnext

Adam Cole Roderick Strong and Kyle O'Reilly vs. Moustache Mountain and Ricochet (Photo: NXT) This was another match that came out of nowhere to provide just some pure fun. Strong and O'Relly's back and forth with Trent Seven and Tyler Bate resulted in some fun matches but adding Adam Cole and then rising star Ricochet into things resulted in a major surprise. Tucked away in one of the NXT weekly airings this match has a lot of fun near falls high flying moves and hard hitting action. It's the kind of mix up that quickly paid off dividends and it's surprising to see that it was rarely replicated after this. prevnext

Undisputed Era vs. Sanity vs. The Authors of Pain and Roderick Strong (Photo: WWE NXT) As expected you kind of have to include all of Undisputed Era's WarGames matches into this list. While the individual members have had their fair share of stellar matches the Undisputed Era truly shone as a unit in their WarGames efforts. Kicking things off with a major match against Sanity and the team Authors of Pain and Roderick Strong this brought the WarGames match as a whole back to life. It went off without any major hitch and was not only a major win for the faction moving forward but also sparked a strong dominant run going forward. prevnext

The Undisputed Era vs. Ricochet Pete Dunne and the War Raiders (Photo: WWE NXT) It's kind of funny looking back and realizing that the Undisputed Era only won their first and final WarGames matches as a complete team. That didn't make any of their performances lackluster either as the faction was always looking good even in defeat. This was especially true for the 2018 WarGames match and it featured a makeup of stars that had a great energy in the match. Everyone contributed something different and brought something new to this and it elevated the WarGames match to a whole new level. It's probably why they kept playing a major role! prevnext

The Undisputed Era vs. Tommaso Ciampa Keith Lee Dominik Dijakovic and Kevin Owens (Photo: WWE NXT) There's a reason the Undisputed Era have been involved with ever War Games match thus far! The best out of their collection thus far has been their run against Team Ciampa. Not only was the Undisputed Era at their strongest as a team here but it was doubly satisfying seeing them take this major loss. Part of the excitement was seeing Kevin Owens come back for the night as the final member of Team Ciampa and seeing Era's chemistry with Owens and the others led to some pretty fun and satisfying moments! prevnext",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNpdHkuY29tL25ld3MvbWVucy9tYW4tY2l0eS1tYW4tdXRkLXByZW1pZXItbGVhZ3VlLW1hdGNoLXByZXZpZXctNy1tYXJjaC02Mzc1MDM4ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man City v Man United: Kick-off time TV information and team news,"Everything you need to know ahead of Manchester City’s Premier League home game against Manchester United.

Graeme McCormick who stood to become SNP president in 2023 earlier claimed he could gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

However McCormick’s decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Swinney the former deputy first minister of Scotland as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down. The deadline for nominations is noon on Monday.

McCormick said he reached the nomination threshold of 100 signatures but chose to back Swinney after a “lengthy and fruitful conversation” and said this could be a “fresh start”.

In a statement on Sunday night he said: “John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months.

“This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I’m sure that John’s determination to deliver independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

“I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney’s nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.”

McCormick’s supporters had argued it would have been undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. He won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution over mounting a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson earlier attacked Swinney for criticising the planned challenge and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was going up against him.

Swinney who described himself as the candidate to unite the party after a “difficult” few years said an election contest would delay the SNP’s essential rebuild. But he signalled he would win any potential contest telling Sky News that party members “probably know the outcome” between the two potential candidates.

His call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.

Once Swinney is named the next SNP leader he will have to win a subsequent vote in Holyrood later in the week to become Scotland’s first minister.

The SNP said it does not comment on such matters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,"Adblocker is on ×

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey leads GOP rival in Pennsylvania Senate race: Poll,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4630466-pennsylvania-senate-bob-casey-david-mccormick/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvZGF2ZS1tY2Nvcm1pY2stZmFybS1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This G.O.P. Senate Candidate Says He Grew Up on a Family Farm. Not Exactly.,"David McCormick’s origin story goes something like this: He grew up in rural Pennsylvania southwest of Scranton. He baled hay trimmed Christmas trees and otherwise worked on his family’s farm. And from those humble beginnings he rose to achieve the American dream.

“I spent most of my life in Pennsylvania growing up in Bloomsburg on my family’s farm” Mr. McCormick now a Republican candidate for Senate told Pittsburgh Quarterly in 2022.

“I’ve truly lived the American dream” he wrote in a fund-raising appeal in October. “My life’s journey — from growing up on a farm in Bloomsburg to graduating from West Point and serving in the 82nd Airborne Division growing a business in Pittsburgh and serving at the highest levels of government — reflects that.”

“I grew up on a family farm from the time I was a kid” he said at the Pennsylvania farm show in January."

It’s been 36 years since Mark Levine decided to join his father Murray in operating the family’s McDonald’s restaurants — a decision he knew was the right one at the time.

“There came a point when we knew that one of the children was going to have to take over the business or it was going to have to be sold and that seemed sad” said Levine who was an accountant at the time.

“So I traded in my three-piece suit and put on polyester blue pants with a white shirt to show up at the training store to train for the next couple of months” he said. “And that was the beginning of an adventure that I could never have imagined back then.”

But now he’s equally convinced that selling his four McDonald’s stores in Washington County is also the right decision.

The restaurants being sold include the Northern Avenue location which has been in the family since 1970 and was rebuilt about eight years ago Levine said.

The Dual Highway restaurant was built two years later as a “walk-in store” because so many customers came by foot he said. The Sharpsburg Pike restaurant opposite Wal-mart was built in 1988 and the Hagerstown Commons store is the newest.

Levine owner of the Golden M Company will be 70 years old in less than a week; he plans to retire at the end of the month to see what lies beyond the iconic golden arches.

But retirement also means saying goodbye to a community that has been a driving force in his life — professionally and personally.

He credits local people who became employees and friends with the company’s success.

“We had three managers who over the years got to the point that they wanted to get their own stores so we campaigned for McDonald’s to approve them. We gave them money to open up their stores” he said.

“As a matter of fact my four stores will be sold to one of the managers who at 15 years old in 1972 walked in and said he’d like to get a job with his father. He stayed with us for 50 years” he said.

Washington County has a “smart dedicated workforce” with many employees working more than one job he said adding that there have been thousands of local workers at his restaurants.

“They are great to work with and we give them an opportunity that they wouldn’t have gotten from some other places. They give me 60 minutes an hour” he said.

“We are also a large employer of English as a second language including Hispanics and a variety of other ethnicities who are important to the company. They take their language mixed with our language for a kitchen language which is understood by Washington County people” he said.

“I am glad to have been able to give so many people an opportunity.”

Giving back over the years in other ways was also important he said including sponsoring baseball teams and supporting other community organizations.

One of his favorite memories is visiting schools with Ronald McDonald the fast-food restaurant chain’s now-retired mascot.

“We would have 20 or 30 events a year where we would take him to elementary schools where the kids were just in awe"" Levine said. ""And that continued until he was pulled a couple of years ago.”

Traveling post pandemic and spending more time with family — including his high school sweetheart and wife of 47 years Ilene plus three adult children and six grandchildren — will now be possible.

“They jokingly say they already see me enough now so I guess we’ll see. My wife thinks I need a new hobby other than work” he said with a chuckle.

“Seriously though I didn’t want to leave in the middle of the pandemic because I wanted to help however possible with my stores and others that have been hard hit. I was in a position to advocate for them on a national level.

“But when you have ketchup in your veins it’s not easy to retire.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL2Zvb2QtZHJpbmsvbmV3LW1jZG9uYWxkcy1kcml2ZS10aHJ1LWFpLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktdGFrZS1vcmRlcnPSAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS9mb29kLWRyaW5rL25ldy1tY2RvbmFsZHMtZHJpdmUtdGhydS1haS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LXRha2Utb3JkZXJzLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New McDonald's drive-thru is using AI technology to take orders make suggestions,"The COVID-19 pandemic brought a lot of changes to restaurants. Since many casual restaurants had to close their doors and switch to take-out only people were ordering fast food even more than usual. And because the ""grab-and-go"" factor is already a perk of fast-food restaurants it was basically a no-brainer for those who hoped grab a meal and maintain social distancing.

Now McDonald’s one of the pioneers of modern fast food has decided to step it up when it comes to efficiency and consistent service. Somewhere in a Chicago suburb an AI is currently taking drive-thru orders.

This could be the McFuture

The McDonald’s app was supposed to help with convenience and shorter wait times but it wasn’t enough for the Golden Arches. There are over 14000 McDonald’s locations in the U.S. alone and 95% of those restaurants include a drive-thru lane which means a lot of us are expecting to be able to drive-up and get our McNuggets STAT.

The AI drive-thru may be able to help. The voice itself is described as female similar to Alexa or Siri. It’s connected to a digital menu and can even suggest food if you’re unsure about what to order.

It can be a bit unsettling to hear a robotic voice greet you instead of the voice of a human employee but it might be something to get used to if McDonald's rolls this out to all locations. Just another bit of tech to add to the modern age.

Will this hel with drive-thru times?

The idea is that the AI will take care of the orders and allow human employees to focus on accuracy and quality of the food items. Fast-food places are always looking to speed up their service to contend with their competitors and McDonald's is hoping an AI drive-thru will help with this even if it’s just a minute or two of difference. It can also be a great outlet for those who suffer social anxiety and find it difficult to speak with human employees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhY2tzdGFnZS5jb20vdWsvbWFnYXppbmUvYXJ0aWNsZS9nZXQtY2FzdC1tY2RvbmFsZHMtcm9sZXMtZm9yLXVrLWFjdG9ycy03MjYxMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Get Cast in a McDonald's Commercial + More Roles for UK Actors,"Get Cast in a McDonald’s Commercial + More Roles for UK Actors

One question we see a lot is about seasonal products. It this case one question we've been getting recently has to do with the McDonald's Shamrock Shake. Specifically the McDonald's Shamrock Shake gluten-free and safe for people with celiac disease.

First the McDonald's Shamrock Shake is not labeled or advertised as gluten-free. However according to the company website milk is the only allergen listed for the Shamrock Shake and for all other McDonald's shakes.

Celiac.com Sponsor (A12):

According to the McDonald's corporate website ""the Shamrock Shake was created in 1967 by Hal Rosen a Connecticut McDonald’s Owner and Operator who made the delicious mint shake in celebration of St. Patrick’s Day. It later debuted in select locations across the U.S. in 1970 and was an instant success."" The Shamrock shake eventually became the cornerstone of efforts to fund the very first Ronald McDonald House. Did you know that on St. Patrick’s Day in 2010 McDonald's poured the “World's Largest Shamrock Shake” a 24 feet tall was “poured” into the Chicago River in honor of a $10000 donation to develop a new RMHC house in the city’s Streeterville neighborhood.

As always be careful with products that are not labeled gluten-free. Learn more about McDonald's Shamrock Shake including its history in helping to raise funds for the first Ronald McDonald House at the McDonald's corporate website.

McDonald’s says its values are the backbone of its brand and the driving force behind every decision it makes but that inclusion is central to makes all other values possible.

The company aims to better represent the communities it serves through two initiatives:

Allyship through accountability Beginning in 2021 McDonald’s is linking quantitative human capital management-related metrics to annual incentive compensation for its Executive Vice Presidents – meaning they will not only be judged on financial performance but also improving representation within leadership roles for both women and historically underrepresented groups. Represent the diverse communities in which it operates by increasing the diversity of leadership By end of 2025 McDonald’s expects to increase representation of historically underrepresented groups in leadership roles (Senior Director and above) in the US to 35% (2020 data shows this stands at 29%). By end of 2025 McDonald’s expects to increase representation of women in leadership roles globally (Senior Director and above) to 45% (up from 37%).

McDonald’s supporting women in leadership

This effort to support women in leadership builds on the company’s 2019 Gender Strategy to improve the representation of women at all levels of the Company by 2023 while also achieving gender equality in career advancement and championing the impact of women on the business.

“Guided by our values we cannot be complacent in our pursuit to better ourselves and our communities” said McDonald’s President and CEO Chris Kempczinski.

“Few brands in the world have our size and reach. And as CEO I remind myself daily that our customers franchisees employees suppliers and shareholders expect us to make a difference.”

In November 2020 McDonald’s appointed Reggie Miller (pictured above) as its new Global Head of Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI). Miller joined from VF Corporation where he developed the company’s award-winning formal diversity and inclusion strategy – with VF named on Forbes’ 2020 Best Employers for Diversity list."

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck raises 2024 profit forecast on surging sales of cancer drug Keytruda,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-raises-2024-profit-forecast-strong-cancer-hpv-drugs-sales-2024-04-25/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."

This may have just been a friendly match but the incredible scoreline meant that it seriously damaged Real Madrid going forward.

Los Blancos already had problems: Gareth Bale and Zinedine Zidane were at war and they'd just lost Marco Asensio for several months to injury. This derby defeat only made things worse.

Real Madrid were coming out of a difficult season and this result cast even more doubts on the futures of some of the club's big stars such as James Rodriguez among others.

It seemed like Atletico had the advantage going into the new season but things changed quickly with this 7-3 win seeming to have turned into a curse for Diego Simeone's side.

Atletico haven't won any of the four Madrid derbies since that pre-season tie and haven't scored a single goal in the process.

The first derby after the 7-3 came two months later and ended in a goalless draw and the second match was the Supercopa de Espana final which also ended 0-0 and was won by Zidane's side on penalties.

CHEMA REY

Next was the second league meeting between the sides which was won 1-0 by the Bernabeu side which saw them take a huge step towards the league title and their first meeting this season saw Real Madrid inflict their rivals' first defeat of the campaign at the Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano.

Simeone's side will be looking to get this monkey which has haunted them since July 2019 off their back when the two teams meet at the Estadio Wanda Metropolitano this Sunday.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Some Las Vegas hotels ban outside food & drinks

Miles to Memories notes that the Virgin Las Vegas resort that’s opening soon has a surprising policy which is mentioned in the FAQs:

Can we bring in our own food & beverage? Outside food and beverage is not permitted in our guest rooms. Our resort offers an array of restaurant offering including pre-stocked in-room minibars and 24-hour room service for your convenience.

So yeah apparently you can’t bring outside food & drinks into your own guest room at the Virgin Las Vegas. This is totally bizarre to me but upon digging a bit deeper it seems that this isn’t the only hotel with such a policy.

For example it would appear that Encore at Wynn Las Vegas has a similar policy:

Outside food and beverage as well as coolers are not permitted at the resort and casino. Guests arriving with these items will be required to discard these items or leave them in their vehicle for the duration of their visit.

Is this outrageous policy actually enforced?

I should mention that my interest in Las Vegas is virtually non-existent so I’m not the target customer for these properties. I didn’t love Las Vegas pre-coronavirus and I sure as heck won’t love it post-coronavirus.

Still I’m kind of in disbelief that this is actually a policy because it’s so outrageous. It’s one thing if they said you can’t cater your own party in a suite without going through the hotel but the way these rules are written you couldn’t even bring a Starbucks iced coffee a Diet Coke a protein shake or a bag of almonds into your room.

I have a few immediate thoughts here:

I wonder if this policy will be enforced; if you enter the hotel with a CVS or liquor store bag will they really search you?

Even if this policy isn’t widely enforced it rubs me the wrong way; I don’t want to go into a hotel knowing I’m violating rules and could be kicked out for doing something very reasonable

I understand hotels (particularly in Las Vegas) are very much trying to push their own F&B outlets but there’s a fine line between that and not giving people the ability to eat what they want in their room

When staying at hotels during the pandemic I’ve found myself getting food from outside the property more often given the limited selections available and my general desire to dine in my room rather than in an indoor restaurant; sometimes I pick up something sometimes I order through Postmates or Uber Eats and sometimes I just get snacks at a drugstore

Bottom line

It would appear that multiple Las Vegas hotels have policies banning all outside food and drinks. I’m not sure whether this policy is actually enforced on a widespread basis but this has to be one of the most ridiculous hotel policies I’ve ever seen. I totally get hotels want to push their own outlets but this crosses the line in my opinion.

Las Vegas hotels often forget they’re still in the business of hospitality even if they try to operate like factories.

Were you aware that some Las Vegas hotels have policies like this? Do Las Vegas hotels actually enforce these rules?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHA6Ly95b25rZXJzdGltZXMuY29tL2Etc3VyZS1iZXQtZm9yLW5ldy15b3JrLWJyaW5nLWZ1bGwtZ2FtaW5nLXNwb3J0cy1iZXR0aW5nLXRvLWVtcGlyZS1jaXR5LWNhc2luby1tZ20teW9ua2Vycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'A Sure Bet for New York' Bring Full Gaming and Sports Betting to Empire City Casino -MGM Yonkers,"A sports betting location in Yonekrs would attract a new audience to Empire City Casino-MGM Yonkers

A Sure Bet for New York’s Future” Alliance Launches & Calls on Governor and Legislature to Support a Full Gaming License and Access to Mobile Sports Betting for Empire City Casino by MGM Resorts in Yonkers

“A Sure Bet for New York’s Future” announced the creation of the new local alliance in support of a full gaming license and access to mobile sports betting for Empire City Casino by MGM Resorts and touted its benefits for Yonkers the Bronx and the greater Westchester region.

Nearly 30 businesses community organizations and labor groups in Westchester and the Bronx have formed the new alliance. They include: the Business Council of Westchester the Bronx Chamber of Commerce and the Westchester-Putnam Central Labor Body.

A full-scale casino license complete with retail and mobile sports betting and live table games will create thousands of new family-sustaining union jobs while generating millions in additional annual wages and tax revenue that would directly benefit local communities. The alliance is also focused on ensuring that the region is not left behind as the state considers implementing mobile sports betting.

“A full-scale casino license for Empire City Casino by MGM Resorts in Yonkers is a no brainer” said John Ravitz Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Business Council of Westchester. “The brick and mortar is already in place. A full-scale casino license will enhance the existing facility and is a clear path to providing significantly more revenue for the state offering union jobs and supporting the entire region. And if New York is going to legalize mobile sports betting MGM Resorts must be able to compete for a license. BetMGM is one of the top mobile sports betting platforms in the country and New York needs and deserves the best operators.”

“There is overwhelming support among Bronx residents community leaders and businesses for Empire City to become a full-scale casino because we already have benefitted from Empire City’s presence” said Lisa Sorin President of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce. “A full-scale casino license for Empire City will no doubt have a direct impact on the Bronx. We urge the Governor and the Legislature to allow Empire City to develop into a full-scale casino so we can start to see the jobs and the revenue our state needs this fiscal year.”

“A full-scale casino license at Empire City will support the creation of thousands of new union jobs from the more than $1 billion impact it will have on the region” said Thomas Carey President of the Westchester-Putnam Central Labor Body. “Think of all of the union jobs this will create for business and our Building and Construction Trades Brothers and Sisters as well as Food Service employees security and the endless opportunities as we advance. If Albany wants to prioritize economic recovery they must allow Empire City to apply for a full-scale casino license as soon as possible.”

The Alliance co-chairs sent a letter to Governor Cuomo Senate Majority Leader Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Heastie asking that a defined process be put in place to allow Empire City Casino to be able to pursue a full-scale commercial casino license so that the state can immediately benefit from this turnkey private economic development project.

The sunny skies and warm weather couldn’t have come at a better time as pool season heats up at many Las Vegas resorts.

For several pools across the valley this week marks the first time they’ve been open this year. For others the weather means an increase in traffic.

Circa’s Stadium Swim pool deck has been open to guests since October. But manager Mike Pena says things are really starting to ramp up as the 2021 season gets underway.

“There’s definitely a level of excitement that’s building for pool season right now especially as a number of the other pools around town begin to open their doors” Pena said Friday afternoon. “It’s beginning to signify to a lot of folks that summer’s around the corner.”

Las Vegas resident Damir Mouzdybaev who reserved a cabana at Stadium Swim on Friday to entertain visiting family and friends agreed.

“Las Vegas is the only place to have fun right now” he said. “The scene number one is very very safe. They’re keeping everything under the restrictions. But it’s alive. The music’s playing. Drinks are coming. And it’s sunny. That’s the most important part. So it’s amazing.”

In town from Twin Falls Idaho Kenna Belloli hit The Mirage pool Saturday morning with her friend Mindy Starr.

“It’s probably the thing that I was looking forward to the most for this weekend of getting away” Belloli said as the pair dangled their toes in the water.

Other visitors were surprised to find the pools open.

“We actually didn’t know it was pool season” said Abigail Alemanin in town from Chicago to celebrate her birthday at Park MGM. “So we’re loving it so far just enjoying our time relaxing for the weekend.”

While MGM Resorts International keeps some of its pools open year-round this weekend marks the first time this season that pools are open at all of its resorts. Most are accessible only to hotel guests. A few of the dayclubs however have been converted to 21-and-over “extension” pools offering bottle service music and other VIP amenities for anyone who makes a reservation.

Each has adopted a regimen of COVID-19 protocols including “pods” of two four or six lounge chairs attendants sanitizing chairs and daybeds as soon as guests exit and “pool ambassadors” cheerfully reminding guests to wear their masks when they’re out of the water and aren’t actively eating or drinking.

Melissa Razo in town from California was impressed with the safety protocols at Park MGM’s pool on Saturday morning.

“There’s actually a lot more people than I was expecting but it’s OK” Razo said. “I mean everybody is wearing their mask so I’m assuming everybody is being safe. And the pool is really good. I didn’t think it was going to be sunny enough for us to come out here but it feels good.”

At New York-New York’s pool Sarah Nett echoed those sentiments a bit later in the day as temperatures rose into the high 70s.

“Coming from Wisconsin this is like summer to us” she said laughing.

Ho (58) who is currently co-chairperson and executive director of gaming operator MGM China Holdings is understood to be preparing to return to SJM Holdings the conglomerate set up by her late father Stanley Ho Hung-sun which controls 19 of Macao’s 41 casinos.

Quoting industry insiders the report noted that a recent sale of shares by Ho could indicate that she was intent on reducing her stake in MGM so she could take over the reins at SJM.

It is believed that Ho may make the jump back to SJM once MGM’s new concession tender has been concluded. A source close to MGM indicated that chief operating officer Hubert Wang Zi Qi could take over from Ho adding that it would be “politically unwise” for the company to appoint an American national at this time.

Ho’s most recent sale of 1.45 million shares of MGM Resorts International was worth US$56.7 million (MOP 460.3 million) further reducing her participation in the company after selling US$35.6 million (MOP 284.5 million) worth of shares last month.

Before the initial transaction Ho held just over 8.2 million shares. Her stake is now reduced to about 6.7 million shares according to a filing with the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong where the parent company MGM China is listed.

According to a separate filing reporting the annual results of the company in 2020 Ho still currently holds as much as 22.49 per cent of MGM China.

The cast of ""Rock of Ages"" with the late Nick Cordero portraying Dennis DuPree parties it up at the show's premiere in Hollywood on Wednesday Jan. 15 2020. (John Katsilometes/Las Vegas Review-Journal)

The final notes of “Don’t Stop Believin’” never subside. They just go on and on and on and on …

You’re welcome for the earworm from Journey and also the stage show “Rock of Ages.” The 1980s rock musical is once more hitting “Play” in VegasVille. The show is all but signed dotted-line style for the former Cabaret space at Planet Hollywood Resort.

That’s why you might have spotted co-producers Scott Prisand and Matt Weaver at the hotel last weekend. The joyous revival is likely to move into the space in December where fans will kick it up again with a shot of Dennis Dupree’s Good Time Juice.

The vision again is to expand the “Rock of Ages” concept to include the popular Bourbon Room nightspot. The club which featured live performances and rowdy MTV videos did silly business when the show was at The Venetian from 2012-16.

Bourbon Room actually ran for several weeks after the show closed at the hotel. That space is now The Dorsey.

Following its time on the Strip “Rock of Ages” moved to the Rio for a year until closing Jan.1 2018 (I remember the night well when an usher chided me for trying to take a pic of the cast’s final bow. I am such a problem).

Since producers have been in talks with The Strat (officials from that hotel caught the show’s premiere in Hollywood in January 2020) Hard Rock Hotel/Virgin Hotels Las Vegas and MGM Resorts International.

We really enjoyed the downsized mobilized “RoA” that ran pre-pandemic on the Sunset Strip. The late Nick Cordero seized the show as club operator Dupree. Cordero whose credits included “Bullets Over Broadway” and “Waitress” on Broadway died last June of complications of COVID-19. That man was a real star.

More down the line certainly from this title which also featured a column fave name-checked in the next note …

EJY ‘Cocktail’ return

Eric Jordan Young returns with inventive musical mash-up “The Cocktail Cabaret” for dinner shows at 3 and 6:30 p.m. Sunday at Italian American Club. The production’s cast is still intact. EJY as we refer to him in shorthand is back in his killer role as emcee.

The cast is requisitely talent-laden featuring Niki Scalera and Maren Wade with a guest appearance form James D. Gish. Philip Fortenberry leads the band filled out by drummer Mark Pardy bassist Josh Jones and sax man Eric Tewalt (who in just a week’s time will have played IAC and also Allegiant Stadium with Santa Fe & The Fat City Horns).

Young is also performing his first solo show at The Space at 6 p.m. March 13. Tickets are sold for in-person and livestream access (go to thespacelv.com for the specs). Fortenberry again accompanies on piano.

The two-man showcase arrives a year to the day after EJY was laid off from his job in Tampa Florida as a director of “Footloose” on Norwegian Cruise Line.

“I’m taking all the things I did over the past year the virtual shows and performances and throwing it into a personalized moment” Young says. “I’m sharing what I’ve discovered about myself and the industry and Las Vegas.”

He’d certainly welcome a return to “Rock of Ages” as a part he co-starred in the show at The Venetian and Rio along with his directorial stints in L.A. and on Norwegian.

“I can only hope the producers would reach out to me in a directorial role” Young says. “It’s a very exciting concept if it’s cool and immersive like it was in Hollywood. I really love that show.”

Totally Vinny

Las Vegas magic practitioner Vinny Grosso says of his new show at Notoriety “It’s just me a one-man show. It’s the right opportunity for what I want to do and where I am in my life too.”

Proving again that the sun never sets on magic shows in Vegas Grosso’s “Totally Mental” has opened at Notoriety at Neonopolis. So has ex-Tropicana Theater headliner David Goldrake’s “M Is For Magic.” The two swap performance times Fridays through Sundays (go to neonopolislv.com/notoriety to drill for the specifics).

Goldrake has been scanning the city for venues for more than a year before landing at Notoriety. Grosso was led to Ken Henderson’s second-level annex by prolific Vegas producer Adam Steck of SPI Entertainment.

“I said ‘I have a show that can work with a small audience and is a small production’ and he said ‘That’s great I know just the room for you’” Grosso says. “The space is beautiful it’s gorgeous and I love what they’re doing downtown with all the artistic changes.”

Grosso is among the many “America’s Got Talent” alums plying their craft in Vegas and has twice fooled Penn & Teller on the duo’s “Fool Us” show. Grosso also produced “Over The Air” magic online during the pandemic.

Grosso has also earned a bachelor’s degree from Villanova University with a degree in mechanical engineering where he learned to create his own original illusions. He’s able to pull off his mentalist act by using innovative methods allowing audience members to be a part of the show while safely adhering to social distancing.

Of his new performance platform Grosso says “With Circa going up a lot of great energy the vibe downtown is great. I am excited about it.” Notoriety on the top level of Neonopolis helps spark that energy.

The city government of Valenzuela will launch a program that will allow dog owners to trace their pets once they go astray.

Under ValPets or Valenzuela City Pets App pets of residents will get microchip implants with RFID (radio frequency identification) technology that will serve as their permanent ID.



“In the event that their pets go missing personnel from the City Veterinary Services Office will only have to scan the microchip implant to see their owners and other details” the local government explained in a YouTube video.



“The details of the missing dogs will then be posted on valpets.appcase.net website where pet owners can visit if their pets go missing” it added.

Owners may personally claim their missing dogs from the city’s veterinary office. They may also have them delivered but have to pay the delivery fee through PayMaya.



“In case pet owners cannot claim their pets they will be open for adoption” the city government added.

The registration for free microchip implants will start on March 13.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhZzI0LmNvbS90ZWNoL2JvZHktbW9kaWZpY2F0aW9uLWF0LWhvbWUtc2VhdHRsZS1jb21wYW55LW9mZmVycy1kaXktaW1wbGFudC1raXRzLTE4NjcyMDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Body modification at home: Seattle company offers DIY implant kits,"Seattle Washington - People can now give themselves body modifications thanks to a Seattle-area company selling DIY implants that can turn your body into a radio-frequency identification device .

Although many in the body modification world have been playing around with various self-inserted implants for years now legitimate DIY kits on sale in stores are a brand-new development.

Dangerous Things a Seattle-based company is now selling DIY microchip implant kits that look extremely futuristic and even include a trio of LED lights that can be seen through the skin.



What's the main objective and purpose of these? From a functional standpoint they serve as radio-frequency identification devices – or RFIDs – that can be scanned by any near field communication device (NFCs).

Phones computers cars safes and keyless access points to homes and buildings use NFC-readers. Meaning an RFID implant could grant access to any of these things by merely scanning your hand near the reader.

According to the company's website the creator of the implants Amal Graafsta has been rocking an implant since 2005.

While Dangerous Things recommends that a professional installs the implants its kits supply customers with all the scalpels microchip-filled syringes and ointments needed for insertion of chips in the least painful way possible.

The company sells a wide array of chip implant kits including a cyborg kit that comes with field testers and diagnostic cards to help customers become the data-reading bio-hackers they've always dreamt of being.",,,,,,,,,

Wired is also reporting “tens of thousands of email servers” hacked. The exploits have been patched by Microsoft but security experts talking to Krebs say that the detection and cleanup process will be a massive effort for the thousands of state and city governments fire and police departments school districts financial institutions and other organizations that were affected.

According to Microsoft the vulnerabilities allowed hackers to gain access to email accounts and also gave them the ability to install malware that might let them back into those servers at a later time.

Krebs and Wired report that the attack was carried out by Hafnium a Chinese hacking group. While Microsoft hasn’t spoken to the scale of the attack it also points to the same group as having exploited the vulnerabilities saying that it has “high confidence” that the group is state-sponsored.

According to KrebsOnSecurity the attack has been ongoing since January 6th (the day of the riot) but ramped up in late February. Microsoft released its patches on March 2nd which means that the attackers had almost two months to carry out their operations. The president of cyber security firm Volexity which discovered the attack told Krebs that “if you’re running Exchange and you haven’t patched this yet there’s a very high chance that your organization is already compromised.”

Both the White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Chris Krebs (no relation to KrebsOnSecurity) have tweeted about the severity of the incident.

Microsoft has released several security updates to fix the vulnerabilities and suggests that they be installed immediately. It is worth noting that if your organization uses Exchange Online it will not have been affected — the exploit was only present on self-hosted servers running Exchange Server 2013 2016 or 2019.

While a large-scale attack likely carried out by a state-run organization may sound familiar Microsoft is clear that the attacks are “in no way connected” to the SolarWinds attacks that compromised US federal government agencies and companies last year.

It’s likely that there are still details to come about this hack — so far there hasn’t been an official list of organizations that have been compromised just a vague picture of the large scale and high-severity of the attack.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8wNS9wb2xpdGljcy93aGl0ZS1ob3VzZS13YXJuaW5nLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1oYWNrZXJzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzAzLzA1L3BvbGl0aWNzL3doaXRlLWhvdXNlLXdhcm5pbmctbWljcm9zb2Z0LWhhY2tlcnM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,White House warns of 'active threat' from Microsoft email hackers,"Washington CNN —

The Biden administration is increasingly sounding the alarm over a series of newly discovered cyber intrusions that Microsoft said this week were linked to China.

“This is an active threat” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday. “Everyone running these servers – government private sector academia – needs to act now to patch them.”

Psaki’s warnings followed a tweet by national security adviser Jake Sullivan Thursday evening that underscored how concerned the Biden administration is. He urged IT administrators nationwide to install software fixes immediately. Sullivan said the US government is monitoring reports that US think tanks may have been compromised by the attack as well as “defense industrial base entities.”

Later on Friday the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency underscored the risk in unusually plain language stating in a tweet that the malicious activity if left unchecked could “enable an attacker to gain control of an entire enterprise network.”

In a rare step White House officials have urged private sector organizations running localized installations of Microsoft Exchange server software to install several critical updates that were released in what information security experts described as an emergency patch release.

The cybersecurity firm FireEye said Thursday it had already identified a number of specific victims including “US-based retailers local governments a university and an engineering firm.”

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Friday the Defense Department is currently working to determine if it has been negatively affected by the vulnerability.

“We’re aware of it and we’re assessing it” Kirby said. “And that’s really as far as I’m able to go right now.”

Microsoft disclosed this week that it had become aware of several vulnerabilities in its server software being exploited by suspected Chinese hackers. In the past Microsoft said the hacker group responsible – which Microsoft is calling Hafnium – has gone after “infectious disease researchers law firms higher education institutions defense contractors policy think tanks and NGOs.” The group in question had not been previously identified to the public according to Microsoft.

The announcement marked the latest information security crisis to hit the US after FireEye Microsoft and others reported a suspected Russian hacking campaign that began by infiltrating the IT software company SolarWinds. That effort has led to the compromise of at least nine federal agencies and dozens of private businesses.

But the malicious activity disclosed this week is not in any way related to the SolarWinds hack Microsoft said Tuesday.

Microsoft typically releases software updates on the second Tuesday of each month. But in a sign of the seriousness of the threat Microsoft published the patches addressing the new vulnerabilities — which had never been detected until now – a week early.

‘We urge network operators to take it very seriously’

The Department of Homeland Security also released an emergency directive on Tuesday requiring federal agencies to either update their servers or to disconnect them. It is only the sixth such directive since the formation of CISA in 2015 and the second in three months.

“We urge network operators to take it very seriously” Psaki said of the directive. The administration is concerned there as a “large number of victims” she added.

Once the Hafnium attackers compromise an organization Microsoft said they have been known to download data such as address books and to gain access to its user account database.

One person working at a Washington think tank told CNN both her work and personal e-mail accounts were hit by the attackers. Microsoft sent her a warning that a foreign government was behind it. AOL sent a similar notification for the personal account.

The person was then visited by FBI agents who showed up on her doorstep repeating that this was indeed an ongoing sophisticated hack by a foreign government and that there is a nationwide FBI investigation underway.

The attackers had used their unauthorized access to e-mail the person’s contacts “tailoring [the messages] in a way that the recipient will not doubt I am the sender.” The attackers’ fraudulent emails sent in the person’s name included invitations to non-existent conferences and referred to an article in her name and a book in a colleague’s name neither of which was written by them.

Each message the person said came with links asking people to click on them.

“This is the real deal” tweeted Christopher Krebs the former CISA director. “If your organization runs an OWA server exposed to the internet assume compromise between 02/26-03/03.”

In its own advisory CISA urged network security officials to begin looking for evidence of intrusions as far back as September 2020.

The US government’s unusually public response to the incident was a surprise to many experts a reflection of both the Biden administration’s focus on cyber issues compared to the Trump White House as well as the scale of the threat.

“Is this the first time the National Security Advisor has promoted a specific patch?” John Hultquist the vice president of FireEye’s Mandiant Threat Intelligence arm wondered aloud.

“When you wake up to the [National Security Advisor] and [Press Secretary] tweeting about cyber” National Security Agency communications official Bailey Bickley tweeted from her personal account appending a “starstruck” emoji and quoting Sullivan’s tweet from the night before.

At least 300000 organizations across the US have been hacked over the last few days through flaws in Microsoft's Exchange server email software sources familiar with the matter told KrebsOnSecurity.

The ""unusually aggressive Chinese cyber espionage unit"" that Microsoft calls ""Hafnium"" is focusing on stealing emails from a range of victims including companies small businesses and local governments Krebs said.

The group exploited four flaws in Microsoft's Exchange servers. The bugs gave attackers full remote control over the affected systems.

Microsoft released a security update this week to patch Exchange versions from 2013 to 2019. Microsoft recommended users immediately install updates to the Exchange product which is primarily used by business customers. The company also said that it informed appropriate US government agencies about the breach.

On March 2nd Microsoft disclosed that four Exchange Server zero-day vulnerabilities were being used in attacks against exposed Outlook on the web (OWA) servers. These vulnerabilities are tracked as CVE-2021-26855 CVE-2021-26857 CVE-2021-26858 CVE-2021-27065.

Known as 'ProxyLogon' these vulnerabilities are being used by Chinese state-sponsored threat actors to steal mailboxes harvest credentials and deploy web shells to access the internal network.

When Microsoft disclosed these attacks they had released updated signatures for Microsoft Defender that will detect the web shells installed using the zero-day vulnerabilities.

These web shells are detected using the following names by Microsoft Defender:

Exploit:Script/Exmann.A!dha

Behavior:Win32/Exmann.A

Backdoor:ASP/SecChecker.A

Backdoor:JS/Webshell (not unique to these attacks)

Trojan:JS/Chopper!dha (not unique to these attacks)

Behavior:Win32/DumpLsass.A!attk (not unique to these attacks)

Backdoor:HTML/TwoFaceVar.B (not unique to these attacks)

For organizations not using Microsoft Defender Microsoft has added the updated signatures to their Microsoft Safety Scanner standalone tool to help organizations find and remove web shells used in these attacks.

Using Microsoft Safety Scanner to remove web shells

Microsoft Safety Scanner also known as the Microsoft Support Emergency Response Tool (MSERT) is a standalone portable antimalware tool that includes Microsoft Defender signatures to scan for and remove detected malware.

MSERT is an on-demand scanner and will not provide any real-time protection. Therefore it should only be used for spot scans and not relied upon as a full-fledged antivirus program.

Furthermore MSERT will automatically delete any detected files and not quarantine them if you do not start the program with the /N argument as in msert.exe /N . To scan for web shellsand not delete them you can also use use the PowerShell script described at the end of the article.

The Microsoft Safety Scanner can be downloaded as either a 32-bit or 64-bit executable and used to perform spot scans of a machine as needed.

After launching the program agree to the license agreements and you will be shown a screen asking what type of scan you would like to perform.

Microsoft recommends that you select the 'Full scan' option to scan the entire server.

Selecting Full MSERT scan

As the full scan can take a long time depending on the size of your install Microsoft also states you can perform a 'Customized scan' against each of the following folders:

%IIS installation path%\aspnet_client\*

%IIS installation path%\aspnet_client\system_web\*

%Exchange Server installation path%\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\*

Configured temporary ASP.NET files path

%Exchange Server Installation%\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\ecp\auth\*

After the scan is finished MSERT will report what files have been removed and their definition name.

Microsoft Safety Scanner scan results

For more detailed information on what files were removed you can consult the %SYSTEMROOT%\debug\msert.log file as shown below.

Backdoor:ASP/Chopper.F!dha web shell detected by MSERT

When done using MSERT you can uninstall the tool simply by deleting the msert.exe executable.

New PowerShell scripts finds web shells

If you would like to scan for web shells without removing them you can use a new PowerShell script named detect_webshells.ps1 created by CERT Latvia.

""Initial activity during January 2021 was attributed to HAFNIUM however since then other threat actors got hold of these exploits and started using them. Prior to public disclosure & patches being published by Microsoft (since 27 February or so) publically exposed Exchange servers started being exploited indiscriminately.""

""As such installing latest Exchange updates soon after Microsoft published them did not fully mitigate the risk of prior compromise therefore all Exchange servers should be inspected for signs of unauthorized access"" the CERT-LV explains in their project description.

Among the biggest winners will be Moderna and Pfizer – two very different US pharma firms which are both charging more than $30 per person for the protection of their two-dose vaccines. While Moderna was founded just 11 years ago has never made a profit and employed just 830 staff pre-pandemic Pfizer traces its roots back to 1849 made a net profit of $9.6bn last year and employs nearly 80000 staff.

But other drugmakers such as the British-Swedish AstraZeneca and the US pharma Johnson & Johnson have pledged to provide their vaccines on a not-for-profit basis until the pandemic comes to an end.

Whether the market remains a money-spinner in the future depends on whether the vaccines become the type that need just a one-off shot – as for measles – or if regular vaccinations will be required such as for flu. But in the immediate future there are big financial returns up for grabs.

Here we look at who is in line for the biggest gains – and which shareholders have already made fortunes.

1 Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine

Pfizer’s Comirnaty vaccine developed with Germany’s BioNTech is based on re-engineered messenger RNA – the molecule that sends genetic instructions from DNA to a cell’s protein-making machinery. It was the first to be approved and has to be stored at ultra-low temperatures (-70C). Governments have ordered about 780m shots including the US (200m doses for $3.9bn) and the EU commission (300m) while 40m doses will go to lower-income nations via the Covax facility. It costs $39 (£28) for two doses in the US and about $30 in the EU.

Expected sales in 2021: $15bn-$30bn

Pfizer which splits costs and profit margins equally with BioNTech expects $15bn in 2021 sales based on current deals. The final number could be twice as high as Pfizer says it can potentially deliver 2bn doses this year. Barclays analyst Carter Gould is predicting sales of $21.5bn in 2021 $8.6bn next year and $1.95bn in 2023 on the assumption that the jab is given as a one-off shot.

Pfizer: +1.8%

BioNTech: +156%

The two founders of BioNTech the husband and wife team Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci – both doctors – became multibillionaires last year when the potential of the vaccine and the deal with Pfizer prompted the shares to surge.

2 Moderna mRNA vaccine

The vaccine produced by the US biotech firm based in Massachusetts must be stored at freezer temperature (-20C). The UK has ordered 17m doses the EU bought 310m with an option for a further 150m in 2022 while the US government ordered 300m shots. Japan purchased 50m shots. Moderna charges $30 for the required two shots in the US and $36 in the EU.

Expected sales in 2021: $18bn-$20bn

Moderna has said it expects 2021 sales of $18.4bn. Barclays analyst Gena Wang forecasts sales of $19.6bn $12.2bn in 2022 and $11.4bn in 2023 assuming recurring vaccinations.

A group of investors that backed the company when it was founded in 2010 will have made substantial returns. The chief executive Stéphane Bancel a 48-year-old French executive owns 9% of the shares now worth nearly $5bn.

3 Johnson & Johnson Adenovirus vaccine

J&J’s jab the world’s first single-shot Covid-19 vaccine was developed by its Janssen division in Belgium. It uses adenovirus-26 a rare variant of cold virus. It was approved in the US in late February and can be stored at standard fridge temperatures for at least three months. Big orders include the US UK (30m doses plus option for 22m) the EU (up to 400m doses) and Covax nations (500m doses through 2022).

Expected sales in 2021: up to $10bn

The company aims to deliver at least 1bn doses this year which would generate $10bn. The US government has ordered 100m doses with the option to buy 200m more and is paying $10 a shot.

4 AstraZeneca Adenovirus vector vaccine

The vaccine developed with Oxford University uses a modified chimpanzee cold virus and can be kept at fridge temperature. Viral vector vaccines use a harmless virus to deliver a piece of genetic code to cells. Big orders have come from the UK (100m) the EU (up to 400m) the US (300m) and Japan (£120m).

Expected sales in 2021: $2bn-$3bn

Analysts at SVB Leerink are forecasting sales of $1.9bn this year and $3bn in 2022. The 2021 figure could be far higher if AstraZeneca achieves its ambitious target of 3bn doses. The company has pledged to supply the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis during this pandemic and charges $4.30 to $10 for two doses.

5 Sinovac Inactivated virus vaccine

The CoronaVac jab has been administered for emergency use in several Chinese cities since last summer and was approved by China’s regulator in early February. Sinovac which is based in Beijing has struck deals with Brazil Chile Singapore Malaysia and the Philippines. In January Turkey and Indonesia kicked off their vaccination campaigns with the jab. Sinovac also plans to supply 10m vaccine doses to Covax nations.

Expected sales in 2021: billions of dollars but unclear

Sinovac says it can produce more than 1bn doses this year. The vaccine has been priced at $60 for two shots in some Chinese cities. Sinovac’s Indonesian partner Bio Farma which has ordered at least 40m doses said it would cost $27.20 for two doses locally.

6 Gamaleya Institute/Russian Direct Investment Fund Adenovirus vaccine

Although it has not been approved by the EU regulator yet Hungary and Slovakia have bought the Russian vaccine Sputnik V. In total more than 50 countries including Iran Algeria and Mexico have ordered it. AstraZeneca is testing a two-shot combination of its vaccine with Sputnik.

Expected sales in 2021: unclear but possibly billions

The developers are struggling to mass-produce Sputnik in Russia but RDIF a sovereign wealth fund told the Financial Times last month that it had signed contracts with 15 manufacturers in 10 countries to produce 1.4bn jabs. The developers have said they would charge $20 or less for the required two doses internationally but are providing it free in Russia.

7 Novavax Recombinant protein vaccine

The Novavax vaccine uses a small fragment of a lab-made version of the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein. The US firm hopes for regulatory approval in the UK US and other countries in the first half. The company has been researching vaccines for more than 30 years and has never before had a jab approved. It has agreed to supply 300m doses so far including the UK (60m doses) EU Canada and Australia. It hopes to produce 150m doses a month and is expected to be cheaper than rivals. According to the Financial Times the company has agreed to charge $3 a shot in Africa. The vaccine will also be made in Stockton-on-Tees in north-east England and can be be kept at fridge temperature.

Expected sales in 2021: ‘several billion dollars’

Based on these deals Novavax said this week it sees “the potential for several billion dollars in revenue in the next 12 months”. This is set to rise as Novavax expects to be able to make 2bn doses a year by mid-2021 thanks to a partnership with the Serum Institute of India.

8 CureVac mRNA vaccine

CureVac expects to publish late-stage results for its CVnCov vaccine in April and hopes to gain EU approval by June. The EU has pre-ordered 225m doses with the option to buy a further 180m. Unlike other mRNA vaccines CureVac’s shot can be stored at fridge temperature. Together with GSK which owns nearly 10% of the German firm it is seeking to develop next-generation shots for multiple emerging Covid-19 variants in one vaccine.

Expected sales in 2021: unclear – pricing not yet revealed but priced at a profit

The Nasdaq-listed biotech aims to produce up to 300m doses this year and 600m to 1bn doses in 2022. CureVac says its jab requires less active ingredient than rivals but insists it cannot price it at cost because investors are expecting a return.

Credit... Henning Bagger/Ritzau Scanpix via Reuters

A fast-spreading coronavirus variant first observed in Britain has gained a worrisome mutation that could make it harder to control with vaccines Public Health England reported on Monday. And on Tuesday a team of researchers reported an experiment suggesting that this mutation might make vaccines somewhat less effective against the variant.

The variant known as B.1.1.7 first came to light in December. Researchers determined that it had rapidly become more common across Britain in just a couple of months.

Its spread appears to occur because of its improved ability to infect people. Experiments in test tubes suggest that some of its mutations allow the B.1.1.7 variant to hold on to cells more tightly than other coronaviruses.

Since B.1.1.7’s discovery in Britain the variant has been reported in 72 other countries. The United States confirmed its first case of the B.1.1.7 variant on Dec. 29 but is conducting little of the genomic sequencing necessary to track the spread of new variants that have caused concern. Since then the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded 467 samples of the variant in 32 states. Officials in New York City said on Tuesday that they had identified 13 cases of the variant and were ramping up testing capacity to detect more.

In its latest analysis Public Health England estimated that the variant’s rate of infection is 25 percent to 40 percent higher than that of other forms of the coronavirus. Some preliminary evidence suggests that it may also cause more deaths.

Several lines of evidence suggest that vaccines will work against the B.1.1.7 variant. On Thursday the vaccine maker Novavax announced that its British trial found no evidence that B.1.1.7 could evade the vaccine’s defenses.

But in South Africa where a variant called B.1.351 has surged to dominance the Novavax and Johnson & Johnson vaccines have both been less effective in trials.

That variant has been reported in 31 countries so far. In the United States it has turned up in Maryland and in South Carolina.

Scientists suspect that the B.1.351 variant’s partial escape from vaccines is largely thanks to a single mutation called E484K. Experiments indicate that the E484K mutation makes it harder for antibodies to grab onto the virus and prevent it from entering cells.

Now it turns out that some B.1.1.7 coronaviruses in Britain also have the E484K mutation.

To search for new mutations British researchers reviewed the 214159 genomes of coronaviruses that the United Kingdom has sequenced as of Jan. 26. In its report Public Health England said that they found 11 samples of the B.1.1.7 variant that also had the E484K mutation.

Since that analysis more of these viruses have come to light. NextStrain a website where scientists gather and analyze coronavirus genomes now identifies 16 B.1.1.7 variants that carry the E484K mutation.

These B.1.1.7 coronaviruses gained the mutation thanks to random copying errors as they multiplied inside of people. The evolutionary tree of the coronaviruses suggests that 15 of the variants descend from one common ancestor that gained the E484K mutation. Meanwhile the sixteenth variant seems to have gained the same mutation on its own.

Commenting on Monday’s report Kristian Andersen a virologist at Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla Calif. said that it was impossible yet to say whether the E484K mutation would make these coronaviruses not only more contagious but more resistant to vaccines. “It’s much too early to speculate whether it will so we’ll have to wait for data” he said.

Just because the E484K mutation helps the B.1351 variant the one initially found in South Africa evade antibodies doesn’t mean it will do the same in other variants. That’s because mutations don’t have a fixed effect. The impact of a single new mutation to a virus depends on the other mutations that the variant already carries.

But in a report posted online Tuesday Ravi Gupta a virologist at the University of Cambridge and his colleagues reported an experiment they ran to address exactly this question. They combined the E484K mutation with other key mutations found in the B.1.1.7 variant the one initially found in Britain. The addition of the E484K mutation made it difficult for antibodies to block the viruses. The researchers wrote that they “observed a significant loss of neutralizing activity.”

However Dr. Gupta and his colleagues used antibodies taken from people who had received just the first of two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. It remains to be seen whether the B.1.1.7 variant with the new mutation E484K can evade antibodies after a full vaccination.

Nicholas Davies a mathematical biologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine cautioned that with so few of these new coronaviruses it’s hard to say whether they will become more common than ordinary B.1.1.7 variant.

But it is striking that the same mutation E484K has now been documented arising several times in Britain as well as in South Africa. Meanwhile in Brazil yet another variant has also gained the same E484K mutation on its own.

Dr. Davies speculated that the mutation may give the virus an advantage when it is spreading in populations where a lot of people have already been sick with Covid-19. It may be able to evade their antibodies to other variants. “E484K may well convey a fitness advantage in settings where there is existing immunity” Dr. Davies said.

If so the virus may be providing the world with a dangerous new example of a common theme in evolution. A good solution can arise more than once — such as flight which evolved in birds bats and insects. Evolutionary biologists call this repeated pattern convergence.

“It’s not great to see this mutation in the B.1.1.7 lineage although I think it’s no surprise at all” said Dr. Andersen. “We should expect that to happen.”

Dr. Gupta argued on Twitter that the best defense against this convergence is vaccination. By making it harder for coronaviruses to get from person to person they will have fewer chances to gain the E484K mutation or other dangerous changes.

“We need to continue vaccinating and drive down transmission” Dr. Gupta wrote.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL2RydWctZGVsaXZlcnkvV2l0aG91dC1saXBpZC1zaGVsbHMtbVJOQS12YWNjaW5lcy85OS9pONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Without these lipid shells there would be no mRNA vaccines for COVID-19,"Credit: Acuitas Therapeutics

Messenger RNA (mRNA) is having a moment. This year hundreds of millions of people will receive shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines for COVID-19. The crucial ingredient in each injection is mRNA short-lived strands of genetic material that prompt our cells to start making SARS-CoV-2 proteins which in turn help our immune systems develop antibodies that prevent future infections. Thanks to decades of scientific perseverance billions of dollars of investment in the technology and previous work on coronaviruses the vaccine makers were able to design their vaccines and prove their safety and efficacy in under a year.

The success of these COVID-19 vaccines is remarkable and was far from guaranteed. mRNA is incredibly delicate. Enzymes in the environment and in our bodies are quick to chop mRNA into pieces making lab experiments difficult and the delivery of mRNA to our cells daunting. On top of that mRNA strands are large and negatively charged and can’t simply waltz across the protective lipid membranes of cells. Many scientists thought the technology would never work.

“There were many many skeptics” says Frank DeRosa who began working with mRNA in 2008 and is now chief technology officer at Translate Bio a firm developing mRNA vaccines with Sanofi. “People used to say that if you looked at it wrong it would fall apart.”

Luckily scientists found a solution. To protect the fragile molecule as it sneaks into cells they turned to a delivery technology with origins older than the idea of mRNA therapy itself: tiny balls of fat called lipid nanoparticles or LNPs.

LNPs used in the COVID-19 vaccines contain just four ingredients: ionizable lipids whose positive charges bind to the negatively charged backbone of mRNA pegylated lipids that help stabilize the particle and phospholipids and cholesterol molecules that contribute to the particle’s structure. Thousands of these four components encapsulate mRNA shield it from destructive enzymes and shuttle it into cells where the mRNA is unloaded and used to make proteins. Although the concept seems simple perfecting it was far from straightforward.

It is a tremendous vindication for everyone working in controlled drug delivery. Robert Langer chemical engineer Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Over more than 3 decades promising lipids studied in the lab often failed to live up to their potential when tested in animals or humans. Positively charged lipids are inherently toxic and companies struggled for years before landing on formulations that were safe and effective. When injected intravenously the particles invariably accumulated in the liver and delivery to other organs is still an obstacle. Reliably manufacturing consistent LNPs was another challenge and producing the raw materials needed to make the particles is a limiting factor in the production of COVID-19 vaccines today.

LNP development has been a headache but without this packaging mRNA vaccines would be nothing. “It is the unsung hero of the whole thing” says Giuseppe Ciaramella who was head of infectious diseases at Moderna from 2014 to 2018.

The vaccines appropriately celebrated as a first for mRNA technology are also a milestone for the nanoparticle field. Although the first drug based on an LNP was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for a rare genetic disease in 2018 the two authorized mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 present a far bigger opportunity for the nanoparticles than even the field’s founders can imagine. “It is a tremendous vindication for everyone working in controlled drug delivery” says Robert Langer a chemical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

“LNPs will be going into millions of arms over the course of this year” says University of British Columbia nanoparticle scientist Pieter Cullis. “What was a fringe field back in the 1980s has turned into something that is mainstream now.”

The delivery dilemma

Modern LNPs can be traced back to work on simpler systems called liposomes hollow lipid spheres often made of just two or three kinds of lipids. In the early 1980s Cullis found that cancer drugs could diffuse into these liposomes and get trapped in the hollow core. When injected into animals with cancer the liposomes would slip through the leaky vasculature of tumors enter cells and unleash a drug. Cullis and several others started companies with the hope that liposomes could safely deliver otherwise toxic drugs into tumors in humans.

Progress was slowed by issues with stability and manufacturing. The first liposome-based drug eventually was approved by the FDA in 1995 but by then Cullis and many in the field had moved on to a new challenge: using lipid particles to deliver nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA.

The devil is absolutely in the details as far as LNPs are concerned. Giuseppe Ciaramella former head of infectious diseases Moderna

At the time scientists were enamored by advances in genetics that were promising to cure diseases by giving someone new genes or turning disease-causing genes off. Figuring out how to deliver these nucleic acid therapies—either DNA or RNA—into cells was a major challenge and required something more sophisticated than a conventional liposome. Cullis knew that adding positively charged lipids to the liposomes would help balance the negatively charged nucleic acids but there was a problem. “There are no cationic lipids in nature” Cullis says. “And we knew we couldn’t use permanently positively charged lipids because they are so damn toxic.” Those lipids would rip cell membranes apart he adds.

A solution came from new lipids that were charged only under certain conditions. During the late ’90s and through the first decade of the 2000s Cullis his colleagues at Inex Pharmaceuticals and the Inex spin-off Protiva Biotherapeutics developed ionizable lipids that are positively charged at an acidic pH but neutral in the blood. The group also created a new way to manufacture nanoparticles with these lipids using microfluidics to mix lipids dissolved in ethanol with nucleic acids dissolved in an acidic buffer. When the streams of those two solutions merged the components spontaneously formed lipid nanoparticles which unlike the hollow liposomes were densely packed with lipids and nucleic acids. The process was simple in theory but getting the machine to reliably spit out consistent LNPs was difficult.

LNPs that looked good in the lab often floundered in the clinic however. The first versions of ionizable lipids were still toxic. And early formulations of the nanoparticles didn’t degrade fast enough causing them to accumulate after repeated injections. Protiva found that one of its experimental LNP therapies caused a more severe immune reaction in humans than it had in the lab and the company pinned pegylated lipids as a major factor.

Pegylated lipids in which polyethylene glycol (PEG) strands are attached to lipid heads have several functions in a nanoparticle. PEG helps control the particle size during formulation prevents the particles from aggregating in storage and initially shields the particles from being detected by immune system proteins in the body according to James Heyes a former Protiva scientist. Heyes is now chief scientific officer of the LNP company Genevant Sciences—a firm with origins in Protiva.

But PEG also has liabilities. It prevents LNPs from binding to proteins that help shuttle them into cells. Because PEG extends particles’ life span in the body the immune system has more time to spot the particles and start mounting an antibody response. And although PEG is found in many cosmetic drug and food products scientists hypothesize that some people could develop antibodies to PEG and that giving those individuals an injection of PEG-coated nanoparticles could trigger an anaphylactic reaction.

Escape from the endosome

By 2005 the development of better and safer LNPs was driven by excitement for a new technology called small interfering RNA (siRNA) for selectively silencing genes. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals which became the leading siRNA company quickly realized that existing nanoparticles were not very good at helping siRNA get into cells. The company struck multiple partnerships to make new LNPs including with Protiva in 2005 and Inex in 2006. The groups made more than 300 ionizable lipids first optimizing the fatty tails then tweaking the ionizable head group and the linker region in between. The work was grueling and lipids that made great nanoparticles in a petri dish would often flop in animal studies. “You can have 50 different ionizable lipids that all deliver effectively to cells in culture and 49 of them won’t work a damn in vivo” recalls Thomas Madden who worked at Inex and is now CEO of Acuitas Therapeutics.

LNPs take advantage of a natural process called receptor-mediated endocytosis to get into cells Madden explains. Upon binding to a cell the nanoparticle becomes encapsulated in an even bigger lipid bubble—an organelle called an endosome. The endosome’s acidic interior protonates the heads of the ionizable lipids making them positively charged. That positive charge triggers a change in the shape of the nanoparticle which scientists think helps it break free from the endosome and ultimately release its RNA cargo into the cell’s cytoplasm. Once released the RNA is free to do its job.

The most effective nanoparticles were ones that the body mistook as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol—commonly called bad cholesterol. Proteins that recognize LDL cholesterol in the blood bound to some of Alnylam’s nanoparticles and carried them to LDL receptors on liver cells which then caused the cells to engulf the nanoparticles in an endosome. It was the kind of complex interplay that studies in a petri dish missed.

“A lot of work has gone into studying what happens inside a cell but trying to understand the transport that occurs before these nanoparticles reach their cells is another question entirely” says Kathryn Whitehead a nanoparticle scientist at Carnegie Mellon University. As a consequence “we don’t even screen in vitro anymore” she says. “I find it more informative to test directly in an animal.”

Even some of the LNPs that worked well in animals proved too toxic for the repeated dosing required of many siRNA therapies. “The biggest issue was trying to find the right balance between systems that were effective but also safe and tolerable” says Marian Gindy executive director of pharmaceutical sciences at Merck & Co. who led the RNA formulation team from 2008 until Merck ended its siRNA programs in 2013. “And I would say that is still the biggest challenge in this area.”

By 2010 Alnylam had landed on a winning ionizable lipid known as MC3. Nanoparticles based on MC3 required about one-thousandth the dose of LNPs made using older ionizable lipids. Alnylam used the new formulation in patisiran (Onpattro) its treatment for a rare disease called hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis. In 2018 patisiran became the first approved siRNA drug and the first approved therapy delivered via LNPs. But the drug requires an 80 min infusion every 3 weeks and pretreatment with multiple anti-inflammatory drugs to minimize reactions to the nanoparticle. By the time patisiran was showing promise in the clinic Alnylam had set most of its LNP work aside in favor of a new chemical conjugation technology that it used to deliver its other siRNA therapies subcutaneously.

A launchpad for mRNA

For a brief time new work on LNPs fell out of favor—that is until new companies that were focused on mRNA brought fresh energy to the field. BioNTech founded in 2008 and Moderna founded in 2010 promised to be able to use mRNA to produce any protein in the body as either a therapeutic or a vaccine. In the past decade mRNA garnered billions of dollars of investment. Discovering how to deliver those mRNA strands into cells was a problem from day 1 but prior experience with siRNA provided a launching pad.

“Early on people recognized that the same lipids used for siRNA could also be useful for mRNA” says Daniel Anderson a nanomedicine and biomaterials scientist at MIT. His group began collaborating with the rare-disease company Shire Pharmaceuticals to encapsulate mRNA that encoded protein therapies to treat rare liver diseases.

The off-the-shelf LNP formulations designed for siRNA worked for mRNA occasionally but not very well says Romesh Subramanian who led a team at Alexion Pharmaceuticals that worked on mRNA therapies with Moderna from 2014 to 2017. siRNA molecules are like short rods with two rows of about 20 nucleotides each he explains. mRNA in contrast can easily span thousands of nucleotides wind into complex shapes and change the properties of the LNP in ways that are hard to predict.

After realizing that MC3 wouldn’t cut it for mRNA delivery Moderna invested significant resources into building a better ionizable lipid. “There was a group of chemists put on this right away to build novel cationic lipids” says Ciaramella the former head of infectious diseases at Moderna. “It is kind of like a small-molecule drug discovery engine but on steroids.” The team made about 100 ionizable lipids and introduced ester linkages into the carbon chains of the lipids to help make them more biodegradable he recalls. Tweaking the ratio of the four lipids in the nanoparticles altered the LNPs’ distribution in the body. “The devil is absolutely in the details as far as LNPs are concerned” Ciaramella says. “But once you optimize it for one organ you can change out the mRNA with minimal optimization.”

That adaptability is key. For example Moderna recently made an updated version of its COVID-19 vaccine for a new variant of the coronavirus first identified in South Africa. In that vaccine which must still undergo clinical testing the mRNA code is slightly changed to match the genetic code of the new strain of the virus but the LNP formulation remains the same. Now that the company knows its nanoparticle works it can use it over and over again for different vaccines.

But details on how Moderna arrived at its optimal formulation in the first place are scant. The company did not grant an interview to talk about its nanoparticle development and neither did Pfizer or BioNTech. For its COVID-19 vaccine Moderna ultimately used an ionizable lipid that it calls SM-102 which it first described in a 2018 study on alternatives to MC3. Pfizer and BioNTech licensed an ionizable lipid called ALC-0315 from Acuitas.

Those ionizable lipids which are remarkably similar in structure were discovered while the firms were optimizing LNPs for systemic administration and delivery to the liver—not the intramuscular injection of a vaccine. Experts point out that optimizing the nanoparticles for vaccination could lead to shots that require lower doses which could ease the manufacturing burden amid a pandemic. New lipids and nanoparticle formulations will likely take too long to develop to make a difference during this pandemic but Moderna BioNTech and others are continuing to look for better ways to get mRNA into cells for a variety of applications.

An LNP resurgence

The pandemic has reinvigorated interest in continuing to refine LNPs. Small firms dedicated to the nanoparticles are getting more calls from larger drug companies that want to use their lipids. Effective LNPs could be crucial for new mRNA vaccines mRNA therapies DNA gene therapies and even CRISPR gene-editing thrapies.

“Everyone is trying to figure out the next big ionizable lipid” says Gaurav Sahay a nanoparticle scientist at Oregon State University.. But he thinks that nanoparticle researchers should also start paying more attention to the other components of an LNP. Sahay says his lab found that using alternative versions of cholesterol molecules could dramatically improve delivery. And although both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines use the same standard phospholipid swapping out this ingredient for a different phospholipid could lead to nanoparticles that reach different cells in the body Whitehead says.

“Delivery into specific cell and tissue populations is still a huge challenge for the field” says Yizhou Dong a nanoparticle researcher at the Ohio State University. Right now intravenous injections of nanoparticles can easily reach the liver and intramuscular injections for vaccines are taken up by immune cells. Some companies are working on experimental formulations for aerosolized delivery to the lungs but the rest of the body remains out of reach and the demand for targeted delivery is high. In late February the CRISPR base-editing company Beam Therapeutics where Ciaramella is president and chief scientific officer paid $120 million to acquire the start-up Guide Therapeutics which is focused on LNP discovery and has a system for finding particles that target specific cells of the body.

“There was this time when LNPs went through the dark ages” says Thomas Barnes CEO of the mRNA company Orna Therapeutics. “I think there is going to be a bit of a renaissance in these ionizable lipids and that the world is going to get excited about LNPs again.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTAzLTA2L3doaWNoLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUtaXMtdGhlLWJlc3QtbW9kZXJuYS1wZml6ZXItb3Itam9obnNvbi1qb2huc29u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which Covid Vaccine Is the Best Moderna Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson?,"Something sounds fishy when public-health experts advise us to take whatever vaccine is available even though some vaccines show much more promising efficacy numbers than others. And it’s understandable that people would want to shop for the best vaccine. Americans are accustomed to the idea of consumer choice in pharmaceuticals — why else would we have so much direct-to-consumer drug advertising? But cut through the noise and there’s only one thing that really matters: All three FDA-authorized vaccines seem to work equally well — close to 100% — at preventing hospitalization and death.

That message has gotten diluted in the reporting around the efficacy numbers for different vaccines. The efficacy numbers associated with the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines came in at around 95% while the newly approved Johnson & Johnson vaccine has shown a less impressive 72% in the U.S. and even lower in other countries. As risk-communication expert Peter Sandman says people remember from school that 95% usually earns an A and 72% a C at best."

“The current U.S. beer market is in a state of flux” says Chris Lombardo team lead and senior analyst for New York-based IBISWorld. “Though the craft beer boom has normalized relatively breweries now contend with consumers that increasingly demand a diverse array of alcoholic beverages and not just the traditional culprits like wine or spirits — think spiked seltzers spiked teas [ready-to-drink] (RTD) mixed drinks cider etc. Beer is still the largest alcoholic beverage segment in the United States but its years of complete domination seem to be dwindling.

“Younger demographics entering the legal age to consume alcoholic beverages are the greatest drivers of this change in addition to increased attention on health and dietary concerns” he continues. “As a result over the past five years the industry’s largest players such as AB InBev and Molson Coors have increasingly diversified their product catalogue introducing many products that diverge from their traditional beers.”

Brian Sudano managing partner for New York-based Beverage Marketing Corporation (BMC) also highlights the transitions permeating throughout the beer market as well as the implications from those changes.

“The U.S. beer market is going through a transformation” he explains “After decades of consolidation the emergence of craft beers began to create fragmentation. Major brewers tried to play via acquisition but the segment continued to fragment. Now the rapid growth of FMBs particularly hard seltzer has further supported fragmentation although the leaders in FMBs are fairly concentrated. Via this fragmentation we are beginning to see fragmentation of the leading beer brands.

“At one point the Top 5 beer brands commanded over 50 percent of the market and now sit around 30 percent” Sudano continues. “In addition Michelob Ultra and Modelo Especial are now Top 5 brands and former leading brand Budweiser is no longer in the Top 5.”

Although the state of the beer market already was in a state of transition analysts note that the pandemic escalated the change rate.

“The pandemic helped accelerate trends that were already taking hold in the hard seltzer business which skew to the off-premise” Sudano says. “It also had an impact on the rapid growth being experienced in craft beer taprooms which resulted in a slowdown in the number of craft breweries opening each year as well as more closings. Due to clout at retail the pandemic helped major beer brands improve their overall trends although they continue to decline.”

Danelle Kosmal vice president of beverage alcohol practice for Chicago-based NielsenIQ also has identified changes within beer packaging since the pandemic hit the United States.

“There are some new trends within the category that developed from the onset of the pandemic” she says. “Among these shifts includes a surge in sales for large pack sizes. Twelve-packs and large gained 3.6 dollar share points during COVID months in 2020 compared to those same months in 2019.

“Nearly every pack size ― small and large ― in the category grew in off-premise sales but some of the larger packs really outpaced the growth of six-packs and singles” she continues. “During COVID months of 2020 12-packs grew 31 percent in off-premise dollars 24-packs grew 26 percent and 30-packs grew 19.5 percent compared to six-packs that grew by only 7.4 percent and singles which grew 4.7 percent.”

Kosmal adds that eCommerce alcohol sales also seemed to flourish as a result of the pandemic benefiting beer as well.

“In 2020 total online alcohol sales grew by 232 percent with online beer sales pacing about the same up 233 percent” she says.

Nathan Greene consulting analyst for BMC explains that depending on a brand’s footprint pre-pandemic has impacted how brands have navigated the eCommerce boom.

“eCommerce and [direct-to-consumer] (DTC) channels are also having concurrent opposing effects on consumers experience and access to brands/products depending on digital platform” he says. “Mainstream last-mile delivery apps (i.e. Drizly and Minibar) generally offer fewer yet high-volume brands/SKUs in comparison to a full store set of offerings potentially reducing experimentation.

“Conversely many small suppliers often craft have expanded their pool of consumers by setting up online ordering (sometimes on in-house platforms while others on established services) for on-site pick up delivering locally and/or wider in/out-of-state shipping where regulations permit” he continues. “This expanded offerings within reach via digital platforms allow discernment-conscious consumers to experience suppliers previously inaccessible.”

In terms of overall performance beer sales totaled more than $43.7 billion in total U.S. multi-outlets a 14.7 percent increase for the 52 weeks ending Dec. 27 2020 according to data from Chicago-based Information Resources Inc. (IRI). Case sales also were up 10 percent during that timeframe. Total domestic beer also was up totaling $27.5 billion a 6.9 percent increase.

However when looking at the four sub-segments that IRI combines to make up total domestic (premium super-premium sub-premium and craft) performance was modest for domestic premium and domestic sub-premium with dollar sales up 3.7 and 0.5 percent respectively.

BMC’s Greene also details the varying performance among the factions of the domestic beer market.

“Total domestic beer shipments declined 0.5 percent in 2020 a slight improvement over 2019 performance which saw a decline of 0.8 percent” he says. “Among price-tier sub-segments super-premium saw the strongest growth driven by hard seltzer and a continuing market-wide trend toward premiumization. The premium and sub-premium segments saw the largest impact from COVID with occasion shifts and bulk purchasing having positive effects on some brands while on-premise closures hurt others. BMC estimates that super-premium volume growth was between 4 and 6 percent while both the premium and sub-premium saw segment-wide performance between -1 and +1 percent.”

In its November 2020 report “Beer: Incl Impact of COVID-19 – US” Chicago-based Mintel also notes that the move toward premiumization is affecting performance of the category.

“While beer has historically been appreciated for affordability the expansion of accessible options in other alcohol categories combined with the demand for higher quality beer has leveled the playing field and led to sales declines among value brands” the report states. “Beer can’t as easily compete for price as it once did nor should it rely on low price as its strong selling point in the long-term. Low price is just one aspect of ‘big v’ value that’s so important to consumers.”

Yet the market research firm notes that the shifts in purchase patterns could serve as an opportunity for the beer market.

“The struggling beer category could look to the disruption of the pandemic as a bit of a reset” it states. “Twenty-eight percent of drinkers report increasing their alcohol consumption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased stress is given as the leading reason for drinking more. While beer’s role in relaxation answers one need the category needs to move beyond mitigating the bad toward nurturing the good boosting appeal for fun and indulgence.”

In line with the notion of fun Bud Light a brand of St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch recently unveiled Bud Light Legends a new exclusive rewards program and a legendary Super Bowl LV advertisement that reunites notable Bud Light characters in one epic commercial.

This year the brand is bringing the nostalgia with legendary appearances by iconic Bud Light friends including Grammy-nominated artist Post Malone Cedric the Entertainer the “I Love You Man” guy the Bud Knight Oracle Susana and more as they all come together to save Bud Light.

In Bud Light’s 60-second Super Bowl LV TV commercial Bud Light Legends fan-favorite characters joined forces to help a delivery driver save an overturned Bud Light truck and ensure the ice-cold Bud Light makes it to the convenience store. Leveraging their combined superpowers the Legends celebrate and recreate some of the best moments in the history of Bud Light advertising the company says.

The commercial also serves as the formal launch of the new Bud Light Legends program which recognizes the fans that have supported Bud Light over the years and encourages them to ‘Join the Legendary’ at BudLightLegends.com for exclusive rewards custom merchandise and legendary experiences. Before the big game fans also are invited to revisit some of their favorite Bud Light commercials from years past by checking out BudLight.com/Vault.

“Fans have loved and celebrated Bud Light’s role in the Super Bowl for decades and this year we’re excited to reunite iconic characters in the most epic way with this new spot” says Andy Goeler vice president of marketing for Bud Light in a statement. “Bud Light Legends rewards those that always go the extra mile for Bud Light the friends that bring the fun wherever they go and those who understand the importance of good times. Today we invite our Bud Light Legends to come along with us for the journey.”

Domestic beer brands also are using their reach to alleviate stress for consumers. This past holiday season Miller Lite a brand of Chicago-based Molson Coors Beverage Co. gave away $50000 worth of food and beer and donated an additional $50000 to UnidosUS' pandemic relief efforts through the Give Back 12-Pack program. The brand gifted people $25 to create a ""12-pack:"" six items to be used to prepare a Nochebuena dinner and maybe even a six-pack of Miller Lite.

“The holidays are going to look very different with people not being able to get together for some holiday Miller Time. We can't change that but we can at least make them a little brighter with the Give Back 12-Pack” said Allison Wallin marketing manager for Miller Lite in a statement. “This gift is meant to help families worry less about dinner and focus more on connecting with their loved ones. We also hope that through our partnership with UnidosUS we bring some meaningful relief to the communities most affected by the pandemic.”

Domestic brewers also are finding strength in numbers during this transformative time. In 2020 D.G. Yuengling & Son Inc. Pottsville Pa. and Molson Coors Beverage Co. launched a long-term brewing partnership which will bring Yuengling's beer to millions more people outside of its East Coast footprint.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Speaking to reporters including MMA Junkie backstage following his split-decision win over Casey Kenney at the UFC Apex Cruz (23-3 MMA 6-2 UFC) explained his reason for the unusual callout.

“He’ll probably love that he’s getting plugged like this to be honest so it’s actually a benefit for him. So he should thank me” he began. “We’re in a day and age where if I take a picture with Conor McGregor now I’m Conor McGregor’s ‘friend’ right? If I take a picture with Dominick Cruz and have him commenting on my page we’re in a day and age where that looks like we’re friends. Well I may be your friend but you can’t use me in order to get ‘clout’ as they put it.”

Molenkamp’s Instagram and Facebook pages feature numerous photos and videos shot with UFC fighters and Cruz suggested that Molenkamp whose Instagram bio describes him as a “brand building aficionado” has attempted to use Monster Energy sponsorship as leverage to increase his personal brand online. It’s something the former bantamweight champion said he took exception to.

“Look at my face look at my body. I get beat to death for a living” he said. “So when you try to force me and you text me that if I don’t comment on your page if I don’t give you an interview that you’re going to take what pays my bills? What are we doing? Monster sponsors me not you.”

When asked if he felt like he was trapped in his endorsement contract with the energy drinks brand Cruz clarified his comments.

“It’s not ‘trapped in a contract.’ It’s forced to give him clout forced to hype him up if I want to make money. Monster pays me.”

He even revealed that others had experienced similar issues with Molenkamp including UFC president Dana White.

“Dana White has complained on this guy. Dana White has gone on this man’s page and said something – they ignored it like it didn’t happen” said Cruz. “So I’m not the first one to say something. Dana’s also said something. Ask him about it.”

But Cruz insists that his callout of Molenkamp is real and said he’d like to use the situation for good by making any matchup between the pair a charity bout.

“So this was a callout because he calls himself a pro fighter. He’s got 100 pounds weight on me and I’m like we can make this a win-win situation” he said. “Let’s do a charity event. Monster picks the charity and we scrap it out. He says he’s got three pro fights. Let’s prove it. Put your money where your mouth is. You’ve got a little tiny guy calling you out for charity. Not for anything else. Why not?”",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UFC veteran calls out sponsor in bizarre post-fight ‘hostage’ interview,"Dominick Cruz (R) beat Casey Kenney in UFC 259 then called out a bizarre opponent.

UFC veteran Dominick Cruz wound back the clock to score his first victory since 2016 at UFC 259.

But the bantamweight followed up his split decision win over Casey Kenney with a bizarre call-out that had Joe Rogan feeling all kinds of awkward.

Cruz the 35-year-old two-time bantamweight champion took aim at a certain Hans Molenkamp for ‘holding fighters hostage’.

“It’s been a long amazing journey up to this point” Cruz said. “I would love to get a charity fight lined up in a day and age where a lot of fake people can take pictures next to Lamborghinis.

“A guy named Hans Molenkamp has been holding a lot of fighters hostage saying he’s an awesome pro fighter and picking his fights.

“How about we do something for charity? He’s got a 100-pound advantage. I think we can put on a show with a lot of money.”

Joe Rogan cut off the interview quickly citing the ‘political’ nature of his comments.

Molenkamp is a sponsorship executive at Monster Energy one of the UFC’s biggest sponsors.

Molenkamp has been accused of using his influence over Monster’s sponsorship deals to force fighters to interact with his personal social media account and pretend to be his friend in an attempt to build Molenkamp’s personal profile.

His social media features clips with famous fighters like Conor McGregor Jon Jones Jorge Masvidal and Daniel Cormier both training with them and conducting interviews.

Cruz elaborated on his grudge in an interview with ESPN afterwards where he noted that he wasn’t the only one to be frustrated by Molenkamp’s fame-seeking.

“Dana White’s complained about him” he said.

“Monster Energy drink has him running the mixed martial account for some reason. If you don’t comment on his posts if you don’t do his photos and his interviews he’ll hold your sponsorship into account he’ll hold it against you.

“I’m sponsored by Monster Energy Drink – not Molenkamp. My point was if he doesn’t re-sign me okay so be it.

“I’m tired of him forcing him to like on his pages forcing me to take pictures and do interviews when I’m sponsored by Monster not him.”

Cruz’s reference to Dana White comes from a Molenkamp Instagram post a couple of years ago in which he claimed he had introduced White to a celebrity.

White commented before Molenkamp deleted his post.

The new dividend policy issued by the Bangladesh Bank recently revealed the real financial capacity of banks as dividend is now linked with financial strength.

Only 12 out of 30 listed banks in the country have the capacity to declare a maximum of 30% dividend for last year complying with the dividend rule. These banks are – Al-Arafah Islami Bank Bank Asia City Bank Dutch-Bangla Bank Dhaka Bank Eastern Bank Jamuna Bank Mutual Trust Bank Prime Bank Pubali Bank Southeast Bank and Trust Bank.

In 2010 when the market was booming half of the listed banks declared dividends as high as 30%-95% while 11 banks declared over 20% dividend.

Even though there was no rule about declaring dividend previously the Covid-19 pandemic has brought the Bangladesh Bank to the realisation that shareholder directors must be compelled to concentrate on banks' performance to get reward from public money.

According to the new dividend policy a bank can declare a maximum of 30% dividend including 15% cash for shareholders only if it can maintain a minimum of 15% capital adequacy ratio (CAR).

Despite having provision forbearance the average industry CAR declined to 11.64% in December last year from 11.94% in September the same year. The capital base is assumed to deteriorate further in the coming days as regular loan classifications resumed from January this year which will increase provisional burden eroding capital base.

The new dividend policy has given rise to debate in the market. Managements of banks are happy with the policy because it will strengthen their companies' financial health. Shareholders on the other hand have reacted rather negatively to the decision which has already been reflected in the stock market. Prices of banking sector stocks have been in downtrend since the policy was issued.

The dividend policy that the Bangladesh Bank issued on 7 February this year however has given a clear picture of the real capacity of banks in terms of declaring dividend.

For instance National Bank – a listed private commercial bank – that had declared 95% dividend for its shareholders in 2010 is currently not capable of declaring over 15% dividend for the year 2020 as it does not comply with regulatory requirements in maintaining capital base in line with the new dividend policy.

Moreover if the bank takes provisioning forbearance it will not be allowed to declare more than 12% dividend according to the dividend policy.

Banks are required to earmark a portion of their profit as provision to tackle default loan risks and some banks take deferral from the Bangladesh Bank when they fail to maintain it.

The inability of National Bank to comply with the regulatory requirements reflects how the company had been declaring a high dividend ignoring its weak health.

The weak financial health of the bank has a reflection in its share price as well. The share price of the once highest dividend declaring bank is now the lowest among all listed banks in the stock market.

Each share of the bank has been trading at Tk7 far below its face value of Tk10.

National Bank's CAR – the ratio of a bank's capital to its risk – stood at 13.3% in December last year after making slight improvement from 12.63% in September thanks to provision forbearance amid suspension of loan classification throughout the year.

The Bangladesh Bank has tightened dividend policy for banks to counter a probable wave of default loans in the coming months as an aftershock of the pandemic said a senior executive of the central bank.

""Banks have to build their capital to tackle unforeseen losses. Capital may increase in two ways — fresh investment by sponsors and retention of earnings by banks"" he observed.

""But because of legal barriers both ways are now complex for banks. For instance the bank company act allows an individual director to hold a maximum of 5% shares personally and 10% with family which is a barrier to injecting fresh capital by increasing share holdings.

""Meanwhile the issue of retaining earnings is costly for banks at present as the government in the last national budget imposed a 10% on retained earnings if they exceed 70% of profit.""

In this situation the Bangladesh Bank has tightened the dividend policy to increase the banks' capital base which will ultimately extend their lending capacity he explained.

Earlier in September last year the central bank showed its strict stance on dividend declaration by denying the dividend proposal of Rupali Bank for the year 2019 landing the listed company to junk stock from ""A"" category.

Despite having capital shortfall the board of the bank approved a 5% stock dividend which goes against the dividend policy. The practice of declaring dividend despite poor financial health had been going on for long but the Bangladesh Bank has put a stop to this by issuing the dividend policy.

After the dividend proposal of Rupali Bank was scrapped by the regulatory authority the share price of the bank has continued to fall reaching the range of Tk24-25 each currently from above Tk30 several months back.

Even though banks appear to be more interested in declaring dividends despite suffering losses or having capital shortfalls companies of other sectors show the opposite behaviour.

For instance newly listed telecom company Robi Axiata decided not to declare a dividend for the year 2020 despite seeing a sevenfold jump in its annual profit.

The company preferred cash retention within the business instead of its stock market image in the first year of listing.

The stock market shareholders reacted negatively to the decision causing an immediate tumble in share price after the information was disclosed last month. Addressing the issue Robi's Managing Director and CEO Mahtab Uddin Ahmed requested general investors not to consider dividend as the only indicator of a company's performance.

Ahsan H Mansur executive director of Policy Research Institute (PRI) has welcomed the new dividend policy saying ""The Bangladesh Bank has linked dividend with banks' performance which is good for companies.""

The new policy will make directors and shareholders focus on improving their company's performance to get a good dividend he observed.

He further added that shareholders should be more educated and focus on value of share instead of dividend.

""Retention of earnings will increase the value of shares which will bring shareholders more benefit.""

Criticising the National Board of Revenue's (NBR) decision to impose 10% tax on retained earnings he said the NBR panalises companies for not declaring cash dividends for shareholders which is not good for the business.

Impact of the new dividend policy on stock prices

Banking sector shares experienced a big shock following the policy declaration.

Bank shares lost a market capital of Tk2100 crore in the last one month.

Out of 30 listed banks shares of 13 banks are currently trading close to their face value of Tk10 or below according to the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE).

What is in the policy?

According to the new policy banks that will be able to maintain at least 13.5% capital without taking any deferral facility can announce up to 25% dividend while the capital requirement in the previous circular was 11.25% for 15% dividend.

Banks that are not under any deferral facility and able to maintain a minimum of 11.87% capital can declare a maximum of 15% dividend including 7.5% cash.

Banks that have a minimum of 12.5% capital base and have enjoyed deferral facility can declare highest 12% dividend including 6% cash.

Banks with a minimum 11.87% capital base can declare a highest 10% dividend with 5% cash.

Banks with less than 10.62% capital base will not be allowed to declare cash dividend but can give a maximum of 5% stock dividend.",,,,,,,,,,,,

These agricultural investments largely unnoticed and unchecked represent a potentially catastrophic blind spot.

“Animal protein and even dairy is likely and already has started to become the new oil and gas” said Bruno Sarda the former North America president of CDP a framework through which companies disclose their carbon emissions. “This is the biggest source of emissions that doesn’t have a target on its back.”

By pouring money into emissions-intensive agriculture banks and investors are making a dangerous bet on the world’s growing demand for food especially foods that are the greatest source of emissions in the food system: meat and dairy.

Agriculture and deforestation largely driven by livestock production are responsible for nearly one quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. By 2030 livestock production alone could consume nearly half the world’s carbon budget the amount of greenhouse gas the world can emit without blowing past global climate targets.

“It’s not enough to divest from fossil fuel” said Devlin Kuyek a senior researcher at GRAIN a non-profit organization that advocates for small farms. “If you look at emissions just from the largest meat and dairy companies and the trajectories they have you see that these companies and their models are completely unsustainable.”

Those trajectories could put global climate goals well out of reach.

The American banks that are the four leading financiers globally of fossil fuels —JP Morgan Chase Wells Fargo Citigroup and Bank of America—all to varying degrees have made climate action more of a priority. But these and other major global banks continue to funnel dollars into companies that trade in “soft commodities”including beef soy timber and palm oil that are linked to the destruction of forests and critically important ecosystems.

A battery of recent analyses by sustainable investment and environmental advocacy groups has tracked the dollars. JP Morgan Chase for example has directed more than $450 million since 2016 to leading Brazilian meat packers that environmental groups claim have direct ties to deforestation and to recent devastating fires in the Amazon. BNP Paribas and HSBC are among the banks that have committed to stop funding deforestation from agriculture but still continue to provide billions to companies that have not.

Though they have promised to address climate change Rabobank Morgan Stanley Barclays and Goldman Sachs continue funding agribusinesses directly or indirectly involved in deforestation or high-carbon agriculture.

The banks either declined to comment for this article or did not respond to requests for comment. HSBC and Morgan Stanley pointed to their sustainability commitments online.

“We’re still trying to get the banks to recognize that the land-use sector is part of the climate problem” said Hana Heineken a senior campaigner with the Rainforest Action Network an advocacy group that has extensively tracked how banks have financed deforestation. “As things stand right now there is still a disconnect between banks saying they’re going to address climate change in their portfolios and what they’re going to do about financing.”

The world’s largest asset managers—BlackRock Vanguard and State Street—sell investment funds marketed as “sustainable.” But some of these funds contain agribusiness companies blamed for cutting down tropical forests. And the asset managers are among the biggest investors in major meat and dairy companies including JBS the world’s largest beef producer. None of these asset managers has a formal policy on deforestation environmental groups say.

When reached for comment the asset managers pointed to their sustainability platforms online and noted increased efforts to address deforestation and climate impacts from agriculture in their portfolios. In early 2020 BlackRock acknowledged the climate impacts of certain agribusiness practices and said it would push for greater disclosure of sustainability measures from companies in its funds.

The world’s food system needs to feed a population expected to hit 10 billion by 2050 meaning that the system will have 3 billion more people to feed than it did a decade ago. Global investors and banks see an opportunity in these numbers and in some cases are doubling down.

The climate impact of this could be disastrous with emissions from the food system projected to rise by nearly 60 percent if they stay on their current path.

Faced with these dire numbers some critics are increasingly calling for divestment from the food and agriculture companies with the biggest climate impacts—especially giant livestock and grain companies—much as they’ve called for divestment from fossil fuel companies.

Others are simply calling for more vigilance in policing destructive farming practices and the financial institutions that support them. They’re also pushing for more support for farmers and farming methods that use fewer resources emit fewer greenhouse gases and replenish soils.

“We need food” said Moira Birss climate and finance director for Amazon Watch. “And we don’t need fossil fuels.”

As demand for food rises the world’s banks and investors will ultimately determine whether an increasingly taxed food system fuels a climate collapse.

Big Banks Have Big Impacts

Agriculture is the biggest driver of deforestation globally responsible for half of all recent tree loss and more than 90 percent in the tropics.

Palm oil soy and cattle are the largest commodities behind that loss with cattle accounting for from half to two-thirds as agribusiness interests or their suppliers cut down or burn forests to open up more pasture to graze the animals or cropland to feed them. These commodities known as “soft commodities” because they are grown not extracted pose the most significant risks to forests.

They are also the keys to profit for the agriculture and food industries.

Clearing forests releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide and destroys their ability to store carbon. It’s also a major cause of soil erosion and biodiversity loss which create yet more risk to the global food supply and to public health as the coronavirus pandemic has so clearly illustrated. With the destruction of large ecosystems biodiversity plummets. The species that survive tend to be the ones that harbor and spread disease.

While the burning of fossil fuels remains the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions emissions from agriculture would have to be slashed to stay within the 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius targets of the Paris climate agreement. That’s even if the rest of the economy including the energy and transportation sectors adequately decarbonized.

Stopping deforestation is one of the fastest ways to limit carbon emissions. Yet the world’s biggest banks and asset managers are fueling the problem instead.

The UK-based group Global Canopy examined the companies with the greatest exposure to deforestation including financial institutions. It found that despite making commitments to stop deforestation by 2020 as of 2018 not a single company was on track to cut deforestation from its supply chains. These included a range of companies that rely on commodities tied to deforestation including McDonald’s and PepsiCo.

Banks Global Canopy concluded were the biggest laggards: “Financial institutions are behind companies in setting commitments and policies on deforestation. Of the 150 financial institutions assessed nearly two thirds had no financing policy for any of the four key forest-risk commodities” their report said. In its 2020 analysis the group found 63 percent of financial institutions still did not have deforestation policies.

This despite the banks’ outward claims and commitments to tackling climate change.

In fact the world’s major banks are accelerating their funding of commodities tied to deforestation in Latin America Africa and Southeast Asia. Among the top banks funding “forest-risk” commodities—those potentially responsible for deforestation —are JP Morgan Chase and Rabobank the world’s leading agricultural bank which has said it does not fund deforestation in any areas of Brazil.

Many of their commitments—public and much applauded—have come since the Paris climate agreement. Yet as with the funding of fossil fuels the money they are investing has ballooned since the historic accord. Overall global banks have increased their lending to commodities linked to deforestation by about 40 percent funneling $154 billion in credit from December 2015 when the agreement was signed to April of last year.

Most of these forests are being converted into cropland to grow grain to feed livestock or to pastureland to graze cattle. The conversion doesn’t just destroy forests releasing carbon dioxide in the process it multiplies the number of animals that emit methane an especially potent greenhouse gas.

Financial think tanks and green investment groups in report after report have found that major global banks have made promises to stop financing deforestation but have not lived up to them. Not a single major bank that has committed to stop financing deforestation from soft commodities has done so completely or quickly enough according to a December report from BankTrack.

And no American bank has required its clients to adopt no-deforestation policies.

JP Morgan Citigroup and Bank of America are among the top US-based creditors of American commodities giants Cargill Bunge and ADM which supply major American food businesses from McDonald’s to Walmart.

These grain traders have made commitments to stop deforestation but continue to come under fire for their vast soy plantations one of the largest drivers of deforestation in South America.

Cargill and Bunge did not respond to requests for comment.

Edel Bach a spokesman for JBS said the company has a “zero-tolerance approach to illegal deforestation” and “has made extensive investments… to monitor its entire Amazon value chain to ensure it is illegal deforestation free by 2025.”

Jackie Anderson a spokeswoman for ADM explained that the company has a no-deforestation policy is a signatory to a moratorium on deforestation in the Amazon and is a founding member of the Soft Commodities Forum an effort to stop deforestation and land conversion in the soy supply chain.

Recent research has found that despite making these commitments the major grain traders are still producing commodities that are tied to deforestation in areas of Brazil beyond the Amazon. These same companies continue to be blamed for deforestation linked to palm oil in Southeast Asia much of which ends up in products made by top international consumer goods companies.

The Role of the Asset Managers

The biggest asset managers led by BlackRock are also significantly invested in the meat and dairy industries and in other commodities linked with deforestation.

Though meat and dairy account for less than 1 percent of their total assets under management BlackRock Capital Group and Vanguard are the meat and dairy industries’ largest shareholders according to Feedback Global.

Blackrock and Vanguard are also JP Morgan’s largest shareholders.

BlackRock Vanguard and State Street—“The Big Three” asset managers— have $12 billion invested in producers linked to deforestation including the major grain traders ADM Bunge and Cargill and the meatpackers JBS Marfrig and Minerva according to a recent analysis by Friends of the Earth. ADM Bunge Cargill and JBS in turn indirectly and directly supply some of the world’s biggest consumer goods companies including PepsiCo Nestlé and Unilever.

The report puts much of the blame on the big asset managers. “Powerful investors have consistently undermined meaningful action by agribusinesses and the consumer goods sector writ large” the analysis said.

The asset managers say they have no control over the companies in their funds because the majority of their investment products are passively managed index funds. These types of funds follow a major market index like the S&P 500 which means the index manager actually controls which companies are in the fund.

“Every dollar that BlackRock manages belongs to our clients and more than 90% of our equity assets are invested in index-based funds that our clients choose” a spokesman for BlackRock responded in an email. “We cannot selectively divest from individual companies in indexes that may present sustainability risks.”

A Vanguard spokesperson said that while there is “no industry acknowledged specific exclusion regarding deforestation” Vanguard’s sustainability funds track an index that filters out companies that fail to align with principles outlined by the United Nations. (These do not explicitly mention deforestation.)

State Street and Capital Advisors pointed to their sustainability statements online.

But critics say that the Big Three and other major asset managers are getting a pass and that they could exclude certain companies from their basket of investments if they implemented no-deforestation policies or structured their products differently.

“They could put in place explicit screening tools” said Matthew McLuckie managing partner at Posaidon Capital a London and Zurich-based green investment firm. “If you are going to support a net-zero transition or Paris alignment how can you be holding companies chopping down tropical forests?”

In emailed responses to questions about their deforestation practices McDonald’s Nestlé Unilever and Walmart said that they had made commitments to source their products only from deforestation-free areas: McDonald’s said it would eliminate deforestation from its supply chain by 2030; Nestlé said it would stop sourcing soy and palm from deforested areas by 2022 and stopped buying Brazilian soybeans from Cargill in 2019; Unilever said its supply chains would be deforestation-free by 2023; Walmart said it would stop sourcing beef in deforested areas of Brazil by 2022 among other commitments. PepsiCo did not respond to a request for comment.

Disclosure is Voluntary

Over the last decade investors and regulators have pushed companies including financial institutions to disclose their carbon emissions.

Disclosure is a key first step toward giving investors and banks the information they need to make informed decisions about where to put—or not to put— their money.

Guidelines like those outlined by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and platforms including the CDP (formerly the Climate Disclosure Project) have prompted greater responses from a growing number of companies that see climate change as a risk.

Without disclosures banks and investors aren’t equipped with information about the greenhouse gas impacts of the companies including banks that they invest in or support.

But these disclosure requirements are voluntary and critically they don’t comprehensively reveal the extent of deforestation or other climate risks in companies’ agricultural supply chains.

The TFCD guidelines the most robust and widely used explicitly say that banks don’t have to disclose emissions from agriculture. Rather the task force “suggests banks define carbon-related assets as those assets tied to the energy and utilities sectors.”

That means for banks at least in the framework of the TCFD agriculture isn’t a “carbon-related” asset so banks don’t have to reveal the extent to which they finance them.

Critics say this allows banks and the companies they finance to hide behind their supply chains. JP Morgan’s first report using the TCFD guidelines for example contains no mention of the bank’s investment in commodities with ties to deforestation.

Most of the emissions from agriculture and food companies come from their “Scope 3” emissions—emissions not from their direct operations but from their supply chains. Nearly 90 percent of food and agribusiness company emissions fall into this category experts say but only a fraction of the companies report them. Of the world’s top food and beverage companies only 16 percent disclose emissions from their agricultural supply chains.

Many companies don’t report on the deforestation in their supply chains at all. Those include Domino’s Pizza and Mondelez. And even those that do disclose may not depending on the company include a complete picture of emissions from deforestation or importantly the conversion of land from forest to pasture or cropland.

A Domino’s spokesman said the company provides information on sourcing for its U.S. products on its website and is currently developing a climate strategy. Mondelez did not reply to a request for comment.

Part of the problem is not just the general murkiness of supply chains but a lack of common principles for measuring emissions from land conversion and deforestation.

“In greenhouse gas accounting of Scope 3 emissions it’s challenging to get high quality data because they don’t have a lot of transparency in their supply chains” said Cynthia Cummis a greenhouse gas accounting expert with the World Resources Institute. “The science behind land-based emissions is challenging and there isn’t agreement on the best methods.”

Companies can take advantage of that critics say. The data self-reported to CDP by the companies is not audited by a third party and critics say CDP’s rating system rewards companies for having a policy on deforestation even if that policy is weak.

“In effect you’re taking a company’s word” said McLuckie. “Investors are left largely in the dark.”

‘This is Just About Money’

Demand for “green” investments that meet environmental standards has grown in recent years as progressive investors pressure companies to address climate change. “Impact investing” has gained traction with investors and sustainable funds now control more than $1 trillion in assets doubling according to a 2020 analysis by Morningstar over the three years before the study.

A 2019 report from the Croatan Institute found that impact investing now accounts for more than $17 trillion—or one in three dollars—of the more than $51 trillion in assets under professional management a 42 percent increase over 2018.

In a January 2020 commentary BlackRock acknowledged that agribusinesses have a significant climate impact especially because of their links to deforestation and said that the company would engage with those companies to improve their performance.

“Amongst other things we ask companies to disclose any initiatives and externally developed codes of conduct e.g. committing to deforestation-free supply chains to which they adhere and to report on outcomes ideally with some level of independent review” the company reported.

But some of BlackRock’s sustainable investment funds contain large agribusiness companies with ties to deforestation. For a company to be included in the fund it needs to provide an inventory of its greenhouse gas emissions but not its Scope 3 emissions.

“You have huge agroindustrial companies —chemical fertilizer seed monopolies— in these so-called sustainability funds” said Mark Campanale executive director of Carbon Tracker. “If they’re the answer we’re asking the wrong questions.”

Giant fund managers establish criteria for the risk they’ll take on in their portfolios but because of the lack of transparency and uniform standards on disclosure they may not know the extent of the emissions from any given company.

Companies with supply chains linked to deforestation often defend themselves by saying that the supply chains are too complicated to monitor effectively and that doing so would be prohibitively expensive.

Some companies notably Unilever are investing millions to clarify their supply chains so investors and consumers know exactly where their products are sourced. But many companies hide behind their supply chains some analysts say.

“They try to do everything they can to be intransparent in their supply chains” said Gerard Rijk senior equity analyst with Profundo a Netherlands-based research group that tracks supply chains and investing. “It’s clear they’re not trying hard enough. This is just about money.”

One initiative the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) created a system that enables financial institutions to assess their “financed emissions.” Like supply chain emissions a financial institution’s loans and investments are Scope 3 emissions and represent the vast majority of their emissions.

In July Morgan Stanley became the first U.S. banking giant to join PCAF. It was followed soon after by Bank of America and Citi. As of February 2021 PCAF included 101 financial institutions representing more than $21 trillion in assets.

But PCAF’s methodology a work in progress does not yet encompass carbon emitted from land-use conversion when land is changed from forest to crop or pastureland one of the biggest sources of emissions from agriculture.

Doubling Down

To feed 10 billion people by 2050 the world needs to produce 50 to 70 percent more food.

For investors those are appealing figures.

“Demand is going up and there’s a lot of money to be made” said Merel van der Mark coordinator of the forests and finance coalition for the Rainforest Action Network.

In a 2018 report Valoral Advisors said there were roughly 440 funds in the food and agriculture sector up from 38 in 2005. Those funds managed around $73 billion in investments. “The last 10 years have seen the emergence of the global F&A sector as an institutional asset class with increasing interest from private and institutional investors alike” Valoral said referring to the food and agriculture sector.

Indeed investors seem to be doubling down in part because they’re getting a strong message about future demand. That’s true for food of all kinds but especially for meat and dairy as appetites and incomes rise in developing countries.

A marked uptick in agricultural investing occurred after the 2008 financial crisis when global food prices spiked and investors began seeing opportunities especially in farmland.

“Within the financial sector there’s just been an evolving and growing effort to find returns wherever they can and it’s moving beyond your traditional investments” said Kuyek of GRAIN. “That’s part of the reason you’re seeing investment in agriculture.”

The profits to be made from meat and dairy are especially enticing largely because of rising demand but also because low grain prices have made it increasingly cheap to produce beef and milk at lower costs.

“There’s been a meat-ification of diets particularly in the US Europe Brazil and Australia and increasingly China” said Daniel Jones a senior campaign manager with Feedback. “We know that meat and dairy is a climate issue but why is it that meat and dairy continues to grow? Is it an insatiable human appetite for meat? Probably not.”

Saying but Not Doing

As investors increasingly move toward investing in sustainable investment funds and impact investing grows shareholders and green-focused asset managers have been pushing companies to tackle their climate impacts.

They do this through a range of actions including putting forward shareholder resolutions requesting climate action.

Because the giant asset managers are often the largest shareholders in corporations—including banks—their votes can determine whether a resolution passes or not. And for the most part even asset managers that have committed to addressing climate change often have failed to support climate-related resolutions. In 2020 for example BlackRock and Vanguard voted against climate-related resolutions more than 80 percent of the time.

On agriculture-specific resolutions the numbers are even lower.

In cases where BlackRock did vote with shareholder proposals in favor of climate action the companies it targeted were largely energy companies not those with agricultural supply chains and links to deforestation. Since 2012 the Big Three have voted against or abstained from 16 shareholder proposals aimed specifically at deforestation. (In a notable exception BlackRock voted in 2020 to support a shareholder proposal at Procter & Gamble that asked the company to report on its efforts to eliminate deforestation in its supply chain).

“There’s absolutely a big gap full-stop” said Jessye Waxman shareholder advocate with Green Century Funds. “I think this speaks to the broader questions about what it really means for a firm to be addressing climate risk comprehensively. If you want to address climate risk you need to address agriculture.”

Feedback Global and other critics contend that engagement—from appealing to companies directly to shareholder resolutions—isn’t working. They’re now calling for divestment from carbon-intensive agricultural and livestock companies.

Still other critics say that banks and investors have an opportunity to influence companies toward more sustainable forms of agriculture.

“Our call isn’t for full and immediate divestment from the agriculture industry as it essentially is for fossil fuels” said Birss of Amazon Watch. “It’s not the same. We can’t say it’s all terrible.”

But she added “If irreparable harms to the climate come from the production of food those who are carrying out the production of that food and the people providing the one necessary ingredient —finance—have a responsibility to ensure those irreparable harms aren’t happening.”

The status of Grand Theft Auto 6 remains the biggest question in gaming today. Some leaks have claimed that it’s finished and releasing in the near future while other insiders have said it is still some years away.

Though that hasn’t stopped fans and investors of Take-Two – the publishers of Rockstar’s releases – bombarding them with questions about the game.

In early February the publishers responded to questions about a possible remaster of GTA 3 Vice City and San Andreas releasing before GTA 6 saying any announcement will come from Rockstar.

The mosaic on the nearly 30m-long wall in Bennett Path which connects Bennett and Brighton Rds was created by community members as a means of brightening up the neighbourhood and covering up graffiti.

Vianney Santagati instigated the project a year and a-half ago with Maria Macnee but it quickly grew to become a project for the wider neighbourhood.

Mrs Santagati and Mrs Macnee advertised the project by putting flyers in letterboxes bringing a wide variety of people including local children to work on the wall.

‘‘It’s a real community project. We’ve had people bring us afternoon tea’’ Mrs Santagati said.

She has created other mosaics around Dunedin including a coat of arms at St Margaret's College.

The tiles were sourced through donations recycling and discount sales.

Tile Centre provided some of the tiles and grout for the project.

‘‘A lot of it would have ended up in the skip otherwise.’’

The Dunedin City Council provided a grant to help complete the wall.

Mrs Santagati said the diversity of skills and tastes made the wall unique.

‘‘Nothing has to be perfect because then it would be a bit boring.’’

The updates include maintaining 20 to 25 companies to be classified as “Hong Kong companies”; broadening the number of industry classifications from 4 to 7 adding Information Technology Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary & Staples; and reducing the time required after an IPO before a new stock can be included from 2 years to 3 months.

The plans also include increasing the number of companies to between 65 and 80 as well as capping weightings at 8% from 10%.

The sweeping proposal comes amid significant changes within the city’s stock market as a wave of Chinese megacaps choose the financial hub as a preferred venue to sell shares.

Hong Kong’s benchmark index is near its lowest level versus the MSCI World Index in 17 years and the gauge’s abundance of old-economy financial stocks has made it look outdated in an age when China’s tech giants have increasing sway.

Financial news services around the world quote the Hang Seng Index (HSI) as the main indicator of Hong Kong listed stock performance and locally billions of dollars of retirement savings track its ups and downs.

Brief history

The HSI launched in November 1969 with 30 stocks backdated to a base value of 100 from the end of July 1964. The original 30 included names like the iconic Star Ferry and Philippine beer brand San Miguel both of which were dropped from the index in 1972 and Dairy Farm dropped in 1973 added back in 1987 then dropped again in 1995.

Up until 2006 the HSI composition witnessed little expansion in its components with just 33 companies the vast majority of which were still mostly known as Hong Kong companies making most of their revenues and profits within the Hong Kong SAR.

Major changes though started thereafter when several more mainland-oriented “H-Share” “Red Chip” and “P Chip” stocks were added without removing existing components.

These additions included CCB Sinopec and Bank of China in 2006 and ICBC China Life Ping An Bank of Communications PetroChina China Overseas and China Shenhua in 2007 taking the total number of stocks to 43.

Soon Chinese tech biggie encent replaced PCCW in 2008 then a few more additions in the following years made the Hang Seng a 50-stock index for most of the period from 2012 through the end of 2020.

However the steady rise of Mainland-based but Hong Kong-listed companies has raised some concern since then as the index started mimicking the Mainland-focused benchmarks like the related Hang Seng China Enterprises.

This explains why the quota for the index to assure inclusion of 20-25 “Hong Kong companies” was highlighted.

Before and after

Today the top-10 HSI components represent just two industries Finance and Information Technology and total just over 60% of the index:

Source: Tracker Fund Portfolio Holdings

Another enhancement accompanying this sector update is an explicit target that the index should cover at least 50% of the market value of each of the seven industries listed on the Hong Kong Exchange.

This is expected to have the biggest impact on the Healthcare and Consumer sectors though all this chart means is that the index will cover more of those two industries not that those two industries will be a significantly larger share of the index.

Experts say as listed companies across Greater China continue to increase their weightage on the stock exchange the proposed changes would help the Hang Seng more comparable to the S&P 500 or STOXX 600 than to the more bank-heavy S&P/TSX 60.

Customers and competitors

Broadly the Hang Seng fund benchmark customers are local and regional while traders of Hang Seng futures and options are global ones.

The most “captive” customers of the HSI are employees working in Hong Kong who are required to contribute to local Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) retirement savings schemes.

The HSI is also currently tracked by at least 10 different ETFs (3 listed in Hong Kong 2 in Shanghai 1 in Shenzhen 1 in India and 3 in Europe and the Middle East) and 11 leveraged & inverse products (all in Hong Kong) as well as a few other funds).

The two largest Hang Seng ETFs (HKEX tickers 2800 and 2833) are also the two largest ETFs in Hong Kong with almost HK$150 billion (US$19.3 billion) in assets and with a 0.1% expense ratio are among the lowest cost funds in Asia.

Outside Hong Kong and Mainland China the HSI is not as widely used as a fund benchmark barring the two largest US-ETFs with significant allocations to Hong Kong listed stocks: the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF.

Each of these ETFs currently have $108 billion and $78 billion in total assets under management respectively of which 20-30% are allocated to Hong Kong listed shares both larger than Hong Kong’s largest tracker fund.

Going forward futures and options traders in New York or London are more likely to use Hang Seng for their “go-to” China H-share indexes expect experts.

That’s because Hong Kong lists futures and options on the related HSCEI as well as “mini” futures contracts both the HSI and HSCEI with the total volumes of these contracts making Hang Seng the clear leader in benchmarking derivatives on H-shares.

The next most traded China equity index futures contracts outside of Mainland China are the FTSE futures contracts listed in Singapore with roughly US$5-10 billion in daily volume tracking the very different “FTSE China A50” index of A-shares.

Singapore’s SGX recently launched a futures contract on the FTSE China H50 Index that more directly competes with Hang Seng but the $40 million daily volume of these H50 contracts “have a long way to go before catching up.

The proposed changes then could have an enormous impact on investment funds traded via options and futures.

Valuation and Expected Returns of Hang Seng Tracking Portfolios

For investors and retirement savers with funds benchmarked to the HSI the key question is “what is my future expected rate of return on my funds”? Although future investment returns are impossible to predict valuation is often a key input to future returns as all else being equal the more you pay for the same future profits the lower your rate of yield and vice versa. At a time when many investors are concerned about stock markets being “high” or “expensive” let’s take a quick look at how the HSI’s valuation multiples compare to history and how these recently announced updates may impact these multiples.

Since 1973 the dividend yield of the HSI has largely traded between 2% and 5% with the two biggest spikes above 5% happening early first at the end of the 1972-1974 bear market and again in the early 1980s around the establishment of the Hong Kong dollar peg. The following chart plots the earnings yield (the inverse of the P/E ratio) above the dividend yield to show one important trend in Hong Kong dividends over the past 50 years: HSI components paid out almost all their earnings as dividends in the early 1970s but over the past decade payout ratios have fallen to less than half.

This next dividend yield chart shows dividend yields broken down by each of the four old industry classifications. What is notable is how the yield of the Commerce & Industry sector has diverged away from the other three sectors down to lows not seen since the 1999-2001 dot-com bubble. As seen in the table of top 10 components above this seems to be due to the rising weight and valuation of Information Technology giants that pay little or no dividends. This means that from a yield and valuation perspective it will be important to watch how much the upcoming rebalances of the HSI trim exposure to larger low-yield or no-yield names and re-allocate to higher yielding names. Seeing that the median dividend yield of the 52 largest HK-listed companies is currently 2.6% versus 3.6% for the next 52 largest stocks (https://www.hkex.com.hk/Market-Data/Securities-Prices/Equities?sc_lang=en) it seems likely the rebalance may both raise as well as diversify the index’s dividend yield.

Conclusion

For most of my career so far I had considered the Hang Seng to be an index widely used news sources and traders but a lopsided and outdated measure for long-term Greater China investors seeking a benchmark. Of the modernizations described above the lowering of the maximum stock weight to 8% and target that the index will cover at least 50% of the value of each of 7 industries listed in Hong Kong are the two I believe are most important to making the HSI more balanced and relevant to investors.

Shares of XPeng (NYSE: XPEV) fell 29.2% in February according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The Chinese electric-vehicle (EV) stock sold off amid a broader pullback for EV companies.

A sharp rise for Treasury bond yields kicked off in February and investors began moving out of tech stocks in favor of fixed income investments and stocks in the energy and industrials sectors. EV stocks were hit particularly hard and XPeng got caught up in the pullback.

So what

XPeng stock is still up roughly 32% over the last year but the company's share price also trades off roughly 62% from the high that it hit last November. The company is expanding its EV deliveries at a rapid clip and it looks as if it will continue to enjoy strong growth despite currently shipping fewer vehicles than competitors NIO and Li Auto. However XPeng could get caught up in a broader correction for electric-vehicle stocks.

Now what

XPeng stock has continued to slide early in March's trading. The company's share price is down roughly 21% in the month so far.

XPeng published its February vehicle delivery figures on March 1 reporting that it had delivered 2223 vehicles in February. Combined vehicle deliveries across January and February were up 577% and the company has now delivered 20181 of its P7 midsize sedans.

The company has established itself as an early force in China's EV space and it has a large addressable market to grow into but investors should probably expect high volatility in the near term. XPeng has a market capitalization of roughly $20 billion and trades at roughly 27 times trailing sales. The company is scheduled to publish its fourth-quarter results on March 8.

Apple Inc. has slumped 15% since late January. Tesla Inc. has lost more than a quarter-trillion dollars in market value in three weeks. And more than $1.5 trillion has been wiped off the Nasdaq 100 in less than a month.And yet none of it has been enough to rattle the retail investor.Instead to borrow a Reddit phrase describing bullish gumption they’ve had diamond hands. Since the market peaked a few weeks ago retail traders have plowed cash into U.S. stocks at a rate 40% higher than they did in 2020 which was a record year. They’re opting for parts of the market that have suffered the most doubling down in arguably risky ways with triple-leveraged tech funds and options galore.A year out from the Covid-19 stock crash with individual traders now making up nearly a quarter of U.S. volume on any given day battle lines are forming. Some of the favored speculative bets that minted money on the way up -- electric-vehicle stocks special purpose acquisition companies and green energy plays to name a few -- are the same securities that are buckling now as bond yields rise.Retail traders many of them newbie investors have consistently held strong buying virtually every dip during what’s been the best start to a bull market in nine decades. But now the world is wondering how much it’ll take for them to call it quits especially after a year in which retail traders were right way more often than wrong.“Historically it’s been a bad signal that retail investors are piling into the market and a signal of a top” said Arthur Hogan chief market strategist at National Securities Corp. “And every time we tried to call a top in 2020 because of retail participation it was wrong.”As stocks swooned over the last three weeks retail investors snapped up an average of $6.6 billion in U.S. equities each week according to data from VandaTrack an arm of Vanda Research that monitors retail flows in the U.S. market. That’s up from an average $4.7 billion in net weekly purchases in 2020.They’ve doubled down on areas of the market that have been hit the hardest. Apple which has plunged 15% since late January was the most-popular retail buy this past week. NIO Inc. the electric-vehicle maker down almost 40% since Feb. 9 was the second-most popular. Next up were exchange-traded funds tied to the Nasdaq 100 the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (ticker QQQ) and a triple leveraged version (ticker TQQQ).On Thursday when the Nasdaq 100 fell as much as 2.9% almost 32 million bullish call options traded across U.S. exchanges the fifth-most on record. The other four have all occurred within the last four months.Equity ETFs added almost $7 billion of fresh money during the first four days of March building on a record $83 billion that flooded in last month data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. In fact even before March began flows into U.S.-listed ETFs were off to their best start to a year on record out-pacing the prior best start -- which was in 2017 -- by over 74% according to Matt Bartolini State Street Global Advisors’ head of SPDR Americas Research.“There’s a lot of excess liquidity and we just had this $600 check going to many families in January” said Jimmy Chang chief investment officer of Rockefeller Global Family Office. “We’re going to get an additional liquidity injection in the $1400 check and part of that money is going into risk assets.”Karim Alammuri a 31-year-old marketing strategy manager is one of many retail investors who’s been snapping up stocks. In recent days he bought shares of fuboTV Inc. and SPAC Churchill Capital Corp IV. Fubo TV has plunged more than 50% since a December peak. Churchill Capital has lost almost 60% of its value in 11 trading sessions.“I plan on sticking around because I don’t want to take a loss” he said by phone from New York. “A lot of very attractive stocks are on crazy discount right now so I’m just looking to see how I can re-shuffle things to be able to buy them.”With an army of retail investors standing ready to buy any dip those declines have grown shallower and shallower. The S&P 500 has gone without a 5% pullback since early November or 83 straight days the longest streak in a year.The end result of persistent dip buying is a market with little downside. At its lowest closing level of 2021 the S&P 500 was only down 1.5% year-to-date. That’s the smallest drawdown at this time of a year since 2017.If past is precedent that could mean the sell-off has more room to run. Retail investors tend to buy the initial dips and it’s not until they capitulate and sell that markets ultimately bottom according to Eric Liu co-founder and head of research at Vanda Research. The firm’s data show that was the case in both selloffs in 2018 as well as roughly a year ago during the Covid crash.To Victoria Fernandez chief market strategist for Crossmark Global Investments their continued presence in the markets likely means elevated volatility will persist. Still that doesn’t mean retail investors’ efforts are misguided.“Is there some dumb money in retail trades? Yes. But not all of it” she said. “Some of these people are doing their homework looking for opportunities and trying to take advantage of it. Some win some lose -- it’s really not that different than what professionals do on an institutional basis.”"

The film focuses on an attempt to solve a series of murders that took place at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1830. Oscar-winner Bale reunites with Cooper director of the 2017 Western Hostiles playing a veteran detective who investigates the murders helped by a young-cadet who will later become world-famous author Edgar Allan Poe. Cooper penned the screenplay an adaptation of the Louis Bayard novel of the same name.

Netflix outbid several competitors to secure worldwide rights to the film. CAA Media Finance and Endeavor Content handled domestic sales on The Pale Blue Eye with MadRiver handling international.

Cross Creek producers of The Trial Of The Chicago 7 —which Netflix picked up last summer in a worldwide deal after the film was unable to be released in theaters because of COVID-19—are producers on The Pale Blue Eye. Bale and Cooper with produce together with Birdman producer John Lesher and Cross Creek’s Tyler Thompson.

The film is set to begin principal photography this fall after Bale’s duties on Taika Waititi’s Marvel movie Thor: Love And Thunder and the untitled David O Russell movie both of which are currently in production.

The streaming giant has been on a buying spree at this year’s all-virtual European Film Market previously signing a pair of 8-figure deals: paying a reported $15 million for North America and Latin America rights to Colin Firth World War II movie Operation Mincemeat from The King’s Speech producer See-Saw and Cohen Media Group and dropping $18 million for U.S. rights to Liam Neeson-Laurence Fishburne action-thriller The Ice Road in a deal with CAA Media finance.

Thanks to a Chrome extension some of that functionality can be used within Netflix.

The extension currently only available for Google Chrome on desktops gives us a glimpse as to what Prime Video’s X-Ray function could look like applied to Netflix.

Amazon first introduced X-Ray for Movies all the way back in 2012 and it is one of the few features that sets that streamer aside from the rest.

Unlike Prime Video’s functionality it only currently gives a handful of actors that are based on their appearances throughout the entire show or movie as opposed to Prime Video’s method of doing it on a scene-by-scene basis.

Clicking on any of the actors will bring up a collection of that actor’s other works. Clicking each title will reveal information about that movie or series including trailers review scores and descriptions. Most importantly it pulls in its streaming availability from Google but doesn’t easily indicate which other titles are available on Netflix.

The extension also pulls in soundtracks for respective titles.









We managed to nab a few words with the developer Sid for the Chrome extension to talk about how it came about and where it’s headed in the future.

WoN: What gave you the idea to start the project?

Amazon Prime’s X-Ray feature I loved how I didn’t have to check my phone or switch between windows to get to know more about the cast and songs. But what Amazon’s X-Ray feature lacked was details of the other TV shows and movies the cast has worked in. I’ve added that too. You can see their other works trailers ratings and streaming info in a single click.

WoN: Can you tell us how the extension works technically? Does it use APIs etc?

It uses a bunch of APIs and websites IMDb Youtube TMDb Google and TuneFind.

WoN: How has the reaction been so far?

I’ve only posted a few posts on Reddit so far and the reaction has been pretty good.

WoN: What expansion plans beyond the song lists do you have for the future?

– General Trivia and Goofs related to the movie show and actor

– Recommendations based on the movie/show currently being watched

It would put underemployed Americans to work on projects intended “to conserve and restore public lands and waters bolster community resilience increase reforestation increase carbon sequestration in the agricultural sector protect biodiversity improve access to recreation and address the changing climate.”

That is plenty of justification for such an initiative in the country’s current circumstances. But the potential of this idea if the record of the original C.C.C. is any guide goes far beyond the advertised purposes. A modern-day C.C.C. could be an attention-getting reminder of something that a great many Americans seem to have forgotten: the capacity of government to be an instrument of the common good.

The Civilian Conservation Corps created in the spring of 1933 at the behest of the new President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave jobs to an eventual three million young men before the Second World War took over the task of fighting unemployment. (Roughly eighty-five hundred women participated in a “She-She-She” program belatedly established at Eleanor Roosevelt’s insistence.) The C.C.C. left a legacy of trees trails shelters footbridges picnic areas and campgrounds in local state and national parks across the country. It had equally notable effects on the health and outlook of the men who served. Most were undernourished as well as unemployed when they signed up. They came home with muscles tans and according to a letter sent to corps headquarters in Washington by a resident of Romeo Colorado an “erect carriage” that made them easy to pick out from the rest of the young male population.

Joseph Kaptur of Toledo Ohio treasured the memory of his corps service spent reforesting the shores of the Miami and Erie Canal. His gratitude stuck in the mind of his daughter Marcy Kaptur now an Ohio congresswoman and the sponsor of one of seven C.C.C. bills introduced in Congress last year. “I don’t know anybody who wasn’t changed and uplifted by that experience” she says.

Although Roosevelt sold the C.C.C. as a jobs program first and foremost it was shaped by his strong interest in timber and soil management acquired over the course of efforts to revitalize hundreds of acres of badly tended farmland attached to his family estate in Hyde Park New York. The C.C.C. in turn raised the conservation consciousness of many of its participants according to “Nature’s New Deal” a book from 2009 about the program by the historian Neil Maher. C.C.C. camps had lectures and night classes as well as libraries. A corpsman named Robert Ross assigned to a camp near Crystal Springs Arkansas used his off-hours to investigate matters that he “had been totally ignorant of—soil erosion restoration protection of the forests the uses of land the damage of forest fires.” Less than ten per cent of the enrollees had graduated from high school. Many of them learned to read and write during their time in the corps however and hundreds went on to jobs with the National Park Service the forestry-service unit of the Department of Agriculture and other federal state and local conservation programs.

The C.C.C. had educational value for the people living alongside its camps too. Many communities Maher writes objected mightily to the anticipated arrival of “street-slum foreigners” “corner holders” and “bums.” The hostility tended to evaporate once corpsmen came to town in person proved unthreatening and began spending their wages at local diners shops and movie theatres.

The program was hugely popular everywhere and Roosevelt promoted it as a morale booster in a time of extreme hardship—and as a vote-getter in election years. Among his Administration’s many groundbreaking policies only this one escaped the anti-New Deal fulminations of Alf Landon the Republican governor of Kansas when he ran for President in 1936. Landon like other Republicans praised the corps; he even tried to take credit for getting Congress to extend its operations to state parks. Despite his claim the presence of C.C.C. camps flipped several Kansas counties blue and helped F.D.R. win the state in his landslide reëlection victory.

The revival of interest in the idea can be traced to two loose groups of C.C.C. champions. One whose ranks include the retired General Stanley McChrystal and the Starbucks founder Howard Schultz—who are among the backers of an initiative called Serve America Together—sees a way to overcome the “political social economic and religious barriers causing such divisiveness in our country” as McChrystal and Schultz put it in a joint op-ed last summer. The other group composed mainly of academic economists is more concerned about the job-replacing effects of robots and computers and the marketplace’s chronic failure to meet important social needs. Those two streams of thinking converged and gained force last spring after the pandemic abruptly terminated the employment of some twenty million Americans.

In addition to the White House plan and Representative Kaptur’s measure bills have been introduced by Colorado’s Joe Neguse and Illinois’s Bobby Rush in the House and by Delaware’s Chris Coons Illinois’s Dick Durbin and Oregon’s Ron Wyden in the Senate. Thinking separately they have come to common conclusions about what a new C.C.C. should be like—and what it shouldn’t be like. The original corps besides excluding women was racially segregated with camps for African-Americans often placed in remote areas according to Maher “because of local protests in every region of the country including the North.” A twenty-first-century C.C.C. would correct those fundamental defects. Most of the idea’s backers agree that it should also pay a living wage in contrast to Roosevelt’s program which offered room and board and thirty dollars a month (about six hundred dollars in today’s money) with most of it earmarked for families back home.

Another difference: cities and suburbs could be major work sites this time around. Openlands a Chicago-based nonprofit that collaborated with Durbin on his plan has drawn up a list of project categories including brownfield remediation the greening of schoolyards the repair of biking and walking trails and the planting of urban vegetable gardens and orchards. Senator Bob Casey a Democrat of Pennsylvania with his own C.C.C. proposal in the works imagines a corps that would build and improve parks in green-starved inner-city neighborhoods and reverse the loss of tree canopy that has made cities especially vulnerable to global warming.

Casey has allied himself with the coalition of more than a hundred organizations behind an economic-policy package called “Reimagining Appalachia.” It proposes a C.C.C. that would restore wetlands and areas scarred by coal-mining while making room for ex-prisoners victims of opioid addiction and others unlikely to be hired by private employers. Along the way Casey says such a program could have the salutary effect of reminding rural and urban Americans that “they have very similar and overlapping problems” including cycles of community decay set off by the exodus of well-paid jobs whether in mining or manufacturing.

The White House effort is focussed for now on developing an administrative structure (it is likely to build on AmeriCorps a Clinton-era national-service program) and finding funds in the existing budgets of the Agriculture Department the Interior Department and other federal agencies to get a fledgling corps up and running. Putting more serious money into such a program would require Congress’s coöperation and perhaps a degree of bipartisanship.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpZHNuZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9tb3JlLXBsYXN0aWNzLW9uLXRoZS13YXktb3V0L25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvODUwNzgyNjlmOTI1ZjY4NWY1NmQ5ODEyZTRjNzY2ZjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Single-use plastics ban expanded under federal government’s National Plastics Plan,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.kidsnews.com.au/environment/more-plastics-on-the-way-out/news-story/85078269f925f685f56d9812e4c766f2 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpZHNuZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9tb3JlLXBsYXN0aWNzLW9uLXRoZS13YXktb3V0L25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvODUwNzgyNjlmOTI1ZjY4NWY1NmQ5ODEyZTRjNzY2ZjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTAzLTA4L3N1bnJpc2UtaG9zdC1zYW1hbnRoYS1hcm15dGFnZS1xdWl0cy1wb3N0LzEzMjI2MDYw0gEnaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYWJjLm5ldC5hdS9hcnRpY2xlLzEzMjI2MDYw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sunrise host Samantha Armytage quits Seven Network breakfast show,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-08/sunrise-host-samantha-armytage-quits-post/13226060 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTAzLTA4L3N1bnJpc2UtaG9zdC1zYW1hbnRoYS1hcm15dGFnZS1xdWl0cy1wb3N0LzEzMjI2MDYw0gEnaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYWJjLm5ldC5hdS9hcnRpY2xlLzEzMjI2MDYw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpZHNuZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9odW1hbml0aWVzL2F1c3RyYWxpYXMtaW5jcmVkaWJsZS13b21lbi1vZi1pbmZsdWVuY2UvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS83ZjAzZTY2YzYzZjBlYTljMzBlNzhlYjhiYTRiZWE5OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Australia’s women of influence for 2021 International Women’s Day,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.kidsnews.com.au/humanities/australias-incredible-women-of-influence/news-story/7f03e66c63f0ea9c30e78eb8ba4bea99 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpZHNuZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9odW1hbml0aWVzL2F1c3RyYWxpYXMtaW5jcmVkaWJsZS13b21lbi1vZi1pbmZsdWVuY2UvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS83ZjAzZTY2YzYzZjBlYTljMzBlNzhlYjhiYTRiZWE5OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2VzdC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3Mvd2Etd29tZW4tcHJvdmUtdGhlLXBvd2VyLW9uLW5hdGlvbmFsLXJpY2gtbGlzdC1uZy1iODgxODE0OTQ4etIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WA women prove the power on national rich list,"WA’s female leaders have dominated the top 10 spots on a new list revealing the wealth of Australia’s richest women.

Or follow us on Google News

2020 US electricity generation data are in from the US Energy Information Administration. Crunching the numbers renewable energy accounted for 20.6% of US electricity generation last year.

That was led by wind power which accounted for 8.3% of US electricity generation followed by hydropower at 7.2% and solar power at 3.3%.

As reported last month 77–80% of new US power capacity came from solar and wind power in 2020. However power plants typically last decades and it takes a long time for significant changes in electricity generation to show capacity trends.

If we look a little bit further back in the electricity generation data we can see that renewables are indeed growing their share of the electricity generation pie. In 2018 17.5% of electricity generation came from renewables — 6.5% from wind power 6.9% from hydropower and 2.2% from solar power.

If you did a simple extrapolation using that 2018–2020 timeframe and extending the trend to 2030 renewables would rise to 36.1% of US electricity generation by 2030 with wind rising to 17.3% hydropower to 8.7% and solar power to 8.8%. However that ignores the fact that solar power capacity has been growing increasingly faster in recent times. It’s more likely solar power would grow faster and the others perhaps slower. In fact it was just a few months ago that the International Energy Agency declared solar power the cheapest electricity in history and it was not long before that that Tesla rolled out record-low rooftop solar power prices. There is certainly an enormous amount of potential for greater solar power growth in the US in the coming decade.

Getting to the other side of the table the biggest loser from 2018 to 2020 in the electricity sector was coal which dropped from 27.3% of US electricity to 19.1% of US electricity. Actually coal was the only source with a notable drop in US electricity generation. Natural gas saw its share rise from 34.9% to 39.9% and nuclear saw its share rise slightly from 19.2% to 19.5%.

Chip in a few dollars a month to help support independent cleantech coverage that helps to accelerate the cleantech revolution!

If you follow climate science and air pollution news closely then you are probably already grumbling and grunting that 36.1% renewable energy share of US electricity generation in 2030 just doesn’t cut it. Indeed the transition to clean electricity needs to speed up. Perhaps the more significant renewable energy domination of new power capacity will help. Renewables grew from 18.3% in 2019 to 20.6% in 2020. A 2.3% increase in renewable energy share each year would at least lead to 43.6% renewable energy share by 2030.

We’ll see and CleanTechnica will certainly be tracking it as we have been for the past decade.

Regarding the month of December that is typically not the best month for renewables and in 2020 the share came to 20.1% a bit below the full-year total of 20.6%. Though wind and solar accounted for 11.6% in December just as they did for the year as a whole. And the year-over-year increases in the month of December were as follows:

Source December 2018 December 2019 December 2020 Renewables 17.0% 17.5% 20.1% Solar + Wind 8.5% 9.4% 11.6% Solar 1.4% 1.6% 2.3%

Do you have any additional thoughts on the December or 2020 electricity generation split in the United States or in the trends from 2018 through 2020? If you have any forecasts to share for the coming decade feel free to chime in down in the comments with those as well.

In the meantime if you don’t have solar power and can get it do so now! There are still great federal incentives as well as record-low prices. If you want to go with conventional solar PV via Tesla or a Tesla Solar Roof feel free to use my referral code for a modest discount: https://ts.la/zachary63404

If you’d like to install small-scale wind power or hydropower on your property sorry I can’t help you with that. 😀

To close this report here are interactive versions of the electricity generation charts:

As an addendum here’s our latest US power capacity report referenced above:

According to new data from the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) — data derived from Velocity Suite ABB Inc. and The C Three Group LLC — solar power and wind power accounted for 77.1% of new utility-scale power capacity in the United States in 2020 (chart above). Adding in a CleanTechnica estimate for rooftop solar power capacity that percentage rises to 80.1% (chart below).

Using the first group of figures (excluding rooftop or small-scale solar power) another 1% of power capacity came from other renewable energy sources and 21.8% came from natural gas.

Using the second group of figures (with a CleanTechnica estimate for rooftop/small-scale solar power) natural gas accounted for 18.9% of new US power capacity in 2020.

In the month of December 99% of new power capacity came from solar and wind power while natural gas contributed 1% of new power capacity across the country.

Considering politics for a moment recall that Donald Trump said he’d revive the coal industry. In actuality there was no stopping market forces and the coal industry continually collapsed under Trump including in the last year of his presidency. I will return to the long-term collapse of coal in another article. However while coal did continue to decline and renewable energy — most notably solar and wind — rose the growth of solar and wind power slowed under the Trump administration which had several fossil fuel industry insiders running major US departments — Department of Energy Environmental Protection Agency Department of Interior. Under President Biden solar and wind power are expected to grow faster again. The point is not to beat 80% of new power capacity coming from solar and wind as much as it is to increasingly retire fossil fuel power plants while using more and more electricity from renewable energy sources.

For a closer look at the power capacity additions that were connected to the grid at the end of 2020 these are the utility-scale power projects that went online in December 2020:

Invenergy LLC’s 522 MW Sagamore Wind Project in Roosevelt County NM.

NKE,Nike,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2lucHV0L3N0eWxlL2hvdy10by1yZXN0b3JlLW5pa2UtZHVuay1zbmVha2Vycy1zaG9lcy1kaXktZHVuay1sb3ctZ3MtcmF2ZS1waW5rLWdvbGTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How I turned old $15 Nike Dunk sneakers into a pair worth $500,"Since last year it’s been nearly impossible to score a pair of Dunks without shelling out hundreds of dollars above their original price. When Nike drops new pairs on the SNKRS app they sell out in minutes so I've come to terms that my chances of ever copping one of the latests Dunks are slim.

It’s not as if there haven’t been enough opportunities. Nike has been rolling out waves of Dunk models since 2019 and even added the sneaker to its customization program. But releases sold out too quickly for me to catch and the Nike By You drop failed miserably on the brand’s end. Now SNKRS the app where most of the Dunk models are sold has limited the silhouette to lottery-based draws. The move is supposed to distribute the sneaker more fairly but after Nike’s recent sneaker reselling scandal I’m not quite sure I trust the brand anymore.

Leaving Nike out of the purchase isn’t a small feat though. On StockX Dunks can average upwards of $400 and cheaper sites like eBay still settle around $200 for the silhouette. Being a woman in the sneaker world also limits the pairs available to me to begin with — those with smaller feet often have to pay a bigger price for their desired shoe. The highly coveted Syracuse Dunk Low for example averages around $550 for sizes 8.5 to 11.5 on StockX while sizes below or above range from $700 to $1500.

The 'Syracuse' Dunk Low Nike

Luckily there are cheaper options for resale but sometimes the price is more costly than what the sneakers are listed for. On Depop a reselling app favored by trendy teens Dunks can sell anywhere from $100 to $400 — but also don’t come with the same authenticity guarantee that StockX and eBay offer buyers. It takes a trained and careful eye to spot fake Dunks which there are plenty of. Where there’s demand there’ll always be supply — even if that supply sports a lopsided Swoosh or off-colored branding.

All of this adds up to sifting through hundreds of listings searching for a reasonably priced authentic Dunk sneaker in your size. After a few weeks of scouring the platform for the silhouette I stumbled upon a beat-up pair for $15. Covered in dirt and creases they were priced low for a reason — but as desperate as I was I thought “I could fix these.” Surely it would be easier to fix up an old pair than land a new one… right?

One man's Dunk...

@emmalynnc on Depop

Cleaning sneakers was a skill I had already acquired from college when I was too broke to drop money on a rotation of shoes. Instead I relied on OxiClean whitening toothpaste and an iron to keep my selection at the time — a pair of white AF1 Jesters — from looking too raggedy. When my discount Dunks arrived however I knew it would be a project unlike any other.

In person the shoe’s creases were even more significant among other signs the sneaker had lived a full life. The design which research discovered was “Rave Pink Gold” had originally been sold in 2005 and it looked like the previous owner had left them in the closet since then. A concentrated amount of dust and dirt had settled into the Dunk’s insole creases upper and shoelaces. These sneakers didn’t need some love — they needed devotion.

So I prepared my setup. I started by mixing a bit of whitening OxiClean into two small bowls: one to soak the laces in and another to scrub the shoe down with. I also grabbed a whitening toothpaste (any brand should do) to help clean the leather uppers. While the laces sat in the mixture for about an hour and a half I got to work scouring the shoe with a toothbrush — anal I know — alternating between the OxiClean concotion and the toothpaste. About 30 minutes and a TV episode later the sneakers were noticeably cleaner.

The next step — getting the creases out of the Dunks — was the hardest and most stressful part of the cleaning process. After what looked like years of wear the sneakers had been considerably rumpled and clearly hadn’t gotten the same loving treatment as my college Jesters. To ease the creases I packed the shoes with paper to fill their shape and lightly steamed them with an iron. Then I placed a damp cloth over them and gently ironed the dents as flat as I could. The operation was tedious — especially taking care not to burn the shoe’s metallic leather — but it paid off. While not all the creases could be removed ironing them significantly altered their appearance.

DIY Dunk

At the end of the restoration process the Dunks looked good — not new but good. Looking back it would’ve been much faster for me to buy a clean pair but given the funds and stress I had saved it was worth it. Finally I had my hands on the silhouette — a retro pair too.

Further digging into the sneaker’s history made the operation much more satisfying. The exact model I had restored — in a barely improved condition — is listed on GOAT for $500 while more prying revealed it was also up for sale on Poshmark for $270. Even a used pair on eBay which also resembled the condition my now-refreshed Dunks is going for $300.

While I don’t plan on selling my hard work anytime soon it’s nice to see that it carries the same value — and exclusivity — as a pair bought off SNKRS. By buying used I scored a genuinely rare retro pair and sustainably sourced a coveted silhouette. I would highly recommend doing the same: A little elbow grease goes a long way and could save — or make you — a couple hundred bucks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vbmV3cy9uaWtlLWVhcm5lZC1lZGl0aW9uLWJvc3Rvbi1jZWx0aWNz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Earned Edition Jersey: Boston Celtics,"The Boston Celtics signed Kemba Walker to a four-year deal during the 2019 offseason after Kyrie Irving left in free agency. Walker Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown all averaged over 20 PPG and helped guide the Celtics to a 48-24 record in the regular season — third-best in the Eastern Conference.

The Celtics began the 2019-20 NBA Playoffs with a dominant sweep of the Philadelphia 76ers giving Walker the first playoff series victory of his NBA career. Boston then defeated the Toronto Raptors in a gritty seven-game conference semifinals that featured a double-overtime thriller in Game 6. Boston’s season ended in the Eastern Conference Finals as the Celtics fell short against the Miami Heat in a six-game series.

Though seeing a shoe inspired by a humble white red and blue cardboard box is surprising enough there’s another element at play that makes the inspiration even more unique — almost all of Nike’s US shipping is handled by UPS.

The shoe’s cream upper and white midsole are ensconced in a foam shell which serves an inside-out look and is covered in small repeating blue text hits that read “Air Force 1.” A signature detail arrives on the heel via a shipping label-inspired white blue and red badge that alters the Postal Service’s standard label branding to read “Air Force 1” “N.354” “For Everyday Use” and more all while retaining a cheeky “From” hit.

Further details are supplied by a red N. 354 text hit atop the lateral Swoosh a sport blue toggle system atop the white laces and a dark berry blue on the exposed foam tongue flipped heel graphics collar pull tabs and outsole. Small dashes of red on the tongue and insole round off the look.

At the time of writing a release date for this USPS-inspired Nike Air Force 1 Experimental has yet to be announced. However it’ll likely hit the Nike webstore this spring for $120 USD.

Narrated by actress and playwright Dominique Fishback the minute-long video titled “We Play Real” aims to highlight the accomplishments of black female athletes and performers while “celebrating their resilience to lead the world forward” said Nike in a press release. Athletes spotlighted in the film include WNBA players A’ja Wilson and Jewell Lloyd NWSL player Crystal Dunn tennis champion Serena Williams and Olympic runner Sha’Carri Richardson among others. Additionally it showcases the Alabama State University Honey Beez a group of student dancers that perform at games and university functions.

The film also references instances in which these women have used their platform to promote racial justice such as the time Naomi Osaka drew attention to the killing of Breonna Taylor by wearing a mask adorned with her name on day one of the U.S Open in September.

Coinciding with the video Nike will be hosting a social campaign designed to elevate black voices and a pitch competition in partnership with Black Girl Ventures — a non-profit organization that aims to provide black and brown woman-identifying founders with access to community and capital. Through the social campaign NBA athletes including Lebron James Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving will use their Instagram handles to support black women who are impacting sports and society. These women which include WNBA players A’ja Wilson Jewell Lloyd and Diamond DeShields as well as Black Girl Ventures founder Shelly Bell will also post their success stories.

As part of Nike and its umbrella brands’ $140 million investment in addressing racial inequality the Swoosh will be investing $500000 in Black Girl Ventures.

The brand says it will continue to deliver content throughout 2021 that celebrates black women and demonstrates how all aspects of culture can be more inclusive.

In the wake of national unrest following the death of George Floyd last May Nike has released a series of initiatives to promote racial equality including its monetary investments as well as a powerful video message condemning racism and injustice. Nike spokesperson Sandra Carreon-John also told FN in July that the company has been working aggressively over the past few years to enhance D&I as well as overall race relations within its own organization.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXBsZXguY29tL3NuZWFrZXJzL2EvY21wbHh2aWN0b3ItZGVuZy9kcW0tbmlrZS1haXItbWF4LTkwLWJhY29uLTIwMjAtcmVsZWFzZS1kYXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Bacon' Nike Air Max 90s Are Returning on Air Max Day,"With Nike’s 2020 Air Max Day celebrations still weeks away the beloved Air Max 90 “Bacon” collaboration is reportedly receiving a re-issue in March according to py_leaks.

The style was originally released in 2005 with the now-closed New York City sneaker boutique Dave’s Quality Meat that resembles the slice of bacon that features various hues including red pink and sail on the leather and suede upper. Pairs of the original release are currently fetching prices upwards of $1000 on the secondary market in deadstock condition.

Last month Nike also confirmed its plans to celebrate the Air Max 90’s 30th anniversary that’s taking place this year by bringing back the classic model in its true original form which began with the release of a new tonal “Sail” colorway and with additional makeups arriving in the months ahead.

Though an official release date has yet to be announced the re-release of the Nike Air Max 90 “Bacon” is rumored to arrive in March. Check back soon for updates.

UPDATE (03/06): Nike has confirmed that the coveted “Bacon” Air Max 90s from 2004 are returning for Air Max Day 2021 which will be observed on March 26. Grab a detailed look at this year’s reissue below.

It could be a real-life freight rolling on the Norfolk Southern line that runs north-south through Lake Norman. Or it could be one of Lou Paone’s four model trains 1/32nd-scale locomotives and cars that broadcast a train whistle recording as they whip around the 485 feet of track in his back garden.

Paone a 72-year-old managing director at Deloitte Corporate Finance designed and built all of it in the 5000-square-foot garden behind his waterfront home complete with shrubs flowers bushes and rock formations. He created it after twin disasters. He and his wife Rosemary moved to The Point in 2007. A year later Paone a lifelong gardener stepped on a yellow jacket nest while working in a plant bed on the property. The wasps stung him nearly 30 times. About a week later with his wounds still open he contracted a waterborne bacterial infection. “I almost lost the use of my legs” he says.

Paone had to recuperate for several months while he worked from home unable to travel for business and he had time on his hands. He remembered a friend’s neighbor he’d met 25 years before who had built a model train display in his compact garden and spa. If I ever have the time and the space Paone thought then I’ll do the same. Now he had both and he started to research garden railroads. “The internet is amazing” he says. “I found tutorials articles and chat rooms that provided me with answers to many of the questions I had for designing and building a garden railroad.”

Paone had always admired “the lush and rugged character of the Pacific Northwest.” As he recovered Paone removed trees and dumped soil to level the 100 feet between his house and the shoreline then painstakingly built more than 125 feet of interconnected wooden trestles to guide the engines’ journey through the garden. The terrain beneath it contains waterfalls a pond and cove a river gorge and a dry riverbed. He even took an online bonsai class so he could shape shrubs and ornamental trees.

He found a tutorial from a pair of modelers in Australia to learn how to build the stone bridges and another from a U.S.-based modeler about how to stabilize the stainless-steel track as it expanded in extreme heat and contracted in cold. One way to answer those questions: Spend a lot of money. Stainless steel conducts electricity better than any other metal and doesn’t corrode. It costs $15 per linear foot and Paone spent $7000 on the track alone. He used 500 plants at $30 each and 40 pallets of stone. Each of the four train engines cost between $750 and $1500.

Then came the regulatory hurdles. “I had a cease-and-desist order from the (N.C. Department of Environmental Quality) that stated ‘If you continue to upset the naturalized area along the shoreline without getting our approval you’re going to be fined $2000 a day.’ I immediately called them and said ‘What do I need to do?’”

Paone had to add trees back to the property to reflect the original number and amend his original design for the pond because it encroached on a shoreline setback requirement.

“Duke Energy was also alerted by the NCDEQ because I was building a waterfall and pond that were using a secondary irrigation pump” he continues. “Duke Lake Services only allows one irrigation pump per property for lakefront homes to conserve lake water.” Paone redesigned the system to send water from the overflowing pond back to the lake.

His last hurdle: The Point community’s architectural committee which told him his plan had numerous violations of their code and that the model trains were “toys.” (The committee prohibits permanent toys visible from the lake on lakefront property.)

Paone did what he would at work: He made a PowerPoint presentation to address each concern. “I then brought in two of the railroad engines … and made the argument that they were essentially a unique garden accessory to a naturalized garden landscape” he says. “The committee was immediately taken by the visual attractiveness of the model train engines.”

It took about three months for him to win approval. But Paone says the trials were worth it. “People often say ‘Your grandsons must love it’” he says. “They do love it but kids get easily bored if they are not constantly active. It’s the adults that will stand there and be mesmerized by the layout and detail.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvd2VkZGluZy1uby01LW5pY29sYXMtY2FnZS1tYXJyaWVzLXJpa28tc2hpYmF0YS1pbi1sYXMtdmVnYXMvYXJ0aWNsZV9iNGIwZTkwOC01NDMzLTU0ZTQtYmU0OC1iODhjOTc0N2FkNmMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wedding No. 5: Nicolas Cage marries Riko Shibata in Las Vegas,"Memphis TN (38111)

With digital assets set to become ubiquitous it makes sense for asset owners owners to familiarise themselves with so-called tokenisation technology. Industry specialists point to its liquidity governance and customisation benefits and institutions are likely to have to engage with the concept soon enough in any case by design or otherwise if they haven't already.

Cryptocurrencies continue their meteoric growth and governments continue to pour resources into blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) to develop their own fintech advancements such as online payments and digital currencies.

Tokenisation – the blockchain-enabled securitisation of an underlying asset class which ranges from bonds and funds to real estate and even art and wine – is touted as a way to democratise private assets. There is no data available to show the rise in tokenisation demand but those involved with the development of such digital assets say that interest has been picking up slowly but surely in Asia Pacific.

Family offices have expressed interest in tokenised assets and a growing number of financial institutions have made inroads in the field.

Scott Thiel DLA Piper: Tokenisation enquiries rising

Hong Kong family office Stan Group launched a tokenised property blockchain last year and in 2019 Unionbank in the Philippines launched a tokenised fiat currency to help with foreign remittance. British law firm DLA Piper tokenised an artwork by Chinese artist Wang Xiao Bo using the Toko platform it launched in November.





""The market is insufficiently mature to have hard data to support the rise in tokenisation"" said Scott Thiel technology partner at DLA Piper. ""However... we have seen a steady increase in the number of enquiries and number of projects that are in the pipeline.""

""Investors and asset owners are looking to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology and digital assets to not only create new products but also attract a different class of investors which they haven’t historically been connecting with"" he told AsianInvestor.

WHY TOKENISE?

A major selling point of tokenisation is that it allows for the breakdown of the asset into fractions providing even retail investors access to the asset class. But larger institutions stand to gain too for instance because of the liquidity and governance benefits of the technology experts told AsianInvestor.

Tokens provide greater governance capability and data transparency and reduce friction when it comes to investment administration and life cycle operations said Danielle Gerace head of market advocacy and innovation for Asia Pacific at US asset management and servicing firm Northern Trust.

Danielle Gerace Northern Trust: Touting transparency

""Exiting alternative assets can be complicated when there isn’t an established or liquid secondary market"" she told AsianInvestor. ""You've got to pay specialised brokers to dispose of it – so if there's a market for these alternatives supported through digitalisation and fractionalisation then all of a sudden that creates greater price transparency and liquidity opportunities.""

One example was a private equity blockchain solution that Northern Trust developed and launched supported by DLT that enabled a more efficient lifecycle management.

“You might create restrictions that say 'I don't want to invest in tobacco-related entities'"" she said. ""We create a smart contract on those exclusions so that when the private equity fund goes to make a capital call they can automatically exclude any limited partner investors that have exclusions on a particular type of investment class.""

REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE

Moreover there is stronger regulatory certainty for tokenised assets than for say crypto assets Gerace added ""so it's easier to find that pathway to market and life production capability"".

A further point of note is that tokenisation doesn’t provide the anonymity of crypto. ""You’re not substituting who the owner is with a string of letters and numbers – you’re just substituting a real asset for a fractionalised piece"" said Douglas Wolfson Hong Kong-based director of financial crime compliance at LexisNexis Risk Solutions.

(AG&P) has been issued the Notice to Proceed (NTP) by the Philippines’ Department of Energy (DOE) for the development of its LNG import and regasification terminal in Batangas Bay on the main island of Luzon called the Philippines LNG (PLNG). PLNG will store LNG and dispatch natural gas to power plant industrial and commercial customers and other consumers opening up for the country a new era of clean efficient fuel and doing its part for the Philippines to compete for and win investment and jobs in the years to come.

PLNG will have the initial capacity to deliver up to 3.0 MTPA of regasified LNG with additional capacity for liquid distribution. On day one PLNG will have scalable onshore regasification capacity of 420mmscfd and almost 200000cbm of storage that will ensure high availability and reliability of natural gas for its customers. AG&P has already completed its pre-development work for PLNG which is expected to be commissioned by summer 2022.

“We are excited about this critical step in bringing AG&P’s Philippines LNG Import Terminal online. AG&P is working very hard to bring this safe environmentally-friendly competitive fuel to our customers by the summer of 2022 and hope that the wide availability of natural gas will spur manufacturing and jobs in the Philippines while we all enjoy healthier air. We salute the Philippines’ DOE for its professionalism and hard work in evaluating our proposal and granting AG&P the Notice to Proceed. We are aligned with the DOE’s forward-looking vision for clean energy and look forward to supporting it every day. I would also like to recognize the hard-working engineers in our Korean subsidiary Gas Entec which has brought its world-leading technology to PLNG” said Mr. Karthik Sathyamoorthy President of LNG Terminals & Logistics AG&P.

The DOE approved AG&P’s NTP application in line with its commitment to make the Philippines a regional LNG hub in Southeast Asia. As an initial step PLNG will serve to kick-start the country’s LNG importation and regasification ability delivering gas to secure the current and future energy demand of the region.

“The Philippines LNG Terminal is a landmark development for the country that will accelerate industrialization create jobs lower pollution and trigger overall economic and social progress. It will directly and indirectly improve the quality of life for many thousands of Filipinos” added Mr. Sathyamoorthy.

A new mural has been unveiled in South Belfast marking the history of the local community and the area.

The mural which is on Coolfin Street off the Donegall Road has been created by the Greater Village Regeneration Trust artist Jonny McKerr and the community.

The site at the entrance to Belfast City Hospital had been a bonfire site for over 20 years before it was transformed into a community garden in 2018.

Due to its location the bonfire had proved to be contentious.

Community Safety Officer for GVRT Eddie Kelly said that younger members of the community provided vital input into the design of the mural wanting to remember the history of the bonfire while also celebrating their home and its future.

He said: ""We had been wanting to put a nice positive mural up beside the community garden for quite a while and once we were able to get the go ahead we got some of the younger ones to get involved and decide on the design.

""They wanted to remember the bonfire that was here and the history of the area its people and the sense of community here. We combined that with the centenary celebrations to have Northern Ireland coming out of the flames.

""We also have Carrickfergus Castle in the background as that was where King William landed and the bonfires we light every year are a symbol of the beacons that were lit across the coast in order to guide him there.

""We would just like to thank the artists for their hard work in creating such a brilliant mural for us along with the property ownerthe local community and the Department for Communities.""

The Greater Village Regeneration Trust has recently received further funding to replace a paramilitary mural in the area and work on it is due to take place in the next few weeks.

It is part of a wider area to promote positive artwork in the area that celebrates the history of inner South Belfast and its people."

The paper ""Capitalizing on conflict: How defense contractors and foreign nations lobby for arms sales"" details how a network of lobbyists and donors steered $285 million in campaign contributions and $2.5 billion in lobbying spending over the last two decades as well as hiring more than 200 lobbyists who previously worked in government.

The amount of money at stake is immense both at home and abroad the center states on its website OpenSecrets.org. Not only is a significant portion of the Pentagon's $740 billion annual budget spent on weapons the report explains but American defense firms agreed to sell $175 billion in weapons to other countries over the last year. That includes deals to sell $23 billion in F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and drones to the United Arab Emirates and billions more in sales to Taiwan and Saudi Arabia it adds.

The practice appears unlikely to change significantly under the Biden administration. The report notes that while President Joe Biden issued an order restricting officials who leave the White House from quickly lobbying the executive branch or registering as foreign agents several of his appointees have ties to the defense industry. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for example sat on Raytheon's board before joining the administration.

And since Biden's inauguration the report states the State Department has approved the sale of $85 million in missiles from Raytheon to Chile and a $60 million deal between Lockheed Martin and Jordan to provide F-16 Fighting Falcons and services.

Foreign nations that are among the arms industry's biggest customers also spend heavily to influence U.S. policy often to the tune of tens of millions of dollars in spending covered by the Foreign Agents Registration Act. However the report notes that some nations that spend the most such as South Korea and Japan focus more on trade and commercial issues than military spending.

Australia the United Arab Emirates Taiwan and Saudi Arabia are some of the other major buyers of American weapons.

Defense lobbyists are also among the best-connected in Washington D.C. the report states. Of the 663 lobbyists working for defense contractors nearly three-quarters used to work for the federal government -- the highest percentage of any industry according to the report.

""These connections make for cozy relationships and highly useful contact lists"" the report says. ""Overworked and underpaid congressional staffers can also hope that lucrative lobbying jobs await them at the same companies who come to them pushing their own agendas.""

The so-called ""revolving door"" also exists on Capitol Hill the report adds. Over the last 30 years nearly 530 staffers have both worked for a member of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees of both houses of Congress or the Defense Appropriations subcommittees and then as a lobbyist for defense companies.

The report highlights former Defense Secretary Mark Esper as an example of the revolving door in action. Esper worked for the Senate Foreign Relations and House Armed Services committees in the late 1990s and early 2000s as well as an assistant deputy secretary of defense before moving to Raytheon's government relations office. After seven years in that job President Donald Trump made him secretary of the Army and then head of the Defense Department.

It's like Richard Tanenbaum is playing multimillion-dollar Monopoly but with aerospace and industrial properties rather than houses and hotels.

His latest move was to part with more of the properties he started developing 20 years ago around Tinker Air Force Base.

Tanenbaum who heads Gardener Tanenbaum Holdings just sold three more aerospace properties in a $50.36 million deal to a repeat West Coast investor. Mark Beffort CEO of Newmark Levy Strange Beffort — and a frequent investment and development partner of Tanenbaum's — and Brett Price the firm's managing director negotiated the sale.

The transaction has no immediate effect on the tenants — defense contractors Northrop Grumman L3 Harris and LCI — other than giving them a new landlord.

That's Tenmark Holdings led by Michael Schau of Los Angeles who has been investing in Oklahoma property for 15 years and is one of the largest industrial and aerospace owners in the state. Just more than a year ago Tenmark which has offices in L.A. here and Dallas acquired the Boeing Co. campus adjacent to Tinker also developed by Tanenbaum for $124.7 million.

“I have a continued relationship with this buyer and have worked with him now on multiple deals” Tanenbaum said in a written statement. ""This buyer believes in the future of Oklahoma City Tinker Air Force Base and aerospace's potential for decades to come. And from my perspective I did REAL WELL.""

Tanenbaum could not be reached Friday for further comment.

Schau said ""We're thrilled with the recent acquisition and proud to play a small part in OKC's explosive aerospace growth. Our continued investment in OKC and surrounding areas are evidence of our long-term optimism in the market.""

Price said the latest sale ""further cements the robust role that aerospace plays in the Oklahoma City economy. Investors are drawn to these properties based on a strong local economy and the ongoing commitment of aerospace companies to invest and expand in the OKC metro.”

The portfolio of properties totals 303964 square feet. The price came to $165.70 per square foot. Newmark did not break the price down by individual building.

Sold were:

• 6700 SE 59 built in 2001. Tenant: L3 Harris 38681 square feet.

• 6400 SE 59 built in 2002. Tenant: Northrop Grumman 174145 square feet.

• 6401 and 6421 S Air Depot Blvd. built in 2003. Tenants: Northrop Grumman and LCI 91138 square feet.

Tanenbaum offered the properties for sale among several others in different portfolio configurations in March 2008. It was awful timing. Investment capital had been flowing into Oklahoma the few years before but had dried up. By the next fall tight credit had dissipated into no credit. The stock market crashed in September. Investment stopped cold. He offered them for sale again in 2010 and some did eventually.

Tanenbaum's next big project in partnership with Beffort is a multimillion-dollar mixed-use project ""focused on collaborative innovation"" in aviation aerospace bioscience and energy research and development in Oklahoma City's Innovation District. Gardner Tanenbaum and Beffort's Robinson Park Investments announced the high-density 400000-square-foot two-building project at NE 8 and Interstate 35 just before last Christmas.

Tanenbaum most recent investment announced in January was his $106.5 million portfolio purchase of 42 buildings leased by the federal government. Tanenbaum Equity Partners a subsidiary of Gardner Tanenbaum bought the properties from CoreCivic Inc. in Brentwood Tennessee — 573000 square feet leased under the federal General Services Administration to agencies including the Social Security Administration Department of Homeland Security and Veterans Administration.

S. Air Force to reverse engineer the B-2 bomber’s Load Heat Exchanger (whatever that is). You’d think if the Air Force wanted to reverse engineer something they’d be looking at another country’s aircraft. What can this mean?

Presumably the original plans for the system have been lost or maybe the company who made them is long gone and the tooling to create new ones along with it. Then again maybe the assembly needs parts that you can no longer get. The Drive has another interesting speculation: perhaps the plans were so secret that were accidentally destroyed.

You don’t hear much about the B-2. There are only 20 left of the 21 built at least that we know about. Original plans in the 1980s called for 132 but the end of the Cold War spelled the end for the stealth bomber. They get an overhaul every nine years. The Drive also speculates that this may be part of the Air Force’s desire to digitize spare parts and use 3D printing but — honestly — it doesn’t sound that way to us. Especially since the fleet will retire no later than 2032 so whatever is replaced is only needed for a decade.

If you think you want to have a go here’s the help wanted ad from the Air Force. If you read the text it’s pretty clear they have some defective units that need replacement and it sounds like no one knows how to do it with existing materials. Not many of us get to design things that are still working nearly three decades later. Keeping a supply of parts and even know-how for something built in the 1990s isn’t trivial. Something to think about if you design something with a long service life.

The B-2 is a stealth bomber and while one did crash it wasn’t shot down. The F-117A — the stealth fighter — was shot down against all odds though. While the B-2 appears to be quite a plane we prefer our bombers a little bit older. Still you might enjoy the video below about the B-2’s chief engineer although he doesn’t mention the Load Heat Exchanger.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvYWlyLWZvcmNlLWNvdWxkLWRlZmVhdC1ub3J0aC1rb3JlYS1ob3ctbWFueS1wbGFuZXMtZGllLTE3OTQyOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Air Force Could Defeat North Korea But How Many Planes Die?,"Here's What You Need to Remember: Any sort of attack on North Korea would be a gamble with the lives of thousands if not millions of South Korean and Japanese lives. As such a diplomatic solution is far more preferable to a war than might end poorly.

In the event a war were to break out on the Korean peninsula American airpower would play a key role.

Initially the burden would likely fall to the Pentagon’s fleet of stealth aircraft including the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber.

The U.S. Navy too would likely have to play a role using its surface warships and submarines to launch waves of Tomahawk cruise missiles to target North Korean air defenses and command and control assets. However American forces would have to move quickly to take out North Korea’s retaliatory strike capability—both its nuclear forces and its conventional artillery forces that could lay waste to Seoul.

That’s ultimately the problem for American military planners during any potential pre-emptive strike against North Korea. How does one eliminate Pyongyang’s nuclear forces without risking a retaliatory strike that would leave thousands of South Korean and Japanese civilians dead? Indeed if some of the worst case scenarios play out North Korea could potentially even strike back at the American homeland with an nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile.

If the Trump administration were to strike at North Korea stealth aircraft like the F-35 would have to eliminate North Korean air defenses quickly. Pyongyang does not have the most modern of air defense systems—the threat mostly comes from the sheer volume of older Soviet-built systems it has available to it.

However while the bulk of North Korea’s air defenses are antiques it does have some potent newer weapons available including its own indigenous KN-06 clone of the Russian S-300. Vasily Kashin a senior fellow at the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at Moscow’s Higher School of Economics —who is a specialist on Asian matters—told The National Interest earlier this year that South Koreans sources have written that the KN-06 has been successfully tested. The weapon is thought to have a range of up to 150 km.

“No one knows exactly how many such systems exist. The KN-06 has phased array radar and tracks via missile guidance system and maybe equivalent to the early S-300P versions but with greater range” Vasily told The National Interest.

But air defenses are less of a problem than targeting North Korea’s artillery pieces— which are dug into hardened positions—that are aimed at Seoul. Indeed even without its nuclear-tipped missiles dug-in conventional North Korean artillery could leave Seoul devastated within only a few hours. Any successful attack on North Korea would have to eliminate those threats before they could level Seoul—but that is easier said than done.

“Between 1950 and 1953 the U.S. Air Force and Navy flattened North Korea so the NORKS have had 65 years to think about how to make sure that does not happen again and dig lots of bomb proof shelters and tunnels” retired Rear Adm. Mike McDevitt a senior fellow at the Center for Naval Analyses told The National Interest.

Indeed as Jerry Hendrix wrote for The National Interest any air strike would have to hit their targets simultaneously while Aegis missile defense ships stood ready to shoot down any North Korean ballistic missiles headed toward South Korea and Japan.

“In all likelihood it would begin with lightning swiftness with overwhelming attacks on key targets to include the thousands of emplaced artillery pieces that overlook the South Korean capital of Seoul nuclear weapons storage facilities nuclear launch vehicles and integrated air defense systems. These attacks would be conducted with near simultaneity” Hendrix wrote.

“While these attacks are ongoing Japan based U.S. Navy ballistic missile defense cruisers and destroyers as well as ground based Theater High Altitude Aerial Defense systems will use their long range radars to identify and shoot down North Korean missiles as they launch.”

Success however is not guaranteed. Any sort of attack on North Korea would be a gamble with the lives of thousands if not millions of South Korean and Japanese lives. As such a diplomatic solution is far more preferable to a war than might end poorly.

By 2016 the machine was equipped for greater range and was renamed Avenger ER and now as we’ve firmly stepped into 2021 a new milestone for what is supposed to be a revolutionary drone was reached.

General Atomics (GA-ASI) said last week a second Avenger ER after the one in 2016 received the FAA Experimental Certificate which allows it to fly in the U.S. national airspace. The company plans to use this certificate to start flight testing the machine as it moves to get it ready for different ongoing projects and contracts.“Since 2005 GA-ASI has worked closely with the FAA to affirm the special airworthiness certification of RPAs promoting their integration into the National Airspace System” said in a statement General Atomics’ Senior Director of Quick Action Programs Pete Latta.“This EC will also help GA-ASI employ the latest configuration of the Avenger ER for customer payload testing and company investments in advanced UAS control technologies.”The Avenger is technically a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) like most other General Atomics Predator-series drones . It is built with a 44-foot (13 meters) long fuselage and has a 76-foot (23 meters) wingspan.The drone is powered by a commercial Pratt & Whitney turbofan engine good for 5000 pounds of thrust. It can take off from runways shorter than 5000 feet (1.5 km) and can stay in the air for up to 20 hours.The Avenger can spy on or bomb its enemies from altitudes of over 50000 feet (15 km). It is capable of supporting a wide range of sensors but also 3000 pounds (1.3 tons) of precision munitions.According to General Atomics the Avenger ER can be controlled from the same stations used to fly the Predators but it is better suited to survive “in higher threat environments.”"

“Wall Street is not happy” said one source familiar with the situation. “If cruises are flying off the shelves the message from big investors has been to raise prices if inventory is selling too quickly … the companies are leaving too much money on the table.”

Cruise lines have widely reported strong pent-up demand and record sales volumes in media announcements leading to a backlash from the investment community.

Carnival said sales were solid due to pent up demand in late February and a few weeks earlier Oceania saw its world cruise sell out in a single day.

Victory Cruise Lines and American Queen Steamboat said that January and February 2021 bookings are over 35 percent higher than November and December 2020 bookings according to a press release.

The story is also good at Royal Caribbean Group with bookings up 30 percent.

“Despite the lack of marketing spend we have seen a 30% increase in new bookings since the beginning of the year when compared to November and December” said Jason Liberty CFO speaking on the company’s recent business update and fourth quarter earnings call.

Among other examples Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings has seen a demand uptick recently with new cash bookings.

“And while still early in the booking cycle we are very encouraged and very pleased by the strong booking activity driven by pent up demand across all three brands for 2022 voyages. Volumes during January and February sequentially improved by over 40 percent from November and December 2020 and as an added bonus over 80 percent of these bookings where new cash bookings” said Frank Del Rio president and CEO speaking on the company’s fourth quarter and year-ending earnings call.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vQ3J1aXNlLVRyYXZlbC9WYWNjaW5lLXB1c2gtYW5kLWNydWlzZXJzLXdpdGgtY2FzaC1naXZlLXJpc2UtdG8tYm9va2luZy11cHNpemluZy10cmVuZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Traveler confidence rises and cruise travel gets upsized,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelweekly.com/Cruise-Travel/Vaccine-push-and-cruisers-with-cash-give-rise-to-booking-upsizing-trend on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vQ3J1aXNlLVRyYXZlbC9WYWNjaW5lLXB1c2gtYW5kLWNydWlzZXJzLXdpdGgtY2FzaC1naXZlLXJpc2UtdG8tYm9va2luZy11cHNpemluZy10cmVuZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9tdWNoLXByZXNpZGVudC1qb2UtYmlkZW4td29ydGgtMTcwMDA3Mzc5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Much Is President Joe Biden Worth?,"Evan El-Amin / Shutterstock.com

President Joe Biden’s net worth is $9 million according to Forbes. Along with his wife Jill the Bidens’ wealth includes two Delaware homes valued at $4 million combined cash and investments worth an additional $4 million and a federal pension worth over $1 million.

Although Biden has made a steady income as a politician the majority of his wealth has come from book deals and speaking fees. Biden’s starting salary in the Senate was $42500 a year in 1979; when he left the Senate in 2009 he was making $169300. As vice president his salary shot up to $230700; he’ll be earning $400000 as president.

Biden’s first memoir “Promises to Keep” earned him $71000 in royalties and $9500 for audiobook rights around the time of its publication in 2008. But that’s chump change compared to what he has earned since leaving the White House. From 2017 to 2019 the Bidens earned more than $15 million according to tax filings reviewed by Forbes. That includes a reportedly $8 million book deal $1.8 million from book tour events $2.4 million in speaking fees and $775000 from the University of Pennsylvania to lead the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement as the Benjamin Franklin presidential professor of practice.

Joe Biden’s Political Career

Biden was elected to the Senate from the state of Delaware in 1972 when he was 29 becoming one of the youngest senators in history. His first wife and young daughter were killed in an automobile accident only weeks after his appointment an event that influenced his decision to commute to the Senate by train.

During his time in the Senate Biden presided over several governmental boards serving as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He ran for president twice before once for the 1988 race and again for the 2008 presidential election. Biden served as vice president under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017. He started his term as president of the United States on Inauguration Day Jan. 20 2021.

It has been less than six weeks since COVID-19 restrictions were relaxed in Bucharest but rising infections have prompted authorities to reimpose tighter restrictions for a 14-day period effective as of Monday.

The restrictions will see bars restaurants theaters gambling venues and cafes close indoor spaces as the capital’s infection rate rose above three cases per 1000 inhabitants over a 14-day rolling period — effectively entering a “red scenario” which the authorities use as a threshold to manage both restrictions and the spread of the virus.

Many protestors brandished Romanian flags and chanted “freedom” and “down with the mask.” A large placard read: “Say no to forced vaccination.”

The demonstration was attended by George Simion the leader of Romania’s far-right AUR party which has been vocal against compulsory vaccination.

The new restrictions will see many schools in the capital revert back to online learning while nurseries primary school pupils and those from eighth to 12th grades will continue with physical attendance in some cases operating only at half capacity.

“We have already been through this and we survived” Andreea Beca who owns a small bistro in central Bucharest told The Associated Press.

“We also realized that maintaining the quality of our food is the most important criteria for our customers and that they are ordering online — we can only hope for the best” she said.

Harsher measures are to be imposed at the same time in the western city of Timisoara a city of more than 400000 residents which will enter quarantine after its infection rate rose above seven per 1000 residents.

In quarantined areas inhabitants are obliged to fill out an official form stating the reason for their movement. Across the country there is a lightly enforced curfew between 11 p.m.-6 a.m.

Many former communist countries in Eastern Europe are battling against vaccine skepticism as immunization campaigns are slowly rolled out across Europe.

According to a government website more than 1.7 million people in Romania have received a COVID-19 vaccine.

Romania — a country of more than 19 million people — has recorded more than 828000 COVID-19 infections and 20900 people have died.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC0zLWRlbWFuZC1zcGlrZXMtMjAyNzEzNzIyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Model 3 Demand Spikes In Japan Following 25% Price Slash,"Has Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) recent price slashes in the Japanese market played out in a way your college Economics 101 professor would be proud of?

What Happened: According to a recent report by Automotive News the Model 3 has received significant price slashes in the neighborhood of 25% for the Japanese market. Full pricing information is provided below.

Model 3 Standard Range Before Price Cut Model 3 Standard Range After Price Cut $48000 $41000 5.11-million yen 4.29-million yen

Model 3 Long Range Before Price Cut Model 3 Long Range After Price Cut $60450 46052 6.55-million yen 4.99-million yen

(Pricing on the Performance Model 3 remains unchanged.)

For readers unfamiliar the law of demand states if a firm raises prices on a given good or service the demand for said good or service shrinks.

Meanwhile all else equal if prices decrease the quantity of a good thereby increases. In other words price and quantity demanded have an inverse relationship.

All this being said a report from Teslarati highlighted Model 3 delivery estimates in Japan have been pushed back to three to four months a staggering increase in expected wait time from the prior six- to eight-week window.

This delivery data suggests at minimum interest in the near-term for Tesla's entry-level EV has spiked.

Why It Matters: Official sales numbers from Japan in February are not available but Elon Musk’s Tesla really needs all the help it can get to spur demand in Japan.

Automotive News notes Tesla sold less than 2000 units in the country in 2020 a drop in the bucket as Musk seeks to sell 20 million EVs globally by 2030.

Price Action: According to data from Benzinga Pro Tesla shares ended down about 4% on Friday ending the after-hours session at $596.25.

Tesla shares are trading lower in sympathy with the overall market amid continued concerns over increased bond yields which have heavily impacted stocks across sectors.

The stock has a 52-week high of $900.40 and a 52-week low of $70.10.

Nearly three dozen power facilities that failed in the 2011 winter storm failed again in 2021 according to an analysis by ABC13.

HOUSTON Texas (KTRK) -- Nearly three dozen power facilities that failed in the 2011 winter storm failed again in 2021 according to an analysis by ABC13.

Those facilities and others are the focus of state hearings about why power plants didn't heed the warnings of the 2011 storm to better winterize and prepare for cold weather in Texas. The data suggest that had changes been made after the plants failed in 2011 it's possible they would've stayed online during the brutal winter cold in 2021.

That cold was responsible for freezing natural gas supply lines to plants water lines that feed the power generation units and machinery freezing up. Those were among just some of the many problems that caused power plants to shut down.

Of Texas' power generators that were not operational during the storm ERCOT's CEO Bill Magness said the freeze was responsible for 42% of the failures

In records released by ERCOT at least 71 individual power generation units in Harris County alone failed during mid-February's winter storm at 11 different sites including energy giants Calpine and NRG. All of the sites that failed in Harris County were powered by natural gas.

But the data is incomplete and doesn't list all of the power generation companies that had problems. Only companies that agreed to have their names disclosed were on the list the rest remain secret.

Across the state 1797 units failed at least 356 power facilities in Texas according to the records.

The storm of 2011 was much less severe over time requiring blackouts but only for part of a day.

ERCOT officials have claimed that the scale of the forced blackouts - the largest in Texas history - were necessary to avert an even more catastrophic failure that would have wiped out power to most of the state's 30 million residents for months.

Curtis Morgan the CEO of Vistra Corp. told lawmakers at the outset that the blackouts affected plants that could have generated more power that was urgently needed. He said when officials from his company called utility providers they were told they weren't a priority.

Among Vistra's subsidiaries is Luminant which operates nearly two dozen plants across Texas. Morgan blamed outdated lists of critical infrastructure in Texas for darkening gas processers and production sites as grid managers began shutting off parts of the system.

Morgan didn't say how many of the company's plants were turned off or for how long but he did say the company was within three minutes of power going offline at one nuclear plant and that the main power grid in America's energy capital was just moments away from total collapse Feb. 15. He said he had reached out to state officials including Abbott's office with concerns.

""We came dangerously close to losing the entire electric system"" Morgan said.

Of Texas' power generators that were not operational during the storm ERCOT's CEO Bill Magness said the freeze was responsible 42% of the failures. A lack of fuel and equipment damage unrelated to the weather also contributed but Magness said that for 38% of the plant outages the problem remains unclear.

The outages lasted days for millions of Texas homes and millions more lost water as water treatment plants shutdown and miles of pipes burst across the state. The toll of the storm included at least 15 hypothermia-related deaths around Houston said Democratic state Rep. Ana Hernandez vice chairwoman of the House State Affairs committee.

The crisis has put Texas' power and fossil fuel industry under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers who reap millions of dollars in unlimited political contributions from energy interests more than any other sector.",,,,,,,,,

Q4 2020 GPU Market Share Results Show NVIDIA Gaining While AMD Losing A Bit Intel Gains Big Chunk of Overall GPU Market Share

When looking at the overall market the worldwide GPU shipments increased to 20.5% which marks a 12.4% growth over the previous year. The research firm has forecasted that the installed/shipped GPU base will increase to 419 million units during 2020-2025. The PC market in general is showing signs of recovery after the pandemic disrupted global operations. Overall GPU shipments increased by 20.5% from the previous quarter.

The overall PC market increased by 30.25% quarter-to-quarter and increased 35.76% year-to-year. via JPR

Intel's overall shipments increased by 20.5% AMD's shipments increased by 6.4% while NVIDIA saw a decline of 7.3%. These are overall GPU shipments and Intel/AMD both had some strong products to offer to users with their Renoir and Comet Lake-based products. Intel also managed to ship a lot more 14nm desktop processors which feature their own integrated graphics solutions & those are also accounted for in these figures.

Quick highlights

AMD’s overall unit shipments increased by 6.4% quarter-to-quarter Intel’s total shipments rose by 33.2% from the last quarter and Nvidia’s decreased by -7.3%.

The GPU’s overall attach rate (which includes integrated and discrete GPUs desktop notebook and workstations) to PCs for the quarter was

113% down -9.2% from last quarter.

The overall PC market increased by 30.25% quarter-to-quarter and increased 35.76% year-to-year.

Desktop graphics add-in boards (AIBs that use discrete GPUs) decreased by -3.90% from the last quarter.

Q4’20 saw an increase in tablet shipments from last quarter.

When looking at the discrete graphics segment the market segment saw gains with NVIDIA gaining a 2 point market share lead over AMD. NVIDIA GeForce GPUs now account for 82% of the overall d GPU market share while AMD Radeon graphics cards account for 18%. That's a huge increase when compared to the previous year where NVIDIA was sitting at 73% discrete and AMD at 27%. NVIDIA not only released high-end GeForce RTX 30 GPUs but has also introduced more mainstream GPUs in Q1 2021 which should also help them raise the market share in the upcoming results.

While NVIDIA and AMD both face severe supply and demand issues the green team has been able to provide a slightly better flow of its discrete graphics cards compared to AMD's Radeon RX 6000 series. Another contributing factor to NVIDIA's higher market share gain is due to cryptocurrency mining. NVIDIA has taken measures to counter crypto mining operations by limiting hash rates on its upcoming GeForce graphics cards and also announced its CMP lineup which is dedicated to the crypto mining segment but we will have to see how that affects its market share growth in the few coming quarters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2dhbWVzL2hvdy1uaW50ZW5kby1hbmQtbnZpZGlhLWNvdWxkLWJyaW5nLTRrLXRvLXRoZS1zdXBlci1uaW50ZW5kby1zd2l0Y2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Nintendo and Nvidia could bring 4K to the Super Nintendo Switch,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/games/how-nintendo-and-nvidia-could-bring-4k-to-the-super-nintendo-switch/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2dhbWVzL2hvdy1uaW50ZW5kby1hbmQtbnZpZGlhLWNvdWxkLWJyaW5nLTRrLXRvLXRoZS1zdXBlci1uaW50ZW5kby1zd2l0Y2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9hbWRzLXJhZGVvbi1yeC02NzAwLXh0LWxhdW5jaC1wcm92ZWQtaXQtbmVlZHMtYS1kbHNzLWtpbGxlci10by1iZWF0LW52aWRpYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD's Radeon RX 6700 XT launch proved it needs a DLSS killer to beat Nvidia,"Earlier this week AMD officially unveiled its Radeon RX 6700 XT graphics card. Sitting below the previously announced Radeon RX 6900 XT Radeon RX 6800 XT and Radeon RX 6800 this new GPU is designed to appeal to more budget conscious gamers that don't need the raw horse power of those high end cards.

In many ways it was a welcome move as while AMD has usually been the brand to get if you want excellent value recently Nvidia has been enjoying unfettered success in the mid-range thanks to its RTX 3060 RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070 graphics cards.

Finally it seems like AMD has a modern alternative (especially to the RTX 3070) to challenge Nvidia.

However while we liked a lot of what we saw with the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT launch especially when it came to price - it'll cost $479 (about £340 AU$610) - there is still one glaring omission when it comes to AMD's fight against Nvidia – its alternative to Nvidia's DLSS technology.

What's DLSS?

In case you don't know DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) a clever tool in RTX 2000 and RTX 3000 series graphics cards that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to cleverly upscale a game to appear at a higher resolution.

It means you can get better looking games running at what appears to be higher resolutions without the performance hit. While a game running at '4K' with DLSS on isn't really running at 4K the image still looks very good and many people won't notice any drop in image quality.

What they probably will notice though is higher framerates and smoother gameplay. We've seen in recent games like Watch Dogs: Legion and Cyberpunk 2077 that turning on DLSS allows PCs equipped with a compatible GPU to achieve steady framerates at or above 60FPS while also having demanding graphical settings like ray tracing turned on.

In fact DLSS is the only way to get Cyberpunk 2077 to run at 60FPS with ray tracing on with an RTX 3090 GPU - and that's one of the most powerful (and expensive) GPUs in the world right now.

However it's with budget and mid-range graphics cards that the benefits of DLSS really shine. It suddenly allows these cheaper GPUs to effectively punch above their weights - either by hitting higher resolutions or by being able to make use of ray tracing.

It means you don't have to spend a fortune to get amazing graphics in PC gaming. That's a brilliant thing and it means despite being $329 (about £240 AU$430) the RTX 3060 still offers ray tracing effects. You don't have to spend $699 (£649 about AU$950) for an RTX 3080 to experience ray tracing.

Without DLSS the RTX 3060 can't play games with ray tracing on and achieve smooth frame rates at 30fps let along 60fps. DLSS though gives RTX 3060 owners the ability to experience ray tracing.

What about AMD?

However while the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT is pitched to battle mid-range Nvidia cards for gamers playing at 1080p and 1440p it remains at a disadvantage as DLSS remains exclusive to Nvidia cards.

While we've not had a chance to test out the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT yet it does mean there's a possibility that performance with ray tracing and ultra graphical settings AMD's card sees poorer performance than the RTX 3070 or even the cheaper GPUs from Team Green when they use DLSS to help boost frame rates.

And while you could argue that AMD's card will offer better native performance and that relying on DLSS is too much of a crutch - or even cheating - by Nvidia for many people the image quality will be negligible but the improved frame rates (and even lower prices) will be more important.

To level the playing field then AMD needs a DLSS alternative. The good news is that it is coming.

AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution as it's known is supposed to be coming at some point even possibly this month and could offer a similar way to boost frame rates by rendering games at a lower resolution then upscaling them.

However the mid-range AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT is arguably the AMD GPU that would benefit the most from this so the fact AMD didn't mention it at the launch event is concerning.

Until it comes out DLSS will remain a compelling reason to buy an Nvidia GPU over an AMD one. That's something that AMD cannot afford to let continue much longer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRydXN0ZWRyZXZpZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2N0cmxhbHRkZWxldGUtYW1kLWNhbnQtY29tcGV0ZS13aXRoLW52aWRpYS13aXRob3V0LWEtZGxzcy1yaXZhbC00MTI2MzAz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ctrl+Alt+Delete: AMD can't compete with Nvidia without a DLSS rival,"AMD has just announced the RX 6700 XT which is the 4th graphics card of the Big Navi generation. But despite all the fanfare there’s still no sign of AMD’s competitor to DLSS which in my mind is a deal breaker.

While AMD has so far done an excellent job of rivalling Nvidia’s graphics cards in terms of raw performance the lack of a DLSS solution means AMD’s cards struggle to run modern games at a high frame rate when ray tracing is activated.

Take the Radeon RX 6900 XT for example. With ray tracing turned off it excelled as a 4K graphics card in our testing comfortably surpassing 60fps in the majority of games. But as soon as we activated ray tracing the RX 6900 XT performance dropped down below 30fps for the likes of Control and Battlefield V.

The below table shows how beneficial DLSS can be for Nvidia graphics cards when ray tracing enters the fray pushing the frame rate up by an impressive 31fps when playing Control. In comparison AMD’s RX 6900 XT card struggles to juggle both ray tracing and a 4K performance simultaneously which is a concern since these are the GPU’s flagship features.

Ray tracing and DLSS on AMD RX 6900 XT 57fps 28fps NA Nvidia RTX 3080 107fps 32fps 63fps

While we haven’t been able to test the newly announced RX 6700 XT just yet the new graphics card will likely face the same issue when gaming in Quad HD resolutions. It says a lot that AMD refrained from sharing ray tracing benchmark results in the launch video as the Nvidia RTX 3070 will likely offer far superior results with the feature activated.

Of course ray tracing isn’t the be all and end all of the new generation of graphics cards especially since many new games still don’t support the advanced light-rendering technology. However when Nvidia’s RTX 3070 card costs just $20 more than the new RX 6700 XT the omission of such a major feature can’t go unnoticed.

The good news for AMD is that a DLSS competitor is already in the works. AMD even has a name for it: FidelityFX Super Resolution. However AMD has been very quiet on the technology in recent events with a launch date yet to be confirmed.

Website Prohardver (via VideoCardz) suggests AMD plans to release a big driver update this Spring which could mean the FidelityFX Super Resolution’s arrival could be imminent. That said the fact this major driver update wasn’t mentioned during the RX 6700 XT presentation makes us less hopeful.

And even if AMD does launch the FidelityFX Super Resolution this month there’s no guarantee it’ll be as effective as Nvidia’s DLSS straight away. Nvidia originally launched DLSS back in February 2019 and the first iteration had a lot of issues such as visual downgrades. It has since launched DLSS 2.0 which is far more effective at producing accurate upscaled images.

If it took Nvidia two years to iron out the kinks for DLSS it’s certainly possible that AMD will have to do the same once FidelityFX Super Resolution finally launches.

It is of course great to finally see AMD challenging Nvidia in the high-end graphics market this generation but if the company is serious about knocking team green off its pedestal then it should be prioritising the launch of its DLSS rival over the release of additional graphics cards.

But the question is whether the industry will listen—or continue to gamble with shale gas and oil.

In February Equinor CEO Anders Opedal had a brutally honest assessment of the Norwegian energy company’s foray into U.S. shale. “We should not have made these investments” Opedal told Bloomberg. After losing billions of dollars Equinor announced last month that it’s cutting its losses and walking away from its major shale investments in the Bakken region of North Dakota.

Meanwhile at CERAweek the oil and gas industry’s top annual gathering held the first week of March the CEO of Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Vicki Hollub told attendees: “Shale will not get back to where it was in the U.S.”

“The profitability of shale” she said “is much more difficult than people ever realized.”

Admissions of questionable profits and the end of growth from a top CEO charts new territory for the shale industry. These comments come after a decade of fracking which has resulted in losses of hundreds of billions of dollars.

But despite the unsuccessful investments and fresh warnings some companies continue to promise investors that the industry has finally figured out how to make profits from fracking for oil and gas. While not a new argument these companies are offering new framing—a “fracking 4.0” if you will—focused on new innovations future restraint and real profits.

In February for instance as fracking pioneer Chesapeake Energy emerged from bankruptcy the company’s CEO Doug Lawler told Bloomberg: “What we see going forward is a new era for shale.”

Meanwhile Enron Oil and Gas (EOG)—considered one of the best fracking companies—lost over $600 million in 2020. Despite this the company is now touting “innovations” it has made to help create future profits along with promises of new profitable wells—part of an industry annual ritual promising new technologies and new acreage that will finally deliver profits to their investors.

Surge in Permian M&A and Profitability Could Trigger New Wave of European and Asian Investments in US Oil and Gas https://t.co/HWpJocfcUK — Jonathan Tyner (@tynerenergy) February 22 2017

This time will be different

In May 2019 Hollub oversaw one of the biggest oil and gas acquisitions in industry history when Occidental purchased Permian-based fracking company Anadarko for $57 billion. The deal was backed with $10 billion from investor Warren Buffet. The deal was a huge bet on the profitability of fracking for oil and gas in the Permian Basin’s shale.

At the same time Houston-based energy investment group Tudor Pickering and Holt released an investment note begging the industry to stop producing so much oil while losing money. The firm implored the industry to not follow through on plans to increase production saying “Please for the love of God don’t do it.”

But the industry did it. And lost more money.

Following the acquisition I wrote: “Despite the U.S. fracking industry’s history of ‘capital destruction’ one of the top investors in the world has bet big that Occidental holds the secret to Permian profits. But perhaps this time really will be different or perhaps Occidental will follow in the footsteps of Halcón and others who bet it all on the Permian and lost.”

And later that year DeSmog asked: “Will the Fracking Revolution Peak Before Ever Making Money?”

All of this came a little over a year after investors had begged the industry to stop taking on debt to produce oil that it sold for a loss. This resulted in promises from the industry to do just that and an analyst telling the Wall Street Journal “Is this time going to be different? I think yes a little bit.”

It wasn’t different however and the industry borrowed more money to produce more oil and gas—and lost more money doing it.

Right now there's no good news for the Permian or the fracking industry & 2020 will very likely be another year of big losses more debt & more bankruptcies. Each yr makes increasingly clear that the vaunted shale boom will be one of the biggest financial busts in US history. https://t.co/2Rh2nPQGqA — Golden Fleece (@Mintgecko) February 22 2020

A 2020 report by Friends of the Earth Public Citizen and BailoutWatch estimates that the U.S. oil and gas business borrowed another $100 billion in 2020 while Bloomberg estimates over $62 billion in new losses for U.S. shale producers last year. These losses occurred despite U.S. oil production decreasing by approximately one million barrels per day in 2020 compared to 2019. Despite the pandemic and prices for natural gas being the lowest in decades U.S. natural gas production only declined 1 percent in 2020.

The stark reality

Occidental CEO Hollub has admitted that it’s hard to make money in shale but is promising the company will do just that.



In comments in February Hollub touted a “new model for shale development” for Occidental which is based on the idea of the company focusing on technological advances and using carbon capture to help it make profits in shale. Hollub described this new strategy as an “opportunity to mitigate what people have so much concern about with shale.”

While certainly a new approach to shale as it involves the use of direct air carbon capture—something it has been touting it would do since 2019—it doesn’t directly address the challenge of making shale profitable. Occidental currently plans to begin construction on its carbon capture project in 2022 so it is likely to be business as usual over the next few years before it can begin to evaluate if the new model might improve the economics of fracking shale for oil. And as a January 2021 Bloomberg article noted this approach would require “support from tax credits and outside investors to be financially viable.”

Unlike Occidental though others are getting out based on a similar assessment about the economics of U.S. shale production. As Equinor’s Opedal said: “The Bakken does not compete [with other available investments]… We have chosen to sell the Bakken.”

In May 2020 the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also reported on how Shell and Chevron were selling their shale assets in Appalachia. The article stated that while oil companies had all piled into Appalachian shale in the early days “one by one many have left or are trying to.”

Meanwhile some assets have no value and are just being written off as losses. In 2020 Exxon wrote off $20 billion of its assets acquired in its purchase of shale gas company XTO—the largest write down the company had ever made.

Many of those companies that have the option to get out of the U.S. shale business are choosing to do so. They know what is all too clear at this point: This time isn’t different.

‘A new era of shale’

One company that’s taking a different approach in order to stay in the game is Chesapeake. It’s a company built on fracking.

Unlike Equinor which has other assets and investments if Chesapeake chooses to get out of the fracking business the company would be sold off and the CEO would no longer get paid. And if there is one thing shale CEOs are good at it is getting paid huge sums while losing investor money.

It should be no surprise that Lawler Chesapeake’s CEO is promising a new era for shale—that this time will be different. Admitting otherwise would jeopardize his salary. Lawler even got a bonus for overseeing the company he drove into bankruptcy in 2020.

So what is different this time for Chesapeake? Lawler is claiming that the days of losing money producing oil and gas are done. “They’re absolutely over” Lawler told Bloomberg.

Lawler’s new strategy to finally achieve profits is to focus on just fracking for gas and no longer pursuing fracking for oil. Fracking for gas is the exact business Shell left and according to Bloomberg “many have left or are trying to.”

Yet just a few years ago in 2019 prior to filing for bankruptcy it was a different “new era” for Chesapeake as the company promised investors a new strategy: pivoting from gas and betting big on oil. That bet didn’t work and bankruptcy followed.

Chesapeake now wants investors to believe it will make money fracking for gas which it admitted it couldn’t do in 2019 and was the reason for switching to a focus on oil.

Same story different marketing

In the case of EOG the company is pinning its hopes on technological innovation and promises of new and better performing wells. The company said it benefited from “countless innovations across the company in 2020.” Technology however isn’t enough to save the finances of the fracking industry and many of its past promises of technological salvation (e.g. cube development drilling longer wells) have proven to be financial disasters.

EOG is also promising that now it will focus on drilling and fracking “double premium” wells. These wells will be money makers the company says claiming it has 10 years’ worth of these assets. In an earnings call at the end of 2020 EOG CEO Bill Thomas explained to investors that “these double-premium wells are much much more productive.”

Image Credit: Slide promoting EOG’s New Double Premium Source: EOG Investor Presentation

Why Double Premium? In 2016 EOG promised investors it had premium wells that would deliver results. So this time around it’s making bigger and better promises.

Looking ahead

Looking ahead 2021 may appear to be business as usual for the shale industry: Promises of restraint by some companies while others chase new production with increased drilling. New marketing pitches with new marketing language with the same promises of profits and a bright future.

In January 2021 a Reuters headline said: “OPEC crude output cuts should help U.S. shale profits in 2021.” This echoes headlines from January 2018 when the Wall Street Journal wrote: “Frackers Could Make More Money Than Ever in 2018 If They Don’t Blow It.”

The implication is that the industry was already a profitable one and that good days lie ahead. The industry however has always struggled and as Occidental CEO Hollub notes U.S. shale production is likely past its peak.

The reality however is that it likely is a new era for U.S. shale. Companies like Equinor are getting out. Everyone knows profits are “difficult” to come by. Production is unlikely to ever return to the levels of 2019. And investigations into fraudulent claims over shale assets raise doubts as to how much oil is really in the shale.

But something else is happening too. As Hollub discussed Occidental’s future as a shale producer during CERAWeek she said: “We do not expect to be an oil company only in the next 10 to 20 years. We expect to become a carbon management company.”

In other wordsthe company that made the biggest bet ever on the future of shale has aspirations of no longer being an oil company in the future.

A new era for U.S. shale is beginning and those who can are leaving the business to those who have no choice but to stick it out double down and promise that once again this time will be different.",,,,,,,,,,,,

LYNCHBURG Va. – A pair of second-half goals carried Liberty (7-0 6-0 BIG EAST) past the visiting Old Dominion field hockey team (4-3 4-2) on Sunday.



""Overall it was a much better game for us today"" head coach Andrew Griffiths said. ""It fits our pattern of improvements in the second game of back-to-backs so I'm pleased with that. Rina Tsioles had another outstanding game for us and played every minute in the midfield this weekend.""



After an evenly-contested first half the Flames needed only 57 seconds to break the deadlock in the third quarter. Daniella Rhodes scored her 11th goal of the season to put the hosts ahead 1-0.



The Monarchs had a pair of chances to tie the game in the third quarter but did not capitalize. Marlon de Bruijne hit the post with a shot in the 37th minute and Ilse Westera's shot was saved by Azul Iritxity Irigoyen in the dying seconds of the period.



Liberty tacked on an insurance goal less than 90 seconds into the fourth quarter by way of a forehand shot from Jill Bolton. From there the Flames clamped down on ODU holding the Monarchs without a shot attempt in the final period.



""We made two simple mental mistakes in the second half that led directly to goals and Liberty did an excellent job of finishing those opportunities"" Griffiths said. ""After that we were chasing the game and it opened up in the fourth quarter.""



Old Dominion took aim at the Liberty goal in the opening stages of the match. De Bruijne drew a save from Iritxity Irigoyen at the 4:10 mark. Just over 30 seconds later Riley Taylor was denied by the Flames goalkeeper. The Monarchs' strong start was punctuated by a penalty corner and a de Bruijne shot that sailed wide of the target.



""The first half we really controlled possession of the game and created some excellent chances"" Griffiths said. ""We missed two great opportunities that were essentially open goals and in a tight game we can't afford to do that.""



In the first 30 minutes ODU had a slim 6-4 edge in total shots. For the game the Flames outshot the Monarchs 15-8. Liberty was more clinical with its chances putting 11 on target in comparison to Old Dominion's three.



Cam MacGillivray made a season-high nine saves. Iritxity Irigoyen stopped three shots.



The Monarchs will look to bounce back with a pair of neutral-site matches with Providence in Conshohocken Pennsylvania on March 13 and March 14.



""It was a tough road weekend for us but also a very good learning weekend"" Griffiths said. ""The team spirit is good and we are already looking for to playing them again on home turf in a few weeks.""

What is Hydrofluoric acid's purpose in the semiconductor industry why has Samsung had to develop a recycling system and how will this change the semiconductor industry?

What is hydrofluoric acid used for in the semiconductor industry?

Hydrofluoric acid is a chemical that is made up of Hydrogen and Fluorine. When in solution HF is a hazardous acid to biological matter due to its penetrative properties. If HF comes into contact with skin the resulting acid doesn't show signs of burns immediately but instead sinks into the body and causes deep tissue corrosion.

HF is also a major component in the semiconductor industry thanks to its ability to dissolve glass. Silicon wafers are oxidised to create layers of silicon-diode which is an excellent electrical insulator. Furthermore the growing of oxide layers on silicon allows for carefully controlled layer height and such layers can reliably be grown to tens of nanometers in thickness.

Once an oxide layer is grown on a wafer areas need to be removed to make electrical connections with the underlying silicon material. To do this a layer of etch-resist (which does not dissolve in HF) is spun-coated onto the wafer and the etch-resist (which is UV curable) has a design patterned to it. Once cleaned areas which need to have their oxide layer removed are exposed and submerging the wafer in HL will see these areas etched away.





Japan Bans the Export of Key Semiconductor Compounds

So HF is clearly of major importance to the semiconductor industry and as such semiconductor foundries tend to take measures to ensure their supplies of HF and other key compounds. However back in July 2019 the Japanese government announced that it would ban the export of key compounds for semiconductors including HF to South Korea.

Such news would normally be of little importance until you discover that South Korea is one of the world’s biggest producers of semiconductors. Japan produces 90% of the worlds semiconductor consumables including HF. But why would Japan enforce such a ban on South Korea?

According to Reuters the ban's cause extends from a court ruling in South Korea that identified Japanese companies who took part in forced labour during WW2 and ordered that those companies must pay compensation as a result. Japan stated that the matter was already settled in 1962 but South Korea has declined this response. As such Japan decided to fight back and impose the export ban on South Korea's chemicals are heavily dependent on.

Samsung Develops HF Recycling for Semiconductors

The semiconductor industry is arguably the living embodiment of precision; billions of transistors less than 10nm all carefully spaced with no flaws all working in unison. To make such devices every step of the production process is carefully monitored and any consumables whether it be a silicon wafer or a cleaning compound must be of the highest purity.

As such you rarely see (if at all) any recycling of components compounds or materials. If a piece of silicon does not work it is binned and crushed into sand. It won’t likely be used to remake a silicon wafer or the chemicals used to make it recycled.

However the shortage of HF caused by Japan on South Korea has seen Samsung turn to alternative methods to ensure it can continue semiconductors' manufacture. Recently Samsung announced that it has developed a system for recycling HF acid which can be reused in the semiconductor production process reducing the overall quantity of clean HF purchased.

The system developed by Samsung Electronics reuses the HF used in the wafer back surface cleaning process. While the exact process behind the recycling process has not been detailed Samsung have stated that they have been able to reuse up to 80 percent of the recycled material and has been proven to work for up to 1500 products. The recycled HF is to undergo testing on a main production system now and if successful could see Samsung reduce the quantity of HF purchased by 87%.

Recycling for the Semiconductor Industry

If recycling of compounds and materials can be achieved the semiconductor industry would undergo a massive change. The end-products produced themselves will not be different nor will they necessarily be any cheaper but they will be significantly more environmentally friendly.

The semiconductor industry produces many extremely toxic compounds and by-products which need to be taken care of carefully. Furthermore the semiconductor industry requires many rare materials that can require mining operations on unimaginable scales which causes significant environmental and social damage.

Thus recycling and reusing minerals could see less mining operations required better conditions for poorer areas of the world (as these are disproportionately affected by mining) and a cleaner environment.

A high-level graphic on the 2019 demand by end-use for semiconductors. Image used courtesy of SIA

It's difficult to play down the gravity of the chip shortage after reading the letter. The letter focuses on how the absence of U.S. chip manufacturing incentives has affected the country's competitiveness highlighting America's declining share of global semiconductor manufacturing.

It then urges the Biden Administration to fund the CHIPS for America Act fully. This bipartisan legislation plans a package of grants and tax incentives to strengthen America's domestic semiconductor supply chain.

The Chips Are Down

The dire state of America’s domestic semiconductor supply chains has been put in the spotlight by the ongoing global chip shortage. And while offers of help from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd (TSMC) have been well-received this supply chain disruption may be indicative of the U.S.' waning role as a foremost hub for semiconductor research and manufacturing.

A line graph showing the trend in the global regional semiconductor market. Here you can see America's leading point was in 2000. Image used courtesy of SIA

While it’s true that the U.S. still asserts a great deal of dominance over the industry by U.S. firms holding roughly half of the global semiconductor market share since the late 1980s this is market hold may be dipping.

This line graph depicts the trend in semiconductor market shareholdings from 1988–2018. The bar graph shows the market shareholdings as of 2018. Image used courtesy of SIA

One place of concern is America's position in areas like memory which South Korean firms like Samsung and SK Hynix are dominating. Contract manufacturing the holy grail of the modern chip industry enabled TSMC to take the crown of the world's biggest chip company. While Intel is still struggling with its shift to 7nm Samsung is already at 5nm. Also TSMC is expecting to move to 3nm (and beyond) as early as 2022.

To aid long-term technical viability and competitiveness for the U.S. semiconductor industry the federal government will likely need to make significant investments not only in terms of financial incentives and tax breaks but legislative efforts too.

Biden Orders Review of Semiconductor Supply Chains

In response to the ongoing chip shortage and mounting pressure for the federal government to take action President Biden signed an executive order (EO14017: America’s Supply Chains) on February 24th addressing the semiconductor industry’s growing concerns.

The order compels the federal government to conduct a 100-day review of supply chains in four sets of products including computer chips and large-capacity batteries. The White House plans to look at the ""resiliency and capacity"" of the American manufacturing supply chains to support national security and emergency preparedness.

During a press conference President Biden emphasized that addressing the chip shortage is necessary to ensure the United States meets challenges related to the pandemic cybersecurity and climate change. Biden suggested that the most effective way is to sharpen America's competitive edge by bringing investments back home.

While the semiconductor shortage has undoubtedly played a part in shaping the order Biden noted during his 2020 campaign that the U.S. needed new rules and processes to dictate trade relationships with other nations. This order may well be the first in a series of strategic moves to decrease U.S. dependence on foreign trade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3R5bGVycGFwZXIuY29tL3NhbXN1bmctZGV0YWlscy1wbGFucy1mb3ItMTctYmlsbGlvbi1jaGlwLWZhY2lsaXR5LWluLXRleGFzL2FydGljbGVfYWFkZWY0ZjItN2VkNy0xMWViLThiODktNTMwYjBjYmY0YzM2Lmh0bWzSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly90eWxlcnBhcGVyLmNvbS9zYW1zdW5nLWRldGFpbHMtcGxhbnMtZm9yLTE3LWJpbGxpb24tY2hpcC1mYWNpbGl0eS1pbi10ZXhhcy9hcnRpY2xlX2FhZGVmNGYyLTdlZDctMTFlYi04Yjg5LTUzMGIwY2JmNGMzNi5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung details plans for $17 billion chip facility in Texas,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC 台積電) yesterday unveiled a plan to hire 9000 people this year in the latest round of recruitment as the chipmaker races to boost capacity to alleviate a chip crunch and safeguard its technology advantage.

TSMC’s talent recruitment this year might be the most ambitious in its history while last year’s drive of 8000 added recruits doubled the 4000 new hires that it averaged over the preceding few years.

The latest drive — for fabs in Hsinchu Taichung and Tainan — aims to catch up with growth in the company and new technology development the Hsinchu-based chipmaker said.

The annual hiring campaign was launched amid shortages of a variety of chips especially auto chips.

In January the company revised its five-year revenue forecast to growth of 10 to 15 percent from a previous estimate of 5 to 10 percent which it attributed primarily to stronger-than-expected demand for applications using high-performance computing and 5G smartphones.

TSMC in January said that it plans an annual capital expenditure of US$25 billion to US$28 billion (US$884.14 million to US$990.24 million) mostly to develop and manufacture advanced 3-nanometer 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer chips.

The recruitment plan would bring the chipmaker’s overall headcount to more than 60000 employees up from 51297 at the end of 2019.

TSMC hosted a recruitment event at National Taiwan University yesterday the first in a series of hiring activities to take place at local universities this month and next.

The company expects about 3000 students to sign up for job interviews and said that next month it would begin accepting applications to a new internship program.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyYXBoZW5lLWluZm8uY29tL2dyYXBoZW5lLXNxdWFyZS1wcmVwYXJlcy1pcG8tYW5kLWFpbXMtbWFzcy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWN2ZC1ncmFwaGVuZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Graphene Square prepares for IPO and aims for mass production of CVD graphene,"South Korea-based Graphene Square developer and distributor of graphene materials and films has announced that it is preparing for an IPO to fuel global expansion. It will select the underwriter this year and plans its Kosdaq listing in 2022 through the Technology Special Listing program a system introduced in 2005 to allow promising startups to list the local bourse based on a technology evaluation conducted by Korea Exchange-designated institutions.

Graphene Square’s competitive edge is said to be found in its proprietary chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method used for the production of graphene. The method is based on the research of Professor Hong Byung-hee of Seoul National University on the synthesis of large-area graphene. In fact Graphene Square itself was established in 2012 as a spin-off of chemistry professor Hong Byung-hee’s lab at Seoul National University.

Simply put our CVD technology adheres high molecular compounds onto the copper-synthesized graphene then removes the copper using an etchant and finally separates the graphene from the molecular compound explained Hong.

Graphene Square opened the door for mass production of graphene by combining the CVD technology with the ""roll-to-roll"" technique also devised by Hong who still oversees the company as its CEO. The technique apparent from its name is just like printing newspapers as every production stage is conducted on a single production line thus maximizing productivity.

Professor Hong highlighted that his company’s graphene synthesis and production equipment is particularly sought after by overseas universities and research institutions driving the vast majority of the company’s current revenue. Its most recent sales were to the Israel Institute of Technology or Technion which purchased three sets of CVD equipment earlier this year.

Among the various potential segments for use of CVD graphene Graphene Square is currently focusing on the development of transparent heaters for EVs. The heater attaches graphene onto the glass film of the front windshield of the vehicle and produces heat thereby preventing frost.

The company stated that there is severe energy waste when EVs make hot air for defrosting. We are currently working closely with a global auto company to manufacture the transparent heaters by 2022.

The company is also developing pellicles for the extreme ultra violet (EUV) lithography process. EUV lithography in the semiconductor industry uses EUV light that has been penetrated through the patterned EUV ""mask"" to draw circuits on a wafer. The pellicles are basically thin films that protect the expensive EUV masks by covering their surfaces.

Graphene Square stated that it sees a huge opportunity in the EUV sector as the pellicle technology used in the EUV sector is not yet fully advanced in the market despite the global trend of semiconductor manufacturers increasingly considering adopting the use of pellicles to protect the masks.

Other areas of the company’s research for potential commercialization include applying graphene onto the current collectors of rechargeable batteries for improved capacity and charging speed and onto bulletproof jackets."

While the Cañada del Oro Placers Campo Bonito Claims and the Mine With the Iron Door are well known among prospectors in the mountain range it is the Oracle Ridge Mine that has served as an established mining locality for 140 years.

The mine is located on the north flank of the Catalinas 72 miles by road northeast of Tucson through Oracle and accessible off Mount Lemmon Forest Service Road 38.

Oracle Ridge is on the border of Pima and Pinal Counties on private property within Coronado National Forest. As part of the Old Hat Mining district it comprises over 1200 acres including more than 100 patented mining claims.

The Santa Catalinas were formed more than 20 million years ago by geologic uplift culminating in multiple stages of folding and faulting as evidenced around the Oracle Ridge mine site.

Surrounding country rock includes Precambrian granites quartz and rhyolite. Ore deposits in strata and contact metamorphic skarn veins were formed by the intrusion of mineralized fluids.

Mining at Oracle Ridge dates to 1881 with prospectors attracted by copper stained croppings in a 4-mile limestone diorite contact metamorphic zone encircling Marble Peak. The Peak was christened after a mile and a quarter length three-quarters of a mile wide mass of marble deposit that borders the mines and prospects.

A $200000 investment and construction of a 20-ton-per-day smelter to process copper ore from several nearby mining operations were made on Marble Peak including the Geesaman workings Hartman Homestake Leatherwood and Stratton.

Around 100000 pounds of copper were produced onsite using charcoal as fuel. Transportation across rugged terrain and distance to market hindered early development.

Phelps Dodge acquired the property in 1910 developing the Geesaman and Leatherwood claims to 6000 feet by 1913. This included a 280-foot inclined shaft and drifting at the 100- 200- and 250-foot levels.

However the ore averaged less than 4% which was considered low grade for profitable exploitation at that time.

Legal disputes over land ownership hindered the company from further exploration and mining was intermittent until Catalina Consolidated acquired the property in 1937.

A report in 1942 mentioned 60000 tons of tailings with scheelite (an ore of tungsten) attendant in the copper ore offering a potential of 0.4% tungsten trioxide.

Recommendations were to build a reclamation plant to treat the tailings for scheelite; however investigations by economic geologist Saville Cyrus Creasey concluded it could not be mined at a profit.

Improvements made in the form of a 100-ton- per-day flotation mill operated until 1944. The company was acquired by the Control Mine Inc. (which christened the Control Mine). It maintained operations through a government premium until it was lifted in 1946.

Onsite 115000 tons of ore were processed with 1081 tons of concentrate averaging 27% copper 8.6 troy ounces per ton of silver and 0.015 troy ounces per ton of gold.

Exploration continued during the latter half of the 20th century. A ground magnetometer survey conducted by consulting geologist Alan Rugg discovered an anomaly on the north and south ends of the property. That resulted in the discovery of magnetite bearing iron 100 feet below the surface and 350000 tons of copper mineralization comprised of around 2% copper.

Continental Copper and Union Minière entered a partnership in the late 1970s investing $19 million in exploration culminating in more than 9 miles of underground development by the mid-1990s.

Primary copper ores comprise bornite chalcocite chalcopyrite and covellite which occur in zones that are conducive to selective mining with the benefit of increased metallurgical yield.

An office building maintenance and warehouse buildings were constructed on-site. Low copper prices caused a suspension in operations in the early 1980s with a stockpile of 85000 tons of ore grading 2.56% copper.

In 1992 a column floatation mill designed and built by Minproc Ltd. was erected eventually reaching a capacity of 1020 tons per day.

Two 25-short ton truckloads of copper concentrate were shipped daily from the mine to the Hayden Smelter.

Several mining methods have been employed at Oracle Ridge including room and pillar and long hole sublevel stoping. The former involved open stoping wherein pillars of ore are left standing to support the rock over a flat-lying ore body. The latter implemented in 1992 was a low cost high productivity mechanized technique enabling miners to develop multiple stopes synchronous to one being mined out with a recovery of up to 95% blocked out reserves.

Seven yard scoop trams muck and load the ore where it is transported to the surface by 18-ton underground haul trucks.

A U.S. Department of Interior report in 1994 noted past production of the mine as 849500 short tons containing 38.8 million pounds of copper 81000 pounds of lead 37000 pounds of zinc 580500 ounces of silver and 4550 ounces of gold.

It also concluded proven and probable ore reserves at 4 million short tons with an average grade of 2.33% copper and 0.67 ounce of silver per short ton.

Production issues arose with the crushing and grinding circuits being unable to process tonnage of ore which factored into the mine’s closure in 1996.

An assessment by Globex Mining Enterprises Inc. concluded earlier ventures involving $25 million invested in the mine had been misspent on extraneous projects which inevitably led to a lack of working capital contributing to unprofitability.

Over the past 25 years mining companies have committed further financial resources to geological mapping core sampling drilling and refurbishment of the underground workings.

As of 2021 Eagle Mountain Mining has acquired $11 million from its investors to further develop the Oracle Ridge Mine which currently is estimated to contain 11.76 million tons of mineral resource primarily copper followed by silver and gold.

This investment will fund diamond drilling to expand the resource size while concentrating on higher-grade zones for development investigating other sites within a few kilometers of the mine for potential resource and adding geology and management personnel to the project.

Last year the company hit 25.09 grams per ton of high-grade silver while confirming a new identified zone of broad copper mineralization.

After starting the week on a positive note benchmark indexes S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average withdrew and slipped to a one-month low before ending the last session. They were down 1.34% and 1.11% respectively early Friday. Earlier sentiment had improved after jobless claims came in below economists’ forecast.

After a relatively quiet period consolidations seem to be making a comeback. Continuing its acquisition spree Accenture clinched at least four deals this week with the buyout of UK-based talent consultancy Cirrus Logic topping the list.

The professional services firm also agreed to buy Brazil-based robotics solutions provider Pollux and Australian logistics consultancy GRA. The other business that joined the Accenture fold is technology solutions provider REPL Group.

Agilent Technologies agreed to acquire Resolution Bioscience for $695 million while Taco Bell owner Yum! Brands bought artificial intelligence provider Kvantum. The other key deals include Digital Turbine’s purchase of Israel-based mobile advertising company Triapodi Ltd and the $1.45-billion acquisition of UK-based Capco by Indian software giant Wipro.

Once again retailers dominated the earnings scene with department store operators Kohl’s and Target Corp. publishing their latest statistics on Tuesday followed by discount chain Dollar Tree on Wednesday. The next day Kroger Company and warehouse giant Costco Corp. delivered mixed results for their most recent quarters amid tough-year-over comparison.

Chipmaker Broadcom’s first-quarter report was the other major announcement of the week. As Wall Street approaches the fag end of the earnings season Oracle’s third-quarter financial report is probably the most-awaited announcement next week — scheduled for March 10.

Prior to that H&R Block and Dick’s Sporting Goods are expected to report on March 9. As the week progresses Ulta Beauty will be unveiling fourth-quarter numbers on March 11.

Following calls for more equitable vaccine distribution East Palo Alto seniors and essential workers will be able to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at a clinic this Tuesday.

The clinic will be held on March 9 at 2160 Euclid Ave. in East Palo Alto from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. A clinic for residents of the Belle Haven neighborhood in Menlo Park will take place on Saturday March 13 at the Onetta Harris Community Center 100 Terminal Ave. in Menlo Park from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The clinics which San Mateo County announced on Thursday are a partnership between the county the Ravenswood Family Health Network the city of East Palo Alto and the YMCA of Silicon Valley.

Ravenswood CEO Luisa Buada said in a statement that they were thrilled to work with the county to expand vaccine access.

“The majority of our residents are hard-working families in front-line jobs. They are the ones working in our markets and performing other vital jobs and services that keep our community running” Buada said.

The clinics are open to eligible residents which includes health care workers residents of long-term care facilities people 65 and older and essential workers in the food and agriculture education child care and emergency response sectors. To sign up or get more information people can call or text 650-665-0482.

The clinics are aimed to overcome barriers to vaccine access. East Palo Alto has the lowest rate of vaccinations in the county with 12.6% of East Palo Alto residents vaccinated compared to the countywide rate of 25.6%. Last week state and city leaders called for increased vaccinations in East Palo Alto.

During a COVID-19 study session hosted by the East Palo Alto City Council on Thursday night Buada said that vaccine clinics can be complex and labor-intensive. Ravenswood has had vaccine clinics in January and February providing about 2600 vaccinations so far and they are prepared to continue vaccinations.

“Nine weeks ago we weren’t doing any vaccines and really didn’t know how it was going to all work and today we feel very confident that we can do mass vaccinations at about 100 to 125 people an hour safely. And we have signed up many volunteers to do that” Buada said.

Buada said that the center planned to host additional clinics every Saturday except on the Saturdays preceding a holiday or four weeks ahead of a holiday.

However those clinics depend on whether they receive enough supply from the county which receives its supply from the state.

The county continues to be constrained by the vaccine supply. Deputy County Manager Justin Mates said that the state’s eligibility tiers are not always matched with the supply.

“When there’s a new group announced that doesn’t mean the state has supply to vaccinate that entire group it just means that those people are now eligible to be vaccinated if the supply is there” Mates said.

Mates said that the county is aware of the low vaccination rate in East Palo Alto and they recognize that other vaccination events may not have been as accessible to East Palo Alto residents. He encouraged people to check with their health care provider for vaccine updates and to sign up for the county’s notification tool and the state’s MyTurn.ca.gov notification system.

While Mates said the state’s MyTurn system is not yet active for San Mateo County people should still sign up as the MyTurn system will begin to offer vaccine appointments for San Mateo County residents on March 15.

City Clerk and spokesperson Walfred Solorzano also encouraged people to check the city’s social media for updates or sign up for Spanish language updates via the WhatsApp button on the city’s Facebook page.

City and county leaders are also working to address vaccine equity and barriers via the county’s Vaccine Communication Equity Working Group comprised of more than 100 community partners and leaders.

The group meets weekly and East Palo Alto City Council member Lisa Gauthier a member of the group said that they are working to understand why people might be hesitant to take the vaccine and to address those concerns.

Vice Mayor Ruben Abrica acknowledged that some people may not trust the government but council members could use their reach and networks to encourage people to take the vaccine.

“I think I’ve convinced a few people” Abrica said. “Now that the vaccine is out there the more we talk to people we know are doubtful we start having an impact personally.”

Dr. Anand Chabra San Mateo County Health’s COVID-19 mass vaccination section chief said that having more vaccines available will also make it easier for providers to reach communities.

The state is expected to receive about 380000 doses of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine officially known as the Janssen vaccine which Chabra encouraged people to take when available.

For those who might be concerned about the effectiveness of the Janssen vaccine Chabra said it was important to note that the Janssen vaccine was tested at a different time than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. In addition unlike Pfizer and Moderna the Janssen vaccine was tested against COVID-19 variants and provides protection from those as well Chabra said.

“It’s not really an apples-to-apples comparison” Chabra said. “And it (the Janssen vaccine) protects against severe illness resulting in hospitalization and it was 100% effective against dying from COVID so that’s the most important thing that we’re trying to protect against for everybody.”

Chabra reminded people that taking the vaccine may come with some side effects such as a sore arm fever fatigue or muscle aches which should resolve within a couple of days.

As to whether people can still transmit the virus after being fully vaccinated Chabra said there isn’t enough research to answer that question.

Even if vaccinated people should continue taking the COVID-19 precautions of washing hands wearing a face mask social distancing and avoiding gatherings.

As of Thursday 164388 San Mateo County residents have received the COVID-19 vaccine. Information about vaccination in San Mateo County including a link to sign up for the county’s notification tool is available here.

A video on vaccine safety and equity is available here. The video features San Mateo County Health Equity Officer Shireen Malekafzali and Mills-Peninsula Medical Center Emergency Department physician Leroy Sims.

Women’s economic empowerment is critical to achieving gender equality and strengthening sustainable development cooperation. It includes women’s ability to participate equally in existing markets having a louder voice and more agency and their meaningful involvement in economic decision-making at all levels.

This can be achieved by ensuring women’s financial inclusion technical inclusion entrepreneurship empowerment and participation in decision-making.

For the second year in a row Saudi Arabia has made notable progress in advancing women’s economic opportunities according to the World Bank Group’s latest report.

The Women Business and the Law 2021 report placed Saudi Arabia among the leading countries in the Middle East and North African region — scoring 80 points out of 100 up from the 70.6 achieved in 2020.

According to the report Saudi Arabia has progressed in reducing wage inequality eliminated restrictions on female employment in jobs previously deemed too dangerous and lifted bans on women working night shifts.

As science progresses at a rapid pace access to new technology and the ability to create and shape technological change is increasingly becoming a fundamental tool to support women’s empowerment and improve their lives especially in a post-pandemic world.

During a roundtable discussion in July last year spawned by Women20 (W20) an official engagement group of the G20 speakers noted that only 48 percent of women are accustomed to the latest technology while 60 percent of Saudi women use social media platforms without producing any digital content. This confirms that women are users of technology not producers they said.

“Improving digital and cybersecurity literacy among women contributes to their economic empowerment since they will be needed in all sectors locally regionally and internationally” Dalal Al-Harthi a cybersecurity expert told Arab News.

FAST FACT The Women Business and the Law 2021 report placed Saudi Arabia among the leading countries in the Middle East and North African region.

Al-Harthi is a faculty member at Shaqra University and resident engineer at the US-based cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks. Throughout the last three years she has worked in three positions across different institutions in the US as the only female engineer in her teams.

However she considered those situations as motivation to prove herself as opposed to a challenge.

“Males historically and currently dominate the cybersecurity field. A recent report by Cybersecurity Ventures states that women make up 20 percent of the cybersecurity workforce. Because of this massive shortage of women among cybersecurity professionals today I became deeply passionate about raising this percentage to 50 percent” Al-Harthi said.







Digital empowerment of women allows them to seize the opportunities provided by evolving global markets. (Social media)



“The cybersecurity field is the hottest cake in the market and in high demand around the world” she added.

Therefore the digital empowerment of women and girls by upgrading their knowledge and skills allows them to seize the opportunities provided by evolving global markets. Moreover attracting more women to the tech sector is essential to unlocking the potential of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and ensuring technology is developed from a balanced perspective.

Al-Harthi advises women who want to venture into cybersecurity to improve their technical skills obtain professional certificates look into cybersecurity job descriptions to grasp the bigger picture and work on their communication research and writing skills.

According to the undersecretary for women’s empowerment at the Saudi Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development Hind Al-Zahid having women in prominent leadership positions will result in greater numbers of women in senior roles in the labor market.

Saudi Arabia has increasingly encouraged women’s leadership in recent years. The most notable event came earlier this year which saw the appointment of Iman Al-Mutairi as executive director for destination branding at the Soudah Development Co. a new brand fully owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund the Public Investment Fund.

Several initiatives have also been launched to prepare women for leading positions in the public sector such as the QIYADYAT platform and the leadership academy at the Public Administration Institute.

As it stands 2.5 percent of leading positions in the Kingdom’s public sector are occupied by women but in the private sector the figure rises to 25 percent.

In a recent interview with Al-Arabiya TV Al-Zahid said that the gap between the public and private sectors is due to the lack of a talent pool that helps include more women in the public sector as many women work in the education and health industries.

On the bright side the latest numbers show that women’s participation in the labor market has increased to 31 percent exceeding the government’s goal of 25 percent by 2025.

Dr. Albandari Al-Rabiah director of the Studies and Information Department at the Public Administration Institute said that studies have shown that a balanced representation of women leaders across different levels of an organization leads to a higher level of performance and innovation and therefore increased revenues and a distinct competitive advantage.

Dr. Al-Rabiah also conducted a field study to evaluate the experience of women leaders in the Kingdom’s public sector.

“The results of the study demonstrated the high sense of commitment among Saudi women toward their responsibilities and role in society as well as their relentless pursuit to prove themselves in addition to a number of challenges that face women on the ascending ladder to leadership positions” she said.

Two years after the study was published Al-Rabiah insists that the Kingdom is witnessing a decisive turning point for women and their journey towards leadership positions.

The unemployment rate among women in Saudi Arabia is 31 percent while among men it stands at 9 percent. Therefore women have been encouraged to get involved in entrepreneurship to expand their participation in the labor market fuel economic growth and create more jobs for their female peers.

Vision 2030 aims to increase the contribution of SMEs to Saudi gross domestic product from 20 to 35 percent.

Emon Shakoor an ex-neuroscience researcher and now technology entrepreneur who started her journey in her early 20s launched Saudi Arabia’s first tech-inclusion and female-focused accelerator to help more women venture into the field.

“Today in Saudi according to Ministry of Education numbers more women are graduating from tech-related majors than men however after graduation they do not continue working in the industry” said Shakoor CEO and founder of Blossom Accelerator.

She said that the way to solve this problem is for women to have more allies mentors and networks because that is the only way that women graduating from the field can stay and strive in the industry.

Shakoor added that entrepreneurship is a male-dominated sector and that although female entrepreneurs have become more and more noticeable the most successful and biggest companies in the Kingdom were founded by men.

That is the case not because men are better than women but because men have their well-established communities she said.

In her own life Shakoor said that she did not always receive enough social trust and respect as an ambitious and successful entrepreneur.

Ultimate' Roster,"Nintendo has added Xenoblade‘s Pyra and Mythra to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate‘s expansive roster. The new character additions arrive just three months after Nintendo introduced Sephiroth to the title.

Mr. Sakurai Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. Ultimate director recently presented the characters in depth. The two characters will be playable as a single unit a duo officially billed as “Pyra/Mythra.” The characters work in tandem where you can switch between the two at any given time each with its own distinctive moves. Pyra deals greater damage while Mythra has moves that make it easier to launch your foes off the battle stage. Accompanying Pyra/Mythra is a new stage inspired by Xenoblade Chronicles 2 set on the back of Azurda a flying dragon.

This story originally ran on June 25 2018. We’ve republished it alongside our coverage of the newly-released Coming 2 America.

When the Eddie Murphy vehicle Coming to America landed in theaters 30 years ago it was received in much the same fashion as the comic superstar’s last few pictures (Eddie Murphy: Raw Beverly Hills Cop II The Golden Child) — big box office but middling reviews. A few noted that it marked something of a departure for Mr. Murphy playing a gentler character in what was as the studio’s press notes pointed out his first romantic comedy. But few could have predicted that the film would influence so much of what Murphy did in the years to follow — or the hold it would continue to have on contemporary audiences.

Murphy was the undisputed box office king of the 1980s propelling his explosive debut in 48 Hrs. into a series of wildly successful vehicles. He set himself up with an old-fashioned (and lucrative) studio contract at Paramount where he began to develop his own projects under the “Eddie Murphy Productions” banner. He devised the story to Coming to America (he said; more on that later) of an African prince looking for his queen in Queens New York as a chance to work with his pal Arsenio Hall who had just come to national prominence as Joan Rivers’s replacement host in the final weeks of her failed Fox talk show.

Screenplay duties were handed off to David Sheffield and Barry W. Blaustein who began writing for Murphy when he was on Saturday Night Live. And to direct Murphy brought in John Landis who helmed his early hit Trading Places. The intensity of the schedule (it began shooting six months before its summer release date) and the big egos involved did not by most accounts make for a harmonious set. “He directed me in Trading Places when I was just starting out as a kid but he was still treating me like a kid five years later during Coming to America” Murphy told Rolling Stone in 1989. “And I hired him to direct the movie!” Landis in a 2005 interview granted that Murphy had changed. “The guy on Trading Places was young and full of energy and curious and funny and fresh and great” he explained. “The guy on Coming to America was the pig of the world — the most unpleasant arrogant bullshit entourage just an asshole.”

But whatever the tensions on set the collaboration yielded rewards. Landis brought in Rick Baker the Oscar-winning makeup wizard whom he’d worked with on An American Werewolf in London and Michael Jackson’s Thriller video to design the elaborate prosthetics that allowed Murphy and Hall to each play multiple supporting roles — wild comic creations (in essence Saturday Night Live bits and characters) to offset their kinder gentler leads. Landis who had just read a book about Jewish comedians donning blackface in the vaudeville days suggested flipping the script. “Rick Baker can make you an old Jew” he told his star and Baker did — so successfully that when Paramount executives visited the set while Murphy was made up as “Saul” they didn’t recognize their studio’s biggest star.

Those pleasures were barely noted by mainstream critics when Coming to America was released in June. Time’s headline “The Taming of Eddie Murphy” was emblematic of the reviews — complaints abound that by casting Murphy as such a restrained character the film “seems designed to handcuff and gag the high-voltage outrageous comedian” as Stanley Kuffmann wrote in The New Republic. Never mind the outrageous comedy of the character vignettes or Murphy’s understandable desire to grow his screen persona. But audiences turned out in droves; it ended up banking a staggering $288 million in receipts (on a $35 million budget).

And then the lawsuits began. Five separate suits were filed by everyone from struggling screenwriters to an actual African prince (who claimed the film told the unauthorized story of his life) but the biggest name was political columnist Art Buchwald who said he sold Paramount a Murphy-targeted treatment called King for a Day in 1983. His $5 million breach of contract suit would dominate entertainment journalism for years not only for the sensational claims of plagiarism but for the subsequent exposure of “Hollywood math” that would lead Paramount to claim when the court ruled in Buchwald’s favor that the $288 million grosser had somehow not shown a profit. (The tabloids meanwhile had a field day reporting Murphy’s lavish weekly expenditures during production including $3800 for his custom motor home $1500 for his personal trainer $650 for his valet $5000 for a weekly “living allowance” and $235 for a single McDonald’s breakfast for the star and his entourage.) After the court ruled in Buchwald’s favor Paramount appealed then finally settled the suit in 1995.

Beyond questions of authorship another quiet controversy haunted Coming to America in 1988 — a question of representation. In a New York Amsterdam News editorial (later republished presumably for the benefit of white readers in the Village Voice) Ali Rashid Abdullah wrote that “voices from the African-American community have predictably taken positions pro and con in relation to the imaging of African-Americans as well as Africans in Coming to America” specifically regarding the scenes in Prince Akeem’s native Zamunda. Abdullah asked pointedly “Does Murphy help perpetuate a negative image of Africa — for the sake of a few laughs — at a time when blacks are beginning to identify with their African roots?”

In the New York Sun noted bomb-thrower Armond White took it further calling Coming to America “a betrayal of every instance of politics history sex and ethnic culture Black people have ever known.” White’s review was so over-the-top that it prompted Murphy to respond issuing a statement in a paid advertisement in the Sun finding “the lack of charity on the part of this black man for another black man’s life and work to be puzzling superficial uniquely vicious and deserving a public response.”

In retrospect what’s truly baffling about White’s broadside is how thoroughly it glosses over what was in fact revolutionary about Coming to America in the arc of Murphy’s career. White writes “There’s ethnic self-loathing and humiliation throughout Coming to America. Murphy’s consciousness is the kind that is completely detached from political action …. Black politics Black consciousness has never figured in the plots of Murphy’s movies but his comic’s acumen uses the idea of Black awareness in order to seem truly Black up to date.”

There is a kernel of truth in the latter point — Murphy’s films were not to this point about black people. His debut 48 Hrs. was at its essence the story of a hip fast-talking black dude who was the smartest guy in a room full of white people and that’s a pretty apt description of Trading Places Beverly Hills Cop and Beverly Hills Cop II as well. As his power and bankability increased and as his involvement in the development of his pictures became more hands-on Murphy got a fair amount of flak for not creating opportunities for other African-Americans; most notably this was the subject of a long-running feud between Murphy and Spike Lee who told Jet magazine “If Eddie Murphy who made a billion dollars for Paramount went into their offices and said ‘I ain’t making any more films until you hire some Black people in your front office’ they would have to do it. I hope he’ll use his clout rather than focus on who gets the best table at Spago’s.”

Murphy pushed back against this criticism — “[The] company is called Paramount not Eddie Murphy Productions” he told Rolling Stone. “I can’t walk into the studio’s front offices and demand shit: ‘Hire some black people here!’” — but even a cursory glance at his filmography shows a course correction that began in 1988. Even Lee noticed it; in the introduction to his Do the Right Thing companion book the following year he acknowledged Coming to America as “a serious move by Eddie Murphy to do a film by and about Black people.” (More than that it was a movie that didn’t make a big deal about its blackness; as Landis recalled “I realized this is an opportunity to do something really important that nobody will notice… It was so successful; no one ever refers to that as an African-American movie. Ever. Yet it has three speaking parts for white people. Every other speaking role is an African-American.”)

So Murphy did in fact create opportunities in the process — America sports early appearances by Samuel L. Jackson Eriq La Salle and (if you look closely) Cuba Gooding Jr. Immediately thereafter Murphy wrote produced directed and starred in Harlem Nights a film stocked with African-American showbiz legends and up-and-comers. Three years later he reteamed with screenwriters Blaustein and Sheffield for Boomerang romantic comedy with a nearly all-black ensemble cast. And in the years that followed he alternated Beverly Hills Cop–style action flicks with Coming to America–ish black-oriented multi-role comedies like The Nutty Professor Vampire in Brooklyn and Norbit.

Yet Coming to America stands tallest boosted to this day by its memorable characters and meme-friendly dialogue and costumes (witness the flurry of moviegoers hitting Black Panther’s opening weekend in both Wakandan and Zamundan duds). By any reasonable definition its standing today is less that of a studio comedy than a cult movie — though that term has been appropriated by white bro-movie culture to films like Fight Club The Big Lebowski and (God help us) Boondock Saints that dominate midnight-movie bookings and retro screenings.

But it has the cultural ubiquity and endless quotability of a great cult movie — and something else besides. What binds the best cult films is a uniquely personal perspective and again one doesn’t think of a big-time ’80s Eddie Murphy movie as particularly personal. Yet from its opening scenes in which Murphy’s Prince Akeem is awakened by a string ensemble bathed by beautiful women and escorted on rose petals everywhere he goes America is satirizing the popular perception of Murphy’s lavish lifestyle (a perception all but confirmed by the receipts read in the Buchwald trial). Writing in the short-lived New York magazine 7 Days Louis Menand took the allegory further: “It’s the story of a man who lives in a fantasy world where every desire is satisfied and where everyone loves him. But he fears for his true self the man he was before his wealth and success and he dreams of returning to the mean streets of his beginnings and discovering his true soul’s companion. He doesn’t want the mean streets though he wants the royal palace; and when he finds his soulmate that is where he expects to return. Wealth will then be a just reward — the reward for being true to himself.

“Zamunda in short is Hollywood and Akeem is Eddie Murphy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc3R5bGUvcnV0aC1jYXJ0ZXJzLWdsb2JhbC1wYXJhZGUtb2YtZ29yZ2VvdXMtY29zdHVtZXMtZm9yLWNvbWluZy0yLWFtZXJpY2EtNDE0MTQ1NC_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9zdHlsZS9ydXRoLWNhcnRlcnMtZ2xvYmFsLXBhcmFkZS1vZi1nb3JnZW91cy1jb3N0dW1lcy1mb3ItY29taW5nLTItYW1lcmljYS00MTQxNDU0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ruth Carter’s Global Parade of ‘Gorgeous’ Costumes for ‘Coming 2 America’,"No stranger to designing looks for fictional African royalty with the exotic Black Panther’s Wakanda costume designer Ruth. E. Carter was the first person who director Craig Brewer called about creating the stylish world for the new film Coming 2 America out this weekend on Amazon Prime Video.

“In a way we both had a similar challenge. How do we update the style and culture of Zamunda while preserving the look and themes of the original?” says Brewer who previously worked with Carter on Dolemite is My Name.

“This conversation led to the creation of my favorite costume accessory for King Akeem [Eddie Murphy]. Borrowing from the style of King Jaffe Joffer in the first film we replaced the real lion head and skin draped around James Earl Jones and turned it into a large golden broach that held his cape in place. Ruth brought up the point that Akeem has three daughters and they would be against wearing real fur.”

Carter’s solution was to modernize the opulent creations from the 1988 original noting “We know a lot more than we did 30 years ago about Africa and needed to be a little more sophisticated in Zamunda. I came up with a Zamundan story while sharing the beauty and pageantry the first film offered.”

The modern styles created by Carter for Coming 2 America translated into “large-scale beautiful African prints” and “gorgeous shapes” as the designer looked to fashion on a global scale.

“Zamunda had a world view and the Queen in the first film wore an Indian sari. When we see Lisa [Shari Headley] in the current film at the dining table having dinner with Mary Junson and her son Lavelle [Leslie Jones and Jermaine Fowler] she too is in a sari. I brought in India and mixed it with African symbols and they made it their own” Carter tells The Hollywood Reporter.

The Oscar-winning costume designer worked with more than three dozens designers on the film looking to African and African American creatives such as Palesa Mokubung of Mantsho House of Deola Ikire Jones and custom jewels from Khiry TruFaceByGrace Aphia Sakyi and Sewit Sium with traditional gems from Bulgari and Swarovski.

One of the film’s show-stopping dresses is from designer Laurel Dewitt known as the “Queen of Chain and Metal” who made a highly creative solid-metal dress that is worn by General Izzi’s [Wesley Snipes] daughter. Indian influences were incorporated with pieces by New Delhi designer JJ Valaya who is known as the “Monarch of Indian fashion” for his hand embroideries and embellishments. “I was all over the world on this project” says Carter.

Dressing for both comedy and the continuity of returning beloved characters was also taken into consideration. With Akeem and Seemi (Arsenio Hall) maturing some 30 years the custom looks were made with stately royal fabrics such as velvets and silks in leafy patterns and embellished with an embroidered family crest.

Costumes took a comic turn for Leslie Jones who we see in all kinds of colors and shapes and outlandish details like the fringe on her turban. Jones also wears a stunning high-jewelry Serpenti diamond necklace by Bulgari. “I wanted to stay in the world of comedy make it very colorful and keep people happy and laughing. At times it was hard and felt like maybe I went too far over the top. Once the actors got into it they carried it so well and made it okay to be daring and think outside the box. The actors took it to a higher frequency of humor and I thought what was I worried about?!” says Carter.

Of the film’s 800-plus costumes standouts include a wedding dress created by Cameroon-born designer Claude Kameni of Los Angeles-based Lavie by CK (who dressed Viola Davis for the 2021 Golden Globes). “We have a moment that celebrated a glorious wedding gown with one of the largest trains I have ever seen” notes Brewer. “It was so massive that we had to install two rolling dollies under the train just so the actress could pull it up.”

For KiKi Layne‘s Meeka Carter favored sport looks created by Marusya Kazakova of Brooklyn-based brand Jahnkoy. “The leisurewear shows how you can be athletic feminine and pretty and wear cool sneakers” she details.

Carter’s work also included dressing the barbershop uniform-clad My-T-Sharp crew and the multi-color attired McDowell employees. “I also loved these Congolese historic etchings of fancy haircuts.

Famous venture capitalist and silicon valley entrepreneur Peter Thiel says investors shouldn’t be too dependent on investment decisions based on formulas. Instead they should look for companies that do things differently through disruptive business models.Thiel believes these companies have the ability to find value in places that other people might not notice. Thiel feels to achieve investing success investors shouldn’t wait to think big; they should look for high-growth businesses in new industries.Peter Thiel is the co-founder of PayPal and Palantir and was also an early investor in Facebook. He also made early-stage investments in LinkedIn Yelp Lyft Asana Yammer and many other successful technology companies. He is well known for his business and investing acumen which has put him in the same league as the top investors of the world.Born in Frankfurt West Germany in 1967 Thiel was very good in mathematics. He studied Philosophy at Stanford University and also served as the Editor-in-Chief of the. He remained the editor till he completed his Bachelor in Arts degree in 1989. He then enrolled in Stanford Law School and earned his Doctor of Jurisprudence degree in 1992.Thiel says investors should pick the most successful businesses which are monopolies as they combine proprietary technology with network effects economies of scale and branding.“In the real world outside of economic theory every business is successful exactly to the extent that it does something that others cannot do. Monopoly is therefore not a pathology or an exception. Monopoly is the condition of every successful business” he wrote in his hugely popular bookThiel says today's largest tech giants began their business journeys as startups. The secret behind their rise was their ability to identify and eventually dominate an emerging market with little to no competition.“The most successful companies make the core progression – to first dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent markets – a part of their founding narrative” he says.Thiel attributes the success of companies like PayPal to their ability to start small in an untapped market.Giving the example of Paypal he says the company started its business by playing in small niches and then perfecting its product before moving into other adjacent areas to dominate the markets.Paypal gained traction by getting in touch with E-bay auction customers who were a small but important niche that dealt in high-volume transactions. The company then moved outside this small niche by reaching out to non-auction customers and offered them attractive incentives. Once the company got acquired by E-bay itself it moved to other niches like online music providers and convinced credit card gateway providers to include them on their platforms.“Focus on a small niche helps a company avoid excessive competition while learning valuable lessons without endangering their survival. This is no different in the public market spheres where a company establishes dominance in a product category before making ‘bolt on’ acquisitions to widen its dominance” says he.In his book Thiel lists out a few tips for investors to achieve long-term investing success.An investor has to find value in unexpected places by looking at principles of a business rather than using formulas to pick potential investment bets. He says investors often make the mistake of judging companies solely on their results.“It is important to look for the principles a company follows before looking at anything else. Companies with strong and ethical principles are a good bets to invest in” he says.Thiel says it is important for investors to conduct thorough research about a business before investing in it to ensure that they are able to pick quality stocks. He advises investors to look at the strength of the balance sheet sound dividend policy and returns of a business to ensure that they pick the right stocks for investment.“Look at its principles but more importantly look at the quality of the business. Companies with strong balance sheets can stand strong amid adverse conditions. If a company has a history of growing dividend payout you can consider it a quality bet” says he.Thiel believes investors should take the art of investing seriously and it should be the most important task they should focus on in their priority list.If one shows huge passion and determination while investing one is bound to earn huge profits in the long run. “Investment is not an activity to do on the sideline of your life cycle. It should be one of the most important tasks to focus on. The culture today does encourage us to do things we love but sometimes it could be unprofitable. Investment is an activity that can bring huge profit if done with passion and dedication. It does not matter what you do as long as you do it well” he says.Investors should not have a casual approach towards investing as it may lead to losses. Thiel feels one should pay great attention to growing companies and invest in them. Also he is a great believer of investing in venture-backed firms.“One of the major mistakes one can commit as an investor is to have a casual approach towards investing. Don’t make the mistake of underestimating the power of diverse portfolios in growing companies. It is important to pay attention to growing companies and invest in them” he says.Thiel says there is no point in being contrarian for the sake of being contrarian. Only the truly independent thinking investor or entrepreneur can find market opportunities that turn into wealth generators. Thiel feels investors should have clarity in thoughts and base their decisions on facts and reasoning.There is a huge difference between creating value and actually capturing it. Thiel feels companies operating under perfect competition-like conditions do not capture most of the value they create and hence investors should be careful while investing in such companies.On the other hand monopoly businesses both create and capture value and hence should be first on the investor's radar.Thiel says in order to find a ‘monopoly business’ investors need to find businesses with a solid moat.Such businesses can be identified…Investors make the mistake of having a short-term focus on investing which can derail any effort towards building long-term durability.Thiel’s success as an investor seems to come from following many of the same principles that have made Warren Buffett successful which includes independent thinking or focusing on “monopoly businesses” which is just another term for companies with moats.Thiel advocates having a single-minded focus on very few companies that can become extremely valuable over time versus the ‘spray and pray’ approach that most other ordinary investors follow to achieve mediocre results.Zero to One",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3NlbnRpYWxseXNwb3J0cy5jb20vbm1wbG9sLWFuZC1tYWxlbmEtZXhwbGFpbi1ob3ctc29kYXBvcHBpbi1nb3Qtcm9iYmVkLW9mLTI1MDAwLWJ5LWEtdHdpdGNoLXN0cmVhbWVyLWluLTIwMTUtZXNwb3J0cy1uZXdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nmplol and Malena Explain How Sodapoppin Got Robbed of $25000 by a Twitch Streamer in 2015,"Internet celebrities and streamers are no strangers to scams happening on the World Wide Web. Many fans and creators have noticed many of them falling prey to it. Along with that many have also seen these creators actively take part in it to fool the viewers. But Twitch streamer Sodapoppin takes the cake for being robbed in one of the strangest ways possible.

During a recent stream content creator and friend Nmplol explained how Sodapoppin lost $250000. Other than that his girlfriend Malena also joined in to describe how their roommate got scammed by a fellow Twitch streamer in 2015.

Sodapoppin scammed of $25000 in 2015

While driving with LegendaryLea Malena and Nmplol talked about the scam that their friend Chance “Sodapoppin” Morris fell into in 2015. At the time Chance was possibly the biggest creator on Twitch where he raked in thousands of views. But Nmplol stated that his roommate also fell into trouble when he got scammed of $25000.

Malena explained how a Twitch streamer robbed him and acted like nothing happened. In 2015 Nmplol tweeted about it and stated that a streamer by the name of MatthewJK stole from his friend. But yesterday was the first time that someone explained how it happened. In the stream Malena noted that MatthewJK even paid for a dinner for them with the stolen money.

“A dude literally came over and stole from Chance then paid for our dinner and said that he paid for it. But it was actually out of Chance’s pocket.”

How Chance lost money as explained by Nmplol and Malena

Later on in the stream Nmplol explained how Sodapoppin lost 25 grand from his account to MatthewJK. He mentioned that the streamer had paid himself the money using Chance’s PayPal. Nmplol said that he got the details when Sodapoppin logged into his Paypal account using Matthew’s iPad which saved it.

“Chance at one point logged into his iPad on his PayPal and it saved it.”

The crew had all the details and evidences to press charges but they couldn’t do anything about it. Nmplol talked about how expensive it became to take legal action as it had become a Federal issue because MatthewJK went back home.

“He want back home so it became a Federal issue and then it cost more time and more money.”

In the end Sodapoppin never got his $25000 back. He has rarely talked about the issue on his stream and it’s clear to see that he never took legal action. He never got to press charges on MatthewJK and it’s a shame that he had to go through this.

Don’t let unrealistic expectations bu,"Indra Nooyi the first woman CEO of PepsiCo and an epitome of success for millions of women across the globe claimed in an interview once; “I don’t think women can have it all. I just don’t think so. We pretend we have it all. We pretend we can have it all.” Along similar lines in a 2016 article titled ‘No women can’t have it all’ Anne-Marie Slaughter a renowned American international lawyer talked about the challenges she faced when balancing professional success with familial responsibilities and why she could not have it all.

As evident then ‘having it all’ is a phrase used exclusively in the context of women who juggle a professional career (typically a high-paying and respectable one) with a family without having to sacrifice one for another. It is often seen as an ideal that all women aspire to and only a select few can accomplish and the two most important variables that go into achieving this ideal are ‘a great family’ and ‘a great career’. Such a formulation of ‘having it all’ for women is deeply problematic for several reasons.

First if you are a single woman a single mother a childfree married woman or a homemaker then based on this definition you do not have a shot at having it all. This is an immensely reductive definition of success which essentially works by exclusion. For instance according to Gallup world poll data aggregated from 2014-20 23% of the world’s female population is currently married without any children 16% is single and 13% are single mothers. So are we to assume that these women who comprise 52% of the world’s female population can’t have it all until they get married and/ or have children?

If ‘having it all’ refers to a woman’s happiness and well-being then why can’t a single woman a single mother a childfree woman or a homemaker be seen as having it all? More so because the existing research about the correlation between happiness and working full time with a family for women is at best contradictory.

A 2019 study carried out by a group of researchers from the University of Manchester and the University of Essex revealed that women with two children who are working full time are on average 40% more stressed out than those who are single but also working full time. It is quite plausible then that a single woman who works part-time has a more fulfilling and satisfying life than one who is married has children and works a high-powered corporate job. The former could be spending her time reading books travelling and gaining new experiences while the latter could be enmeshed in an endless quagmire of phone calls household concerns and business conferences.

The point being that there is no single definition of happiness and success and they mean different things for different people. The reductive notion that only women who have both a career and a family can be considered as successful and/ or happy ignores the complexity of human personalities and desires. Also it is heteronormative to the core.

If you are a single professional woman then to ‘have it all’ you need to have a partner and subsequently children. And if you are a married woman with a career then ‘having it all’ becomes a patriarchal shorthand for ‘doing it all’ especially if you have limited access to childcare or are still climbing the professional ladder. It implies that you need to excel at your workplace then be back in time go on playdates with your children and follow it up by reading bedtime stories as you tuck them in bed. Unrealistic expectations like these set working mothers up for disappointment and guilt and any rational person should be able to see through the exploitative intent of such a formulation of a successful woman.

Unfortunately not only are such unrealistic expectations from professional women accepted within society they are glorified. There is no glory in drudgery and that is exactly what ‘having it all’ encompasses for a regular middle-class woman who wishes to climb the professional ladder while managing a family.

Therefore it is high time that we redefine the notion of ‘having it all’ for women to make it more inclusive and kinder. Such a redefinition should ensure that every woman on the planet whether trans disabled cis-gendered straight homosexual single married childfree old widowed divorced and so on has a reasonable shot at achieving it. And the only way to do it would be to let each woman decide for herself her definition of having it all.

Doing this would provide society with myriad definitions of ‘having it all’ and pose a daunting challenge to apologists of patriarchy who want professional women to believe that to be happy they need a family. It would also undercut the notion held by those among feminists who believe that the only way for a woman to have an enriching life is to climb the professional ladder.

So for all the women reading this chances are you already have it all but even if you feel you don’t make sure that you define it for yourself rather than letting society do it for you. And once you do that you will realise that having it all is not as challenging as it is made out to be and the journey towards achieving it will be just as beautiful and enriching as the goal.

But there is still hope that we may be rediscovering the lost virtue of achieving more with less waste.

While the pandemic has battered many it is also reshaping the socio-economic landscape in most countries. Many are beginning to see the more beneficial aspects of embracing the simplicity of their newfound thrifty lifestyles. There are of course some misconceptions of what frugality really involves.

Unfortunately for some frugality is not a lifestyle choice because they are forced to live frugally due to circumstances. The working poor are a reality that exposes the unfairness of many aspects of our society. But choosing to live a frugal life can also be an inherently positive decision that is not based on money.

Frugality does not mean that you have to deprive yourself of everything that brings joy to your life. It certainly is not about the monastic version of poverty. It certainly does not mean always buying the cheapest things. If you want value for money it often makes more sense to buy a good reliable car that will last you 10 to 15 years rather than opt for an old second-hand banger about to give up its soul.

Those who belong to a generation that felt blessed in their youth if they owned a decent pair of shoes and a smart suit for special occasions fail to understand while younger people are so obsessed with wearing branded clothes.

Our consumerist society wants us to believe that we are what we buy. Consumerism brainwashes us into believing that everything we purchase and own sends a message to the world about who we are and the values we hold. For instance owning an over-specified luxury car for use on our congested road system hardly adds any value to your time management. It probably adds to your frustration when trying to park it when going for a meeting.

Frugality forces us to appreciate the fact that we are not what we own. People who adopt a frugal lifestyle do not look for external affirmation of personal wealth

The rediscovery of frugality helps us to build self-discipline. Learning to control your spending is one way you can develop your self-discipline. Many have lost the ability to distinguish between wants and needs. Postponing those wants until they are affordable is a mark of a real and mature person.

Frugality also makes us more self-reliant. As the future especially for younger people looks increasingly uncertain because of the multitude of challenges that our society faces feeling financially independent boosts your self-respect.

Not so long ago fathers used to pass down their sons skills like building a workbench fixing a leaking tap and painting their rooms. Mothers passed similar housekeeping skills to their daughters. Unfortunately today we see much less of these intergenerational skills transfers.

Businesses are also beginning to understand this slow shift to consumers embracing frugality as a chosen lifestyle. Consumers are slowly shifting their perspective on frugality. In a 2020 US survey 67 per cent of Americans considered being called frugal a complement while 65 per cent claimed the pandemic has transformed them into a more frugal person.

To engage frugal consumers companies are revaluating their business models.

As a result of the global recession a McKinsey’s research in the US found that one-fifth of consumers traded down to lower-priced brands and 46 per cent were pleasantly surprised by the quality of cheaper goods.

Major multinationals like Nestlé PepsiCo and Kellogg’s are now focusing on reducing their core products’ assortment to roll out more affordable offerings. Ikea is now offering spare parts for those clients who would rather fix their broken furniture than buy new replacements. Microbusinesses who invariably rely on lean management systems have shed fewer low-income jobs than the larger businesses during the pandemic.

The frugal life is not the cheap life. It is about being mindful of where your money is going. It is about worrying less about how you will survive if your financial situation suddenly deteriorates for whatever reason.

Frugality forces us to appreciate the fact that we are not what we own. People who adopt a frugal lifestyle do not look for external affirmation of personal worth. They look within themselves and understand that what makes them better people is not the paraphernalia of wealth but the moral strength of always seeking to do what is right.

IANSlife caught up with the star to talk about the shoot her days in lockdown and what she’s looking forward to in 2021.

Q: How does it feel to be back to work after months of lockdown? A: As much as I have learnt and grown internally during the lockdown I really did miss the hustle and bustle of my job. While the lockdown was critical at that point I made sure I spent quality time on things I rarely get to do but now that work has gradually begun with all the necessary precautions I cannot be happier. The joy of filming is irreplaceable.

Q: Do you feel there is a difference between shooting in a pre and in a post-Covid world? A: There surely is a difference as maintaining social distancing and various other precautionary norms are a must unlike before. But all the sets I’ve been on have made sure that the crews’ safety is a priority which makes it a very safe working place giving us artists the creative liberty needed.

Q: International travel is on standstill… did you manage to take a holiday or a getaway and how was it? A: I actually made a trip to Maldives during the pandemic for the shoot of Slice’s new ‘Sabse Thick Sabse Tasty’ campaign. I had mixed feeling when I was getting ready for the trip — on one hand I was excited about the shoot post the lockdown and on the other hand I was nervous about travelling in the ‘new normal’ and ensured I took all the right precautions throughout the trip — COVID tests ensuring social distancing using face masks.

Among the biggest winners will be Moderna and Pfizer – two very different US pharma firms which are both charging more than $30 per person for the protection of their two-dose vaccines. While Moderna was founded just 11 years ago has never made a profit and employed just 830 staff pre-pandemic Pfizer traces its roots back to 1849 made a net profit of $9.6bn last year and employs nearly 80000 staff.

But other drugmakers such as the British-Swedish AstraZeneca and the US pharma Johnson & Johnson have pledged to provide their vaccines on a not-for-profit basis until the pandemic comes to an end.

Whether the market remains a money-spinner in the future depends on whether the vaccines become the type that need just a one-off shot – as for measles – or if regular vaccinations will be required such as for flu. But in the immediate future there are big financial returns up for grabs.

Here we look at who is in line for the biggest gains – and which shareholders have already made fortunes.

1 Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine

Pfizer’s Comirnaty vaccine developed with Germany’s BioNTech is based on re-engineered messenger RNA – the molecule that sends genetic instructions from DNA to a cell’s protein-making machinery. It was the first to be approved and has to be stored at ultra-low temperatures (-70C). Governments have ordered about 780m shots including the US (200m doses for $3.9bn) and the EU commission (300m) while 40m doses will go to lower-income nations via the Covax facility. It costs $39 (£28) for two doses in the US and about $30 in the EU.

Expected sales in 2021: $15bn-$30bn

Pfizer which splits costs and profit margins equally with BioNTech expects $15bn in 2021 sales based on current deals. The final number could be twice as high as Pfizer says it can potentially deliver 2bn doses this year. Barclays analyst Carter Gould is predicting sales of $21.5bn in 2021 $8.6bn next year and $1.95bn in 2023 on the assumption that the jab is given as a one-off shot.

Share price change over the past 12 months

Pfizer: +1.8%

BioNTech: +156%

The two founders of BioNTech the husband and wife team Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci – both doctors – became multibillionaires last year when the potential of the vaccine and the deal with Pfizer prompted the shares to surge.

2 Moderna mRNA vaccine

The vaccine produced by the US biotech firm based in Massachusetts must be stored at freezer temperature (-20C). The UK has ordered 17m doses the EU bought 310m with an option for a further 150m in 2022 while the US government ordered 300m shots. Japan purchased 50m shots. Moderna charges $30 for the required two shots in the US and $36 in the EU.

Expected sales in 2021: $18bn-$20bn

Moderna has said it expects 2021 sales of $18.4bn. Barclays analyst Gena Wang forecasts sales of $19.6bn $12.2bn in 2022 and $11.4bn in 2023 assuming recurring vaccinations.

Share price change over past 12 months

+372%

A group of investors that backed the company when it was founded in 2010 will have made substantial returns. The chief executive Stéphane Bancel a 48-year-old French executive owns 9% of the shares now worth nearly $5bn.

3 Johnson & Johnson Adenovirus vaccine

J&J’s jab the world’s first single-shot Covid-19 vaccine was developed by its Janssen division in Belgium. It uses adenovirus-26 a rare variant of cold virus. It was approved in the US in late February and can be stored at standard fridge temperatures for at least three months. Big orders include the US UK (30m doses plus option for 22m) the EU (up to 400m doses) and Covax nations (500m doses through 2022).

Expected sales in 2021: up to $10bn

The company aims to deliver at least 1bn doses this year which would generate $10bn. The US government has ordered 100m doses with the option to buy 200m more and is paying $10 a shot.

Share price change over past 12 months

+7.7%

4 AstraZeneca Adenovirus vector vaccine

The vaccine developed with Oxford University uses a modified chimpanzee cold virus and can be kept at fridge temperature. Viral vector vaccines use a harmless virus to deliver a piece of genetic code to cells. Big orders have come from the UK (100m) the EU (up to 400m) the US (300m) and Japan (£120m).

Expected sales in 2021: $2bn-$3bn

Analysts at SVB Leerink are forecasting sales of $1.9bn this year and $3bn in 2022. The 2021 figure could be far higher if AstraZeneca achieves its ambitious target of 3bn doses. The company has pledged to supply the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis during this pandemic and charges $4.30 to $10 for two doses.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and his entourage postponed a trip to Israel because they're not yet fully vaccinated against COVID-19 local reports said.

On Friday The Jerusalem Post and The Times of Israel reported that local TV news station Channel 12 News said the chief executive's planned Israel trip was pushed back because Bourla wasn't yet fully vaccinated.

The reports said Bourla and some members of the team had received their first COVID-19 vaccine shots but not their second dose.

More than 3.6 million people in Israel have been fully vaccinated according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University of Medicine.

About 41.1% of Israel's population have been fully vaccinated putting Israel far ahead of most other countries. In the US for example about 8.8% of people have been fully vaccinated according to Johns Hopkins.

Last month two Israel studies showed that Pfizer's vaccine reduced transmission in real-world situations Reuters reported.

Bourla's trip to Israel was scheduled to begin on March 8 about two weeks before an upcoming election according to The Times of Israel. At least one local watchdog group had urged government officials to push the trip back saying that it could have benefited the re-election campaign of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the outlet reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZlcnl3ZWxsaGVhbHRoLmNvbS9zaW5nbGUtZG9zZS1jb3ZpZC0xOS12YWNjaW5lLTUxMTQ4NzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is a Single Dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine Enough?,"Key Takeaways Some health experts are advocating for a single-dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine when supplies are low or limited instead of completing the recommended two-dose regimen.

Data on efficacy however is based on clinical trials so more research is needed before health officials make a switch on dosing.

A single dose could possibly benefit people who have already contracted COVID-19 acting as a sort of ""booster"" shot.

As the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues to lag behind ideal numbers around the world some health experts are looking at the potential for giving a single dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines instead of the two-dose regimen.

Two Canadian doctors recently made the argument that the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine is effective enough to warrant a single-dose regimen when communities have a limited supply of the shots. Their letter published in mid-February when Canada was experiencing a delay in vaccine shipments states that the vaccine had an efficacy of 92.6% beginning two weeks after the first dose and before the second was administered. The authors based their analysis on documents Pfizer submitted to the FDA.

They pointed out that this high efficacy was similar to the first-dose efficacy of Moderna’s mRNA vaccine which came in at 92.1%.

Reports initially published by Pfizer found the vaccine was 52% effective between the first and second dose. The letter authors say this calculation included data collected during the first two weeks after the initial dose and that herd immunity would have still been mounting during this time. If you measure first dose efficacy starting two weeks after vaccination numbers improve significantly.

“With such a highly protective first dose the benefits derived from a scarce supply of vaccine could be maximized by deferring second doses until all priority group members are offered at least one dose” the authors wrote of the Pfizer vaccine.

They’re not the only ones who have suggested distributing single doses first instead of ensuring everyone have access to the two-dose regimen as intended. And while Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) hasn't gone as far as suggesting a single dose is all you need it does recommend extending the window between doses to four months for all three of its currently approved vaccines: Pfizer Moderna and AstraZeneca. NACI says one dose of a vaccine is still effective during this time and such an approach would get more people vaccinated faster.

What We Know About Using a Single Dose

The U.K.'s public health authority published findings that suggest a single shot of the Pfizer vaccine can cut hospitalizations in adults by around 80% three to four weeks after the shot. The U.K. has delayed giving second doses to citizens in order to give more people a single jab first.

Research out of Israel published in The Lancet found that the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was 85% effective two to three weeks after a single dose. Another study found that after one dose of the vaccine between days 14 to 20 it offered 57% effectiveness for symptomatic COVID-19 74% for hospitalization and 62% for severe disease.

So does the high efficacy of Pfizer’s vaccine mean that it is time to allow a single dose? In certain circumstances possibly Vanessa Raabe MD an infectious diseases specialist at the NYU Langone Vaccine Center in New York tells Verywell but it’s too soon to roll out this strategy.

“Our data on how well this works is so limited” Raabe says. “Studies that have been done for a single dose were not done in a clinical trial; they were done in a real-world setting and only looked really at the first few weeks after the first vaccine dose.”

This means what happens in the months following a single dose and how well protection lasts is not known. What we do know is how much protection is offered after the two-dose regimen that was studied in clinical trials she says.

“I think the data out there certainly makes it worth investigating further—I think it's a promising signal and it needs some follow up—but I have a little bit of caution relying on the limited data we have for that [single dose] compared to the nine months or so of data that we have on the two-dose regimen” Raabe says.

What This Means For You If you've received a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine you likely already have some protection against the virus. But at this time the U.S. government is not recommending receiving a single dose of either vaccine. Getting your second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is imperative for achieving high immunity levels and protecting yourself.

A Single Dose May Benefit Some

That being said there are possibly some circumstances where a single dose may prove to be beneficial. France recently said that a single dose of an mRNA vaccine like the Pfizer or Moderna options may work for people previously infected with COVID-19.

People previously infected likely have some immunity and the single dose can act as additional protection or a “booster.”

Raabe says for patients who recovered from COVID-19 a single dose may be warranted if access to both doses is in short supply. She says there are a number of preprint papers from different groups showing that people who had COVID-19 show immune responses after a single dose that are at least as high—if not higher—than people who have not had COVID-19.

“This is all based on antibody [data] and data from the immune response rather than actual efficacy data which takes a much longer time” Raabe says. “You have to study a much larger group for a much longer time to know but just looking at purely the immune responses…based off of the data that's available it would be something to think about as a reasonable strategy.”

Further Muddling Vaccine Rollout

Timothy C. Y. Chan PhD a professor of industrial engineering at the University of Toronto and the Canada research chair in Novel Optimization and Analytics in Health tells Verywell that a single dose of mRNA vaccines is an idea “worth exploring” when supplies are limited or supply chains are interrupted.

Still it’s not a one-size-fits-all approach and there are logistical issues to consider. A regimen that differs from the one laid out by the vaccine manufacturer could add a level of confusion or disorganization to vaccine efforts he says.

“It does add a bit of an additional challenge when we're thinking about keeping track of who already has had one dose and making sure they come back…to get the second one” he says. “What if someone misses their [second] appointment and they come back a week later and say ‘Oh I'd like my shot now.’? You'd have to decide do you give it to this person? Or do you give it to the person who's getting their first shot?”

Logistical issues aside Raabe says a short delay between the recommended timing between the first and second dose of the Pfizer vaccine may not be cause for major concern but pushing weeks or months out? It’s too early to tell what effects that may have. We don’t have good data for what happens when you significantly delay the second dose she says.

“But one of the positive things about what we’re seeing from single-dose studies is that for the people who maybe had side effects from their first dose who aren't getting their second dose of the vaccine they probably have some protection” she says. “How long does that last compared to the two doses? We don't know. But I think it’s reassuring…that you probably still have some partial protection.”

Above All the Vaccines are Safe

The important message that Raabe says shouldn't get lost in larger conversations around dosing is how safe and important the vaccines are. Without them we cannot combat COVID-19 and end the pandemic.

“The vaccine trial process for these [COVID-19 vaccines]—even though the timeframe has gone by quickly—is exactly the same as what we would do in clinical trials for all the other vaccines” she says.

“There are so many layers of safety protection built-in including all the protocols that are done and in the U.S. vaccines also have to be approved by the FDA"" she says. ""They work very well and we are in a public health emergency.”

One of the brightest was Keyonte George the rookie out of Baylor who burst onto the scene from day one and seized the Jazz starting point guard role.

It’s hard to expect any more from the 20-year-old who was taken with the 16th pick in last summer's draft. George averaged 13.0 points 4.4 assists and 2.8 rebounds per game for the Jazz. Those numbers were good for fourth in scoring and second in total assists amongst all rookies this year. The passing in particular was a lot better than advertised after not being asked to do much of that while at Baylor.

George’s scoring remains the most intriguing piece of his game. He recorded three games in which he scored over 30 points and went over 20 points in nine others. When he’s playing confidently he can get buckets from all three levels and has plenty of juice from long-range. On February 15 George etched his name into the record books when he knocked down nine three-pointers which tied him for the rookie record and put him all alone for Jazz rookies.

An underrated storyline from the season was the leadership role the rookie took on as the season progressed. Jazz head coach Will Hardy thrust him into the starting point guard role early on and along with this came added responsibility- a responsibility that George seemed comfortable with. Heading into his first full offseason George will have even more of an opportunity to be a leader for this Jazz team that is looking to improve.

Despite all the positives it wasn’t a perfect season for George. He like the Jazz's other guards struggled with efficiency. There was a point in the middle of March where George seemed to have figured out how to get to his spots and score more efficiently but those numbers dipped as his teammates missed games and his name became more prominent on opposing scouting reports. Judging by his end-of-season comments he’s not worried about the misses. George said getting stronger and in better shape would result in the shots falling at a higher clip.

Defensively George is still a work in progress. Although his length stands out there's still plenty of room to grow. He has enough size to play either backcourt position which he used to showcase some nice individual defensive sequences. His off-ball awareness needs to improve as does his general focus on that end but he certainly has the potential to be a fine defender in this league.

One area where George can improve is in his words emotional intelligence. He’s immensely talented but he needs to keep his head up when he misses a shot or makes a silly turnover. He’s young though and there’s so much good that it’s hard to dwell on the bad.

Overall it was a very promising season for George. He’ll head into a big offseason with a lot to learn but a great foundation of skills & intelligence to build on. In a postgame press conference Hardy said that Keyonte could become the future of the Jazz program. That is high praise from his head coach but it is certainly a quote that should make you feel good as a Jazz fan.

Point guard Deivon Smith is transferring to St. John's from Utah giving Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino a veteran replacement for Daniss Jenkins next season.

A fifth-year senior Smith ranked sixth in the country with 7.1 assists per game last season. He averaged 13.3 points and 6.3 rebounds for the Utes compiling five triple-doubles -- second most during a single season in NCAA history and the most by any Pac-12 player.

In a St. John's news release Monday Pitino said the 6-foot Smith reminds him of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier a standout player for Pitino at Louisville.

""Super excited to have Deivon Smith joining the Johnnies"" Pitino said. ""Total dog who rebounds creates and scores.""

Smith from Decatur Georgia played his freshman season at Mississippi State and then spent two years with Georgia Tech. He shot a career-high 46.7% from the field in 28 games during his only season at Utah.

Two of his triple-doubles came during Utah's run to the NIT semifinals and he scored a career-best 28 points against tournament runner-up Indiana State on April 2.

Smith becomes the third notable transfer the Red Storm have landed this offseason joining 7-foot-1 center Vincent Iwuchukwu from USC and 6-foot-7 forward Aaron Scott from North Texas. They both committed last month.

At point guard St. John's also returns sophomore Simeon Wilcher a touted recruit who began to show marked improvement late last season in his limited role as a freshman. Wilcher averaged 2.8 points and 9.1 minutes in 28 games as Jenkins' understudy.

Jenkins followed Pitino from Iona to St. John's for his senior season and propelled the Red Storm to a 20-13 record including 11-9 in conference play for their most Big East wins in 14 years. They reached the Big East tournament semifinals for the first time since 2000 losing 95-90 to eventual NCAA champion UConn.

Jenkins led the team in scoring (14.9 points per game) assists (5.4) steals (1.6) and minutes (30.7) earning second-team All-Big East honors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXJpem9uYXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzU0NzMwMi9mb3JtZXItYXJpem9uYS1wZy10LWotbWNjb25uZWxsLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWluLW5iYS1mb3ItcGFjZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Arizona PG T.J. McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”"

The win put Pinnacle at .500 (9-9) for the first time this season and catapulted the Pioneers into the 6A tournament that starts Thursday night.

Pinnacle came into the game ranked 17th just outside of the 16-team state tournament field. Chaparral was sitting at 16. The win put Pinnacle at 14 and will give it a trip to No. 3 Gilbert Perry to face the powerful Pumas who could have 7-foot junior Dylan Anderson back from an injury that kept him out of Perry's regular-season finale.

Chaparral had its playoffs hopes end.

Wilde who led Pinnacle to back-to-back 6A titles in 2018 and 2019 when he had now Golden State Warriors guard Nico Mannion said he never kept track of his wins over the years at Pinnacle.

Pinnacle is making its 19th consecutive state tournament under Wilde.

""I never worry about wins"" said Wilde who coaches his daughter's golf team to a state title in the fall of 2019. ""My wife (Bridgette) secretly organized the 400 wins.""

Wilde said he didn't put any extra pressure on the players or himself Friday night knowing it was basically a playoff game.

""We prepared like we always do and my kids came through with a big win for our team"" Wilde said.

Pinnacle started out 3-5 and lost to Peoria Liberty 97-74 to start this week before winning its last two games.

""I am proud of our players to have come through adversity to have a chance in the playoffs"" Wilde said. ""The 400 wins are a reflection of my former and current players' efforts.

""It was fun to share it with this group.""

In September 1989 members of Mendocino County’s logging industry lobbied the Laytonville Unified School District to remove Dr. Seuss’s The Lorax from the district’s second-grade curriculum claiming the book demeaned the logging industry. Coverage of the controversy spread across the news wires bringing national attention to the growing war between the logging industry and environmentalism demonstrating Dr. Seuss’ uncanny ability to touch the nerve of audiences.

Currently Dr. Seuss’ children’s literature is grabbing headlines due to what some consider racialized illustrations in a few of his books. The company that oversees Dr. Seuss’ estate said six of his books would no longer be printed because some of the depictions of groups were “hurtful and wrong.” The books that will no longer be reprinted are: And To Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street If I Ran the Zoo McElligot’s Pool On Beyond Zebra! Scrambled Eggs Super! and The Cat’s Quizzer.

Back in 1989 when our local area became the center of another Dr. Seuss controversy Laytonville was an unincorporated hamlet in the rugged north of Mendocino County along Highway 101. According to Lawrence Livermore’s article “Under the Barnum and (Bill) Bailey Big Top: The Mayor of Laytonville” Bill Bailey a logging equipment wholesaler based out of Laytonville saw an opportunity to fix the town’s school district he saw as pandering to “unwashed-out-of-town-jobless-hippies-on-drugs.” He made it his mission to secure power and control of the Laytonville School Board. Bailey successfully was elected to the board and soon got his compatriots Mike Wilwand and Art Harwood elected along with him. Power secured.

As described in a Press Democrat article written by Mike Geniella Judith Bailey Bill Bailey’s wife sought removal of Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax from Laytonville Unified School District’s 2nd-grade curriculum. She claimed the book went against California Education Code 60040 prohibiting references that “tend to demean stereotype or be patronizing toward an occupation vocation or livelihood.” Judith Bailey was quoted as saying “I feel when a second grader reads a line that says ‘Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack’ as a moral of the story then he or she will feel that anyone who cuts down trees is bad.”

The Press Democrat article explained Laytonville Unified School District Superintendent Brian Buckley was obligated to conduct a formal review of Judith Bailey’s request. He formed a committee comprised of a librarian the school’s librarian technician two teachers two district residents and himself. One of the two district residents happened to be Becky Harwood Bill Bailey’s compatriot Art’s wife and Judith Bailey’s sister.

The review committee met to deliberate upon the removal of The Lorax on September 13 1989 according to a Press Democrat article written by Mike Geniella. Becky Harwood said the book was disparaging to loggers and “Kids don’t have to feel bad about what their parents do.” Sue Jones the librarian of Willits High School argued the book should be used as a “place of departure” and envisioned the book giving students insight into the harmful logging practices that once were. After deliberating the committee voted six-to-one to keep The Lorax in the school’s curriculum.

The proposed removal still had one step before it could be quashed: the Laytonville School Board would be casting the final vote on October 5 1989.

Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax is a fable with environmental themes telling the tale of an industrious man referred to as the Once-ler his exploitation of the Truffula trees and a mustachioed creature referred to as the Lorax who claims “to speak for the trees.” By the end of the tale the Truffula trees were clear-cut the ecosystem destroyed and the Once-ler’s industry in ruins. Reflecting on the beauty of the land that was lost the Once-ler remembered the Lorax’s wisdom of stewardship: “Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot nothing is going to get better. It’s not.”

With The Lorax decision in the Laytonville School Board’s hands the book’s controversy became a vehicle for the nation to understand the conflict between the North Coast’s logging industry and the environmental movement. News wires picked up the story and soon readers from Ohio to Florida to New York read about the town of Laytonville and the Dr. Seuss story tearing a community apart.

According to an AP Newswire article that appeared in the Ukiah Daily Journal Theodor Seuss Geisel who was at that point 85 years old said the “grown-ups are missing the point. Trees are used in this book as a symbol- the rousing up of nature. It’s about turning natural resources into crud.”

Arthur “Bud” Harwood the president of Branscomb Lumber Company Harwood Products said in an open letter to Dr. Seuss published by the Ukiah Daily Journal that he did not believe The Lorax should be taken out of school. He said if it was “taught sensitively” the book could be an “excellent tool in stimulating young people’s minds on how we should deal with the environment.” In his letter Harwood insisted the real issue was the book was “required reading for very young students. He expressed he did not “feel that it is right for our schools to put father against son or daughter.”

Well-known Earth First! member Judi Bari was quoted in a Ukiah Daily Journal article written by Lois O’Rourke as saying “The reason they are so afraid of this book is (because) it shows exactly what they are doing. They are taking the last of the redwood forest just like the Truffula trees in The Lorax.”

On October 5 1989 200 residents and national and local print television and radio reporters gathered in Laytonville to cover the school board meeting where The Lorax’s future would be decided.

The majority of public comment at the meeting was against the banning of the children’s book. A Ukiah Daily Journal article written by Lois O’Rouke highlighted some of the prescient public comments.

California Teacher’s Association representative Bill Haywood claimed that the district’s teachers’ academic freedom was at stake if the book was removed.

Kathi Cloninger a resident of Laytonville and Earth Firster! was reported to have said The Lorax “is a useful tool to teach? the value of conservation.”

One person who spoke in favor of removing the book from the required reading list was high school student Tara Fristo who asked “What’s the big deal. It’s only being removed from the mandatory list.” Fristo in her high school brashness looked around at the school auditorium full of reports from outlets ranging from CBS News the Philadelphia Inquirer and People magazine and simply asked “Why are all the TV cameras here?”

Bill Webster a member of the Laytonville School Board was met with a standing ovation when he said manipulating books was “insulting our children” and tells them “we don’t trust you to make your own decisions.”

Bill Bailey the man who had stacked the school board to cancel The Lorax did not show that night and by the end of the meeting the School Board decided to table the decision and explore the option of abolishing the required list and replaced it with a “suggested” reading list.

In the wake of The Lorax controversy Judith Bailey stood firm on her message that the book hurt families in the logging industry telling Press Democrat writer Mike Geniella “I don’t think the teachers understand the message that says cutting down trees is wrong. Especially in an area where children’s parents are the very people who cut down the trees for a living.” Bailey did give ground saying that she was not “interested in taking the book away from anyone” insisting the book “can remain in the classroom the library or wherever. I know there’s nothing to gain by holding back knowledge.”

In an editorial published by the Ukiah Daily Journal after the school board meeting staff expressed a timeless sentiment regarding the First Amendment: “every time we hear of another book being attacked by a certain group for whatever reason — religious moral or any other- we cringe. Book banning (or burning in some cases) has no place in a democracy. It has no place anywhere.”

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

P&G although saying they are mainly cruelty-free now continues experimenting on animals.

Plenty of makeup is tested on animals like rodents — and dogs and cats — something state Rep. Sara Carruthers (R-Hamilton) wants to change.

""Some of this stuff is just inhumane sick and unnecessary"" Carruthers said. ""A lethal dose test involves forcing rats to swallow large amounts of chemicals until the subject dies so that you can determine the dose that causes death.""

She and state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Cleveland) introduced House Bill 495 which would stop the majority of animal testing for cosmetics sold in Ohio.

Not only would this save animals but it would also help the economy — since consumers want cruelty-free products Carruthers said.

The vegan cosmetic market is growing exponentially in part because of Generation Z's interest in ""ethically sourced products"" according to UNiDAYS a popular student shopping app that conducts market research.

But Carruthers' background is what made her interested in animal rights.

""My great great grandfather did it — they did use animal testing"" she said.

Carruthers is a descendant of Cincinnati-based company Procter and Gamble and she wants companies like hers to stop animal experimentation. Although her family still has some influence they no longer have a vote in the company policies and have no position on the board. She says her family no longer owns any part of the corporate giant but their Procter-side of the family continues to be a fixture in the Cincinnati area.

I reached out to P&G whose spokesperson said in a statement that their PETA cruelty-free brands are not tested on animals. However that is a small percentage. They have 79 brands and only 13 are on the PETA-certified list.

""P&G has invested over $480 million in non-animal test method development over decades and is partnering with groups like PETA and the Humane Society International & US working closely with governments to end animal testing globally"" the company said.

Some countries still mandate testing on animals they added.

A significant portion of their products are made in China according to 2018 testimony given to the U.S. Trade Representative and Chinese regulations require testing on products like toothpaste hair treatments and anything with sunscreen in it like a moisturizer or foundation.

I asked for a multitude of clarifications on their ""cruelty-free"" policy including data backing up their statements of being anti-animal testing. They were not addressed in their short statement.

It isn't just the United States and China that they have plants. They have factories on all continents minus Antarctica. Some locations have rules against animal testing some require it and others have other types of restraints — such as Japan which holds each ""institution responsible for self-regulation"" according to researchers.

""Let's go for made in America right?"" Carruthers said. ""We have modern testing methods like human cell-based tests sophisticated computer models.""

But bioethics expert and law professor at Case Western Reserve University Sharona Hoffman says the change could be a huge blow to medical advancements.

""Computer modeling is not a substitute for all animal studies — and also you have to worry about the expense"" Hoffman said.

Carruthers responded that data has shown that animal alternatives are actually cheaper but Hoffman is doubtful.

""Growing tissue in labs is quite expensive"" the professor said.

The bill language is broad and it could seemingly impact research to help burn victims or patients who want reconstruction surgeries after cancer or trauma.

""If you're talking about lipstick or blush I would probably agree that you don't need to use animals"" Hoffman said acknowledging that makeup isn't the true concern of hers. ""But for other treatments we have to remember 'cosmetic' is very very broad.""

The National Association for Biomedical Research is also concerned stating that the bill may have a negative impact on ""new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual — cosmetic and medical — application.""

NABR's full statement from spokesperson Eva Maciejewski:

""Measuring the safety and efficacy of a new molecule or compound usually involves preclinical testing with animals and adjunct methods and then phased human clinical trials. Scientists and regulators strive to reduce the number of animals used. They also prioritize the development and adoption of refinement methods. However scientists cannot observe the combined effects of a new molecule or compound on the body’s interconnected systems over time by relying exclusively on artificial intelligence organ chips and other non-animal methods. They also need to use animals to determine if the new molecule or compound is safe enough to begin human clinical trials. It is therefore unclear whether the proposed state bill HB 495 could have a negative impact on new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual - cosmetic and medical - application.""

""Animal studies do not proceed without any oversight"" Hoffman added. ""This isn't just some scientist collecting rats in the garage and then experimenting on them.""

Carruthers argued there are exceptions such as when there is no non-animal method available.

""This is a no-brainer"" the lawmaker said.

This bill will likely be heard in the coming months. She also introduced another bipartisan bill to crack down and try to prevent puppy mills which she said she talked to P&G about.

When Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta was a 12-year-old growing up in North Philadelphia he got a job washing dishes at a restaurant to help his mother pay the bills.

Kenyatta describes his upbringing as ""working poor"" with a keen understanding of the economic challenges that have left many families behind from static wages to housing affordability.

""My story certainly has a lot of distinct parts that are unique to me but not that unique to most Pennsylvanians"" he said.

In 2018 Kenyatta a community activist was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives becoming the first openly gay Black state legislator and one of the youngest members of the legislature.

Since being elected he has pushed for an expansion of early voting statewide and worked to reduce homelessness in his North Philadelphia-anchored district among other issues.

Last month Kenyatta 30 announced that he would be running for the Senate seat being vacated by two-term GOP Sen. Pat Toomey in 2022 in what will be one of the most competitive races in the country.

He will face Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman in a Democratic primary that will likely attract other high-profile candidates in the coming months.

Kenyatta recently spoke with Insider about his campaign. Below are edited excerpts from that interview.

Q. What inspired you to run for the Senate at this really critical time in our nation's history?

A. Every generation has a responsibility to work to preserve and expand the promise of America — and that's been a promise that has excluded a lot of people over time but something we've always worked to broaden. Look at the compounding crises that have been more exacerbated as a result of COVID-19.

If you're a working person there were issues with housing prior to this cruel pandemic. There were issues with education. There were issues with wages. There were issues with being able to start a small business. What we need in this moment are people who understand what's broken and can take us from where we are to where we need to go.

We've been racking up a lot of debt because we haven't dealt with college affordability. We haven't looked at ways to make college free which it ought to be in most instances.

Q: How do we determine whether we are a medium to large-sized company?

A: You are a medium or large-sized company if you meet two of the following criteria for two consecutive financial years:

A turnover of more than £10.2 million

A balance sheet total (assets) of more than £5.1 million

An average of more than 50 employees

Further guidance can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-status-manual/esm10006.

Q: Do the off-payroll working rules apply to small company clients?

A: If a client is classified as small under the Companies Act 2006 and outside the public sector they do not need to consider the off-payroll working rules. Instead the interim’s personal service company (PSC) should self-assess their status for tax purposes.

Q: We are a small company but we are part of a larger group do the off-payroll working rules apply to us?

A: If you are a small subsidiary of a larger group then it is the group as a whole that dictates whether you are classed as small or medium to large-sized.

Q: Does the off-payroll legislation affect charities?

A: Yes from 6 April 21 the legislation will affect private sector and third sector organisations which will include social housing organisations and some charities depending on their size.

Q: Do the off-payroll working rules apply to self-employed sole traders?

A: If the individual does not work through an intermediary structure like a PSC then the rules don't need to be considered. The off-payroll rules only apply to interims providing their services to public sector organisations and medium/large non-public sector organisations through their own intermediary.

Q: If an interim contracts via an umbrella company why does the legislation not apply?

A: If an interim contracts via an umbrella company they are an employee of the umbrella company and their pay is treated as employment income and is subject to PAYE so the umbrella company deducts tax and both employee and employer national insurance contributions from the interim’s pay and therefore off-payroll working rules do not apply to the assignment.

Q: What does a typical umbrella company charge for their service?

A: We have done some market research and on average an umbrella will charge £90 a month for their services – or circa £4.40 a day if a full month is worked.

Q: Does including a statement of work in a contract mean the role will fall outside the off-payroll working legislation?

A: A statement of work does not put a contractor outside of IR35 – an interim engaged via a genuine statement of work arrangement is more likely to be outside IR35 but it is the nature of the arrangement which matters.

Q: I have secured a new role and the client has asked me to help them determine the status of the role - how should I do this?

A: If the client is a medium to large-sized organisation in the private sector or is an organisation in the public sector it is their responsibility to determine whether the off-payroll working rules apply. They must use reasonable care to come to the decision and produce a status determination statement (SDS) that must be issued to the interim and the agency confirming employment status.

Q: A client is using the 'blanket' approach to assess all temporary workers is this ok?

A: Where a blanket determination has been made by a client without taking into account the terms and conditions or working practices of individual workers then this would be seen by HMRC as making a decision without taking reasonable care. If the client has not taken reasonable care the responsibility for the deduction of tax and NICs and payment of apprenticeship levy and paying these to HMRC is the client’s if due.

Three key status tests

Q: What are the three key status tests?

A: Right of substitution Supervision direction or control and Mutuality of obligation.

Q: Does one have to meet all three criteria to fall within IR35 or just one or two of the criteria?

A: If all three key status tests are present HMRC would consider you to be an employee as you are operating under the same conditions as an employee would and therefore the off-payroll working rules apply. If any one of them does not apply you would technically be classed as self-employed. However in order to be able to argue that a contract is definitely outside of IR35 it is best to have at least two out of the three key tests not present.

Q: I am the only employee of my personal service company; how can I provide a substitute?

A: It is the right of substitution that is important not whether there is anyone waiting in the wings or whether there is anyone else working under your limited company. However if a client has agreed there is a right of substitution and should you then need one you would need to find one at the time and you would be responsible for the worker and for paying them.

Q: If a limited company provides a substitute that is not an employee of their company and they use someone who is employed by a different limited company is that not subcontracting how are these different?

A: If you send someone in your place to carry out your work you are providing a substitute. Providing the client is happy to accept the substitute it does not matter where you get them from. Sub-contracting is when a limited company is given ‘X’ amount of work and can pass part of that work on to other people to do that work either alongside them or for them. Whereas a substitute would take the place of the worker initially provided by the personal service company.

Q: My contract gives me the right to send a substitute but the client says they have the right to reject. How does this work?

A: Who the substitute is is completely at the interim’s discretion the client does not have a say in who is put forward but they do have ultimate decision as to whether they accept the substitution. Where the client has a right to refuse a substitute then this would mean the right of substitution would not be definitive as there would not be an unfettered right of substitution. Further information can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-status-manual/esm11045.

Q: The right of substitution must not be unduly fettered. If the client requires a basic security check for anyone coming onto a site that could take a few days would that be considered unduly fettered?

A: If the on-boarding process for a business to engage the services of the substitute takes more the 24-48 hours HMRC would consider this was unduly fettered.

IR35 assessment tools

Q: As the end client how do I determine whether the off-payroll working rules apply to a role?

A: Tools that enable you to make the determination are the Check Employment Status for Tax (CEST) tool provided by HMRC: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-employment-status-for-tax or alternatively there are many other private organisations offering IR35 assessment tools that will help you or you may wish to take professional advice from your advisors. The use of CEST is not mandatory you are free to use whichever method you wish but reasonable care must be taken in all circumstances. You must be able to demonstrate how you arrived at your conclusion and show you considered all the relevant facts.

Q: Will HMRC stand by the result the CEST tool gives?

A: CEST is there to help the end client decide status and HMRC will stand by the results as long as they reflect the facts. If the client put answers into CEST which are not based on true facts HMRC will not stand by those results.

Q: Does the outcome of the CEST tool count as a Status Determination Statement (SDS)?

A: The CEST output will constitute a valid SDS as long as accurate information has been entered into the tool. Any changes in contractual terms or the day to day working practices will result in the original SDS having to be revisited to ensure the answers provided are still accurate.

Q: What alternatives are there to using CEST?

A: There are many other private organisations offering IR35 assessment tools. We have found Qdos Contractor to be responsive and knowledgeable. Should you wish to use them during an assignment process with us you can do so via our portal with no financial benefit to Odgers Interim.

Status Determination Statement (SDS)

Q: What is a Status Determination Statement?

A: If a client is medium to large-sized in the private and third sector or they are an organisation in the public sector they must communicate whether the off-payroll working rules apply to a role using a Status Determination Statement (SDS). This must be passed to the worker and the person or organisation they contract with. It must give the conclusion and the reasons for coming to it.

Q: If the SDS is 'outside IR35' does it still need to be communicated?

A: The SDS should always be communicated as it will inform other parties in the contractual chain of the decision.

Q: What is the deadline for issuing the SDS?

A: The SDS must be produced and passed to the worker and any 3rd party the client contracts with on or before the date any payment has been made for their services.

Q: As a client do we need to produce an SDS for each worker?

A: Employment status should be determined by considering the contractual terms and conditions as well as the day-to-day working realities. If ‘blanket’ determinations are made for groups of workers where the terms and conditions are not the same this would not be taking reasonable care. If the client has not taken reasonable care the responsibility for the deduction of tax and NICs and payment of apprenticeship levy and paying these to HMRC is the client’s if due.

Q: As an interim can I do anything if I do not agree with the SDS?

A: Changes in the legislation mean a worker is now able to dispute the SDS and clients must have a status disagreement process in place to deal with any disputes. The client will have 45 calendar days to respond to any dispute. If the original conclusion is found to be wrong they must produce a new SDS and inform the interim and agency. Failure to respond will result in the client being liable for tax and NICs if due. HMRC advises clients to keep a record of their determinations and the reasons for them as well as records of any disputes made to them. Further information can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-status-manual/esm10015.

Deemed an employee for tax purposes

Q: What does ‘deemed an employee for tax purposes’ mean?

A: If the off-payroll working rules apply the worker is ‘deemed an employee for tax purposes’.

Q: If I am ‘deemed an employee for tax purposes’ will I benefit from pension contributions and annual leave allowance?

A: If you are ‘deemed an employee for tax purposes’ it means you will pay the same tax as an employee in the same way but unfortunately you will not receive any of the benefits of being an employee. Employment status is only for tax purposes.

Q: If I am ‘deemed an employee for tax purposes’ what does this mean for my pay?

A: If you are ‘deemed an employee for tax purposes’ your pay will be taxed at source as if you were an employee and the fee payer will be responsible for the deduction of PAYE tax and NIC's. The personal service company will receive a similar fee to that which they would have received if they were an employee of the client and not providing their services via their own intermediary.

Q: What tax code or tax rate should the fee payer use to make deductions if the off-payroll working rules apply?

A: The fee payer will ask the worker to complete a starter checklist. A tax code will be provided based on the checklist response. HMRC may issue several tax code changes during the course of an assignment depending on the workers circumstances and thresholds.

Q: If I am ‘deemed an employee for tax purposes’ should the fee payer pay me directly rather than paying my personal service company?

A: The fee payer must pay the personal service company as this is the vehicle they have a contract with. The worker is still providing their services through their intermediary and so payment must be made to the respective business bank account.

Q: If tax is deducted in the form of PAYE and the balance is paid into my PSC when I withdraw salary from my PSC will I be taxed again?

A: If you only work inside IR35 during a tax year with no income coming from anywhere else what you are paid requires no further taxation from a corporation tax perspective or further PAYE tax and NI; you will have paid your taxes and NICs and will not be double taxed.

If you do multiple assignments during a tax year remuneration can be drawn free of PAYE tax and NICs up to the level of the deemed direct payment where that remuneration can reasonably be taken to be for services you provided to a public authority or medium or large-sized organisation not in the public sector. This prevents payments being subject to double taxation. Further guidance on this can be found here https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-status-manual/esm10030 and here https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-status-manual/esm10035.

Q: If my personal service company is VAT registered does the fee payer have to treat this as taxable income?

A: No VAT is not put through payroll it is removed first your pay is then subject to PAYE tax and NI and your VAT is paid on top of the net amount after deductions have been made.

Overseas Arrangements

Q: Do the off-payroll working rules apply to a worker who is not a UK tax resident but who is carrying out work in the UK for a UK client?

A: Where a non-UK resident worker is providing services in the UK there is likely to still be a UK tax liability and the off-payroll rules need to be considered. For national insurance however the worker may not be subject to UK national insurance for the first 52 weeks or they have a certificate of continuing liability for another country in which case they are liable to pay social security contributions in their own country and not subject to UK national insurance.

However residency is an incredibly complex area of tax so if you need advice on it we recommend you speak to a residency expert.

Q: Do the off-payroll working rules apply to services provided from the UK to an overseas company?

A: If the end client is based wholly overseas the off-payroll working rules do not apply and the end client does not need to determine IR35 status it will be the personal service companies’ responsibility as it has been previously.

Q: How do I determine if a client is wholly overseas?

A: For a client to be wholly overseas they are not incorporated in the UK and there must be no UK connection before the start of the tax year. A permanent premises/connection/establishment is defined as 'a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on'. A permanent establishment can be anything from a branch office or factory in the UK to an entity who has authority to carry out business on behalf of the client. Further information can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-status-manual/esm10025.

Q: Do the off-payroll working rules apply to services provided from the UK to an overseas subsidiary of a UK group?

A: Yes the rules need to be considered. The residency of the UK company brings the whole group into scope of the rules as they are not wholly overseas. If a client is based overseas but has a UK connection through a permanent establishment such as a branch it is the overseas client who is responsible for discharging its responsibilities (such as issuing the SDS). If the overseas client does not meet its responsibilities it will as a consequence be liable for tax and NICs where the rules apply and HMRC will pursue this debt through the UK permanent establishment.

Q: Do the off-payroll working rules apply to a UK resident who is contracted to work overseas?

A: IR35 applies to the worker so if the worker is a UK resident and therefore is subject to UK tax and NICs regardless of where the services are provided or where the personal service company might be incorporated the off-payroll working rules may apply. We would encourage you to seek residency experts for their advice and further information on this.

HMRC

Q: Has HMRC indicated whether there will be a grace period?

A: Not as such but they have said they will have a light touch approach to penalties for getting it wrong unless they have evidence of deliberate non-compliance.

Q: Can HMRC look retrospectively at previous roles where an intermediary has not self-assessed their IR35 status?

A: HMRC has previously said they will not and we have had no indication of HMRC going outside this so we do not expect them to.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWguY29tLmF1L2J1c2luZXNzL3dvcmtwbGFjZS9jb21pbmctdXAtd2l0aC1jcmVhdGl2ZS1zb2x1dGlvbnMtY29tcGFuaWVzLWxvb2tpbmctdG8taGlyZS1hdXRpc3RpYy1lbXBsb3llZXMtMjAyMTAzMDQtcDU3N3h3Lmh0bWzSAY0BaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc21oLmNvbS5hdS9idXNpbmVzcy93b3JrcGxhY2UvY29taW5nLXVwLXdpdGgtY3JlYXRpdmUtc29sdXRpb25zLWNvbXBhbmllcy1sb29raW5nLXRvLWhpcmUtYXV0aXN0aWMtZW1wbG95ZWVzLTIwMjEwMzA0LXA1Nzd4dy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Coming up with creative solutions’: Companies looking to hire autistic employees,"Large Australian companies such as Telstra and NAB are actively hiring more staff with autism as part of a push for neurodiversity in the workplace.

The neurodiversity programs also embraced by government departments such as Services Australia and technology companies such as DXC and SAP typically form part of a broader goal to employ people with disabilities.

The term “neurodiversity” describes a range of conditions that imply a different way of seeing and interacting with the world including autism ADHD and learning disabilities such as dyslexia. Most of the programs in the Australian corporate sector focus on people with autism but acknowledge the autistic individuals may have other neurodivergent conditions as well.

He drove through the lane for a layup on the Lions' opening possession and shortly followed with a 3-pointer.

But to knock off a state power like Orlando Christian Prep in the Class 2A championship game on Saturday Lawson and his Impact Christian teammates had to be nearly flawless from start to finish.

It turned out to be too big of a task for Impact Christian (20-9) to achieve as its hopes to win a championship were dashed for the second consecutive season by Orlando Christian Prep in a 51-32 loss at the RP Funding Center.

''We have nothing to hang our head about I can't do anything but be proud'' Impact Christian coach Ben Jones said. ''If I look at the film I'm probably going to be upset about a couple of things. But it was a great season and I just want our guys to know that - I can't be upset at all.''

Orlando Christian Prep (27-0) extended its remarkable winning streak to 47 consecutive games. The Warriors who haven't lost a game since Dec. 6 2019 against Daytona Beach Mainland entered the final four as the No. 1 team in the FHSAA's ranking system across all classifications.

Among Orlando Christian Prep's 26 wins this season coming into the state final only three games were decided by less than 10 points.

So Impact Christian knew it faced a daunting challenge especially after losing to OCP 65-35 in December and 58-44 in last year's state championship game.

Still Impact Christian disrupted the Warriors' offensive rhythm to take a 21-20 lead with 2:55 remaining before halftime. And Lawson started the game strong hitting three of his first five shots to score 10 of his team-high 17 points in the first half. He made six-of-14 shots which included two 3-pointers and grabbed a team-high seven rebounds.

''I don't normally take that many shots but I wanted to win badly'' Lawson said. ''I just wanted to help my team win. We started off 3-6 this season and our coach always said we were going to be in Lakeland.''

But a big problem against the Warriors was Impact Christian's interior game. Forward Calvin Johnson came in averaging a team-high 14.0 points per game but he couldn't find his rhythm going 0-of-5 from the field to finish scoreless.

''They were really long and it made it tough'' said guard Taylor Thompson who scored 10. ''Usually teams we play are good but not as big as they were.''

Impact Christian's only other scorers besides Lawson and Thompson were Devean Knowles (three points) and Kelvin Johnson (two points). The Lions were held to 11 points in the second half just four in the fourth quarter.

Despite making only 12-of-27 shots and going 1-for-4 from behind the 3-point line Orlando Christian Prep still took a 28-21 lead into halftime after closing the final 4:47 of the second quarter on an 11-4 run.

After Impact Christian's Kelvin Johnson scored inside on a layup to cut the lead to 28-23 Orlando Christian Prep began to take the Lions out of their offensive rhythm by sealing off the passing lanes on the perimeter and packing the lane with their taller frontcourt players.

After trailing by a 40-28 deficit at the end of the third quarter Impact Christian found themselves in a much worse hole with just more than three minutes remaining when they trailed by 17.

Impact Christian couldn't match its 69 percent shooting from Wednesday's 69-54 victory against Southwest Florida Christian in the semifinals.

Instead Impact Christian shot a woeful 27 percent from the field (11 of 41 shots) committed 14 turnovers and was outscored 16-2 on second-chance shots because of Orlando Christian's Prep's 39-25 rebounding edge.

Guard A.J. Brown led the Warriors with 18 points and 6-foot-7 forward Ven Allen Lubin scored 14 on seven-of-14 shooting.

''We had already played them one time this year so the mindset was what kind we can throw at them differently that they haven't seen'' OCP coach Treig Burke said. ''So I thought maybe we could play this halfcourt trap which would allow our length to cover up some things. As the wore on we definitely felt like we took them out of their offense.''",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS90aGUtNi10aGluZ3MteW91LWFyZS1yZXNwb25zaWJsZS1mb3ItaW4tdGhlLWNsb3VkLWM1MTNhYzA3OTA1ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 6 things you are responsible for in the cloud,"The 6 things you are responsible for in the cloud

In this second article on the data in the cloud series we’re going to explore one interesting concept that has emerged in the cloud: the shared responsibility model. When thinking about moving to the cloud you should first understand the different cloud options and how this will affect your organization. Depending on the deployment model you choose you will have a higher or lower responsibility.

If you missed up the first post in the data in the cloud series I recommend you to read first the article How the cloud will help (or not) your business since we’re going to use several concepts explained there.

Understanding the different deployment models

Now we’re ready to start. First of all you’ll have to understand the different cloud models because depending on the model your responsibility degree will change. The different deployment models are the following:

☁️ Public cloud : when you use a public cloud you’re using computing resources on a subscription basis. These resources can be hardware like storage or CPU or software like databases or application servers. When talking to the cloud we usually are focusing on public clouds.

: when you use a public cloud you’re using computing resources on a subscription basis. These resources can be hardware like storage or CPU or software like databases or application servers. When talking to the cloud we usually are focusing on public clouds. 🔐 Private cloud : as the name suggests the private cloud is owned and managed by your company. This type of cloud goes against the principles we’ve seen in the first article of the series because it has high up-front costs (CapEx). Nevertheless private models are better able to address the security and privacy concerns of organizations today.

This is a mix-up of the two deployment models explained before. Many firms use this deployment model to quickly scale-up their private resources with the power of the public cloud.

Many firms use this deployment model to quickly scale-up their private resources with the power of the public cloud. 👥 Community cloud: this is less known since it is not very common. It’s used when the same resources are shared by several organizations that belong to a community. Universities or government are use-cases of this deployment model.

And now let’s explore the service models

Okay we have several types of service models but what kind of services we can find on them?

🏗 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) : in this service model you’re acquiring computing resources through the Internet like compute storage or network. As we commented on the first post of the series based on the pay-as-you-go pricing model you’ll be billed depending on the amount of capacity demanded and the time you use it.

: in this service model you’re acquiring computing resources through the Internet like compute storage or network. As we commented on the first post of the series based on the pay-as-you-go pricing model you’ll be billed depending on the amount of capacity demanded and the time you use it. 🏭 Platform as a Service (Paas) : here you’ll have access to several resources where you can build and deliver your applications to the end-users without managing the underlying infrastructure. The main drawback of this service model is that it has higher costs comparing them with the other two options.

: here you’ll have access to several resources where you can build and deliver your applications to the end-users without managing the underlying infrastructure. The main drawback of this service model is that it has higher costs comparing them with the other two options. 🏠 Software as a Service (Saas): this is the highest level of abstraction. In SaaS you’ll access end-user solutions. When talking about cloud we’re often referencing SaaS because of the type of services that you as a user have access to. Examples of SaaS are Google Drive Office 365 or Salesforce.

The shared responsibility in the cloud

I’m sure at this point you’ve known what are the different cloud deployment models and service types so now let’s dive into the main topic in this article: the shared responsibility.

This concept has emerged to better understand what aspects you have to focus on as a cloud customer and what aspects the cloud provider is responsible for. This model is organized into 7 key points:

📄 Data classification and accountability : the responsibility for manage classify or meet any compliance obligation is always on the customer side. The cloud provider offers you a set of tools to help you on that task like data encryption data loss prevention auditing and so.

: the responsibility for manage classify or meet any compliance obligation is always on the customer side. The cloud provider offers you a set of tools to help you on that task like data encryption data loss prevention auditing and so. 🛡 Client protection : refers to the devices (both mobile or PC) used by end-users to access the cloud. This is also a complete responsibility of the customer.

: refers to the devices (both mobile or PC) used by end-users to access the cloud. This is also a complete responsibility of the customer. 🔑 Identity and access management : this is an important point for any organization since it provides the capability to access cloud resources. The identity refers to who (specific user) is accessing your cloud and access controls what specific services this user can use. In PaaS and SaaS is a shared responsibility between the customer and the cloud provider. Also the cloud provider will offer you a toolset to manage the security of both the authentication and authorization like multi-factor authentication (MFA) role-based access control (RBAC) or auditing.

In IaaS the customer has de complete responsibility but in PaaS the customer only has to configure it and the cloud provider will take care of the other aspects. In SaaS this point is fully managed by your service provider.

In both IaaS and PaaS this point is shared between the customer and the service provider but with differences. In PaaS most of the configuration and management is on the service provider side but the customer has a small responsibility. In SaaS most of the responsibility is for the service provider.

In IaaS this is a shared responsibility. While the customer has more control over the infrastructure the cloud provider must ensure that the underlying elements can communicate and are configured correctly. In a higher level of abstraction (PaaS and SaaS) the service provider is responsible for this point.

While the customer has more control over the infrastructure the cloud provider must ensure that the underlying elements can communicate and are configured correctly. In a higher level of abstraction (PaaS and SaaS) the service provider is responsible for this point. 🏢 Physical security: as not occur on the on-premise approach the service provider is always responsible (on all 3 models) for physical security like maintaining and securing the building the server rooms the server power and cooling or replacing replacement of defective or old components like hard-drives or processors.

Summary

In a constant-changing world reducing the time-to-market and adapting your IT capacity to the demand are two key points that can translate into a competitive advantage. Like you and me everyone needs to continually adapt their business to the new market demands. Also it is important to understand that in today’s world everybody expects that technology must work perfectly furthermore a product that not works properly or shows bad performance can turn into a driver to change the competitors.

As we discussed in the previous post the cloud has numerous advantages however we cannot ignore certain aspects. In this article we have detailed the principal points that we focus on. Depending on the service models the cloud provider will have some responsibility and on the other side we as customers have to take action.

Thanks for reading the second post of the data in the cloud series. In the next article we will focus on cloud security and comparing it with on-premise solutions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmd0aWFuZGkuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL2xvZ2lzdGljcy9sb2dvcy1haW1zLWZvci1ibGFja3N0b25lcy1taWxlc3RvbmUtbG9naXN0aWNzLWluLWF1c3RyYWxpYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Logos Aims for Blackstone's Milestone Logistics in Australia,"Logos Property Group is continuing to ramp up its regional portfolio as the ARA Asset Management-backed developer seeks to add a Blackstone-owned logistics portfolio to recent acquisitions in Sydney and Singapore.

Logos is now among five bidders short-listed in Blackstone’s sale of the Milestone Logistics portfolio in Australia which is set to receive final bids of around A$3 billion ($2.3 billion) before the middle of next month according to local news reports.

The face-off for the 1.4 million square metre (15 million square foot) set of warehouse assets has the company headed by Trent Iliffe and John Marsh competing with regional powerhouses ESR and Mapletree as well as with Australia’s Dexus and AXA Investment Managers of France according to an account in the Australian Financial Review.

Should Logos shoulder aside the four competing bidders it would be set to add warehouse assets in five Australian cities to its portfolio and bring its acquisitions of income-generating properties to more than $3.6 billion since mid-February.

Asked about the set of deals a Logos representative declined to comment.

Buying in Southwest Sydney

While it has been in the race for Blackstone’s set of Aussie sheds Logos already managed to reach an agreement during the final week of February to acquire warehouse and land assets in southwestern Sydney from logistics operator Qube.

The shed specialist is paying A$1.65 billion ($1.27 billion) to acquire a 100 percent interest in Moorebank Logistics Park which includes a 243 hectare (600.5 acre) parcel of land with existing warehouses in the city of Moorebank. The deal also provides Logos with Qube’s 34 percent interest in the Moorebank Precinct Land Trust which has a leasehold interest in the land.

Under the terms of the deal Logos will fund and deliver the remaining projects at the logistics park including future warehouses for retailer Woolworths while Qube will continue to own the intermodal rail terminals and manage its terminal operations at the site.

“The sale of the MLP property assets allows Qube to focus on its core logistics operations and reduce its MLP development capex obligations while retaining upside potential from the site from long-term growth in container volumes” ASX-listed Qube said in a filing with the stock exchange.

Redevelopment Option

The Sydney deal was announced just one week after Logos was reported to have agreed to buy a warehouse site in the western part of Singapore from airport equipment maker Pteris Global for S$49.7 million ($37.1 million) according to a source familiar with the transaction.

The property at 28 Quality Road in Taman Jurong encompasses a 269090 square foot (25000 square metre) site with a one-storey warehouse and a three-storey attached office block. The part of the property not occupied by Pteris is leased by information management firm Iron Mountain to store records.

The gross floor area spans 220000 square feet out of a maximum allowable 538180 square feet leaving open the possibility of redevelopment to extract more value from the property. The transaction was first revealed in Singapore’s Business Times just one month after Logos agreed to develop a $371 million logistics complex near Kuala Lumpur through a newly established Malaysian joint venture.

CBRE is reported to have brokered the sale of the Singapore facility. Representatives of the property brokerage declined to comment when contacted by Mingtiandi.

Portfolio Sale vs IPO

Should Logos succeed in winning the bidding for Blackstone’s Milestone Logistics there is still a possibility that the assets could be headed for an IPO as an alternative to the portfolio sale according to the Financial Review.

Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan are managing the proposed initial public offering while Eastdil Secured and JLL are reported to have been marketing the portfolio to real estate investors.

The portfolio is 98 percent occupied with an average period to lease expiry of 6.8 years per the local press report.

Asian Expansion

Logos has built up its presence in Asia Pacific as it seeks to capture growth in the region’s logistics markets.

Founded in Australia by Iliffe and Marsh in 2010 Logos entered China in 2012 with Stephen Hawkins establishing Southeast Asia operations in Singapore in 2016 as the company formed a series of partnerships and joint ventures with some of the world’s biggest fund managers.

Quebec pension fund manager Ivanhoe Cambridge first formed a $400 million China-focused joint venture with Logos and CBRE Global Investors in 2015. The Canadian giant followed up on that JV by investing in Logos at the corporate level in 2016. Logos’s first India venture a warehouse development partnership with Assetz Property Group was announced in 2017.

ARA Asset Management acquired its majority stake in Logos in early 2020 for an undisclosed sum joining forces with Ivanhoe Cambridge. The new partners described the transaction as creating “a best-in-class logistics real estate development and investment management platform”.

Other milestones last year included the launch of Logos’s fourth China logistics venture and the company’s first site acquisition in Vietnam.",,,

Commentary by Patrick Duffy | President | Houston

Last January we predicted steady growth for the Houston economy barring a “black swan” event and mentioned the “new Corona Virus in China” as an example. Little did we know that the virus would end up being the Godzilla of black swan events. On the heels of what had been a very robust economic expansion the virus and the global governmental response of massive shutdowns created one of the most dramatic economic crashes in the history of the world. U.S. GDP dropped an unprecedented 31.4% in Q2. While we saw a substantial recovery in the U.S. in Q3 (also an unprecedented 33.4%) and continued recovery in Q4 the lockdowns continue in many states. Most companies in the office sector are still in a work-from-home posture with their employees. Government and Federal Reserve Bank stimulus efforts continue to attempt to mitigate the permanent damage to the underlying economy caused by the virus and associated responses.

Houston had to Cope with a Double Impact

We had the same lockdown approach as most large metro markets and the global shutdowns reduced oil and gas demand by approximately 15% resulting in the lowest oil prices in history. In April of 2020 oil traded at a NEGATIVE $40 per barrel. The U.S. and Canadian rig counts historically averaging approximately 1500 active rigs dropped to 278 in June before “recovering” to 410 at year-end. With only one-third of average rigs active the companies engaged in engineering and oilfield services that support the upstream energy sector were hit very hard.

The good news is that energy demand is projected to surpass supply through year-end 2021 and oil prices have recovered to the high $40s per barrel as of this report. All indications are that we will see oil prices with upside pressure as reserves tighten and new production gradually comes online. This bodes well for the energy sector to see some stabilization and recovery in 2021.

Small businesses especially restaurants and local “mom and pop” retailers have been hit the hardest by the lockdowns with companies moving their employees to work-from-home and out of the typical high-density office markets. These small businesses depend on walk-in traffic which even with the lockdowns partially or entirely removed are still missing the usual client base supplied by nearby office users. Estimates of permanent closures for small businesses are in the 20% range nationally and Houston seems to be following that trend.

The Federal Reserve has signaled that they will continue to be accommodative with close to zero interest rates and liquidity injections as may be required through 21. The incoming administration has signaled massive plans for new spending and unfortunately potential tax increases; however it is unlikely that tax increases will be implemented before 2022. These supportive monetary and fiscal positions should continue to fuel recovery in 2021.

Other states notably California are losing companies and residents to Texas. The recent relocation of Hewlett Packard to Houston is a prime example. We expect this trend will continue to the benefit of Texas cities including Houston. Provided the vaccines prove effective and the global economy continues a steady recovery we believe the bottom has been reached in Houston and that 2021 will see moderate job growth and continued economic recovery. The jury is out on the long-term impacts on inflation of all the money printing that we have seen over the past several years. Real estate has long been a strong inflation hedge and will continue to be an asset of choice for those looking for returns and inflationary hedge over the mid-term.

Population Houston ranks among the leading metropolitan areas in the U.S. in population growth and is the fourth largest city and the fifth largest Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in the nation. Houstons’ MSA consists of nine counties and as of 2020 the region’s population increased by 7.6% since 2015 growing by 507666.

Almost six months have passed since Roland Quandt published information about the Snapdragon 775G during which Qualcomm has released the Snapdragon 888. According to Quandt Qualcomm had been testing the Snapdragon 775G with 12 GB of LPDDR5 RAM 256 GB of UFS 3.1 flash storage and a 120 Hz display. In a preceding tweet Quandt added that Qualcomm had codenamed the Snapdragon 775G 'Cedros' and had assigned it the model number SM7350. Subsequently Digital Chat Station asserted that the Snapdragon 775G could almost match the Snapdragon 865 for performance in AnTuTu.

Now Xiaomi & MIUI News claims to have received high-level documentation about Qualcomm's next upper-midrange SoC. While the Telegram channel did not provide a source for the information published Mishaal Rahman and XDA Developers claim that their source has validated the documents shown below.

According to the documents Qualcomm has based the Snapdragon 775G on a 5 nm process not a 6 nm one as was previously expected. Additionally the Snapdragon 775G is expected to receive a Kryo 6xx CPU although probably not the Kryo 680 CPU that the Snapdragon 888 has. However the Snapdragon 775G will support up to LPDDR5-3200 RAM as the Snapdragon 888 does.

An Adreno 6xx GPU should be on board too but this should come as no surprise since the Snapdragon 765G has an Adreno 620 and the Snapdragon 888 an Adreno 660. Camera details can be found below too including that the 5 nm chipset will have a Spectra 570 Image Signal Processor (ISP). By contrast the Snapdragon 888 has a Spectra 580 and the Snapdragon 765G a Spectra 365. Hence it would seem likely that the Snapdragon 775G's ISP will be closer in performance to that of the Snapdragon 888 than the Snapdragon 765G.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYmVlYm9tLmNvbS9xdWFsY29tbXMtc25hcGRyYWdvbi03NzUtNWctY2hpcHNldC1zcGVjcy1sZWFrZWQtb25saW5lL9IBT2h0dHBzOi8vYmVlYm9tLmNvbS9xdWFsY29tbXMtc25hcGRyYWdvbi03NzUtNWctY2hpcHNldC1zcGVjcy1sZWFrZWQtb25saW5lL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 775 5G Chipset Specs Leaked Online,"Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon 765 5G chipset alongside the Snapdragon 865 back in December of 2019. The tech specs of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 775/ 775G the successor to Snapdragon 765 and 765G have now leaked online. The leak comes from Xiaomiui and cites an internal Qualcomm document as the source.

Snapdragon 775 5G: Leaked Specifications

As per the leaked images of the SM7350 platform the chipset will be manufactured on a 5nm process – the same as the Snapdragon 888. It may feature a Kryo 600-series CPU and support LPDDR5 RAM at 3200 MHz LPDDR4X RAM at 2400 MHz and UFS 3.1 storage.

In the camera department the Spectra 570 ISP (Image Signal Processor) may boast support for up to three 28MP cameras at the same time. Moreover it could also support 64MP + 20MP at 30fps.

Connectivity options of the chipset include mmWave 5G with VoNR (Voice over 5G New Radio) NR CA SA/ NSA support LTE Cat 18 Wi-Fi 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6E 2×2 MIMO Bluetooth 5.2 (Milan) and 256 QAM for uplink and downlink. It may also include the WCD9380/ WCD9385 audio chip.

The channel has also posted a high-level feature comparison of SM7250 (Snapdragon 765) and SM7350 (Snapdragon 775) which you can check out below:

At this moment there’s no way to verify if these alleged specifications are legitimate. However according to XDA‘s report the images are from an earlier revision of the document and hence we may see minor changes to these specifications when Qualcomm makes the chip official whenever it is ready. We’ll be covering when Qualcomm launches the Snapdragon 775 chipset so stay tuned for updates.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15c21hcnRwcmljZS5jb20vZ2Vhci9xdWFsY29tbS1zbmFwZHJhZ29uLTc3NS03NzVnLXNwZWNpZmljYXRpb25zLWxlYWsta3J5by02eHgtY3B1LTVnLXN1cHBvcnQv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubXlzbWFydHByaWNlLmNvbS9nZWFyL3F1YWxjb21tLXNuYXBkcmFnb24tNzc1LTc3NWctc3BlY2lmaWNhdGlvbnMtbGVhay1rcnlvLTZ4eC1jcHUtNWctc3VwcG9ydC8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qualcomm Snapdragon 775 775G Specifications Leak: Kryo 6xx CPU 5G Support and More,"Back in December 2020 Qualcomm made its flagship chipset official yes the Snapdragon 888 processor which is one of the most powerful chipsets offered by Qualcomm. The company is also speculated to launch its premium mid-range processor in the 7 series which is going to be the successor of the Snapdragon 765. According to the new report it seems that Qualcomm is planning to launch the new SoC at the end of March. As per the GSM Arena report this might be called Snapdragon 775 but there is also a possibility that the company might name it the Snapdragon 788.

Some details about the upcoming alleged Snapdragon 775 chipset has been leaked today and the report claims that this has been from an internal presentation. Some reports suggest that the details are accurate but old so we can’t rely on them completely. The important details are the CPU core arrangements and that is leaked in the report.

According to the leak the alleged Snapdragon 775 will arrive with Kryo 6xx cores but this might mean anything. Besides the slides mentioned on the leaked renders suggest that the chipset will be built on a 52nm process similar to the Snapdragon 888. The leak also claims that it will support 3200MHz LPDDR5 and 2400MHz LPDDR4X RAM along with UFS 3.1 Two-Lane HS Gear 4.

Besides the upcoming SoC also tipped to have support for 4K at 60fps video recording three 28-megapixel camera sensors and capable of making use of 64MP+24MP at 30fps at the same time. On the connectivity part the alleged Snapdragon 775 is tipped to arrive with “Wi-Fi 6E with 2×2 MIMO Bluetooth 5.2 (codenamed Milan) LTE Cat.18 Dual 5G mmWave 5G SA and NSA support VoNR and NR CA supporting 4×4 MIMO on the downlink and 2×2 MIMO on the uplink for Sub-6 5G. Sub-6 will work with FDD under 3 GHz and TDD in bands n77 n78 and n79. The Snapdragon 775 will also have the WCD9380/WCD9385 audio chip” as per the GSM Arena report.

Do note that Qualcomm is yet to confirm anything about the launch of the Snapdragon 755. Moreover there is no confirmation of whether the Snapdragon 755 SoC even exists or not. We recommend you to take this information with a pinch of salt and wait for the official announcement.

Expected to be based on 5nm architecture the Qualcomm Snapdragon 775 and Snapdragon 775G may provide better performance than the Snapdragon 765 and Snapdragon 765G SoCs. The leak also hints at support for LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 storage with the Snapdragon 775 series. As of now Qualcomm has not shared any information on the rumoured chipsets so this piece of information should be taken with a pinch of salt.

Qualcomm Snapdragon 775 series specifications (expected)

Xiaomiui a channel on Telegram shared the alleged specifications for the rumoured Qualcomm Snapdragon 775 series of SoCs. Mentioning the Snapdragon 775 and Snapdragon 775G the leaks show they will be based on a 5nm process with Kryo 6-series CPU and support for LPDDR5 RAM clocked at 3200MHz. It will also support LPDDR4x RAM clocked at 2400MHz and UFS 3.1 two-lane HS Gear 4 storage.

In terms of camera support the Snapdragon 775 series is could feature the Spectra 570 ISP with support for up to three 28-megapixel cameras at the same time. It can also process a 64-megapixel sensor along with a secondary 20-megapixel sensor at 30fps. Coming to connectivity the leak shows support for Wi-Fi 6 Wi-Fi 6E LTE Cat 18 mmWave 5G and Sub-6 5G.

It is unclear what the differences between the Snapdragon 775 SoC and Snapdragon 775G SoC will be as the leak does not clarify the same.

The channel also mentions that the Snapdragon 775 series may power the rumoured Mi 11 Lite. However this goes against previous leaks that mention the Snapdragon 732G SoC. It should be noted that a report by XDA Developers mentions the leaked image come from an earlier revision of the official material that is out of date.

As mentioned earlier Qualcomm has not shared any details on the Snapdragon 775 series of SoC and neither has Xiaomi about the rumoured Mi 11 Lite.

Last year we got the Snapdragon 768G which offered better CPU clock speeds & higher GPU frequency. Well now Qualcomm is all set to launch the Snapdragon 775/775G and the specifications of Qualcomm Snapdragon 775 are already here thanks to a telegram channel named “Xiaomiui“. The channel shared the specifications and also revealed that the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G is launching with Snapdragon 775 5G SOC.

Starting with the model number first the Snapdragon 775 bears the model number “SM7350” which shows that it is the successor of “SM7250” i.e. the Snapdragon 765/765G. This is Qualcomm’s first chip that is fabricated based on a 5nm process which means not only it is going to offer better performance but also better power efficiency. While the Snapdragon 765 series offered the Kryo 475 octa-core CPU Snapdragon 775 packs an octa-core Kryo 600 series CPU so the numbers clearly show that there is going to be a big jump in the overall CPU performance. Snapdragon 775 also supports LPDDR5 RAM something that’s not the case with Snapdragon 765/765G.

The Image Signal Processor is Spectra 570 and the chip supports 4K 60fps video recording. It supports three 28 Megapixel sensors working at the same time. There is both Sub-6 5G and mmWave 5G support Bluetooth 5.2 and WCD9380/WCD9385 Audio chip. There is Adreno 600 series GPU as well.

The above image shows the comparison between Snapdragon 765 (SM7250) and the Snapdragon 775 (SM7350). It is also worth mentioning that there are also chances that Qualcomm might launch this chip with a different name like Snapdragon 778. The company did the same last year when it launched Snapdragon 888 when everyone was expecting it to be the Snapdragon 875."

Speculation has been mounting that Ralph Lauren known for the Polo player emblem on its shirts has seen takeover interest from a predator.

City sources have heard rumours the French luxury goods group Kering – run by Francois-Henri Pinault the billionaire husband of Hollywood actress Salma Hayek – could be the company interested in acquiring Ralph Lauren.

Iconic: Ralph Lauren creations have made the company a target for buyers

Kering is said to be on the lookout for a large deal after its closest rival Louis Vuitton owner LVMH run by the billionaire Bernard Arnault bought upmarket jewellery brand Tiffany & Co last year for $15.8billion.

City sources have also linked Kering with a potential takeover of Compagnie Financiere Richemont the owner of luxury jeweller Cartier.

Ralph Lauren started out in 1967 designing men's ties from a room in the Empire State Building in New York and made deliveries to stores himself. His company has grown into one of America's biggest fashion houses worth almost $9billion.

Ralph Lauren and Kering both declined to comment.

Ralph Lauren's shares closed at $122.20 on Friday after falling to just $61 in April last year.",,,,,,,,,

Ringside News exclusively reported in July that this was going to happen. Now WWE could have even bigger plans.

During Wrestling Observer Radio Dave Meltzer discussed NXT’s current plan for TakeOver. There is a thought that they could use Raymond James Stadium for TakeOver and the other WWE shows on the week of WrestleMania to bring in fans and make the events as big as possible.

“The story I’ve heard is it will probably be from [the PC] but then I’ve heard some talk that maybe they’ll go to the [Raymond James Stadium] I guess they’ll announce that this week because I’ve heard the idea of going to the stadium and having like 3800 people for the two shows and then maybe if that was the case then you’d go to the stadium for SmackDown and RAW as well as the two-night WrestleMania which would be six straight nights at Raymond James Stadium if they do that and they may not. The original idea I heard was that the NXT shows will be at the Performance Center we’ll see. Then they move to Tuesday afterwards.”

We’ll have to see what WWE decides to do. They can’t wait to bring in live fans and they are operating in Florida a state that will allow them that luxury.

WrestleMania week will be the biggest that WWE can make out of it this year. We will continue monitoring this situation for an official announcement. After all tickets are not even on sale yet for WrestleMania.

About the Raymond James Gasparilla Festival of the Arts

For over 50 years artists and art lovers from all parts of the country migrate every winter to the Raymond James Gasparilla Festival of the Arts. The country's most accomplished and emerging artists showcase work at one of Florida's largest outdoor art festivals. The Festival is organized and operated by hundreds of volunteers working year-round.

Held annually during the first weekend in March in downtown Tampa artists feature work in ceramic digital drawing fiber glass jewelry mixed media painting photography printmaking sculpture watercolor and wood. The esteemed event also features local young artists' works a weekend full of live entertainment a children's art activity area and more. The 50th Festival was held at Julian B. Lane Riverfront Park in Tampa FL.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9zcG9ydHMvdG9tLWJyYWR5LXJvb2tpZS1jYXJkLWF1Y3Rpb25lZC1yZWNvcmQtMTMybS0yMDIxLTAzLTA2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Brady rookie card auctioned for record $1.32M,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/tom-brady-rookie-card-auctioned-record-132m-2021-03-06/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9zcG9ydHMvdG9tLWJyYWR5LXJvb2tpZS1jYXJkLWF1Y3Rpb25lZC1yZWNvcmQtMTMybS0yMDIxLTAzLTA2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2bmV0d29yay5jb20vbmV3cy9kaWdpdGFsLW1lbnUtYm9hcmRzLXJlYWR5LXRvLXNoaW5lLWJyaWdodC1hdC1zdXBlci1ib3dsLWx20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digital Menu Boards Ready to Shine Bright at Super Bowl LV,"The Super Bowl might look a little different this year but it’s not stopping Raymond James Stadium from serving up its game day menu. The 66000-seat stadium plans to welcome 22000 fans as they witness Tampa Bay face off with Kansas City in Super Bowl LV.

Since you can't do football without food the onsite concessionaire at the stadium is doing its part to ensure fans enjoy the festivities while away from their seats. As patrons browse dining options throughout the concourse they’ll notice that each digital menu board has undergone a complete rebrand for the big game.

Digital menus are relatively new to the Tampa Bay FL stadium. In 2019 the team partnered with Ping HD a full-service digital signage solutions and software company to replace the previous static menu signage.



Ping HD deployed 140 Samsung (SSP) smart signage displays around the stadium. Custom content was designed for each concession area to simplify item selection support theme branding and speed up the ordering process.

The Concessionaire needed a solution that gave them the ability to change their menus quickly. EngagePHD was chosen as the content management solution because it gives them the ability to update and manage all 140 screens from one cloud-based interface.



“The cloud-based solution made it easy for stadium staff to quickly change each digital signage display to match the look and feel of the big game” said Joe Malouff director of marketing at Ping HD.

To further simplify each digital menu integrates seamlessly with Bypass Mobile the point of sale system used at each register. Pricing inventory and other product details are managed within the Bypass Mobile dashboard and then fed directly to each digital signage screen.

""Upgrading the menu boards at [this] stadium has been a fantastic joint project. Implementing an integrated state-of-the-art platform with the ByPass Mobile point of sale system and the Ping HD EngagePHD CMS has helped drive operational efficiency fan engagement and increased food and beverage revenue"" concluded Greg Lewis partner at Ping HD.

Its highlight is the upgrade to Nvidia’s brand-new RTX 3080 generation of GPUs and the Schenker logo on the lid has been replaced with an XMG logo.

Schenker’s own webstore bestware.com allows for a very detailed individualization with the only fixed component being the processor. While our review unit came equipped with an RTX 3080 over the Key 15’s RTX 2080 Super Max-Q you can also select an RTX 3070 instead. Please note that our review unit also came without a valid Windows license. While the operating system was preloaded on the device it will need to be activated with a valid key and license. Schenker will sell you an optional Windows 10 Home license for an additional 100 Euros.

According to the OEM the Pro 15 is not only a highly portable gaming laptop but also a smart workstation for creative professionals. In other words a true jack of all trades instead of a pure-bred gaming device.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vYXUucGNtYWcuY29tL2xhcHRvcHMvODU5NjcvbXNpLWdlNzYtcmFpZGVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSI GE76 Raider - Review 2021,"Popular gaming laptops have gotten thinner and lighter in recent years but there's still something to be said for big-screen big-bore power. The MSI GE76 Raider (starts at $1499) is certainly large and in charge a 17.3-inch system packing a blazing Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 ""Ampere"" GPU in our $2899 review configuration. For that price this model is loaded with deluxe options including a 300Hz display 32GB of memory and a 1TB solid-state drive. While super-fast the Raider doesn't blow away the more compact RTX 3070-equipped Alienware m15 R4 or outrun more portable (and more attractive) 17-inch options. Still if you like its design demand a display larger than 15.6 inches and want a rig that can go toe to toe with just about anybody's the GE76 Raider has the performance and feature chops to satisfy.

Come for the Big Screen Stay for the LEDs

Though big the MSI isn't a behemoth; we've tested larger machines (like the hulking Acer Predator Helios 700) over the years. But at 1.08 by 15.6 by 10.6 inches (HWD) and 6.4 pounds it dwarfs the 15.6-inch-screened roughly-4-pound gaming rigs we've seen by the score recently. It's also bigger than 17-inch laptops that do try to maintain some portability like the Alienware m17 R3 (0.88 by 15.7 by 11.6 inches 6.5 pounds) the Razer Blade Pro 17 (0.78 by 15.6 by 10.2 inches 6.1 pounds) and the Gigabyte Aero 17 HDR XA (0.84 by 15.6 by 10.6 inches 5.5 pounds).

The GE76 Raider's size won't go unnoticed but its design has its own visual flourishes too. The lid is a metallic silver color while the base of the laptop is black—fairly standard here—but there are a few twists that add some flair without overdoing it. The lid bears small geometric corners and an MSI logo that blends in as opposed to the red and black version we sometimes see...

...while the front edge of the laptop holds a clear plastic bar with customizable RGB lighting inside. The lighting flows through the bar in appealing fashion an uncommon feature. You can choose from a variety of colors and effects via the provided SteelSeries software (which also controls the keyboard backlighting). That's about all the visual flair you get from this laptop—the rest is all about features and power.

A Blazing-Fast Display and a Full Suite of Ports

Those features start with that roomy screen which boasts a 300Hz refresh rate. The full HD (1080p) resolution is more pedestrian but a good fit for actually reaching frame rates that can take advantage of the fast refresh. You may crave higher resolution to see a sharper picture but that only makes gaming more demanding and as you'll see in the performance section 1080p play can be daunting enough at the highest image-quality settings. The bezels around the screen are fairly thin and the picture quality on the whole is clear and bright.

The keyboard is pretty nice to use as the keys have plenty of travel but are bouncy rather than mushy. The keycaps seem a touch small which feels wrong given the size of the chassis though the inclusion of a numeric keypad is likely the reason. The keyboard features per-key customizable backlighting. There's not much to say about the touchpad a simple plastic solution that felt neither especially pleasant nor poor.

The good news about this chunky machine is that it has plenty of room for ports. The left side offers a USB 3.1 Type-A port a USB-C port and the headphone jack while there are two more USB-A 3.1 ports and an SD card slot on the right.

The rear edge holds quite a few more: HDMI and mini DisplayPort video outputs another USB-C port and an Ethernet jack.

Components and Performance Testing

As mentioned our MSI GE76 Raider review unit is priced at an eye-watering $2899. That top-of-the-line outlay gets you an eight-core 2.2GHz (5.0GHz turbo) Intel Core i7-10870H processor 32GB of RAM a 1TB solid-state drive and the 300Hz screen backed by a GeForce RTX 3080 GPU.

By contrast the $1499 base model comes with a Core i7-10750H CPU 16GB of memory a 1TB SSD an RTX 3060 GPU and a 144Hz screen. That's a pretty good deal and the in-between GeForce RTX 3070 models might hit the sweet spot. For example a Raider equipped just like our test unit except with an RTX 3070 instead of 3080 graphics card is $2299. Another RTX 3070 unit with a slightly lesser Core i7 processor and 240Hz display is $1999.

For our benchmark charts we pitted the Raider against four other high-end gaming laptops. The Alienware m17 R3 ($3409.99 as configured) is another 17.3-inch system with Nvidia's best previous-generation GPU. The MSI GS66 Stealth and the Alienware m15 R4 ($2699 and $2499 as configured respectively) bring their own RTX 30 Series GPUs to the comparison while the dual-screen Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 ($3699.99 as configured) carries a blazing AMD Ryzen 9 processor into battle against Intel's best. You can see their basic specs in the table below. (See more about how we test laptops.)

Productivity Storage and Media Tests

PCMark 10 and 8 are holistic performance suites developed by the PC benchmark specialists at UL (formerly Futuremark). The PCMark 10 test we run simulates different real-world productivity and content creation workflows. We use it to assess overall system performance for office-centric tasks such as word processing spreadsheet jockeying web browsing and videoconferencing. PCMark 8 meanwhile has a storage subtest that we use to assess the speed of the system's boot drive. Both tests yield a proprietary numeric score; higher numbers are better.

All of these systems are way above the threshold for snappy performance in everyday tasks. If your processor is good enough for high-end gaming it won't break a sweat opening multiple browser tabs and several applications at once. Similarly these laptops' fast SSDs all help reduce boot and game loading times.

Next is Maxon's CPU-crunching Cinebench R15 test which is fully threaded to make use of all available processor cores and threads. Cinebench stresses the CPU rather than the GPU to render a complex image. The result is a proprietary score indicating a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads.

Cinebench is often a good predictor of our Handbrake video editing trial another tough threaded workout that's highly CPU-dependent and scales well with cores and threads. In it we put a stopwatch on test systems as they transcode a standard 12-minute clip of 4K video (the open-source Blender demo movie Tears of Steel) to a 1080p MP4 file. It's a timed test and lower results are better.

We also run a custom Adobe Photoshop image-editing benchmark. Using an early 2018 release of the Creative Cloud version of Photoshop we apply a series of 10 complex filters and effects to a standard JPEG test image timing each operation and adding up the total (lower times are better). This test stresses the CPU storage subsystem and RAM but it can also take advantage of most GPUs to speed up the process of applying filters so systems with powerful graphics chips may see a boost.

There isn't much difference between the Intel systems in these tests while the AMD processor's performance is clearly superior. These are of course primarily meant as gaming machines but the Zephyrus can serve as a pro-grade media editing workstation (especially with its extra screen) while the others are capable enough for occasional editing jobs or hobbywork.

Synthetic Graphics Tests

UL's 3DMark suite measures relative graphics muscle by rendering sequences of highly detailed gaming-style 3D graphics that emphasize particles and lighting. We run two different 3DMark subtests Sky Diver and Fire Strike which are suited to different types of systems. Both are DirectX 11 benchmarks but Sky Diver is more suited to midrange PCs while Fire Strike is more demanding and lets high-end PCs and gaming rigs strut their stuff. The results are proprietary scores.

Next up is another synthetic graphics test this time from Unigine Corp. Like 3DMark the Superposition test renders and pans through a detailed 3D scene and measures how the system copes. In this case it's rendered in the company's eponymous Unigine engine offering a different 3D workload scenario than 3DMark for a second opinion on the machine's graphical prowess.

The Raider led the way in these gaming simulations delivering the most raw graphics power. I will add that in these and most other tests this large laptop wasn't too loud considering its muscle—even using the MSI control software's top performance setting as I did the cooling fans were audible but not annoying. The balanced performance setting tones the fans down further though the system's never silent.

Real-World Gaming Tests

The synthetic tests above are helpful for measuring general 3D aptitude but it's hard to beat full retail video games for judging gaming performance. Far Cry 5 and Rise of the Tomb Raider are both modern high-fidelity titles with built-in benchmarks that illustrate how a system handles real-world video games at various settings. We run them under DirectX 11 and 12 respectively at 1080p resolution at the games' medium and highest quality presets.

Here things are a little less clear. Going in you'd expect the Raider to win—it's a relatively thick 17-inch laptop with Nvidia's top GPU. The Zephyrus and Stealth also have RTX 3080s but they're thinner systems and should be more thermally restricted. Instead the results are a bit of a mixed bag. The Alienware m17's RTX 2080 Super outperformed several 30 Series competitors including the Raider and the RTX 3070-based Alienware m15 beat the Raider in Far Cry 5.

To collect a greater variety of results I also ran the in-game benchmarks of Metro Exodus and Rainbow Six: Siege. These games give us figures for a demanding title with ray tracing and a high-frame-rate competitive multiplayer title respectively. Using Metro Exodus' RTX preset the Raider averaged 77fps good for a strenuous AAA game with ray tracing enabled. It's nowhere near the screen's refresh-rate ceiling but it easily exceeds the 60fps that avid gamers demand.

In Rainbow Six: Siege the Raider averaged 264fps at the maximum preset and 290fps at the low preset (both at 100% render scaling). This is one genre where players often use low graphics settings to maximize performance and needless to say the MSI does make good use of its high-refresh screen and is a dream for competitive gamers.

Overall there's a load of variance in performance between games and between GPUs. This isn't news; in our RTX 30 Series testing to date we've learned that manufacturers' particular implementations of each individual GPU greatly affects performance so two RTX 3080s may deliver quite different results or even lose to a lower-tier GPU configured at a higher wattage. Add the thermal layout of each laptop and differences between games and it's nearly impossible to assume performance from reading specs on paper.

Bottom line: The GE76 Raider is by any standards very fast and well-suited for high-refresh gaming but considering its size and price tag you might hope for a power advantage that doesn't really materialize. The RTX 3070-based Alienware m15 R4 gives more bang for the buck and the Zephyrus Duo's steep price is offset by its exotic processor and dual 4K displays. If you like the Raider's looks a less expensive RTX 3070 configuration of it might be your best bet.

Battery Rundown Test

After fully recharging the laptop we set up the machine in power-save mode (as opposed to balanced or high-performance mode) where available and make a few other battery-conserving tweaks in preparation for our unplugged video rundown test. (We also turn Wi-Fi off putting the laptop in airplane mode.) In this test we loop a video—a locally stored 720p file of the same Tears of Steel short we use in our Handbrake test—with screen brightness set at 50% and volume at 100% until the system quits.

The Raider won't keep going on a long trip but it isn't exactly travel-friendly to begin with. Seventeen-inch gaming laptops aren't known for great battery life; the MSI's nearly six hours of runtime is actually quite an improvement from past systems in this class. It'll give you a modest amount of time off the charger if you want to take it to the couch or sit up in bed though it's awfully heavy for your lap.

Big Power at a Big Price

The MSI GE76 Raider delivers what you'd expect: top-end power with a big fast screen plus the supporting features storage and physical flair to back it up.

The Aero's case is visually very appealing. The subtle relatively slim aluminum chassis is only decorated with the Aero logo and some glossy black stripes. Together with the sturdy case this creates a thoroughly high-quality impression. The build quality is good and there are no uneven gaps; only the webcam cover under the screen looks a bit cheap.

The lid has a recessed section allowing it to be opened with one hand without any problems which proved to be very useful in practice. Compared to the predecessor there were no changes in the Aero 15 XC in this regard.",,,,,,

In the early 2010s Meitu reached such dominance in the portrait touch-up space that its eponymous flagship app became a verb for ""photo beautifying"" in China. But in recent years as smartphones became to offer built-in filters photo editors like Meitu are struggling to hold their lead. Meitu's stock shrank from HK$18 apiece in 2017 to less than HK$3 today.

As the company turns 13 years old and seeks alternative growth it sets its eyes on cryptocurrency.

Meitu purchased 15000 units of Ether and 379.1214267 units of Bitcoin worth around $22.1 million and $17.9 million respectively on March 5 in open market transactions the company disclosed Sunday. The purchase is the first tranche of the firm's investment plan to buy up to $100 million worth of cryptocurrency which is financed by its cash reserves.

In recent times Meitu chairman Cai Wensheng has been an outspoken advocate of blockchain technologies. Though China has banned initial coin offerings and crypto trading exchanges Cai said in 2018 that he personally bought about 10000 bitcoins.

His support for cryptocurrencies is manifested in Meitu's latest investment move. In the disclosure the company states:

""The Board takes the view that blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt both existing financial and technology industries similar to the manner in which mobile internet has disrupted the PC internet and many other offline industries. The Board believes that the blockchain industry is still in its early stage analogous to the mobile internet industry in circa 2005.""

It continues: ""Against this backdrop the Board believes cryptocurrencies have ample room for appreciation in value and by allocating part of its treasury in cryptocurrencies can also serve as a diversification to holding cash treasury management.""

Meitu further explains that the Bitcoin investment is part of its ""asset allocation"" plan while its bet on Ether will aid its general blockchain endeavor wherein it's considering baking blockchain into its various overseas businesses including Ethereum-based dApps. It's also looking to invest in overseas blockchain projects ""that can be synergistic to its large user base.""

As of June 2020 Meitu claimed nearly 300 million monthly active users on its suite of apps released across the globe.

Davis has with major partnerships with companies like Michelob Ultra (BUD) Ruffles (PEP) and is getting advice from some of the best in the arena. The latter presented him with the unique opportunity to be able to ""own your own ridges...to have your own chip...that was pretty cool"" he told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview.

Last year PepsiCo's Frito-Lay unveiled the the NBA All-Star's new signature flavor Ruffles Lime & Jalapeño. Davis explained that his love of spice drove the ""great combination"" with the help of Ruffles. This year Davis also starred in a new commercial dubbed 'Ruffles Without Ridges' featuring T-Pain and King Bach.

This year Ruffles announced a similar endorsement deal with Boston Celtics All-Star Jayson Tatum to create a Flamin' Hot BBQ chip. Pepsi and the NBA also announced it renewed its multi-year renewal of their marketing partnership which began in 2015 after a 28-year relationship with Coca-Cola (KO).

'Success on and off the floor'

In May of 2020 Davis ranked #44 in Forbes' list of 2020 The World's Highest-Paid Athletes Earnings at $30.4 million dollars. The ball player told Yahoo Finance he listened to ""a couple of people"" when it comes to decision-making on what business moves comes next — including megastar teammate LeBron James.

There's ""a couple of friends that I talk to..I talk to [Lebron] a lot"" Davis said. ""He's very successful on and off the floor. So it's a very you know reliable resource for me....I have people I talk to to get better on the floor and how I can expand and my brand off the floor as well.""

As the sports card industry sees a major boom Davis's rookie card also saw a major surge topping the $1 million dollar valuation mark. He joked that he'd have ""to tell his parents about that"" and floated the idea of getting involved in the trade.

""I might have to get into that space... it's very humbling"" he said. ""I mean it's a great honor to have one of my cards sell for that much."" He believes it's an assessment of ""all the hard work and dedication to my craft that I've put into.""

Yet some experts think valuations in sports cards might be overinflated. Sports-betting consultant ""Vegas"" Dave Oancea told Yahoo Finance that valuation may not actually be the price of the card explaining that the run-up in Davis' card is simply because ""the market is just popping right now.""

Story continues

He noted ""someone with money bought the card because they're all being manipulated in the head by these fake prices.""

Consistent with the European Green Recovery and its aspiration to shift to a more circular economy P&G has been the first FMCG company to join the RecyClass initiative a certification approach for recycling requirements to help deliver the goal of making plastic packaging circular with traceability along the whole value chain. P&G obtained a record high of 12 product and technology approvals on its packaging across Hair Care Home Care and Fabric Care brands confirming they meet the Design-for-Recycling criteria guidelines determined by RecyClass.

P&G Shave Care brands Gillette and Venus are making strides to eliminate 545 metric tons of plastic over a year by moving to recyclable carton packaging ia.e. the equivalent of over 55 million water bottles. Moving towards a reuse model breathes longevity into existing products to minimise waste. Household haircare brands Head and Shoulders Pantene Herbal Essences and Aussie launched at scale a new reusable 100% aluminium bottle alongside its recyclable refill pouch made using 60% less plastic enabling consumers to maximise product lifecycles.

“Much has changed in the last year but our commitment to enabling and inspiring positive impacts through our supply chain our brands and our partnerships has remained the same” said Virginie Helias P&G Chief Sustainability Officer. “We are innovating to accelerate the development of the circular economy: from spearheading the Holy Grail intelligent sorting concept reducing our use of virgin petroleum plastic and increasing recycled material content to developing alternative refill models at scale. This is a combination of innovation and collective action.”

Reducing plastic use and increasing circularity

RecyClass’ key focus is to drive plastic packaging circularity P&G is named as the first FMCG company to join the initiative an independent platform originated from Plastic Recyclers Europe (PRE). P&G has received 12 product and technology approvals for its brands Oral B Tide Ariel and more all of whom have redesigned their packs to make them recyclable and meet the RecyClass requirements. This cross-industry collaboration is essential to drive scale and deliver on P&G’s circularity goals.

Higher recycled content means reducing dependency upon fossil fuel. More than 10000 tonnes of recycled plastic are now used every year across P&G Fabric and Home Care brands in Fairy Mr Proper Swiffer and Lenor.

Breathing new life into existing materials by efficient recycling

Recyclable packaging is often the most familiar starting point to engage with the notion of a circular economy. Improving the recycling rates is essential to bring a new life for exiting materials. Led by P&G in 2015 Project HolyGrail is an award-winning technology designed to enhance packaging waste sorting in the EU with the objective to improve both the quality and quantity of recycled plastic. This watermarking technology is gaining momentum and is now expanding as part of AIM the European Brands Association key initiatives. More than 120 companies from across the value chain are participating in this pioneering project. Outside sorting data management and consumer engagement are key pillars to the initiative. Increasing consumer participation and adopting advanced sorting technologies are essential to improve the recycling rates in Europe. P&G is hopeful that this effort to demonstrate the potential of the technology will be recognised by the European Commission and incorporated into their plans for the reform of the Packaging & Packaging Waste Directive.

Beyond efficient sorting to enable circularity easy-to-recycle materials should be used at scale. Ensuring packaging remains functional whilst meeting the requirements for recycling systems across Europe is crucial to P&G’s innovation work.

In Europe P&G’s Fabric & Home care brands including Ariel Lenor and Dash pods bags and Fairy Automatic Dishwashing capsules bags started transitioning from a multilayer non-recyclable flexible packaging to a single layer recyclable packaging made of Polyethylene. This new packaging follows local eco-design criteria to ensure the films are compatible within local recycling streams. Improving the packaging of everyday items such as Oral B’s first HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) tubes is another example of how millions of households can now recycle their toothpaste packaging in existing streams. In the same bathroom Gillette and Venus have introduced brand new modern and sustainable packaging on their refillable razors range which sees the brand switch from plastic packaging to recyclable cardboard packaging.

Break the cycle to end waste through Reuse

Moving towards a consumer reuse consumption model breathes longevity into existing products to minimise waste. P&G enters the next phase with LOOP following pilot programs in New York and Paris. The 18 months pilot has taught us the importance of disruptive innovative refillable packaging that delights and is convenient. Through e-commerce expansion LOOP is looking to derive more consumer insights such as purchase cycles the preferred offers and the environmental impact at use. More learnings are essential to secure a reuse Model which delivers all the environmental and the consumer benefits.

In addition the cross-industry efforts with LOOP P&G is innovating with a breakthrough scaled model on reuse. P&G Hair Care brands Head & Shoulders Pantene Herbal Essences and Aussie are now able to make huge difference to how people combat bathroom waste. A new reusable 100% aluminium bottle and recyclable refill pouch en-masse is now available in many stores across Europe. This will enable 200 million European households to recycle reduce and reuse. This will result in 300 million fewer plastic bottles being produced yearly.

Bayern Munich 4-2 Borussia Dortmund

Goals: 0-1 Haaland (2') 0-2 Haaland (9') 1-2 Lewandowski (26') 2-2 Lewandowski (44') 3-2 Goretzka (88') 4-2 Lewandowski (89')

There was good reason so much of the pre-match narrative had centred around goal-brokers Lewandowski and Haaland. The two strikers shared four first-half goals with Haaland laying down the gauntlet inside 120 seconds with an 18-yard strike that flew past Manuel Neuer off the outstretched leg of Jerome Boateng. The Dortmund No.9 doubled his tally in the ninth minute applying a routine finish to Thorgan Hazard's inch-perfect cut-back and might have added a third on 25 minutes had Thomas Meunier shown more composure in the final third. Bayern heeded the warning as Leroy Sane got the better of Nico Schulz and fizzed a cross-shot onto the toe of Lewandowski to turn in at the far post for 2-1. The Bundesliga's top scorer had an effort charged down and fired over but made amends from the penalty spot late in the half after Mahmoud Dahoud was adjudged by VAR review to have impeded Kingsley Coman.

Dortmund returned fire within moments of the restart as Hazard rocketed a cross from Schulz into the side netting. Bayern responded in kind but Marwin Hitz was able to fend off an effort from Coman after spilling Joshua Kimmich's initial strike. Having left the field of play through injury on the hour-mark Haaland watched Lewandowski blaze over from 18 yards following a fine piece of play from Sane in the build-up. Lewandowski linked up with Serge Gnabry with 15 minutes of normal time remaining but the Bayern substitute's effort took a deflection on its way into the grateful arms of Hitz. Dortmund were clinging on as Jude Bellingham thwarted Kimmich in the closing stages before Leon Goretzka thrashed in a half clearance to give Bayern the lead for the first time. Lewandowski completed his hat-trick soon after to restore Bayern's two-point lead over RB Leipzig at the top of the table.

Match stats

Lewandowski has scored 20 goals in 14 Bundesliga meetings with Dortmund and at least once in 13 of his last 14 top-flight appearances. He is the first player to reach 31 Bundesliga goals after 24 matches of a season.

Haaland scored his 31st and 32nd Bundesliga goals on his 34th appearance. Only Uwe Seeler reached 32 goals faster (33 games).

Dortmund scored twice in the opening 10 minutes of a game against Bayern for the first time in 104 attempts.

Bayern are the league's 71-goal top scorers. It’s over a year since they failed to fire in the Bundesliga (0-0 against RB Leipzig on 9 February 2020).

There were 14 goal attempts in the first half.

Dortmund have lost their last seven league games in Munich.

Dortmund had appeared on course for a first win at the Allianz Arena since the 2012/13 campaign after Erling Haaland’s early brace.

Lewandowski though started the fightback when he turned the ball in at the back post in the 26th minute before levelling from a penalty just before half-time which had been given following a VAR review.

Leon Goretzka completed the turnarond when he volleyed in a clearance during the 88th minute.

There was still enough time for Lewandowski the Bundesliga’s top scorer to chalk up his treble in added time with a low shot from outside the box.

RB Leipzig had earlier moved above Bayern at the top of the table with a 3-0 win at Freiburg which was a sixth straight Bundesliga victory for Julian Nagelsmann’s side.

Christopher Nkunku put the visitors in front from close range just before half-time.

Alexander Sorloth doubled the lead in the 64th minute and substitute Emil Forsberg added a late third with a first-time finish from 18 yards

Third-placed Wolfsburg slipped to an unexpected 2-1 defeat at Hoffenheim where they finished with 10 men.

Christoph Baumgartner gave the hosts an early lead which was a first goal conceded by Wolfsburg in seven games before Dutchman Wout Weghorst equalised in the 23rd minute with a chipped finish.

Andrej Kramaric though had Hoffenheim back in front before half-time.

Wolfsburg’s miserable afternoon was compounded when substitute Paulo Otavio was sent off in stoppage time for denying a goal-scoring opportunity.

Patrik Schick struck with 14 minutes left to give Bayer Leverkusen a 1-0 win at Borussia Monchengladbach and remain in contention for the top six as the hosts suffered a third successive league defeat.

Hertha Berlin finally secured a first Bundesliga win in 10 matches as they came from behind to beat Augsburg 2-1.

Laszlo Benes fired the visitors ahead inside two minutes but Krzysztof Piatek equalised just after the hour and then with only a minute left Dodi Lukebakio slotted in a winner from the penalty spot.

Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart drew 1-1 with both goals coming within two minutes during the second half at the Commerzbank Arena.

Sasa Kalajdzic gave the visitors the lead from close range in the 67th minute but it was short-lived as Filip Kostic who earlier had seen a goal disallowed by VAR quickly pulled Frankfurt level.

In LaLiga Barcelona continued their impressive form with a 2-0 win at Osasuna to close up on leaders Atletico Madrid.

Jordi Alba fired the visitors ahead in the 30th minute with teenage substitute Ilaix Moriba adding a late second for his first Barcelona goal.

It was a fourth league win in five games for Ronald Koeman’s side who kept the pressure on at the top – now just two points behind Atletico ahead of Sunday’s derby with Real Madrid.

Sevilla had earlier missed the chance to close on the top three after they suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at relegation-battlers Elche.

Julen Lopetegui’s side had been looking to respond from their Copa Del Rey semi-final exit against Barcelona in midweek.

Raul Guti though gave the home side the lead with 20 minutes left before Guido Carrillo’s header went in off the post.

Luuk De Jong struck a consolation goal in stoppage time but there was to be no more late drama as Sevilla slumped to a third successive LaLiga defeat and Elche moved out of the bottom three.

Alvaro Negredo’s strike just before the break was enough to give Cadiz a 1-0 win over strugglers Eibar – who saw an early goal ruled out by VAR.

Eibar then had a second-half penalty from goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic saved by opposite number Jeremias Ledesma as they dropped to 18th.

Real Valladolid though boosted their survival hopes with a 2-1 home win over Getafe who finished with 10 men.

Oscar Plano gave Valladolid the lead in the 14th minute with Sean Weissman soon adding a second.

Jaime Mata pulled a goal back for Getafe ahead of the break with the forward later shown a straight red card for a poor tackle with five minutes left.

Alvaro Morata struck twice as Juventus came from behind to beat Lazio 3-1 and move third in Serie A.

Cristiano Ronaldo started on the bench and it was Lazio who went ahead in the 14th minute through Joaquin Correa.

Adrien Rabiot equalised five minutes before half-time with an angled drive before Morata added a quick-fire brace in the space of three second-half minutes to wrap up victory.

Morata put the Bianconeri in front following a counter-attack in the 57th minute and then slotted home from the penalty spot after Aaron Ramsey had been bundled over.

Udinese beat Sassuolo 2-0 with a late first-half goal from Fernando Llorente his first for the club and Roberto Pereyra’s stoppage-time strike on the counter-attack.

Saturday’s earlier kick-off saw Spezia fight back to draw 1-1 at home against Benevento.

Daniele Verde equalised when he knocked in a rebound with just 19 minutes left after Adolfo Gaich had put the visitors in front midway through the first-half for his first Serie A goal.",,,

One discount clothing chain thinks it can step in to fill some of those vacancies.

Burlington Stores plans to open 100 new stores this year and sees an opportunity to reach 2000 US stores in the future the company said Thursday. Previously Burlington (formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory) expected to build 1000 stores. It currently has more than 750 outlets.

Burlington said in a news release that it was increasing its total store target because of the ""opportunity presented by accelerating retail disruption and industry wide store closures.""

Burlington offers women men and kids' clothing home goods footwear and says it sells its merchandise at up to 60% below other retailers' prices. Only 25% of its transactions are through credit cards and the company's core shoppers typically make less than customers who shop at department stores and online competitors according to the company. And it doesn't sell products through its website. Instead the site tells visitors to think of it as a guide to their next trip to its stores.

Burlington has what it calls an ""opportunistic buying"" approach to securing inventory. When designer brands produce too many clothes or department stores cancel orders Burlington steps in to buy the leftover inventory. That approach allows it to rotate in new styles and fashions to drive shoppers to stores say analysts and contributes to its ""treasure hunt"" appeal.

Bargain hunters in recent years have turned to ""off-price"" retailers such as Burlington TJX the parent of TJ Maxx Marshalls and HomeGoods and Ross Stores say analysts. Before the pandemic online sellers and these chains were gaining market share against traditional department stores and clothing stores. The pandemic has sped up the shift to online shopping and caused a wave of store closures.

Burlington expects those trends to work in its favor ""leading to further consolidation and additional closures of full price bricks-and-mortar retail stores"" CEO Michael O'Sullivan said on a call with analysts Thursday.

As stores close ""many shoppers especially more affluent time-starved shoppers will migrate more of their spending online"" O'Sullivan predicts. ""But we anticipate that other shoppers more value-oriented shoppers will find their way to off-price.""

Burlington also said it will open smaller stores in the future that carry less merchandise and have lower operating costs than traditional stores.

With its new smaller stores Burlington may move into Pier 1 or Modell's Sporting Goods locations said David Ritter managing director at Alvarez & Marsal Consumer and Retail Group. Both chains filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2020 and are closing all their stores.

""Unfortunately it has been a difficult few years for brick-and-mortar retail so Burlington should have a wealth of available options"" Ritter said in an email. Burlington in the past has moved into stores previously occupied by chains that filed for bankruptcy such as K-Mart Toys ""R"" Us Bon-Ton and Sports Authority he said.

This story was updated with the latest information.

A Tennessee man accused of holding his teenage daughter captive for 17 months may have brought her to the Tampa Bay area or Florida in recent weeks authorities say.

John Oliver Westbrook 42 is accused of kidnapping his daughter Daphne in October 2019 according to the Hamilton County District Attorney’s Office in Chattanooga Tenn.

She was 16 when she visited him for a weekend in Chattanooga but never returned authorities say going missing along with her two dogs Fern and Strawberry.

Now she is 17 and Tennessee authorities believed earlier this month that they may be hiding in the bay area or passing through the area. The could have been in the city of Tampa or on their way to Sebring to stay with a relative. They could also have departed Florida by now.

The father’s sister Starla Westbrook — aka “Sharlena Peters” on Facebook and YouTube — lives and works at a Ross Dress for Less store there authorities say but she has refused to cooperate with investigators. Sebring is about a 90-mile drive southwest of Tampa.

The sister’s Sebring home was raided this week by investigators who confiscated her electronic devices according to news reports.

Florida issued an Amber Alert for Daphne Westbrook on Friday and said they may be traveling in an orange 1971 Volkswagen Beetle with no windshield or tag. However authorities did not say if father and daughter are still believed to be in Florida.

Daphne Westbrook is being held against her will and cannot communicate with the outside world authorities say. They believe she has been incapacitated by being kept drugged or intoxicated. The teen has been kept out of school away from doctors and has been deprived of medication according to Tennessee authorities.

“She is in increasingly at serious risk of physical and emotional danger and we need your help to find her” said a statement from the Hamilton County District Attorney’s Office.

AMBER ALERT: We’re issuing an AMBER Alert in the ongoing search for Daphne Westbrook who is 17 and missing from Chattanooga.



There are unique circumstances to this case which we will detail in this thread.

The father has been indicted on criminal charges. Authorities believe they have been in New Mexico and in recent weeks Colorado Springs Colo. But they believe he will re-locate because the kidnapping case has been publicized in the Denver media market.

John Westbrook is difficult to track authorities say because he is an information technology expert familiar with security matters and technologies such as Bitcoin and blockchain. His communications are “near-impossible to trace” prosecutors say which has made it “difficult to generate significant leads in this case.”

Westbrook is described as a white man about 6-foot-4 weighing roughly 200 pounds. He has blue eyes and brown hair. The 17-year-old is described as a 5-foot-2 white female with brown hair weighing about 110 pounds. Westbrook may have altered the appearance of both using hair dye and false teeth investigators say.

Anyone who has information about the whereabouts of the father or daughter or spots them is asked to call the Hamilton County District Attorney’s Office at 423-209-7425. Tips can be emailed to FindingDaphne@hcdatn.org. They could also call 911 to contact their local law enforcement agency.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vY2FuYWRhL2FydGljbGUtZnJlZHJpay1lYXRvbi1zYXctdGhlLWRlbWlzZS1vZi1oaXMtZmFtaWx5cy1kZXBhcnRtZW50LXN0b3JlLWVtcGlyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fredrik Eaton saw the demise of his family's department store empire,"Open this photo in gallery: Fredrik Eaton of the T. Eaton Company smiles as he addresses Eaton's employees outside the company's flagship store at the Eaton Centre in Toronto on Aug. 15 1997.Kevin Frayer/The Canadian Press

Fredrik Eaton belonged to the fourth – and final – generation to run Eaton’s the family’s department store empire. One of four brothers he had more in-store experience than any of his brothers starting on the sales floor and rising to run the firm from 1977 to 1988. Mr. Eaton who died at home in Caledon Ont. on Feb. 20 at the age of 82 also served as Canada’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in the early 1990s.

Less than a decade after Mr. Eaton’s tenure as chairman president and CEO of the T. Eaton Co. Ltd. the once-dominant retailer sought bankruptcy protection having fallen out of step with the times. The company had been thrashed by its competitors including Sears and Walmart which arrived in Canada in 1995. In response Eaton’s had made the mistake of aiming for the high-end market.

The department stores were sold to Sears and the Eaton family’s name was removed.

It is hard to imagine now two decades after the company’s demise but from the end of the 19th century to almost the close of the 20th century the Eatons were among the most famous families in Canada considered business and social royalty.

As recently as 1992 the family was listed on the Forbes richest list with an estimated wealth of US$1.2-billion.

Their retail chain boasted as many as 14 main stores usually the anchor of a shopping centre and 42 smaller outlets across Canada; in 1960 they had 45000 employees. They also co-owned the Toronto Telegram newspaper and from 1960 were the principal owners of CFTO the richest private television station in Canada.

Eaton’s was more than a collection of stores; it was a Canadian institution.

One innovation was its mail-order catalogue which was first printed in 1884 and distributed at Toronto’s Industrial Exhibition (later named the Canadian National Exhibition). The first issue was text only but within three years it began including illustrations of some goods for sale. It was a brilliant idea for a predominantly rural country with a population of 4.8 million in 1891. The Canadian Pacific Railway completed in 1885 could deliver goods across the country.

The Eaton’s catalogue which was offered in French as well starting in 1910 figures prominently in Roch Carrier’s famous 1979 short story The Hockey Sweater. The tale is based on a real-life incident when Mr. Carrier was a hockey-loving kid in small-town Quebec. When young Roch’s red Montreal Canadiens sweater wore out his mother ordered a replacement from the Eaton’s catalogue and a blue sweater of the arch-rival Toronto Maple Leafs arrived instead. In real life and in the story the boy was ostracized for wearing the enemy’s sweater. The story became such an important piece of Canadiana that a pictorial reference to it appears on $5 bills printed between 2001 and 2013.

Another Eaton’s practice was to manufacture its own goods including clothes cutting out the middle man and making the family even richer.

Fredrik Stefan Eaton was born in Toronto on June 26 1938 the second son to John David Eaton who owned and ran the Eaton’s department store chain and the former Signy Hildur Stefansson. The spelling of Fredrik Stefan’s given names reflected the Icelandic heritage of his mother who came from the Icelandic community in Gimli Man. His brother Thor who died in 2017 also had an Icelandic name.

The family business was founded in Toronto in 1869 by Fredrik’s great-grandfather Timothy Eaton an immigrant from County Antrim in Northern Ireland. The original shop grew into a department store and kept expanding. By 1900 the company employed 2500 people and the Eaton family owned mansions in Toronto farms in the country and houses on Lake Rosseau in Muskoka where they kept a large fast yacht to travel from the train station to their lakefront property.

Timothy Eaton died in 1907. His son Sir John Craig Eaton ran the store from 1907 to 1922 and his son John David Eaton owned and ran the T. Eaton Co. from 1942 to 1969. Professional managers ran the company during the in-between years.

Fredrik known to his family and friends as Fred first visited the downtown Toronto store in May of 1945 when he was nearly seven years old with his father and older brother John Craig to celebrate the end of the Second World War. Young Fredrik went to Upper Canada College then the University of New Brunswick where he studied philosophy and earned a bachelor of arts. He worked briefly as a police reporter at the Toronto Telegram which his family co-owned.

His first job at Eaton’s was in the children’s department; he then crossed the country to work at the Eaton’s store in Victoria then moved to the buying office in London England. Finding the goods to fill department stores across Canada and supplying the Eaton’s catalogue was a complex business and Eaton’s had buyers in major European capitals. The store prided itself on being able to source goods that Canadians couldn’t find elsewhere.

When Fredrik returned to Canada from his stint in London he managed the Don Mills store in suburban Toronto. During the time he served as chairman president and CEO the Eaton Centre mall in downtown Toronto opened in 1977. The nearby College Street store closed and sales were higher than expected at the Eaton Centre outlet. In 1988 Fredrik’s younger brother George became president; Fredrik remained on the board until 1991.

Eaton’s first sponsored a Santa Claus parade in Toronto in 1904. In 1913 it brought caribou from Labrador to pull Santa’s sleigh. Eaton’s sponsored similar parades in Winnipeg and Montreal. Eaton’s ended its sponsorship of the Toronto parade in 1982 and other corporate interests took it over.

As the most public of the four Eaton brothers Fredrik was in demand to lend his support and money to many causes and organizations. On the volunteer side among other things he was chancellor of the University of New Brunswick president of the Toronto General Hospital which his family first supported early in the 20th century and the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) where he was president from 1984 to 1986.

Nance Gelber whose family had a long connection with the AGO recalls asking Mr. Eaton a question at the annual general meeting where no one ever asked probing questions about why the gallery never used any of the newer art it had stored in the basement.

“I felt the gallery was a little stiff and should open itself to a wider public and tourists” Ms. Gelber said. “[Mr. Eaton] promised to get back to me and he did. I thought he cared about the gallery and had a real interest in it.”

On the corporate side Mr. Eaton was on many boards including the Toronto-Dominion Bank where the T. Eaton Co. banked for decades. He was on the board of Conrad Black’s Hollinger though the two men long-time friends fell out when Mr. Eaton left the board as the company faced legal troubles.

A long-time supporter of the Progressive Conservative Party Mr. Eaton was named High Commissioner to the United Kingdom by prime minister Brian Mulroney in 1991.

“There were lots of people who wanted the post. I chose Fred because he was a royalist and I knew he would represent Canada with dignity” Mr. Mulroney told The Globe and Mail in an interview. “Fred and Nicky did a tremendous job. He also had the means to travel and entertain much more than a civil servant would. Fred Eaton was the illustration of the perfect gentleman.”

Mr. Eaton used his business contacts to help Canadian firms.

“My father worked hard to promote ties between British and Canadian business” his son Fredrik said. “What he enjoyed most in his time in London were the people he met.”

When Mr. Eaton returned to Canada in 1994 he was still a director of the T. Eaton Co. but was not running it. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1997. The following year the company went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange but the money raised did not help. In 1999 Eaton’s declared bankruptcy and the chain was sold to Sears. The Eaton name was taken off the stores in 2002.

The company’s problems began before Fredrik Eaton was born according to Rod McQueen who wrote an unauthorized book on the family The Eatons: The Rise and Fall of Canada’s Royal Family. The company voluntarily returned the wartime profits it made to the federal government Mr. McQueen wrote which weakened the company. “By the end of the Second World War” he wrote “the [Eaton’s] factories were so decrepit they would never recover.”

Mr. McQueen also contends that management at the company became so bloated after the war that it “hobbled the decision-making process.”

Fred Eaton gave a four-hour interview to Mr. McQueen the only one of the four brothers to speak to him. None of them was happy with the final product.

Mr. Eaton was an officer of the Order of Canada a member of the Order of Ontario and had honorary doctorates from the University of New Brunswick and Queen’s University in Belfast. He was a member of a number of clubs including the Caledon Mountain Trout Club. He also enjoyed salmon fishing on the Restigouche River.

What about fresh fruit from Lipton’s or Malcolm Campbell’s?

Although these shops have now disappeared from Glasgow’s streets they were once common sights in the city.

Photographs of shop fronts are among our most popular posts on our Facebook page. Many come from an amazing series generated by the Glasgow Corporation City Assessor’s Department during the 1920s and 1930s.

Some capture the Art Deco style which characterised architecture and design during this period. Others showcase elaborate window displays designed under the window dresser’s creative eye. And many spark memories of visits to these former shopping titans of Glasgow’s streets.

Look beyond the window displays and focus on the businesses themselves you discover just how many well-known retail empires had their roots in Glasgow.

For example Malcolm Campbell (b. 1848) began his career in a greengrocer’s based in Gordon Street. He bought the business from his former employer in 1878 changed the name and built it up until it became a Scottish chain of grocery fruit and vegetable shops. Its records are now held by the University of Glasgow’s Archives and Special Collections.

Thomas Lipton (also born in 1848) also made his grocery business flourish in Glasgow and beyond. From a single shop in Stobcross Street Lipton’s grew and expanded until it became a UK chain.

Later specialising in tea the business was eventually taken over by Unilever which holds the Lipton business archives. Lipton’s personal photographs news cuttings and memorabilia are held by the Special Collections department of the Mitchell Library.

Ross’s Dairies (“It’s Ross’s It’s Right”) had its depot on Crow Road and a variety of outlets throughout the city. These included milk bars snack bars and large tea rooms at the corner of Howard and Jamaica Streets and proclaimed their produce was “straight from the oven straight from the farm” including their delicious soda scones.

We hold the business records of Ross’s Dairies Ltd and several beautiful photos of City Bakeries premises on Dumbarton Road and Cumberland Street. (My aunt worked in both the Shafton and Bearsden Road branches during the late 1950s). Sadly the chain’s archives did not survive when it was bought over by Greggs.

All of these businesses – and more – formed such an important part of the cityscape during the twentieth century.

While they may be gone they’re not forgotten and their archives play an important part in documenting the commercial history of Glasgow.",,,

The news of the coronavirus cases were reported by the Meyer Werft shipyard not the owner (Royal Caribbean) of the new cruise ship. The “employees” were apparently hired by the shipyard (as opposed to crew members employed by Royal Caribbean) although this is not perfectly clear.

The shipyard states that the two positive tests were known last Wednesday March 3rd and were confirmed with PCR tests on Thursday March 4th. The remaining 500 or so employees on the cruise ship are also currently not allowed to leave the ship. The port medical service in Bremerhaven has required the Royal Caribbean ship to remain in Bremerhaven for the time being according to the NDR German news site.

The shipyard spokesman did not say whether the infected employees were placed in quarantine on the ship or ashore. However there have been no further infections so far. The employees are reportedly tested daily. The authorities in Germany are still in consultation regarding how to proceed. Stern reports that the port medical service is “currently investigating suspicious cases and contact persons on board.”

Last week the Meyer Werft shipyard transferred the Odyssey of the Seas via tugs across the Ems River. The ship underwent its initial tests in the North Sea after which it was repositioned to the port in Bremerhaven. The Odyssey is scheduled to leave to undertake additional “test drives.” The NDR site states that it is “unclear when it can take off for the planned test drives.” The shipyard is scheduled to deliver the Odyssey to Royal Caribbean next month.

Royal Caribbean states that it will start selling cruises on the Odyssey of the Seas out of Israel on March 9th. Royal Caribbean plans to start sailing in May from Israel with vaccinated passengers and crew according to the Washington Post. There is no indication regarding the effect of the positive cases on the soon-to-be-scheduled cruises from Israel.

U.S. based cruise line have touted cruises from Europe and other locations outside of U.S. ports as safe and COVID-19 free. But the truth is that there have been over 200 passengers and crew members who tested positive for COVID-19 during European sailings since cruising was suspended from U.S. ports last year. The cases involved MSC Cruises Costa Cruises TUI Group/Mein Schiff SeaDream Hurtigruten and a number of smaller river cruise ships. (You can see a partial list here).

The last positive COVID-19 case on a cruise ship occurred two weeks ago on the MSC Grandiosa. The last outbreak during a cruise occurred last month on the Mein Schiff 2 cruise ship operated by the TUI Group involving four guests.

March 8. 2021 Update: According to the Jerusalem Post – in addition to the two cases of COVID-19 previously reported on the new ship earlier last week “six shipyard workers were identified after a positive test and they were immediately quarantined land side.”

German newspapers like this one and this one (reporting 5 additional cases) report today that there are five to seven additional people on the Odyssey who are infected.

Another newspaper stated that “there was confusion (today) about further corona infections on board the “Odyssey of the Seas” in Bremerhaven the newest cruise ship from Meyer Werft. The Papenburg company has no knowledge of this the city of Bremen is talking about seven new cases.”

“Wall Street is not happy” said one source familiar with the situation. “If cruises are flying off the shelves the message from big investors has been to raise prices if inventory is selling too quickly … the companies are leaving too much money on the table.”

Cruise lines have widely reported strong pent-up demand and record sales volumes in media announcements leading to a backlash from the investment community.

Carnival said sales were solid due to pent up demand in late February and a few weeks earlier Oceania saw its world cruise sell out in a single day.

Victory Cruise Lines and American Queen Steamboat said that January and February 2021 bookings are over 35 percent higher than November and December 2020 bookings according to a press release.

The story is also good at Royal Caribbean Group with bookings up 30 percent.

“Despite the lack of marketing spend we have seen a 30% increase in new bookings since the beginning of the year when compared to November and December” said Jason Liberty CFO speaking on the company’s recent business update and fourth quarter earnings call.

Among other examples Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings has seen a demand uptick recently with new cash bookings.

“And while still early in the booking cycle we are very encouraged and very pleased by the strong booking activity driven by pent up demand across all three brands for 2022 voyages. Volumes during January and February sequentially improved by over 40 percent from November and December 2020 and as an added bonus over 80 percent of these bookings where new cash bookings” said Frank Del Rio president and CEO speaking on the company’s fourth quarter and year-ending earnings call.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphbWFpY2FvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vYWxsd29tYW4vMjAyMS8wMy8wNy9kYXduLXNtaXRoLXRha2VzLXRoZS1yZWlucy1vZi1sZWFkZXJzaGlwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dawn Smith takes the reins of leadership - All Woman,"HOSPITALITY veteran and longstanding member of Sandals Resorts International’s leadership team Dawn Smith has been appointed general manager of the 232-room Sandals Royal Caribbean Resort and Private Island.

For Smith who always wanted to pursue a career in hospitality her latest assignment is further proof of the power of hard work consistency and faith.

“As Jamaicans we are the most genuine passionate courteous and friendly people” she said. “We epitomise true hospitality and have so much love to give. I always wanted to be a part of sharing this love and our culture with the world and I’m thankful that I have been blessed with this opportunity.”

As general manager Smith intends to continue leading by example and putting her team members and guests at the forefront of all she does. She shared “Leading by example will be critical for me in my new role. I have always been inspired by our late chairman and had a very good relationship with him and so I intend to live our company’s mission and vision daily in order to inspire our team members to focus on our core values and continue to be the dream catchers he would want them to be. I am confident that this will take our resort and by extension our company and island to even greater heights.”

Explaining her passion for team member development and a caring personality that sees her mothering many team members at her resort and throughout the luxury-included resort chain Smith describes her leadership style as a ‘servant leader’. “I have a mixture of leadership styles; however the one that speaks most to my personality is being a servant leader. People need to know that they have a leader who interacts with them not to gain fame or power but someone who listens and truly seeks to promote the well-being of those they lead” she said.

“I naturally connect with people easily and I believe that people matter. Everyone has challenges especially now during this COVID-19 pandemic. Listening to concerns and offering solutions can make a difference in someone’s life and therefore whatever I do I do it with sincerity” she continued.

It’s no surprise then that Smith’s favourite part of the job is seeing her guests and team members happy. “I love to know that both my guests and team members are happy” she said. “And I enjoy receiving commendations from our guests about our resort team members and our beautiful island.”

In addition to the day-to-day management of the resort Smith is also appreciative of her role as advisor and liaison to the company’s corporate head office and values the ability to continuously share ideas and discussions with the company’s senior executives. She shared “I am happy to be able to have frequent dialogue with our company’s senior executives and to be able to put forward ideas and suggestions to better optimise resort operations. I have always used my voice to represent our team members and guests and our brand and I am happy to continue to do this in my new role.”

Smith also loves a challenge and considers herself extremely solution-oriented. She explained “When faced with challenges and concerns I have a passion for resolving each situation and it gives me the highest level of satisfaction to see the outcome and the joy it brings to our team and guests.”

She remains grateful to the company for believing in her and for providing her with unlimited opportunities to pursue her passion and hone her leadership skills. Throughout her journey she has taken advantage of the organisation’s many avenues for professional development first pursuing an associate degree programme at Hocking Technical College in the United States and later pursuing her bachelor’s degree in professional business management at Nova Southeastern University in Florida. In 2010 she successfully completed a master’s degree in hospitality and business management from the Global University for Lifelong Learning.

A mother of one son Zachary who recently graduated from the University of Miami with a degree in civil engineering Smith said “I always try to find time for church and family. This makes me happy and fulfilled.” Additionally Smith who is also a Justice of the Peace is passionate about community service and often uses her limited free time to mentor and counsel young women at Montego Bay’s Pregnancy Resource Centre as well as others who seek her assistance for counselling and prayer.

To young women desirous of holding leadership roles in the hospitality industry her advice is simple “Ask God to direct your steps daily and know that nothing is impossible! Work hard learn from your mistakes and do not be afraid to take on great challenges. Never grumble or complain when you are empowered to execute additional tasks never give up and never stop dreaming” she charged.",,,,,,

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

""’I’m the best decision your organization has ever made’"" Ross said.

But Ross wasn’t done.

""’Would you like a massage?’"" he said.

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

Brady likely knew there were going to be some things said that he might not like but he seemed to want the subject of the jokes to stay with him not his former owner.

One Saturday last month several dozen members of the Alaskan Independence Party a small largely unknown political group whose primary goal is to put Alaskan secession from the United States to a vote gathered in Fairbanks for their biennial convention.

Among the topics of conversation: whether to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president.

The party ultimately rejected Kennedy who is running as an independent after a few outspoken members said they did not want him atop their 2024 ticket according to John Howe the party's chairman who was involved in the discussions.

""There was serious consideration"" Howe a machine shop owner told ABC News.

The decision to pass on Kennedy was seen as a blow to the candidate -- ""They wanted us to put him on the ballot"" Howe said -- as Kennedy works to overcome the biggest obstacle to his plans to run as a major outside candidate in November: getting on the ballot across the country.

Typically independent candidates must undergo the painstaking expensive process of gathering thousands of signatures from registered voters in each state in order to qualify for ballot access.

But a candidate can bypass those requirements if a political party that already has ballot access in a given state nominates them to lead their ticket there.

Kennedy has successfully employed that strategy in Michigan and California where he will technically appear on the ballot as the nominee for the Natural Law Party of Michigan and the American Independent Party of California.

What's more his campaign has been in contact with minor parties in at least six other states too ABC News has learned through conversations with leaders in more than a dozen minor parties across the country. (The Kennedy campaign did not return requests for comment for this story or respond to the details that the party leaders provided.)

""As the campaign sees and recognizes that these are very convenient vessels out there it's a clever move and it's not a surprise they do it"" Derek Muller a University of Notre Dame professor specializing in election law told ABC News.

Early polling of the 2024 race suggests Kennedy could take a notable amount of support in a close race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden the two leading candidates -- if Kennedy makes it on the ballot. A new ABC News/Ipsos survey of adults found Kennedy with 12% in a hypothetical five-way election with Trump Biden and two other candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein.

Kennedy's campaign claims to have made it on the ballot in 10 states so far including the battlegrounds of Michigan Nevada and North Carolina. Elections offices in three states have confirmed to ABC News that Kennedy is on the ballot. In other states officials have said they can't yet confirm his candidacy.

Kennedy's strategy of linking with minor parties has encountered both challenges and success. In some cases like Alaska the parties have rejected him while in others they are actively speaking with his campaign about nominating him.

His campaign tried and failed to earn the nomination of the Unity Party of Colorado which chose instead to back West another independent candidate Tijani Cole the party's chairman told ABC News in an email.

The Alliance Party a national group with ballot access in South Carolina has been more receptive.

""National Alliance Party leadership has begun early conversations with the campaign for potential mutual support"" Phil Feuhrer the party's national co-vice chair told ABC News in an email.

Besides nominating Kennedy to lead the party’s ticket in South Carolina Feuhrer said the party is discussing helping the Kennedy campaign gather signatures across Minnesota to appear as an independent candidate there.

""If we reach full agreement with the campaign and our internal statewide leadership teams it would include placement onto the South Carolina ballot as well as the Minnesota Independence-Alliance taking lead on placing the campaign onto the Minnesota ballot"" Feuhrer added using the official name of Minnesota's branch of the party.

""Those conversations are young and still ongoing"" he said.

Kennedy's camp is also in talks with the Reform Party which has ballot access in Florida and Mississippi according to party leaders.

Jenniffer Desatoff the party's Florida chair told ABC News they are ""continuing communication with the Kennedy campaign at this time."" (Kennedy's campaign also contacted the Ecology Party of Florida but was informed the party does not have a ballot line in the presidential race the party's chair Cara Campbell told ABC News.)

Elsewhere the Kennedy campaign twice reached out to representatives of the Constitution Party which has ballot access in nearly a dozen states but the party and the campaign were never able to connect Donna Ivanovich a spokeswoman for the party told ABC News.

Meanwhile Kennedy has formed a party of its own We the People to secure ballot access in several states including in Delaware Hawaii and North Carolina. In those states the signature threshold to make the ballot is lower for candidates aligned with a party than for independent candidates.

Although other independent candidates ally with minor parties for ballot access -- like West is also doing in the 2024 race -- the breadth and ""coordination"" of Kennedy's effort stands out said Muller the Notre Dame election law expert.

""You usually don't see this kind of coordination and effort because the candidacies are usually not serious enough to make the outreach to all these parties in all these different states"" he told ABC News.

But by aligning himself with small often niche parties Kennedy risks absorbing the burden of their sometimes checkered history some observers warned.

The American Independent Party of California which nominated Kennedy last month had backed George Wallace the former Alabama governor and notorious segregationist in the 1960s.

In a video announcing his nomination Kennedy acknowledged the party's past support for Wallace but said it ""has had its own rebirth even before I came along.""

""It's been reborn as a party that represents not bigotry and hatred but rather compassion unity idealism and common sense"" he said.

Another problem with wooing minor parties is that Kennedy's beliefs sometimes don't align with theirs.

The members of the Alaskan Independence Party who rejected Kennedy as the party's nominee were wary he would agree with them on their view that government-owned land should be given back to Alaskans Howe the party chairman told ABC News.

But Kennedy's chances at winning the nomination may have sunk days before the convention when he failed to win over the previous chair of the Alaskan Independence Party Bob Bird in a radio interview with Bird.

""The AIP will not be placing RFK on the ballot"" Bird wrote in a column after the interview casting Kennedy as an outsider.

""Our liberty and prosperity must come from within ourselves"" Bird wrote ""not from a knight galloping in from the Lower 48.""

“I made a boo-boo” Jeffrey S. McConney admitted when describing the erroneous math he scribbled on “TRUMP” corporate letterhead.

The former Trump Organization controller testified about the notes he took during a January 2017 meeting that laid out how the family real estate company was going to surreptitiously reimburse attorney Michael Cohen for fronting the $130000 that silenced the porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment kept her from going public about her decade-old one-night stand with Trump in the days before the 2016 presidential election.

The farce was laid out in black and white with handwritten notes explaining the fuzzy math at play.

Cohen would be paid $180000 which was doubled on paper so that it would make up for the roughly 50 percent taxes the Midtown Manhattan resident would have to pay in federal state and city taxes. McConney wrote “180000 x 2 for taxes” in black pen on the bright white paper. On the witness stand he admitted the company was fine having it “grossed up” to ensure Cohen got his proper share.

The sham continued when tallying up Cohen’s bonus. Initially $50000 was marked as “paid to Red Finch for tech services” but that seemed to morph instead to mean $60000 for Cohen himself.

“Michael was complaining that his bonus wasn’t large enough. This was to make up for whatever he thought he was owed” McConney testified.

The total $420000 was then divided by 12 so that Cohen would get $35000 each month for a year. McConney’s notes of that meeting included a mention that stated “Mike to invoice us” the genesis of what prosecutors say would later be Cohen invoices for fake legal work that Trump gladly paid to keep the hush money deal under wraps.

Monday’s testimony also connected Trump directly to the process a major step forward in the case. Prosecutors showed jurors a copy of a March 28 2017 email in which McConney wrote “I’ll check status tomorrow. DJT needs to sign check.”

On the stand McConney explained that authorizing the money transfers would require having someone actually go to the White House have the then-president of the United States approve the payment himself—while he was president.

But in an instance that exemplifies the lack of intellectual rigor involved in this operation at least one of those checks disappeared on its way back north from Washington to New York City.

After three monthly payments to Cohen in January February and March McConney asked an employee in the Trump Organization accounting department Deborah Tarasoff to cancel a check cut in April that didn’t return.

“It looks like we never got a check back from the White House. It got lost somebody couldn’t find it. I guess it’s the same as lost” he testified.

Paperwork showed that after $105000 was paid by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust the bean counters back in Manhattan realized it would be easier to run the next $315000 in payments through Trump’s personal accounts for the rest of the year.

Matt Colangelo a prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office meticulously went through each of Cohen’s 12 invoices. Every month in 2017 Cohen would email Allen Weisselberg a disgraced accountant who was then the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer but has since been convicted of tax fraud and spent three months at New York’s dreaded Rikers Island jail. Cohen would deliver a curt greeting—mentioning some summer fun a hurricane hitting Weisselberg’s Florida home Thanksgiving the winter holidays—then get right down to business.

“Pursuant to the retainer agreement kindly remit payment for services rendered” Cohen would email Weisselberg each time proudly signing his emails: “Michael D. Cohen Esq. Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”

One by one Colangelo went over every monthly email attached invoice forwarded Weisselberg email and McConney’s copy over to Tarasoff. By the time they got to September McConney was starting to wear down.

“$35000” he said sounding increasingly tired of answering why he knew how much to pay despite there not being any dollar figure on the invoice for supposed legal work. The answer was always the same: that first meeting in January 2017.

“It’s an invoice from Michael Cohen” he groaned when discussing the October paperwork.

When Colangelo asked him to read the email McConney let out a mild whine. “The whole thing?” he asked.

“Why don’t we just do the body this time” Colangelo acquiesced.

The internal Trump corporate emails showed how invoices made their way from Cohen to Weisselberg to McConney to Tarasoff. And the chain would generally end the same way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vaGFtbWVyLW11c2V1bS1hbm4tcGhpbGJpbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Who's Who of L.A.'s Art World Bids Farewell to a Champion,"The actor Owen Wilson chatted with the artist Ed Ruscha.

Peyton Woodyard a four-star safety who committed to Alabama as part of its 2024 recruiting class in December and enrolled in the school for the spring semester entered the transfer portal in late April. He committed to the Ducks on Sunday. Woodyard is the second win for the Ducks this weekend as Michigan State transfer defensive tackle Derrick Harmon committed to the Ducks on Friday.

247Sports' recruiting analyst Greg Biggins describes Woodyard as ""a smart heady safety with an extremely high football IQ.""

Woodyard and Harmon are two massive additions for Oregon which now ranks second in the 247Sports transfer portal team rankings trailing only Ole Miss. The Ducks have added 14 players via the portal this offseason as they prepare for their first season in the Big Ten.

The biggest additions have been quarterback Dillon Gabriel from Oklahoma former five-star receiver Evan Stewart from Texas A&M and cornerback Jabbar Muhammad who helped rival Washington win the Pac-12 and reach the College Football Playoff title game last year. Then there's former five-star quarterback Dante Moore who comes to Oregon from UCLA. The Ducks are not just landing talent in the portal but plucking players from other top programs.

Ohio State is the favorite to win the Big Ten this season but even with Michigan coming off a national title many view the Ducks as the biggest threat to the Buckeyes in 2024. It would be a remarkable story for the Ducks to compete for a conference title in their first year in the league. It would certainly buck the trend of what normally happens when new schools enter one of the Power Four leagues but with the way Oregon has recruited at both the high school level as well as in the portal there may not be a team that's ever been in such a strong position to do so."

Last week Salesforce reported a $2.17 billion annual gain from its investments in other tech companies. A few days later the company's venture arm extended its winning streak with another big exit. In a boom time for large tech IPOs and software consolidation Salesforce's name is showing up everywhere. CEO Marc Benioff has proven that he's not only a mega-dealmaker when it comes to buying high-priced cloud companies like Slack and Tableau but has also turned Salesforce with its hefty balance sheet into a major force in Silicon Valley venture capital. The latest windfall came on Wednesday when cloud security vendor Okta said it's acquiring smaller rival Auth0 for $6.5 billion eight months after Salesforce Ventures led a $120 million investment at a $1.92 billion valuation. Salesforce more than tripled its money between July and March. In 2020 two of Salesforce's portfolio companies — nCino and Snowflake — soared after going public. They produced a combined $1.7 billion in investment gains accounting for 78% of Salesforce's total increase for the fiscal year that ended in January according to the company's fourth-quarter report on Feb. 25. Salesforce also sold all of its 2.8 million Zoom shares last year after more than tripling its money from investing $100 million in the video chat company's 2019 IPO. Those gains are providing a big boost to Salesforce's bottom line. Of the company's $4.38 in earnings per share for fiscal 2021 $1.75 came from mark-ups on strategic investments. Salesforce also reported on its balance sheet that its investments were valued at $3.91 billion as of January up about 100% from a year earlier.

Benioff and Bret Taylor generate many investment ideas

Corporate venture capital used to come with a stigma. Big companies in the eyes of many investors had their own agenda whether it was gaining market insight or product ideas from potential disruptors. Traditional venture firms often preferred to avoid investing alongside them. While Salesforce does sometimes compete with portfolio companies it's better known for using its dominance in the sales software market to provide expanded distribution to the many business apps that need an audience. Salesforce benefits by offering its customers a wider assortment of cloud services and start-ups win by getting meetings with potential clients who otherwise may never take their call. John Somorjai who runs Salesforce Ventures and leads corporate development companywide said his group's pitch has to be increasingly compelling because competition for deals has never been greater.

John Somorjai of Salesforce Source: Salesforce

""There is just so much money available so much dry powder more than has ever been in the industry"" Somorjai said in an interview this week. ""How we're able to get into the best deals is really leveraging the strength of Salesforce and the tools we have."" He said he's roughly doubled the size of his investment team in the past two years to 15 people to keep up with the growing number of start-ups across the globe. Salesforce Ventures doesn't take board seats keeping Somorjai and team mostly on the sidelines when it comes to questions around a potential acquisition or asset sale. On occasion Salesforce does buy a Salesforce Ventures company like its purchase in 2016 of productivity software start-up Quip. ""They never block a sale or create issues and only help"" said Jason Lemkin founder of SaaStr which hosts events on cloud software and invests in start-ups. ""The fact they help a lot of top SaaS VCs mean they are often happy to have them in a hot deal."" Somorjai who joined Salesforce over 15 years ago said many of his best investment ideas come from Benioff and Bret Taylor the company's operating chief (and Quip founder) who are both constantly out talking to customers. About Benioff Somorjai said ""Customers come to him and say 'Have you looked at this company? They're doing really interesting things and helping us in this way.' He feeds that data to me.""

Salesforce Ventures is all over the map when it comes to check size. Or in Somorjai's words ""We're stage agnostic."" In 2020 it participated in the $7.5 million Series A round for education-tech start-up AdmitHub and the $13.5 million Series B for Angaza whose sales management platform targets emerging markets. It also invested $100 million in security vendor Tanium at a $9 billion valuation and just last month backed data analytics company Databricks at a $28 billion valuation. In recent years late-stage growth investments have proven to be the fastest way to generate a hefty profit. Salesforce's $250 million investment in Snowflake's IPO was worth $529 million after one day of trading. Its $100 million purchase of Zoom shares almost doubled in three days in 2019.

That avenue to a quick buck may be closing. Companies now have many ways to go public including through a direct listing or special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) neither of which involve selling IPO shares at what amounts to a huge discount. In a direct listing a new rule allows companies to raise capital while still unlocking the ability for existing investors to sell at market price. In a SPAC companies raise money through a PIPE or private investment in public equity. PIPE investors then end up with stock in the underlying company when it starts trading. While Salesforce could look to PIPEs as another route for late-stage investing Somorjai said he's not currently pursuing that path. ""It's a little bit early to see how that whole PIPE to SPAC trend evolves and how successful some of these SPACs are"" Somorjai said. ""It is a very interesting new way for a private company to get liquidity quickly and probably much easier way for them to do it and potentially allows them to have less dilution.""

Investing and competing

Manny Medina CEO of sales engagement software company Outreach said Salesforce connected with him about making an investment in the early days of the Covid-19 crisis at a time when ""it was easier not to invest than to invest."" ""The world was going into a quagmire and you didn't know which end was up"" said Medina whose Seattle-based company develops software to help salespeople land deals and stay connected with customers. At the same time ""people are hoarding toilet paper and Purell"" he said. Still Salesforce wanted to be a part of Outreach's $50 million financing round which valued the company at $1.33 billion. Medina acknowledged that there was tension involved in allowing Salesforce onto his cap table because the companies have competing products and Salesforce is the industry goliath. Medina said that in conversations with Matt Garratt Salesforce Ventures' managing partner he got comfortable with the team's promise to protect his company's intellectual property and have his back while also getting him in front of the right people at Salesforce or with customers. Ultimately it was worth it for Outreach to do the deal because Salesforce has established a reputation for being a very smart investor he said. ""At the end of the day we'll compete with them anyway like it or not"" Medina said. ""Either we get the relationship and get the signaling of someone who's known for picking winners or we just compete with them without the money and the signaling."" Outreach integrates with Salesforce but it doesn't count on the company for distribution or use its AppExchange which is Salesforce's marketplace for third-party apps. According to Medina ""the only benefit we get from Salesforce is that they're evangelizing the cloud."" That makes Outreach a very different type of investment than Auth0 or nCino. In November shortly after its investment in Auth0 Salesforce chose the company's identity management technology to power its consumer identity offering. Somorjai said it was a service that customers were requesting and Auth0 was a name that people trusted in the space.

For nCino the partnership started even earlier. The company sells cloud software to help banks digitize and automate operations related to lending and portfolio management. From the beginning nCino built its platform on top of Salesforce. In nCino's IPO prospectus the company mentioned Salesforce 99 times. Salesforce first invested in nCino in 2014 and continued doing so over the next five years amassing a 12% stake as of the company's IPO last year. Those shares were worth almost $800 million at the end of 2020. ""They decided to build their entire business on the Salesforce platform so it made a lot of sense to invest in that team and what they were doing"" Somorjai said.

But with the rise of artificial intelligence the discussion has intensified as it's now algorithms not humans that are making decisions about how technology is applied. In June 2020 I had a chance to speak with Paula Goldman Chief Ethical and Humane Use Officer for Salesforce about how companies can develop technology specifically AI with ethical use and privacy in mind.

I spoke with Goldman during Salesforce's TrailheaDX 2020 virtual developer conference but we didn't have a chance to air the interview then. I'm glad to bring it to you now as the discussion about ethics and technology has only intensified as companies and governments around the world use new technologies to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The following is a transcript of the interview edited for readability.

Paula Goldman Chief Ethical and Human Use Officer Salesforce Image: Salesforce

Bill Detwiler: So let's get right to it. As companies as governments are developing apps for contact tracing to help people know maybe who they've been in contact with to help them know where it's safe to go or where it's safer to go and as people are concerned about their data being used appropriately by these apps what do companies need to consider and hopefully the governments who are going to be using these apps need to consider when they're building the apps from the get go? How do they ensure people that look we're going to use this data in the right way and not for the wrong reasons either now or maybe in the future?

Paula Goldman: Well these are all the right questions to be asking Bill. And it's a very strange time in the world right? There's multiple intersecting crises. There's a pandemic there's a racial justice crisis there's so much going on and technology can play a really important role but it has to be done responsibly. And we really believe that when you design technology responsibly it's going to have better adoption. It's going to be more effective. And that's part of why we started at the Office of Ethical and Humane Use at Salesforce back in 2018. We knew that companies have a responsibility to think through the consequences of their technology in the world.

And we started a program that we call Ethics by Design which is precisely for this purpose. It was think through the unintended consequences of product work across our technology teams to make sure that we're maximizing the positive impact. And so we did not predict COVID-19 I will say but I think when the moment hit we were very well prepared to operationalize with our product teams and make sure that what we're designing is responsible and that we're empowering our customers when they collect data to do so in the most responsible way. Does it make sense for me to go into that?

SEE: How to create a privacy policy that protects your company and your customers (TechRepublic)

Principles for ethical product development

Bill Detwiler: Completely. Yeah. I mean I think when you and I spoke at Dreamforce last year I mean it seems like a lifetime ago but it was just last fall. You and I were talking about AI and we were talking about building ethics into AI some of the unintended consequences that the systems like that can have. So maybe I'd love to hear kind of what's happened since then that set you up to be able to address this moment. What have you learned not just from 2018 but from Dreamforce from the fall last year that made it easier for you to sort of have that ethical framework now to have already have been working with the other teams that are building these apps to working with your customers that are using these apps to help them do so in an ethical way?

Paula Goldman: Yeah absolutely. Well when we last talked we were talking about all of these different methods that we were working on with our technology teams and our product teams. So we were essentially looking at risk framework so that you're building a product. What are the areas of risk you should look out for most and screen for? We talked about training for our teams and we talked about designing features with ethics top of mind.

Well it turns out all of these things are especially important during a crisis because COVID-19 is a very unusual circumstance. Think about technology. Technology has helped businesses stay afloat in an economic crisis. You mentioned contact tracing. Technology helps what has previously been like a pencil and paper exercise will help public health officials speed up that process so that they're able in some cases to save lives. So technology can play a really really important role but on the other hand the data is very sensitive. And so these apps need to be designed very thoughtfully.

And that's why when this crisis hit our team worked in partnership. The Office of Ethical and Humane Use worked in partnership with the privacy team and came up with a joint set of principles. We released them internally in April and externally in May and then operationalized them across all of our products. And basically it was like how do you even when no one has all the answers most of us have never lived through a pandemic and certainly have never lived through a pandemic with access to the type of technology that we do now even with all of that uncertainty how can we make sure that the technology that we're developing is trusted and will be effective? So that's what we did. And I'm happy to go through some of the principles.

SEE: AI and ethics: The debate that needs to be had

Bill Detwiler: Yeah. I'd love to hear those. Yeah. I'd love to hear the principles. Yeah.

Paula Goldman: Yeah absolutely. So there's five principles and I'm happy to go through any or all of them but the top of them the most important one we always at Salesforce we rank order list and it's always in order of priority. So the top one is human rights and equality. Equality as you probably know is a core value for Salesforce. And especially when you think about the COVID-19 crisis disproportionately affecting communities of color already marginalized populations we really want to make sure that the solutions that we develop are developed inclusively and with those populations top of mind with and for those populations.

And so we're actively involving diverse experts medical professionals health professionals our Ethical Use Advisory Council external communities. And we're looking out for ways in which products could be unintentionally misused. So let me give you an example of a safeguard that we built in to Work.com. So Work.com which we released recently has a feature that allows employers to schedule shifts for people coming back to the office. And this is a tricky challenge that most employers haven't had to face before. Employees need to have space between them. You need to monitor the capacity on a floor. And so there's a tool in there called Shift Manager [now called Shift Management] and the Shift Manager allows a person to schedule employees for shifts. Sounds simple.

One of the things that we very intentionally did in that product is we made sure that all of the potential employees who could come back for shifts were being treated equally in the technology itself so the default you don't want bias creeping into the way that some employees get selected and others not to come back for shifts. You want it to be treated equally. It's stuff like that that we've worked with our product teams to be very thoughtful and intentional when we're designing.

No one will use technology they don't trust

Bill Detwiler: And you know you hit on something I think is really important there which is the sensitivity of the information a lot of times that we're dealing with because we're dealing with health information you're dealing with location information you're dealing with contact association who you're with information. And so people have I think at least a lot of people that I talk to have a natural skepticism and a hesitation to share that information if they think it could be misused or if they think it can be exposed. And we've heard reports of the contact tracers in some of the states not getting accurate or full information from people even that they're having a conversation with because it is such sensitive information. So I guess do you think that having an ethical framework helps build trust in people that then allows them to provide or gives them the comfort they need to provide this information by saying we're not going to use it in an inappropriate way?

I guess it seems that ethics is a you know some would say it's a nice to have. It's good to have ethics but we're more concerned about collecting as much data as we can building quickly developing being on the cutting edge of innovation getting things out quickly then we'll worry about the kind of ethics later. It seems like when you're using technology to solve a problem and you need buy in and you need participation because there's no way necessarily to get this data without asking people or without people trusting you. I mean you can try to force it on people but for a public health event like this it doesn't seem like that would really work very well. So how does ethics play into at least helping ease people's fears that the information could be misused that the systems that they're using are safe accurate and will benefit them I guess in the long run?

Paula Goldman: Well I think you said it perfectly Bill and the way I would summarize it is that it doesn't matter how good a piece of technology is. No one will use it unless they trust it. And particularly now particularly when we're talking about health data and these are very sensitive topics. And so two of our other principles that we've operationalized in our product one is about honoring transparency. And so for example we want to help our customers share if they are collecting data how and why is that data being collected and how it's being used and make it as easy as possible transparently to explain that. So features in Work.com for example Shift Management we discussed. Wellness Check which an employer can give a survey to their employee just to make sure that they're not experiencing COVID symptoms before they come back into the office.

But those come with out of the box email templates that help customers communicate very transparently with users employees why are they collecting this data? What it's being used for what it's not being used for who has access to it who doesn't have access to it? We have to go out of our way in a crisis to be transparent and explain why actions are being taken. And I think we've tried to templatize that for our own customers and make it as easy as possible.

Image: Salesforce

Another one that's really important here is about minimizing data collection. Again as you were saying I think especially now and especially in a crisis the principle has to be only collect data that is absolutely essential for a solution to be effective and make sure that when you're doing it you're safeguarding the privacy of the individual who is consenting to give that data. But so another example here in Work.com for the wellness status when employees are asked a survey on their health the shift managers that are scheduling don't get to see the specific wellness status. It's either they're ready to come back to work or they're not because there's no need for a shift manager to associate specific symptoms with an individual.

And so these are all the seemingly small design choices that add up to products that people can trust. And I think it's those types of choices at all levels that matter so much right now.

SEE: How to implement AI and machine learning (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)

Bill Detwiler: I think that's a key point too. You mentioned Shift Manager and the two examples you gave are clear ways that you can design systems to not promote what could be you know either discriminatory or behavior or release data inappropriately. How do you I mean how do you develop those individual the design choices? How do you make those design choices? How is the process by which you decide we don't think that the individual manager the line managers should have this data? If you aren't consciously thinking about that then you would probably just say well oh well you have this field on a form this person says ""Nope I'm well"" and so everyone up the chain should just be able to see all the information on the form.

So someone had to think that no we don't want to do that. Just describe the process internally about how you go about doing that because I think any company that's building apps in house or designing processes in house would benefit from having someone there to look for those maybe those points where you have unintentional bias creep into the system.

Paula Goldman: Absolutely. Yeah. And we've released these principles publicly. They're on our newsroom and they're on the Ethical and Humane Use website for Salesforce. So anybody that's interested I'd really encourage you to check them out. And there's like decks that sort of explains some of the thinking that we went through but really it's about education. So we released the principles and then we had very detailed workshops with each of the product teams that were working on different features on Work.com and went through with a fine tooth comb.

Salesforce Trailhead: Define Ethics By Design

So for example the wellness survey the first layer was do we really need to be asking all of these questions? So eliminate the questions that don't need to be in here. That's step one. And then step two is can we aggregate the questions so it's like a single yes no. Because again you don't need an administrator associating symptoms with a specific employee. It's those types of detailed processes that really have made it work.

But what I'll say is you also want to create a culture where people are asking these questions and you want to be empowering everyone to be asking the right questions because when you're thoughtful like that that's what results in the products that get the most adoption and most importantly the products that are going to help save lives. In a crisis like this trust is so paramount.

Incorporating ethics into the development process

Bill Detwiler: Another thing I think that I wanted to touch on and I wanted to talk to you about is the way you're building safeguards into the systems that your customers are going to use. And I've talked to people before around AI. And I remember I was out at TDX last year and we were talking about Einstein AI and using that in some financial systems. That was kind of a new thing at the point in time. And we were talking about how these were tools that companies could use to make sure that their use of Einstein AI was ethical or followed principles and they didn't allow unintentional bias. And at that point we were talking financial systems. And so my question was well okay so how are we going to prevent maybe an unintended use of the technology by a customer to say perpetuate at that time we were talking about kind of red line.

And it was like okay so it wasn't the intent of the system to be used this way but once it gets out in the open it could be. And I think your example with Work.com and the Shift Manager the first one we were talking about where you're saying okay we wanted to build safeguards so that you couldn't play favorites when you're scheduling shifts or you couldn't either intentionally or unintentionally allow people to use that system to discriminate against certain populations within their workforce. So how do you do that? What type of thinking goes how do you I guess operationalize that? You can say this is our philosophy. We want to make sure that our tools can't be used in this way. Talk a little bit about the operationalization that makes that happen.

Paula Goldman: I guess I'd summarize it as three things. So one is what do we decide to build in the first place? And we are pretty intentional about the products we choose to build and their overall use cases. And we choose to build products that we think are going to improve the world. So that's I think at a very basic level but that's a real starting point. Second we also have policies that we set around how customers use our product and I encourage people it's publicly available. We have something called an acceptable use policy. You can just Google it Salesforce accessible use policy. Check out you're talking about AI. You can check out the Einstein section of the policy and there's some really interesting very forward-leaning pieces of that.

For example there's a policy that says if you're using an Einstein bot you can't use it in such a way that deceives the user into thinking they're interacting with a human being. There's a lot of very thoughtful intentionally designed policies on that. But I would say the most important thing is the kind of examples that we were discussing is that we intentionally design our products so that it's as easy as possible to do the right thing and doing the wrong thing is extremely hard if not impossible. And those are the types of examples that we were going through and it's an exercise that we do with rigor across all of our products.

And I want to be humble here. We're still learning. Nobody has the magic wand for responsible technology and we're continuing to learn. We're continuing to work in partnership with our customers and our community to keep improving what we're doing here but we're also very proud of where we are and eager to keep sharing and growing.

Bill Detwiler: Do you ever get pushback I guess from either other groups not inside Salesforce or customers or outside of Salesforce or just other companies that are like ""Well yeah we like this feature but we want to customize it this way?"" Or ""Yeah. We really like that. We like what you're trying to do but again we go back to that kind of it's getting in the way of innovation or progress"" or ""Yes we really kind of need that."" And if so how do you address that? What's your argument to skeptics to say that an ethical framework when you're designing applications when you're designing products or processes is not a nice to have. It really is essential.

Paula Goldman: I think we've been very lucky. We've been very lucky. Salesforce has been a values driven company from the get go. Leadership has always been aligned with this philosophy of making the right long term decisions about what we do and where we engage. And I think in part that's part of what draws customers to us and part of our relationship our promise with our own community. So I wouldn't say there's been a lot of pushback in that regard about the responsible design of technology but it does require taking a long term approach. It does require believing that trust is our most important value which it is and that this all accrues to trust and that when there are we've seen unfortunately in the news over the last few years the sort of the so called tech lash that when trust is broken it's very hard to repair. And that is why we pay so much attention to these issues and it's why we go out of our way to take a listening approach to it as well so that we keep growing and learning and keep doing a better and better job at it.

As economies prepare to reopen following the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations major companies are starting to reconsider their approach to office working will once the pandemic recedes.

Although it is likely to be some time before social and economic activity resumes to pre-pandemic levels the mass rollout of vaccinations in some countries has introduced companies to the possibility of reopening their offices — an attractive model for some employers.

Although the remote-work model has gained significant traction throughout the pandemic it is clear that big organisations do not unanimously embrace it. However in a recent survey conducted by Growmotely 61% of respondents said they prefer a fully remote environment.

Companies including Spotify Twitter and Goldman Sachs are taking different approaches to their future workforce arrangements. Some are embracing an all-remote workforce while others are encouraging employees to return to their office desks.

Here's what some of the top employers have said

Spotify

Earlier this month Spotify announced its transition to a permanent flexible-work model with its Work From Anywhere policy. The new occupational strategy lets its 6550 global employees choose how they want to work at the company — in an office remotely or at a coworking space that the company will pay a subscription for as Insider previously reported.

Employees will be given more choice over the town city or country they want to work from.

""This is an opportunity to scrap the idea that big cities are the only places where meaningful work can happen because we know firsthand that isn't true"" Travis Robinson the head of diversity inclusion and belonging at Spotify told Insider previously.

The company's CEO Jack Dorsey sent an email to his employees informing staff they can work from home ""forever"" if they so wish The Washington Post reported. The firm made its announcement in May last year.

According to the report Twitter's shift to a permanent remote work policy was a two-year project accelerated by the pandemic amid lockdowns.

In 2018 Dorsey sent an email to his employees encouraging them to work from home after experiencing a lift in productivity by doing so himself.

""We've already been on this path and the crisis just catapulted us into a future state"" said Jennifer Christie Twitter's chief HR officer in a blog post as reported by The Washington Post.

Salesforce

The software and cloud computing company adopted similar work-from-home policies after recently unveiling its Work From Anywhere plans. The new guidelines offer employees three options for how they'll work going forward: flex fully remote and office-based. The flex option will allow workers to come into the office up to three times a week for tasks that cannot be conducted virtually.

Not everyone is welcoming the remote work model with open arms. Speaking at the recent Credit Suisse Group AG conference the CEO of the investment bank David Solomon rejected the work from home policy stating that it ""is not ideal for us and it's not a new normal"" CNBC reported.

He said the remote-work culture is an ""aberration"" that needs to be corrected ""as quickly as possible.""

Solomon said the nature of business within the financial sector clashes with the work-from-home model. ""I do think for a business like ours which is an innovative collaborative apprenticeship culture this is not ideal for us.""

Solomon is not alone in his views. Back in mid-October Jamie Dimon the chief executive officer of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co was very vocal about what he viewed as the implausibility of remote working.

""How do you build a culture and character? How are you going to learn properly?"" he said similarly referring to junior workers as Solomon did per Financial News London.

According to Dimon ""a lot of work takes place not at the meeting but before or after the meeting when people share ideas.""

As for the streaming company co-chief executive Reed Hastings told The Wall Street Journal last year that he doesn't see any positives in a remote working environment. ""Not being able to get together in person particularly internationally is a pure negative.""

For big tech including the likes of Facebook Apple and Amazon future workforce arrangements look flexible. All three companies extended remote work policies until at least summer.

So what does the future of work look like?

Prithwiraj (Raj) Choudhury a professor at the Harvard Business School and remote work expert highlighted the key benefits of working away from the office in an interview with Insider.

He said: ""For individuals the benefit of remote work is that it offers flexibility. Individuals can save on time and live in their preferred location under different remote work models. Remote work also creates a lot of value for companies. As an example when companies allow workers to work-from-anywhere talent can be hired globally even at locations where the company doesn't have an office.""

Choudhury respectfully disagreed with Soloman's views on remote working. ""Remote work has been around for a long time and organizations such as the US Patent Office and Dell have successfully embraced remote work much before the pandemic"" he said.

He added: ""One of the models I really like is the TCS 25-25 hybrid remote work model which I have studied in detail.""

In this model all employees spend 25% of their time in the office and the entire team comes in on those ""in-office"" days. ""The other model I like is 'remote-first' where employees act as remote workers even on days that they are in the office"" Choudhury said.

John H. Krystal M.D. chief of psychiatry at Yale-New Haven Hospital discussed with Insider the drawbacks of working from home and implications for public mental health. ""The principal challenges associated with remote work are social isolation poorer communication and paradoxically reduced efficiency"" he said.

According to Krystal virtual work meetings leave little time for ""schmoozing"" — the informal social interactions that build connection and trust.

The resulting work relationships lead to weaker connections between people leaving ""more room for provocative social interactions that can further erode work relationships"" he added.

Many of these women have lost their jobs as the coronavirus forced the closure of the hi-tech businesses they were employed in due to government restrictions.

""When we opened the registration we were amazed that we received 400 applications from women which indicates the large number of many women who haven't had employment for a year or more"" said the Hershkovitz Foundation a founder of W2W said in a statement. The program called ""return"" received some 400 applications from women for only 31 places overwhelming the application process. The goal of the program is to help integrate women into significant positions in hi-tech and the economy.""When we opened the registration we were amazed that we received 400 applications from women which indicates the large number of many women who haven't had employment for a year or more"" said the Hershkovitz Foundation a founder of W2W said in a statement.

The focus of the program is to help the women find opportunities by preparing CV's their LinkedIn pages entering their information on databases and identifying personal and professional barriers. Meetings were also held with recruiters in hi-tech companies to help in networking and included representatives from Microsoft Salesforce Dell General Motors BCG Gornitzky Law Office Discount Bank and others.

""The need to hold the meetings virtually played in our favor because we were able to integrate a large number of women from the far periphery including Eilat and the north who would have difficulty evacuating to distant travels"" said the Hershkovitz Foundation.

Michal Krimolovsky Director of the program noted the diverse backgrounds of many of the women saying ""Program participants came from diverse backgrounds. Some left for the IDF and then were not allowed to return to work and did not find another job some resigned a long time ago without anticipating the severe economic crisis others unexpectedly returned to Israel.""

""Many of these women found themselves out of employment and some had to go down to minimum wage positions or below which does not allow them to have a reasonable economic existence. Fortunately during the program most of the participants have already settled into new jobs."""

To hit capacity targets Seagate will have to adopt new magnetic recording technologies. To ensure the high performance of its future drives the company plans to leverage its multi-actuator technology more broadly. This tech doubles the performance of its hard drives and it could become a standard feature on some of the company's product lines.

Boosting Capacity

Seagate says that it is on track to build a 50TB hard drive sometime in 2026 and a 100TB HDD in 2030. Right now Seagate is shipping its 3.5-inch 20TB HDDs based on heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) to select customers and as parts of its Lyve storage systems. HAMR will enable Seagate to increase the areal density of its platters at a 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) which means larger steps forward for hard drive capacities.



""As we approach the maximum useful capacity of PMR technology each successive drive increases by 1TB or 2TB at a time"" said Jeff Fochtman Seagate's SVP of Business and Marketing at the company's Analyst Meeting. ""With HAMR technology it allows us to jump in steps of 4 terabytes 6 terabytes or even 10 terabytes at a time.""

(Image credit: Seagate)

In a bid to build a nine-platter 40TB hard drive Seagate needs to increase the areal density of its media to around 2600Gb/in2 (2.6Tb/in2). Seagate has already achieved such areal density though it is unclear whether the company already has prototypes of hard drives running such platters or only tests them on spinstands.



In any case Seagate already has media technology that will power its products several years down the road. But it is going to take from three to five years before HDDs with platters featuring a 2600Gb/in2 (2.6Tb/in2) density will be ready for primetime as the company still needs to polish off the media technology as well as develop the appropriate head drive controller and other electronics.

Modern hard drives based on perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) technology use aluminum or glass platters with CoCrPt–SiO2 nanogranular magnetic films. Hard drives featuring HAMR rely on glass platters with magnetic films featuring high magnetocrystalline anisotropy to ensure very small grains. In particular Seagate uses an iron platinum alloy (e.g. L10–FePt).



Today's HAMR media is expected to enable drives featuring 80TB ~ 100TB capacity according to developers. But for 3.5-inch HDDs with a ~105TB capacity and 5 ~ 7Tb/in2 areal density new ordered-granular magnetic films will be needed as grains will get very small and tracks will get very narrow. But ordered-granular media is expected to be a relatively short stop before 'fully' bit patterned media (BPM) technology comes into play with an 8Tb/inch2 areal density.

""We see an opportunity to scale this design space with granular media into the range of 4 Tb/in2 to 6Tb/in2 at which point we plan to add patterning in one dimension through the use of ordered grain media"" said John Morris Chief Technology Officer of Seagate.



""This we expect to be a steppingstone in media to open up the range of 5Tb/in2 to 7 Tb/in2. Then we will transition to fully patterned media to open up densities to 8Tb/in2 and even higher. With the areal density CAGR just introduced we have a path to 10TB per disk by 2030. This then represents our outlook for technology limits over the next 10 to 15 years.""

Boosting Performance

Advancing the capacity of hard drives at a rapid pace is important to keep Seagate's HDDs competitive but capacity is only a part of the equation. Sequential read/write speeds as well as random IOPS-per-TB performance are also important. While read/write speeds are getting higher along with areal density IOPS-per-TB performance drops as the capacity of hard drives increases. Datacenter operators want hard drives to offer more or less similar IOPS-per-TB performance since this affects their Quality-of-Service. If IOPS-per-TB declines data centers have to mitigate it somehow which requires additional investments.



A straightforward way to increase the IOPS-per-TB performance of an HDD is to use more than one actuator with read/write heads and this is exactly what Seagate is set to do. Using two actuators instead of one can almost double throughput as well as IOPS-per-TB performance which is tremendously important for data centers. Furthermore doubling the number of actuators also halves the time Seagate needs to test a drive before shipping as it is faster to inspect eight or nine platters using two independent actuators which lowers costs.

(Image credit: Seagate)

For now Seagate's dual actuator Mach.2 technology is used for experimental drives based on PMR that are available to dozens of customers but it will eventually be used in commercially-available HAMR HDDs. When Seagate's nearline and enterprise hard drives hit capacities higher than 30TB dual actuator technology will become a must-have feature in a bid to guarantee IOPS-per-TB performance on current (~16TB HDD) levels.



""Although Mach.2 is ramped and being used now it is also really still in a technology-staging mode"" said Fochtman. ""When we reach capacity points above 30 terabytes it will become a standard feature in many large data center environments.""

Like all the other technologies HDDs are getting more complex and therefore manufacturing costs increase. Nonetheless Seagate is confident that HDDs will be cheaper than SSDs on per-GB and TCO metrics for years to come.



""We believe that the TCO for hard disk drives and SSDs will stay approximately in equilibrium"" said Morris. ""Both SSDs and hard disk drives will continue to improve their value proposition and storage demand for both will continue to grow. They are both critical enabling technologies for the growing datasphere and their synergistic relationship in the data center infrastructure will persist.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

(Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)

When Joe Biden came to Los Angeles to raise money for his presidential campaign Tom Girardi filled a dining room at the Jonathan Club with wealthy attorneys.

“Obviously everyone thinks the world of you — and they should” Girardi told Biden as his then-wife “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Erika Jayne looked on in a stylish blue dress.

The 2019 breakfast fundraiser at the private downtown club was in many ways the end of an era. By the time Biden was elected last fall Girardi’s life and legal empire were unraveling. His wealth once estimated north of $250 million has vanished and with it his reputation as one of the nation’s most connected and respected lawyers. With Girardi facing bankruptcy divorce and a criminal investigation his days as a political insider and power broker appear over.

For decades though politicians were happy to take his money and put up with his requests for something in return. Along with his family and employees Girardi contributed more than $7.3 million to candidates.

He could get Govs. Gavin Newsom and Jerry Brown on the phone with ease associates said. He and Jayne regularly traveled to Washington D.C. where then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid appointed him to a Library of Congress board. Former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy spoke at the 2002 dedication of a Loyola Law School building named for Girardi’s father.

The couple went to political events or dinners constantly Jayne recalled in her autobiography “Pretty Mess” sharing a table with Barbra Streisand at a Clinton fundraiser or discussing L.A.’s homeless problem at an intimate dinner with the mayor and his wife.

“We would have drinks with a U.S. senator and she’d confide in us the problem the senators were having with the current administration” Jayne wrote in the 2018 book. “These were some great experiences.”

From the winning candidates he supported Girardi sometimes expected favors whether it was an appearance on his weekly radio show a say in judicial appointments or a backroom deal that would help his law practice according to interviews with longtime associates state bar litigation records and an unpublished memoir.

Former state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer for whom Girardi raised hundreds of thousands of dollars said in an interview that their friendship fell apart over requests for favors that he felt were unethical.

Back in 2005 Girardi wanted Lockyer’s permission to let him resolve government antitrust claims against Sempra Energy as part of a separate private settlement agreement he was negotiating Lockyer said.

“My impression was [he thought] Sempra might be more generous on their settlement side if mine went away” he recalled. Lockyer refused.

In the same period he said Girardi lobbied him not to pursue charges against Hewlett-Packard chair Patricia Dunn who was under investigation for allegedly directing a boardroom spying program and instead to go after a young low-level participant Lockyer said.

“I remember at the time saying to Tom ‘I can’t do that. Will you think about justice?’” Lockyer said. Girardi ended their friendship with a letter that stated “I never want to talk to you again.”

At the time Lockyer recalled “I considered him one of my best friends.”

Girardi’s most consistent request of politicians was a say in which lawyers got seats on the bench.

“I make no bones about influencing judicial appointments. Awful you say? Unethical? Well who better to recommend a man to the bench than someone who works with him every day” he wrote in the memoir entitled “May It Please The Court.” His ghostwriter Dennis McDougal shared a copy with The Times.

While some judges are elected in California governors fill vacancies and nominate appellate and Supreme Court posts. Girardi’s connections with governors dated to the early 1970s when he worked to get Brown elected. It's not unusual for an attorney to offer an opinion on a prospective judge's fitness but Girardi's role went well beyond that. He often told stories of how he and other legal insiders met in the back of a private club to decide which of their L.A. peers were deserving of judgeships.

Girardi described in the memoir how he would then surprise the aspiring judge by having Brown swear the new jurist in during a dinner party at his Pasadena home. The former governor did not respond to questions about Girardi’s account or their relationship.

Attorneys throughout California began to turn to him for assistance in getting on the bench. In one example Girardi pressed the chief of staff for then-Sen. Barbara Boxer to throw her support behind L.A. Superior Court Judge Carolyn Kuhl's unsuccessful nomination to the federal appellate bench in 2003 according to an account at the time in the Daily Journal.

“She’s conservative. But she’s honest” the paper quoted Girardi as telling Boxer’s top aide who responded that the senator highly valued his opinion.

Girardi pushed for other state court judges who did make it onto the federal bench according to congressional records. When then-Superior Court Judge S. James Otero was up for a U.S. District Court seat in 2003 Sen. Dianne Feinstein told the judiciary committee that she was prepared to provide ""many quotes"" about the candidate from Girardi among other supporters.

Later Girardi appeared to be coordinating efforts to promote judicial candidates with his close friend state bar investigator Tom Layton. Emails uncovered during a lawsuit Layton brought against the bar suggest the former sheriff’s deputy was acting as Girardi’s gatekeeper with prospective judges.

In one 2014 message a deputy attorney general Kim Nguyen informed Layton she was working on her application and would “send you and Mr. Girardi an updated version shortly.""

“We are already on board” Layton replied. Nguyen was elected to L.A. Superior Court in 2016. She did not respond to a message seeking comment.

Several top bar officials including board presidents also received offers of help from another Girardi pal bar executive director Joe Dunn to get court positions according to an internal bar report that found such offers were harmful to “proper governance.” The report also recounted how Layton approached Jayne Kim a prosecutor at the agency and held out “assistance from Tom Girardi in helping her to become a judge or to achieve some other professional goal.”

Questioned under oath Layton denied making the offer to Kim and downplayed his role in judgeships.

“Are there things Mr. Girardi can do to help people become a judge?” asked the bar attorney conducting the deposition. After Layton said he didn’t know the attorney replied “Well I think you do know.”

Newsom broke with his predecessors in 2019 and publicly revealed the advisors who help the governor select judges. Girardi was listed on the panel that evaluates potential jurists in L.A.

What Girardi got in return for his efforts is not easily quantified. He maintained warm friendships with judges especially in Southern California. He was often seen dining with them and many attended the bashes he threw each year in Las Vegas when plaintiffs lawyers gathered for a convention. He sometimes presented himself as speaking for members of the judiciary such as in a letter to former L.A. County Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey.

“Several judges and justices have mentioned to me that it would be great if you support AB 2205” Girardi wrote in 2016 referencing a public safety reform being debated in Sacramento. Lacey wrote back assuring him her office was supporting the measure.

The cozy relationships sometimes attracted criticism. In 1997 he and another lawyer spent $350000 to charter a Mediterranean cruise ship whose guest list included 10 active or retired judges. When The Times discovered the junket and contacted the judges most of the jurists said they had reimbursed the cost of the trip or planned to.

For some who faced Girardi in court like Carlsbad attorney Terence Mix the esteem Girardi held among judges was striking.

“We were in chambers discussing the case and Girardi comes in and the judge who was sitting behind the desk stood up and said ‘Oh Mr. Girardi I’ve never met you before'” Mix recalled of a 2013 legal malpractice case. “I was like ‘What are you going to do? Genuflect?’ It was clear he revered him.”

Some of the hottest major brands around today are also relatively young: Apple debuted in 1976 Amazon was launched in 1995 and Google didn’t fully hatch until 1998. While these snazzy tech entities tend to dominate top rankings lists — wowing critics with their innovations and enhancements — there’s a lot to be said for brands that have proven their resilience and endurance by standing the test of time.

There are more than a handful of big-name companies that were founded over a century ago and are still going strong today. When they were created there was no internet no computer and many deadly viruses like polio and H1N1 influenza (the root of the Spanish Flu pandemic) — no vaccine. These businesses weathered the Great Depression World War II and more. They’ve gone through their own ups and downs over the years — with some of them facing their greatest challenges yet as they navigate the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here’s a look at 10 brands that have been around for more than 100 years.

Last updated: March 2 2021

1. Coca-Cola

The Coca-Cola Company was founded back in 1892 several years after the beverage was invented by the pharmacist John S. Pemberton. Back then the fizzy drink spun as a tonic for numerous health ailments contained cocaine — which wasn’t removed from the formula until 1903. Over the years the Coca-Cola Company has grown to become a giant in the beverage industry ushering in other popular soda brands including Sprite Fanta Schweppes and Diet Coke. Coca-Cola has a global brand value of over $70 billion and its stock was trading at about $53 as of mid-December 2020.

2. J.C. Penney

J.C. Penney has had its ups and downs and then more downs in recent years as in-store retail struggles to stay relevant but 100 years ago the brand had nothing but potential. Founded in 1902 by James Cash Penney J.C. Penney was originally named The Golden Rule named after the concept that one should treat others as they wish to be treated. The company had just one locale in Kemmerer Wyoming but grew in part because of its savvy expansion overseas and its adoption of mail-order catalogs.

In 2020 the brand announced that it would close up to 200 stores in a financial restructuring effort that saw the company file for bankruptcy in May. In December Simon Property Group and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. purchased the department store chain. J.C. Penney stock has tanked and as of Dec. 14 was trading for only 15 cents a share — which might have been decent back in 1902 but not today.

The United Parcel Service is young in comparison to the USPS which was founded back in 1775 but UPS still weighs in at over 100 years old having been established back in 1908 by a 19-year-old Seattleite named James E. Case and fellow teen Claude Ryan. Launched as American Messenger Company the brand was renamed United Postal Service in 1925. UPS didn’t go public until 1999. UPS has had to tackle plenty of challenges during the pandemic — mostly related to an over-demand of its services. The shipping company had to turn down retailers after being overcapacity in December.

On the Wall Street side of things UPS is faring well. A recent CNN poll among 26 investment analysts found the consensus to be that UPS is a good stock to buy as it’s held steady since November. As of market close on Dec. 14 UPS stock was priced at over $166.

Boeing Airline company

4. Boeing

The Boeing Company dates back to 1916 founded by timber merchant William E. Boeing as Aero Products Company. The aircraft manufacturer was renamed Boeing Airplane Company in 1917. The brand made major strides in the military air-mail and of course passenger space and for decades it looked like nothing could take Boeing down.

Two recent events changed all that: first the regulatory ban placed on Boeing’s 737 Max the company’s star aircraft following two fatal crashes. Second is the pandemic which bulldozed the air travel industry and prompted mass layoffs at Boeing. With the 737 Max cleared for takeoff in 2021 investor interest in Boeing has been resuscitated. As of the evening of Dec. 14 Boeing stock was at $229.15.

7. Kraft Foods

Founded in 1903 by James L. Kraft Kraft Foods started as a cheese delivery service catering to the Chicago area. Soon after James and his brother Charles Kraft patented a spoil-proof processed cheese that became a big hit with the U.S. Army during World War I. As a brand Kraft has been moved around within various mega-corporations. In 1988 the tobacco giant Philip Morris scooped up Kraft integrating it into its other food businesses Nabisco and General Foods. Philip Morris eventually changed its name to Altria Group and Kraft split into two brands: one serving North America as Kraft the other with a focus on international snacks as Mondelēz International. In 2015 Heinz acquired Kraft.

Kraft Heinz stock wasn’t looking too hot in late 2019 when 3G Capital tossed 25 million shares to drop its stake in the company to around 20% but the pandemic turned all that around. Consumers have been buying more shelf-stable and packaged goods showing rejuvenated interest in Kraft. At the end of October 2020 Kraft announced that it had beat its third-quarter earnings forecast with quarterly sales up 6% to $6.44 billion.

The state of entertainment properties and production companies has changed a lot over the past few decades. If you take a look at the number of production studios that were releasing films between 1990 and 2020 you'll see that it has shrunk considerably. And while there are new film businesses creating inventive projects like A24 things have become homogenized for the most part. Just take a look at how much Disney owns — but does it own American Idol?

Does Disney own 'American Idol'?

While Disney has been an entertainment juggernaut for decades and decades there's no doubt it grew its powers and audience reach to new heights after it took ownership over Marvel and the Star Wars franchise. Then it seemed like The Mouse was going to gobble up all other entertainment properties like 20th Century Fox.

It's the reason why X-Men films weren't being included as part of the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe and the past few films featuring mutants felt worlds apart from the successful crop of MCU titles like the Avengers series of films and all of the standalone superhero flicks inundating theaters (and now streaming services) that get constant play.

So what parts of Fox does Disney own and what does it not own?

It's important to note that Disney doesn't own all of Fox but 60 percent of all of 21st Century Fox. According to NPR ""Disney which already owns the Pixar Marvel and the Star Wars brands will now also get Deadpool and the Fox-owned Marvel characters such as the X-Men and Fantastic Four allowing for the full Marvel family to be united. Disney also now owns former Fox television networks such as FX Networks and National Geographic Partners.""

The outlet went on to state ""Disney will also get Fox's 30 percent ownership of Hulu giving Disney a controlling share of 60 percent."" So what portion of Fox does Disney not own? Well a newly formed company Fox Corp operates as its own business entity outside of Disney's operating arms. This includes Fox News the Fox Network and other Fox TV stations. This arguably makes more sense for Disney from a political standpoint.

So who owns 'American Idol'?

When it comes to the ownership of TV shows there are a lot of different factors that come into play. Usually production companies own the rights to specific shows however networks and these companies work out deals that delineate varying degrees of ownership. American Idol may have started on Fox's network TV channel however it's now playing on ABC.

So one would assume that since Disney owns a big chunk of Fox and has stake in its properties and owns 100 percent of ABC then that should mean The Mouse officially owns all of American Idol now and the right to playing all of its episodes correct? Well it's not that simple. The show was created by Simon Fuller and is based off the British TV series Pop Idol — and it's actually produced by Fremantle North America 19 Entertainment which ""sells"" the show to a network to be aired on.

American Idol judge Simon Cowell apparently had a disagreement with Simon Fuller back in the day and left Pop Idol in order to make The X Factor but a lawsuit from Fuller claiming that parts of Cowell's popular new show ripped off of Pop Idol. They settled for Fuller to have a stake in X Factor and Cowell had agreed to appear on the U.S. offshoot American Idol.

So while Disney can now play the episodes the show's intellectual properties belong to Simon Fuller — meaning he's getting a taste of all the profits wherever the show is streamed or licensed to be a part of. Cowell at the height of American Idol's peak was earning a salary of $33 million a season. That just gives you an idea of how profitable the show is if they're giving Cowell that much per season.

The Phoblographer has written a lot about photo sharing sites that screw over the photographer. By that we mean that they won’t pay a photographer for the work that they generate — luckily Clickasnap isn’t doing that. Instead they’re choosing to pay photographers based on views digital downloads sales etc. It seems like a great idea right? Well let’s analyze a bit further.

What is ClickaSnap

According to their website Clickasnap claims to be the world’s’ first and only one-stop-shop for sharing managing and monetizing your art. “We want to help people earn money for their work” their description claims. “We are tired of parasitic companies capitalizing on your work earning billions whilst you earn nothing. ClickaSnap is here to address that.” To most photographers that sounds wonderful. And depending on who you are you could see them as either a savior or a partner. To each their own of course.

Here’s what the rest of their description says:

With systems in place to sell your photos as downloads physical prints earn per view private art galleries and the ability to licence your photos with world first licensing systems. We are constantly innovating to ensure you receive the best experience the most exposure and most importantly real money for your content. We want ClickSnap to be the world’s’ largest still image club learn from masters teach others watch your content be subjectively judged by real people unknowingly rating your content. Join in conversations spend time on our forums upload your content lose no rights earn money for that next lens. Help us grow and in turn we will help you earn an income. Welcome to Web 3.0 the web companies that give back.

Of course they’re far different from Getty and a whole bunch of other platforms.

Is Clickasnap Worth it?

We’ll admit that we haven’t done a thorough test of it for ourselves. But based on how photographers make money we think that it could work very well if you’ve got a massive online following or if you’re a semi-professional photographer. We don’t think that you’ll get rich quick off of it — or at least most photographers won’t. But it surely can work pretty well.

Pros

Photographers get paid by views

They’re genuinely trying something new.

Various ways to monetize your images

Cons

You have to pay money to get your start with the platform to begin with

The photography available isn’t all that exciting

How Does Clickasnap Work?

Before I get into my issues with Clickasnap let me first explain how it works for those that don’t know.

It’s simple. Photographers upload their images and depending on what subscription they’re on they can earn money from their photographs. There are a couple of ways to earn money. The first way is through views. That’s right Clicksnap will pay you 0.25¢ for each view you get. You can also sell your images as digital downloads and in some cases as physical products (such as prints). Photographers can only withdraw funds once they have earned $15.

Unsplash is one of the biggest culprits of abusing photographers for example. They take a photographer’s work strip them of all their image rights and don’t pay them a single penny. Payment in their eyes is exposure. So it’s no surprise we don’t like them. But in steps Clickasnap. It’s a company that wants photographers to get paid but there are certainly some flaws in its execution.

How Does ClickaSnap Make Money: A Possible Issue for Some Photographers

“Clickasnap is the world’s first free to use paid per view still image hosting site” says CEO Tom Oswald. Nothing in that statement is factually incorrect. However it is misleading.

Photographers using a free account don’t get paid. They can upload photos but they’ll need to subscribe to a paid account if they want to earn money. So my problem with the above quote is the lack of full transparency. I get that companies need to do fluffy persuasive PR but have more respect for the photographer. Don’t imply they can earn money without investing some of their own.

The Landing Page

When arriving at the website you’ll see a range of images uploaded by photographers. Sadly there’s a lot of photography that my blind grandmother could make – and she’s dead!

What’s the problem with this? Well if a company is looking for stock photographs the first impression is important. If I arrive on the first page of a stock photo website and the first thing I see is amateur work why would I spend time searching and hoping to find quality photographs? Clickasnap needs to implement some form of quality control for its home page and fast!

This issue may seem small but it really could drive companies to go back to using the rights grab websites to get images for free. While we don’t like services such as Unspalsh they offer a clean website with quality photographs on the home page making it more attractive to users. If you want to knock them out of the market sites like Clickasnap need to offer something attractive to those who pay for stock photography.

This brings us to the next issue.

The Website

I have no clue what the company’s budget is but it’s not difficult to create a clean website in 2021. Honestly the website looks better placed in the early 2000s. That doesn’t mean it’s hip and retro it means it’s visually unpleasing.

On several pages there are typos in the copy. It makes the site look unprofessional and may put people off. Some of the links at the bottom of the home page don’t work. And some of the links feel like they take you to a different website even though it’s the same one.

Essentially branding and image are all over the place. It’s really not a user-friendly experience.

Is ClickaSnap Legit or a Scam?

I like the concept. I like that Clickasnap wants the photographer to get paid. But the company must ensure it offers a platform that helps the photographer. Any serious company wanting to pay for stock photography will be put off by the above issues.

Think of it like this. Let’s say I go to a physical photography gallery to buy some prints. As soon as I walk through the door the first thing I see is awful work. I decide to keep going but when I ask the staff a question they don’t give me a transparent answer. The copy underneath the prints are full of spelling errors. The layout of the gallery is confusing and it’s easy to get lost. Am I going to take out my wallet and invest in some work? No.

User experience is everything as is design and execution. I hope Clickasnap succeeds mainly for the photographer. But it needs to get its “digital gallery” cleaned up in order for that to happen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWF0YW5kaHJhLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9hbmRocmEtbmV3cy9iYWxhLWtyaXNobmFzLWZsb3Atc2hvdy1tYWRlLWhpbS1hbmdyeS0xMTE1NDLSAVZodHRwczovL21vYmkuZ3JlYXRhbmRocmEuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYmFsYS1rcmlzaG5hcy1mbG9wLXNob3ctbWFkZS1oaW0tYW5ncnkvMTExNTQyL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bala Krishna's Flop Show Made Him Angry..,"Senior actor and Telugu Desam Party legislator from Hindupur Nandamuri Balakrishna known for his rude behaviour and loss of composure when it is needed most was at it again on Saturday.

During his campaign in the municipal elections in his constituency Hindupur in Anantapur district Balakrishna lost his cool and slapped a party worker who tried to take the snap of his favourite actor.

As part of the campaign Balakrishna accompanied by his party leaders went to a house in Srikanthapuram colony in Hindupur. Since the house was too small to accommodate several people at a time Balakrishna apparently felt suffocated.

It was then he saw a young man trying to take a snap on his mobile. An agitated Balayya shouted at him rushed to him and gave him a wholesome slap.

The fan was taken aback and was saying something apologetically but Balakrishna tried to attack him once again before leaving the place.

The video of Balayya shouting at the young man abusing him and slapping him went viral in the social media causing a lot of embarrassment to the TDP leaders.

Though it is not uncommon that Balakrishna displays such a rude behaviour the video certainly showed the party in poor light.

So within a couple of hours the TDP leaders released another video of the young man who was slapped by Balakrishna giving his version.

The young man apparently parroting the script written by the TDP leaders said he was not slapped but was just pushed by Balakrishna while going out because the room was overcrowded.

“Please don’t believe the rumours in the social media. I am a great fan of Balakrishna and he has not done anything rude with me” the young man said.

Apparently the reason for Balakrishna’s anger was lack of response from the people for his road shows in Hindupur for the last two days.

He was also angry with the TDP leaders who laughed at the way he was speaking to the media after conducting prayers at a temple.

So having no other way to give vent to his anger Balakrishna displayed it at the poor young man who wanted to click the picture of his favourite hero!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjQ1OTg5MC9jaGFybG90dGUtZGF3c29uLXRpZ2VyLXN0cmlwZXMtdW5kZXJ3ZWFyL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjQ1OTg5MC9jaGFybG90dGUtZGF3c29uLXRpZ2VyLXN0cmlwZXMtdW5kZXJ3ZWFyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New mum Charlotte Dawson embraces her ‘tiger stripes’ as she strips down to white underwear...,"'REAL' New mum Charlotte Dawson embraces her ‘tiger stripes’ as she strips down to white underwear

The Electric Highway Coalition – made up of Southern Company American Electric Power Dominion Energy Duke Energy Entergy Corporation and the Tennessee Valley Authority – wants to collaborate on a network of DC fast chargers from the Atlantic Coast through the Midwest and South and into the Gulf Coast and Central Plains regions.

Southern Company and the others are each taking steps to provide EV charging solutions within their system service territories. The announcement represents an unprecedented combined effort to offer EV drivers convenient charging across different utility footprints and allow uninterrupted travel.

The Edison Electric Institute estimates 18 million EVs will be on U.S. roads by 2030. While many drivers recognize the benefits of driving an EV such as the ease of low-cost home charging some have expressed concern with the availability of charging stations during long road trips. With collaborative efforts like the Electric Highway Coalition energy companies demonstrate to customers that EVs are a smart choice regardless of distance.

The coalition will provide drivers with effective efficient and convenient charging options to enable long-distance electric travel. Sites along major highways with easy access and amenities for travelers are being considered as coalition members work to determine final charging station locations. DC fast chargers can get drivers back on the road in 20-30 minutes.

“At Southern Company we are committed to being a leader in building a clean and sustainable energy future for our customers and that includes continuing to increase the reach of electric transportation for more and more drivers” said Chris Cummiskey executive vice president chief commercial officer and customer solutions officer at Southern Company. “By increasing the number of EV fast-charging stations across our footprint we are providing drivers with additional transportation options that are reliable efficient and more convenient while helping reduce carbon emissions for the benefit of our communities we serve.”

Being a founding member of the Electric Highway Coalition is another part of Southern Company’s larger focus on electrification of the transportation industry and commitment to sustainability and clean energy. Along with the systemwide goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 last year Southern Company announced an internal fleet electrification goal where the company plans by 2030 to convert to electric 50% of its electric companies’ fleet vehicles in the auto/SUV/minivan forklift and ATV/cart/miscellaneous equipment segments.

The Electric Highway Coalition welcomes interested utilities to join as it seeks to extend the reach of network. Additionally its members support and look forward to working with other regional utility transportation corridor electrification initiatives.

GEORGE Utah — The future is looking bright for Southern Utah's tech community.

Already there are four companies signed on to be a part of Tech Ridge an area being developed on the west side of St. George.

Fox 13 News / Google Maps

The companies that are there or are in the process of building their offices are Zonos Vasion BusyBusy and Intergalactic (formerly Airborne ECS).

""Typically if a company became really successful in the past in St. George you needed to move to Salt Lake City so you could recruit the right talent"" said Isaac Barlow the Managing Partner of Tech Ridge and the CEO of BusyBusy.

The hope is that Tech Ridge can be a place for startups or existing companies to grow so they don't have to move to bigger cities.

Clint Reid the CEO & Founder of Zonos said ""The same people were asking questions to tech companies up in Northern Utah about - 'Hey Silicon Valley why wouldn’t you be building your company here? Everybody’s here right?' It’s a different world today than it was five years ago and five years ago for them.""

That different world includes the ability to work remotely which has been pushed into place more prominently by the COVID-19 pandemic something another local tech company realizes.

""I think just with the whole craze with working from home has allowed a lot of entrepreneurs to really just open up and start businesses from anywhere"" said McKay Bird the Marketing Director at TCN.

The ability to work from home can be especially beneficial to companies like Intergalactic an aerospace tech company that needs highly skilled engineers to help create next-generation space technology.

Brian McCann the President and CEO of Intergalactic said ""To get that kind of technology you’ve got to find like-minded engineers and if we force them to move to St. George you’re going to really narrow the hiring pool.""

So they give engineers the option to work remotely at first before transitioning them to St. George over time.

""I think Utah draws a very unique group of entrepreneurial-minded people and so there’s a ton of talent in Utah"" said Brittany Fay the Director of Corporate Marketing at Vasion.

All of this could eventually help bring more tech companies to the red rocks of Southern Utah including some bigger names.

Garrett Helmer the Chief Marketing Officer at Vasion said ""I absolutely do believe larger logos will find this to be an awesome place to put satellite offices but I also see this being a place of incubation for new startups for many years to come in St. George.""

Another great thing for Southern Utah tech companies is the connection they have to Dixie Technical College and Dixie State University.

These help them source talented people who are already nearby to fill their open positions and foster young talent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3NhcG9ydGFyZXBvcnQuY29tL2dlb3JnaWEtcG93ZXItcmFpc2VzLWNhc2gtZm9yLXNvbGFyLWRpdmVyc2Utc3VwcGxpZXJzLXRocm91Z2gtc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHktYm9uZC9zZWN0aW9ucy9yZXBvcnRzL2RhdmlkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Georgia Power raises cash for solar diverse suppliers through sustainability bond - SaportaReport,"By David Pendered

Georgia Power has raised about $742 million through a sustainability bond. Proceeds are to be spent on projects that align with the growing demand by institutional investors that utilities seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.

Georgia Power intends to spend the money on expanding its solar portfolio. In addition the spending is to target “diverse and small business suppliers” according to a Feb. 26 statement announcing that day’s sale of the bond.

Sustainability bonds are viewed as a wave of the future. They serve as common ground for companies in search of money and investors looking to place their money in a socially responsible fund. Moody’s delivered a succinct description in a Feb. 4 research announcement that predicted a 32% increase this year in the sustainability sector:

“Sustainability-linked bonds have strong growth potential as they allow issuers to maintain the flexibility of general corporate purposes borrowing while potentially still appealing to sustainability-minded investors.”

Georgia Power reported the bond is the first sustainability bond to be issued by a U.S. utility. Moody’s rated the bonds Baa1 with a stable outlook according to Georgia Power. The bond rating is medium grade and subject to moderate credit risk according to Moody’s rating scale.

Georgia Power’s parent the Southern Co. set the stage for the bond issuance with its Sustainable Financing Framework released Jan. 4. The framework calls for spending to align with one of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals.

Southern announced in 2020 a goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050. In its federal financial report for 2020 released Feb. 18 Southern reported that “system management expects to achieve sustained GHG emissions reductions of at least 50% as early as 2025” using 2007 as the baseline.

Dan Tucker Georgia Power’s executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer made the following observation about the sustainability bond:

“The sustainability bond issued today is aligned with our ongoing commitment to building a clean and sustainable energy future for Georgia Power customers and the state. By allocating the proceeds of this bond to fund our social environmental and renewable initiatives the company is able to secure benefits for all customers that will last for up to 30 years by way of long-term low-cost financing.”

The stakes are rising quickly in the energy sector for companies to reduce GHG emissions. In addition to investors the Biden administration is expected to press for sustainable finance and investment according to Moody’s Feb. 4 announcement.

In December the nation’s third-largest public pension fund announced that in five years it will begin selling shares in companies that don’t meet “minimum standards” in transitioning to net zero GHG emissions by 2040. The New York State Common Retirement Fund was valued at an estimated $226 billion according to a Dec. 9 statement in which the state comptroller observed:

“We continue to assess energy sector companies in our portfolio for their future ability to provide investment returns in light of the global consensus on climate change. Those that fail to meet our minimum standards may be removed from our portfolio. Divestment is a last resort but it is an investment tool we can apply to companies that consistently put our investment’s long-term value at risk.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMDYvYXdheS1mcm9tLXNpbGljb24tdmFsbGV5LXRoZS1taWxpdGFyeS1pcy10aGUtaWRlYWwtY3VzdG9tZXIv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVudmVycG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8wNi9hd2F5LWZyb20tc2lsaWNvbi12YWxsZXktdGhlLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWlzLXRoZS1pZGVhbC1jdXN0b21lci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Away from Silicon Valley the military is the ideal customer,"By Cade Metz c.2021 The New York Times Company

SAN CLEMENTE Calif. — Over the rolling scrub-spotted hills of the Southern California coast where defense contractors once tested rockets and lasers for President Ronald Reagan’s “Star Wars” missile defense program what looked like a big mechanical insect stalked a white pickup truck.

Half a mile away 28-year-old Palmer Luckey one of the tech industry’s proudest iconoclasts talked excitedly about the military potential of the flying machine — a self-piloting drone called Ghost that his startup company Anduril built.

“You can just set it up and then go do something else while it maneuvers” he said.

Although parts of Silicon Valley have kept the Pentagon at arm’s length in recent years Luckey’s company based 400 miles to the south in Irvine is aggressively courting business from government agencies and the military.

It is one of a number of young tech companies many of them far from Silicon Valley that are shrugging off the concerns about the potential militarization of their creations that in recent years have stirred employee revolts at industry giants like Google and Microsoft.

On a recent afternoon Luckey dressed as if ready for the beach in a Hawaiian-like shirt shorts and flip-flops joined other Anduril employees at the company’s testing site near Camp Pendleton a Marine training facility.

As the drone took off and swooped between the hills Luckey said it could track an object and capture detailed images from seven football fields away. Using many of the artificial intelligence technologies that underpin self-driving cars Anduril’s drones can identify and track vehicles people and other objects largely on their own.

The drones are not armed but could be useful for guarding bases or reconnaissance. The same sensor technologies that allow the drones to fly on their own could also be used to identify targets on a battlefield.

Luckey who sold his previous company the virtual reality startup Oculus to Facebook for $2 billion shrugged off the question of whether tech companies should willingly work with the military and intelligence communities.

“Most engineers want to engineer. They want to get stuff done” the outspoken entrepreneur said as artillery fire echoed from a nearby range. “Most people have a pretty practical view.”

The military and intelligence communities have a long history with research labs and tech companies in Silicon Valley. ARPANET the forerunner of the internet was funded by the Defense Department. David Packard one of the founders of Hewlett-Packard served as deputy secretary of defense under President Richard Nixon. Oracle one of the biggest software companies got its start writing computer code for the CIA.

But the idea of autonomous weapons has been controversial in Silicon Valley and in recent years some in the tech industry have developed a new distrust of government work.

That distrust swelled in 2013 when former defense contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents that revealed the breadth of spying on Americans by intelligence services including monitoring the users of large internet companies. In 2018 Google pulled out of a Defense Department effort to develop artificial intelligence technology after sustained protests from company workers.

Parts of the Valley firmly draw the line at weaponization of their creations. Mike Volpi a partner with the venture capital firm Index Ventures said that Anduril’s drone technology impressed him but that his firm would not invest in any company whose technology could be used with weapons.

“There are many ways to make money” Volpi said. “If a company has a stated strategy to hurt people we would not invest.”

But a growing array of venture capital firms see things differently. Anduril is backed by several notable ones including Founders Fund created by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel; Andreessen Horowitz; and General Catalyst.

“We have the greatest technologists in the world in Silicon Valley” said Katherine Boyle a General Catalyst partner. “We really need to have Silicon Valley working with Washington.”

With seed funding from the Founders Fund Anduril was created in 2017. The founders included several former employees of Palantir the Founders Fund-backed company that helps collect and analyze data for the government and Luckey.

Anduril chose Irvine the heart of Orange County partly because of the proximity to military posts and partly because the founders wanted to avoid the growing distrust for military work in Silicon Valley.

“We are 400 miles away from Silicon Valley” Luckey said. “Attitudes in Orange County have always been more pro-military.”

Luckey is known for bucking Silicon Valley stereotypes. Just before Anduril was founded he was pressured to leave Facebook after he donated to an organization built to spread anti-Hillary Clinton internet memes in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. When I visited Anduril’s test site on a recent afternoon other employees were wearing masks and standing 6 feet apart. But Luckey was maskless and he asked if I would shake hands.

In the drone business however Luckey is not alone. A host of startups are building similar technology for the military. Shield AI founded by a former member of the Navy SEALs is in San Diego not far from Anduril. Teal Drones whose founder emerged from Thiel’s internship program is in Salt Lake City.

The Defense Department is hungry for small drones that will track objects and fly into buildings combat zones and other dangerous areas with little help from remote pilots. Self-piloting drones will become a key part of fighting and other military activities in the years to come said Mike Brown director of the Defense Innovation Unit a Pentagon organization that aims to facilitate cooperation between the military and the tech industry.

“We need to make sure we have friendly sources to buy from” he said.

Although some of the startups say their drones have already been used by the military the technology is still in the early stages of deployment. But it raises concerns that artificial intelligence systems used in tandem with weapons could erode the role of human decision-making in combat.

Asked if their drone technology could be used alongside weapons some startups say it could. This they argue will be an essential part of U.S. efforts to maintain military parity with other countries. “Most people understand that this is part of what the military does” Luckey said.

Shield AI is fashioning autonomous drones for intelligence reconnaissance and surveillance in combat and it says U.S. Special Operations Command has already used them in the field (which the Defense Department confirmed). A Shield AI co-founder Ryan Tseng said this kind of technology like Anduril’s could be used with weapons.

But Skydio a drone company in Silicon Valley founded by former Google employees is more cautious. “We are not putting weapons on the drone” the chief executive Adam Bry said. “Weaponization is the one thing where you want less automation not more.”

Inside its warehouselike headquarters in Irvine Anduril is building a wide range of technologies including sensor towers that can be used as a kind of “virtual border wall.” U.S. Customs and Border Protection is already using these towers to monitor parts of the southern border in Texas and California. It is also looking at using Anduril’s Ghost drones for similar purposes said Chris Brose the company’s chief strategy officer.

A company spokesperson later said Anduril had done only “very early demonstration flights” with Customs and Border Protection. The company will not say how much its drones cost.

But Anduril — named for a sword in J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” trilogy — is also building drones for military use. Standing atop a hill overlooking the site where the company was testing its drones Luckey and Brian Schimpf another Anduril co-founder and the company’s chief executive said the drones were used by Britain’s Royal Marines and had been tested by U.S. military but they will not say which branches.

The drones will provide surveillance in and around military bases much as they can along the Mexican border. Luckey and Schimpf hope they can also be used for reconnaissance and other purposes.

“You just say ‘Find this thing.’ And that’s what it does” Luckey said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd5bXQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMDYvbG9nYW4tY29ycG9yYXRpb24tZXhwYW5kaW5nLW1hZ29mZmluLWNvdW50eS1sb2NhdGlvbi_SAWRodHRwczovL3d3dy53eW10LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzA2L2xvZ2FuLWNvcnBvcmF0aW9uLWV4cGFuZGluZy1tYWdvZmZpbi1jb3VudHktbG9jYXRpb24vP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Logan Corporation expanding Magoffin County location,"SALYERSVILLE Ky. (WYMT) - The Logan Corporation a manufacturing company based out of West Virginia will be expanding employment opportunities in Eastern Kentucky after receiving a $500000 business loan from Southern Kentucky Economic Development (SKED).

SKED was awarded the $500000 grant from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Office of Community Services (OCS).

In a news release from SKED officials state the Logan Corporation intends to match the loan funds with private funding to implement a $950000 expansion project that aims to create 25 new jobs in Magoffin County.

SKED called on the services of Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment Program (EKCEP) Inc. to help to match the jobs with the local people who would benefit most and give them the tools to succeed.

“EKCEP is proud to already have a strong history of assisting Logan Corporation with on-the-job training resources that have helped 40 new hires get up to speed in a hands-on way on the production floor” EKCEP Deputy Director for Employer Engagement and Program Operations Michael Cornett added “and our role through this new project now helps ensure we can intervene—with financial resources or other key support—so that new employees not only start strong but have the best chance for a long-term career with the company.”

Logan Corporation VP of Finance and Administration Kyle Cox said on the project “Working with Brett Traver and his entire team at SKED has made the process easier. There are very few people who care about seeing the people of Kentucky succeed as much as Brett does. All of the partners in this project have worked together so smoothly and allowed me to focus on hiring new employees and making this expansion work.”

Cox also added funding for the project had increased to $1.5 million and is still growing.

The Salyersville location opened in 2016 with 40 workers and currently employs more than 100.

United Airlines had a rocky start to social distancing during the pandemic.

A botched seat blocking policy was quickly abandoned after a customer exposed the airline failing to keep seats open on a flight from Newark to San Francisco. The airline opted to fill flights but not assign middle seats unless necessary instead offering free flight changes to passengers that didn't want to travel on fuller flights.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Out of the big four US airlines United joined American Airlines in filling planes while Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines blocked seats. I took two flights on United in June 2020 and the airline didn't quite impress with its inconsistent social distancing measures and flights with no in-flight service.

Some of those inconsistencies remain but my latest experience on the airline showed how far the airline has come. Aircraft are still being filled to capacity a policy now adopted by all major US airlines besides Delta but United has made improvements to its offering and brought back some amenities that harken back to pre-pandemic times and ultimately make for a better travel experience.

Contactless technologies have proven to be a game-changer for the air transport industry and beyond in recent months. Indeed SITA’s 2020 Air Transport IT Insights report revealed that while airlines and airports have significantly minimised their spending touchless technology remains a high investment priority between now and 2023.

So here we highlight some of the recent solutions airports airlines and other big companies like Amazon and Disney have implemented in order to minimise the spread of viruses and reduce the interaction between passengers and staff – ranging from contactless check-in and security processes to ‘Zero-Touch’ IFE and contactless food & beverage pre-ordering.

Touch-free check-in & bag drop kiosks

Last year efforts ramped up quickly to create a touchless passenger experience at the airport environment. SITA’s report outlines that making the check-in process completely touchless has been a priority for airlines in the past year.

For instance in April Etihad became the first airline to trial new contactless self-service technologies which can estimate a passenger’s vital signs to allow for touchless health screenings at airport kiosks and bag drops.

AirAsia also quickly followed suit and in May the airline introduced several contactless procedures for essential travel including contactless kiosks Passenger Reconciliation System (PRS) contactless payments at the airport as well as enhanced features on its mobile app to help ensure a smooth and safe travel experience. Meanwhile United Airlines was among the first airlines in the US to adopt the technology for check in.

Elsewhere Avinor introduced an end-to-end touchless travel programme enabling passengers to check-in for their flight remotely using their mobiles at the 44 airports in its network; while Changi Airport equipped its check-in kiosks with infrared proximity sensors which can identify the motion of a passenger’s finger as they point towards the options on the screen.

Biometrics technology also has a major part to play in creating a touchless travel experience. The implementation of the technology in the aviation industry has been well underway in the past few years but its potential to facilitate a more contactless travel experience has accelerated the adoption even further in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to SITA’s report biometrics remain the focus for airport investment with 64% of airports aiming to roll out self-boarding gates using biometric and ID documentation by 2023 three times as many as in 2020. Airlines have doubled implementations and plan to double investment for self-boarding using biometric and ID documentation by 2023.

Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) for instance introduced one of the most comprehensive programmes to ensure contactless passenger journey form “parking to boarding” at Kempegowda International Airport Bengaluru (BLR Airport). The airport verifies the passenger’s identify using facial biometrics. Facial recognition technology then gets the passenger through check-in bag check security screening and onto the plane.

At Denver International Airport passengers can use an app called VeriFly to reserve an arrival time at a dedicated TSA screening lane where they then scan their QR access code for entry at a touchless gate.

Zero-touch IFE

In times when passengers have become more wary of touching surfaces some airlines have made updates to their inflight entertainment (IFE) to offer a contactless experience and encourage a BYOD (bring your own device) model. Last year Southwest Airlines for instance launched a series of improvements across its Inflight Entertainment Portal which allows customers to stream inflight content without having to download an app before they board.

In more recent news Qatar Airways announced plans to offer passengers touchless technology for its Oryx One inflight entertainment system (IFE) across its A350 fleet. The Zero-Touch technology introduced in partnership with the Thales AVANT IFE system will enable passengers to pair their personal electronic devices (PEDs) with their seat-back IFE screen by connecting to ‘Oryxcomms’ Wi-Fi and simply scanning a QR code displayed on the screen. They can then use their PEDs to navigate and enjoy more than 4000 options on offer through the airline’s Oryx One IFE system.

Contactless shopping f&b delivery

The contactless experience vision has also reinforced changes to the way people shop at the airport terminal. Just this week travel retail company Hudson unveiled its first-ever Hudson Nonstop store using Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology at Dallas Love Field Airport (DAL).

Travellers are able to seamlessly enter the Hudson Nonstop store with a swipe of their credit card or using “Tap to Pay” take the products they’re looking for and then walk out of the store. The store merchandising layout provides visibility to essential products needed for the travel journey. As FTE previously reported Hudson plans to roll-out additional stores in airports across North America in 2021 making contactless shopping opportunities more widely accessible for travellers.

Brian Quinn Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Hudson commented: “Hudson Nonstop represents a new way of retailing that emulates an end-to-end digital shopping experience which we believe is the future of retail even after COVID-19 – we look forward to serving travellers in this exciting new store concept for years to come.”

Airport hospitality group OTG also adopted Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology enabling passengers shopping at its CIBO Express Gourmet Markets at Newark and LaGuardia airports to make last-minute purchases before boarding their flight.

Airports are also teaming up with restaurants in the terminal to make it easier for passengers to use their mobile devices to order food for pick-up and delivery.

Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) launched a contactless airport-wide programme called LAX Order Now which lets passengers order directly from the LAXOrderNow.com site or by scanning QR codes in the airport. Among other US airports to have trialled similar initiatives are San Francisco Airport Philadelphia Airport Boston Logan Airport Chicago Midway Airport and Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.

Elsewhere in Europe Schiphol Airport launched a pilot which allows passengers to pre-order food and drinks at Schiphol’s food & beverage outlets after security control. Passengers can now scan a QR code from one of the physical banners or media screens located at and after the airport security check. The QR code will allow them to place their order pay online and choose a time to pick up their order after going through security.

Contactless payments

Contactless payments were already a common trend way before the pandemic. For instance consumer brands like Apple Google and Samsung began adding digital wallets to their mobile products as early as 2014.

In the past few years we have also seen a number of airlines adapting to this trend including the likes of Singapore Airlines Finnair Delta JetBlue and British Airways who have already embraced digital payment solutions such as Alipay Google Pay and Apple Pay to cater to the modern traveller and provide a simpler payment process.

Meanwhile in the beginning of 2020 Munich Airport became the first airport in Europe to offer a new mobile cashless payment process for customers. The “Smart Checkout – Tap Pay & Enjoy” application lets consumers use their smartphones to pay for products right at the store shelf by scanning an electronic price tag in order to eliminate waiting times at the cash register. For the payment process the customer is redirected to a mobile website. In contrast to existing payment systems on the European market it is not necessary to download the app which makes the user experience more streamlined.

The pandemic has accelerated this trend even further driving consumers to change their behaviour and airports airlines and retailers to accelerate their adoption of the technology. According to SITA’s annual Air Transport IT Insights research 74% of airlines have stated that they want to allow mobile touchless payment for all airline services provided along the journey – from booking to arrival.

Inflight the trend is also picking up and last October United Airlines for instance announced that it will trial touchless digital payment on select routes out of its Denver hub as a way to resume its buy-on-board services.

A look into parallel industries

The contactless revolution can also be seen at parallel industries such as hospitality retail and amusement parks. One instance is Disney World’s approach to reopening operations post-COVID-19. The amusement park has indeed created a more frictionless experience since the introduction of the MagicBand entry bracelets back in 2013. The MagicBands let customers do everything seamlessly – from unlocking their Disney Resort hotel room doors and entering the theme parks to making food and merchandise purchases. Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit Disney has brought even more contactless engagement by using signage with QR codes throughout the park to encourage guests to use features on the park’s mobile app. Disney has also highlighted that last year food and mobile order utilisation skyrocketed from 9% to 84% and nearly 90% of all payments are now cashless. The company is also implementing contactless security screening using artificial intelligence at its theme parks and Disney Springs centre. Going forward the technology is expected to facilitate the arrival process making entering theme parks and Disney Springs quicker and more efficient.

Similarly to the Amazon Just Walk Out technology unveiled at Dallas Love Field Airport this week Amazon also opened its first till-less grocery store in London which marks its first store concept outside of the US. Traditional supermarkets such as Marks & Spencer in the UK are also improving their use of technology in recent months. The store announced in November that it is expanding the use of its “scan pay and go” service to all its UK grocery stores allowing customers to buy their groceries up to £45 without visiting a till.

As airlines and airports are preparing for passenger traffic to bounce back again this summer it is evident that touchless technology will be crucial to reducing the risk for passengers and staff alike.

FTE will continue to follow the topic closely and during the upcoming FTE APEX Virtual Expo (25-26 May) we will also feature a dedicated session on “Delivering touchless travel and a socially distanced airport experience as passenger numbers rise quickly again” which will include speakers from Port of Seattle Denver International Airport and more to be announced soon.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 1.41%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

Metric Q1 2024 Q1 2024 Analysts Estimate Q1 2023 % Change Adjusted EPS $0.56 $0.55 ($0.41) N/A Revenue $3.87 billion $3.83 billion $3.93 billion (1.5%) Gross margin 28.6% N/A 21.2% 7.4 percentage points

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

We decided to start with one of the classics: Starbucks a reliable (if too reliable) fave. In the African-American culture if a food looks bland we’ll often ask if you “doctored” it up. Simply put: Did you add your own spice and flavoring?? That's exactly what I aimed to do with the Starbucks menu.

We went to a few different drive-thrus ordered nearly the entire menu and then took on the task of reinventing every. single. thing. Obviously I can't tell you exactly what the end results were (that's what the video's for!) but I can promise you that you too can easily recreate these new items at home.

Starbucks and Chick-fil-A both rely heavily on drive-thrus and use video technology and handheld tablets to take orders.

Fast food and fast-casual brands across the country have optimized drive-thrus over the last year as they became crucial in the age of COVID-19. Drive-thru orders have grown across the fast-food industry since the pandemic closed many dining rooms.

McDonald's already a drive-thru heavy hitter with 25000 worldwide says that 70% of sales in top markets are from drive-thru orders. Even salad chain Sweetgreen is jumping on the trend. Starbucks and Chick-fil-A are two of the biggest drive-thru players and they've adopted some similar strategies.

On-the-go orders meaning drive-thru and pickup orders made up 80% of Starbucks orders prior to the pandemic Starbucks told Insider and increased more than 10% over pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter of 2021. Drive-thrus have been up industry-wide because they are perceived as a ""safe way to use the brand"" Kalinowski Equity Research founder Mark Kalinowski told Insider.

Starbucks baristas can also take orders through digital drive-thru screens which the company says are installed at about 3800 stores. Starbucks began rolling them out in 2015 and they use AI called ""Deep Brew"" to recommend food and drinks based on the weather and time of day.

The video ordering is a way Starbucks is ""facilitating the barista-customer personal connection"" a spokesperson told Insider. The company is also rolling out handheld devices for baristas to input orders on. Starbucks says they are in 500 stores and were first implemented this past summer.

While giving customers face time with baristas could certainly be a consideration Kalinowski points to how these newer drive-thru technologies can minimize wait times in drive-thrus. ""In a traditional drive-thru there's only one place an order can be taken"" he told Insider. ""That creates huge bottlenecks"" compared to having mobile stations where customers can place orders.

Chick-fil-A is the most well-known example of applying this model. The chain stands out from the drive-thru crowd in large part thanks to its workers with iPads who take orders from cars even before they reach the window. At Chick-fil-A ordering and delivery are ""zones"" not set locations.

Chick-fil-A has also started taking orders virtually through a tablet. Chick-fil-A confirmed to Insider that this is essentially a tech-savvy twist on having workers walk out to take orders. The tablet allows customers to see workers face-to-face without having to wait for them to reach the actual building.

""It allows the Team Member to stay inside while still offering guests the friendly customer experience of a smiling Team Member"" Chick-fil-A told Insider in a statement.

The chicken brand's drive-thrus can get so busy that they create traffic and even legal issues in some locations. Chick-fil-A has installed double drive-thru lanes at some locations with plans to continue adding more. Starbucks says it is designing new drive-thru ideas including double lanes drive-thru-only stores and drive-thru plus curbside pickup locations.

Quick service restaurants have ""learned a lot in last 12 months with things they might never have tested without the pandemic"" Kalinowski told Insider. ""They're still learning so it should continue to get better.""

The biggest coffee chain in the world added more plant-based food and drink options to its menu than ever before. The move is in response to consumer demand. In the last few years more people have learned of the health ethical and environmental benefits of steering away from animal products.



Nearly half of U.S. consumers now regularly purchase vegan milk according to a 2019 study. In the UK Brits are continuously choosing plant-based options over animal-based ones. In fact a study by supermarket chain Sainsbury’s revealed that 91 percent of UK consumers identify as flexitarian.



The story isn’t unique. It’s the same in many countries around the globe with vegan meat and dairy-free products becoming bigger business than ever. And Starbucks knows this. At the 2018 Seeds and Chips global food conference in Milan founder Howard Schultz said “the opportunity for plant-based food is huge.”

The Importance of Sustainability

Starbucks knows there’s more to sustainability than offering vegan options. It took steps to reduce its carbon footprint by announcing that by 2025 it aims to run 10000 stores on renewable energy.



Kevin Johnson Starbucks’ chief executive officer spoke on a conference panel at the Global Climate Action Summit in 2018. He said “If you look at this problem on a global basis it can be so overwhelming it’s discouraging. The only way to look at this problem is ‘am I partnering with other like-minded organizations in the public and private sectors and NGOs to work progress?’”



He explained that although Starbucks is of course about turning a profit it’s “also about doing what’s right.” He continued “One of our social impact pillars is sustainability. We are a company that believes in the fabric of mission and values that the pursuit of profit is not in conflict with the pursuit of doing good.”

Recycling and Fighting Plastic Pollution

The chain has also debunked the myth that paper coffee cups can’t be recycled. In 2018 it managed to recycle 25 million coffee cups after sending 18 truckloads to Sustana a paper mill in Wisconsin to “make a point” according to Fast Company. Jay Hunsberger the VP of sales for North America for Sustana told the publication that Starbucks wanted to “demonstrate that a coffee cup can be turned back into a coffee cup.”

Starbucks is also on a mission to do what it can to combat plastic pollution. That same year it revealed its decision to eliminate straws from all of its stores. The chain replaced them with lids for cold cups similar to the design it uses for its hot beverages.

Starbucks Vegan Options Across the Globe

In 2020 Starbucks Portugal launched new vegan cakes and sandwiches. In the Phillippines it launched decadent vegan chocolate cakes. South Korean customers also have vegan options including cake and focaccia.



The same year Starbucks Hong Kong launched two new menu items featuring vegan meat made by Impossible Foods. the Maize Impossible Sandwich—topped with egg mayonnaise and cheese — and the Spiced Impossible Puff use Impossible’s plant-based meat but include eggs and dairy.



The company added five new menu items across China each featuring plant-based meat. The “GOOD GOOD” menu includes three distinct pasta and lasagna dishes now served at more than 3300 Chinese locations and featuring Beyond Meat. Starbucks China also offers vegan meat from Hong Kong-based brand Omnipork in two dishes.

That’s when Drees who owns and operates The Olive Cart in both downtown St. Joseph and in downtown South Haven learned that his St. Joe neighbor was going to retire putting her space on State Street in the central business district up for grabs. With the closing of her doors at State Street Antiques Dave had the golden opportunity to open a new door to his own enterprise at The Olive Cart.

Drees didn’t hesitate to step up and claim the space knocking down the neighboring wall and nicely expanding his popular showcase of a broad array of high quality extra virgin olive oils and aged balsamic vinegars for gourmet cooking fans. Now the expansive tasting room has even more space to offer a unique blend of tapenades glazes stuffed olives pastas sauces mustards spices and much more.

The Crusaders are on the road to making more after another accomplishment Saturday afternoon.

St. Henry defeated Clinton County 74-57 in the championship game of the All “A” Classic boys state basketball tournament at Eastern Kentucky University’s McBrayer Arena. St. Henry won its second consecutive state title and third all-time improving to 15-2 overall.

“It’s incredible” said senior Wyatt Vieth. “We’ve been dreaming of this our entire lives. We’ve been playing ball together since we were 2 and 3 (years old). We’ve been doing this a long time. It’s awesome to bring this back to Northern Kentucky.”

The tournament originally set for the week of Feb. 15 had initially been canceled because of bad weather and road conditions throughout the state. But officials revived it later in the week with an altered format.

“It’s amazing” said senior Ryan Butler. “With all this COVID stuff we didn’t think we would have a tournament but we came back here we defended our title and I’m so glad to do this with all these people. I’ve grown up with them and known them all my life. It’s fun. It’s great for the St. Henry community.”

St. Henry persevered against the Fourth Region champion Bulldogs (18-3) who were the underdogs on paper but stayed close to the Crusaders until the fourth quarter.

Vieth was named the tournament MVP after scoring 27 points in the final shooting 12-of-16 from the floor. Other all-tourney picks were Bessler Butler and senior center Cody Teten.

Bessler posted 13 points and seven rebounds. Teten posted 11 points seven rebounds five assists and two blocks. Butler had seven points and senior Brennon McNamara five. Senior point guard Cory Shea had three assists.

Nick Delk and Blake Melton combined for 36 points for the Bulldogs.

“Going back to back is extremely special” Bessler said. “We’ve made a name for ourselves. Coach (Dave) Faust is a great coach. He’s led us all the way. I owe everything to him. (The Bulldogs) are a great team. (Delk and Melton) were putting the team on their backs. We played good defense and we got the win.”

Vieth scored 10 of St. Henry’s 14 points in the first quarter which ended with the Crusaders trailing by two 16-14.

A 3-pointer by Gabe Ryan and a basket by Shea gave St. Henry a 23-20 lead when Vieth went to the bench with his second foul with 5:30 to play in the second quarter.

St. Henry went on a 12-8 run then with points from five different players before Clinton scored on a tip-in at the buzzer to trail St. Henry 35-30 at the half.

Clinton cut the lead to three at 42-39 in the third quarter. Teten Bessler and Vieth scored baskets on a 6-0 run to put St. Henry up by nine.

Two free throws and a basket by Bessler put St. Henry up by 11 at 56-45 in the fourth quarter.

The Bulldogs cut the lead to six in the fourth quarter. Butler hit a 3-pointer and layup to help stem the tide and push the lead back up to eight at 61-53.

“I had got my third foul early in the third and I was (angry) so I wanted to come back ready to play” Butler said. “I did that and helped set the tone for the fourth quarter and we were able to build the big lead.”

Leading 61-55 St. Henry got a putback from Bessler. On Clinton County’s next possession Shea forced a steal which led to a coast-to-coast layup by Vieth. Vieth scored again in transition on the next trip and the Crusaders pulled away.

Vieth was the MVP for the second year in a row but he loves how the whole team has come together.

“Teams are going to focus on me because I’m the leading scorer but I don’t need to score all the points: he said. “We can go to anyone and that’s what makes us so special. We’re all high-caliber players.”

St. Henry shot 60.4 percent from the floor and forced 15 turnovers. Shea the starting point guard pressured the Clinton ball-handlers in the backcourt and made it harder for the Bulldogs to start their offense.

The Crusaders have to refocus for the last week of the regular season before heading into the 34th District Tournament. The Crusaders ranked fourth in the state by the Associated Press made a lot of noise by beating Covington Catholic on Feb. 23 signaling that they’re a contender in the Ninth Region race.

St. Maries wills its way to first title since 1960,"NAMPA — Amid the confusion in the closing seconds Tristan Gentry took the inbounds pass dribbled up the sideline with the clock running out and flung the ball high into the air moments before the horn sounded.

Sixty-one years later the St. Maries Lumberjacks are state champions again.

St. Maries made big plays late for the second time in less than 24 hours and edged the Ambrose Archers of Meridian 51-50 in the state 2A boys basketball championship game Saturday at the Ford Idaho Center for the Lumberjacks’ first state title since 1960 and second in school history.

“It’s surreal; it’s overwhelming. I don’t even know how to process my emotions right now. I’m kinda numb at the moment” said Gentry who finished with 16 points and 11 rebounds including a couple of HUGE offensive rebounds off missed free throws in the closing minutes. “And this one wasn’t even the most wild one we had.”

No that would be Friday night when Colby Renner hit a 30-foot 3-pointer — his only basket of the game — to lift St. Maries past two-time defending champion North Fremont 45-43 in the semifinals.

“After that game last night we were like ‘Holy cow’” we’ve just got to finish this tomorrow” said Renner who finished with nine points in the title game.

And St. Maries (23-1) did — though the Lumberjacks who led by 10 points late in the third quarter had to respond after Ambrose (21-3) took a 50-45 lead with 1:47 left.

St. Maries senior Eli Gibson hit the first of two free throws with 1:26 left. He missed the second but Gentry a 6-foot-5 junior grabbed the rebound and scored to pull the Lumberjacks within 50-48.

Gibson was fouled again with 58.5 seconds left. Again he made the first free throw and missed the second but Gentry grabbed the offensive rebound was fouled and sank two free throws with 56.8 seconds left to put St. Maries up one.

“I was able to push him (the Ambrose player) under the hoop — not really push him but nudge him under the hoop. I guessed I out-jumped him and that’s it” Gentry said. “We’ve lost games in the past because guys didn’t rebound or box out so that’s what I always focus on.”

Ambrose opted to hold the ball for the last shot. With the clock winding down junior guard Johnny Sugarman who led all scorers with 20 points tried to knife his way between a couple of St. Maries defenders. He ended up putting up a wild scooping layin try from just inside to foul line that missed. The ball was knocked over top of the backboard and out of bounds — St. Maries ball with 3 seconds left.

“What was going through my head was No. 1 (Sugarman) was going to take a crazy shot and make it honestly” Gentry said.

Ambrose railed for a foul call on the play. Meanwhile St. Maries inbounded the ball to Gentry all alone in the far corner and Ambrose couldn’t catch him to foul in time. Ambrose moved up a classification after winning the 1A Division I title last year.

“I kinda went and hid in the corner and ran up the (sideline) and threw it up in the air” Gentry said. “It was a feeling of relief.”

“My coaches wanted to get a timeout but it looked like they (Ambrose) weren’t quite organized yet” St. Maries coach Bryan Chase said. “My gut instinct was to let them go with that and if they got in trouble I was going to use it. That just shows how smart these kids are; they have a good basketball IQ; it showed last night with Eli calling that timeout (at midcourt with .6 seconds left setting up Renner’s winning shot). They’re just a smart group of kids.”

Gibson is the lone remaining Lumberjack to play in St. Maries’ overtime loss to North Fremont two years ago in the state title game. He nearly won that game for the ‘Jacks in regulation but his driving layin rolled off the rim at the buzzer forcing overtime.

“It’s stuck with me since it happened” said Gibson who finished with eight points four rebounds and two assists. “I watched that game for the first time maybe two days ago It hurt and to finally come in here and finish it is awesome.”

“We brought the picture down from two years ago where Eli and I are crying” Chase said. “We’ve looked at it the last couple of days and it just kept inspiring me to stay up late and game plan and get ready. And I know these guys were focused all week long and we did walkthroughs for an hour and a half each day getting ready for each opponent and we scouted the teams out. It says a lot about what they wanted to get done down here.”

Senior Randie Becktel added 10 points and seven rebounds for St. Maries which outrebounded Ambrose 32-21.

St. Maries led most of the first half and two late baskets from Becktel sent the Lumberjacks into the locker room up 23-18. Coleman Ross fed a pass to Becktel for a 39-29 St. Maries lead late in the third before the Archers made four 3-pointers in a 21-6 run to take the lead.

But St. Maries wasn’t finished. And in its seventh straight trip to state the Lumberjacks brought home a trophy for the fifth time during that span.

Finally the one they wanted.

“It feels overdue” Gibson said. “We’ve had I don’t know how many good teams come through and we’ve come so close. Everyone disrespects the North and finally being able to finish it and show them that the North can come down South and play is huge for us.”

Ambrose which made 24 of 54 (44%) 3s in the first two tourney games made just 1 of 10 from behind the arc in the first half of the title game. The Archers made 7 of 14 3s in the second half.

Junior Hudson Hughes (averaging 17.6 per game) who had scored 40 in the first two tourney games was saddled with foul trouble on Saturday was scoreless in the first half. He finished with three points -- the 3 that put Ambrose up 48-45 with 2:40 to play.

Senior guard Ben Blythe scored all 19 of his points in the second half hitting 4 of 5 3s for the game.

“They’re really good defensively and we knew that coming in” Ambrose coach Ken Sugarman said of St. Maries. “They’re just really sound; they all move well together they take away driving lanes well they deal with screens well. They’re just well disciplined on the defensive end and I thought especially tonight they were probably the most disciplined I’ve ever seen them in their shot selection. And obviously that pays big dividends in a state championship game. Hats off to them … it was a war.”

The popular American image of a tank is the Army’s M1A1 Abrams. While heavy main battle tanks like the Abrams have slugged it out in classic cinematic tank battles it’s the light tanks that have often been a foot soldier’s best friend. They may be smaller and no match for main battle tanks but light tanks like the M3 Stuart and the M551 Sheridan protected U.S. troops from light armored vehicles mortars and heavy machine guns throughout WWII and the Cold War.

Now U.S. Army soldiers with the 82nd Airborne Division are testing the limits of a new generation of light tanks at Fort Bragg North Carolina. The outcome of those tests—and the opinions of the soldiers themselves—will likely crown the winner of the Army’s Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) acquisition program.

With MPF the Army is looking to give its airborne and light infantry units something they haven’t had since the 1990s: a light tank to augment their firepower and help them penetrate lightly armored medium-gunned defenses in natural or urban terrain. In the 1980s and early 1990s the M551 Sheridan filled that role but it was retired and its replacement the M8 Buford was canceled later in the decade.

It has taken the Army more than 20 years to get back to providing light tank capability to its Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs). These tanks will be more lethal easier to maintain and able to keep up with an IBCT’s new Infantry Squad Vehicle transports. They’ll need to be air transportable via C-17 cargo aircraft ready to fight upon landing and capable of learning new combat tricks as they age.

After cutting through a number of proposals only two prototypes remain one from General Dynamics Land Systems (GD) and another from BAE Systems (BAE). The service eventually wants 504 of these new tanks; an initial 26 will begin production in 2022 after a head-to-head soldier evaluation helps determine a winner.

As of early 2021 each company was supposed to have already delivered a dozen of its light tank prototypes to the Army including four examples of each to Fort Bragg. General Dynamics made the deadline and BAE’s prototype isn’t far behind.

When the full complement of MPF prototypes arrives at Fort Bragg soldiers will learn their capabilities and determine whether an IBCT can consistently keep the light tanks ready to rumble. They’ll also have a fundamental choice to make—whether to recommend a light tank or an even lighter tank.

Big & Bigger

Anything that meets the definition of a tank isn’t small. But there’s a big size difference between GD’s tanks and BAE’s tanks each following a design lineage that stems from its maker’s previous vehicles. General Dynamics builds the Army’s main battle tank the 68-ton M1 Abrams which is designed to defeat enemy tanks and heavy armor. BAE builds the 28-ton Bradley Fighting Vehicle designed to transport infantry or scouts with armor protection.

Both have drawn bits of mechanical DNA from these two vehicles to bring their MPF prototypes to life.

BAE Systems BAE’s tank stems from a design conceived for the Army’s Armored Gun System (AGS) an air transportable light tank to replace the M551 Sheridan. Developed by one of BAE's corporate ancestors the result was the M8 Buford (pictured) and the first prototypes arrived at Fort Knox in 1995. But the Pentagon canceled the AGS program in 1997 a victim of unfavorable assessments and the defense draw-down of the late 90s. Though the M8 never made it into active service it forms the conceptual basis for BAE’s MPF. “We decided to stay in the same size weight space envelope that we had for the AGS program” Jim Miller BAE’s director of business development told Popular Mechanics. “We think that fits what the Army really wants.” BAE describes its MPF as somewhere between the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) and Stryker infantry carrier in terms of size. It weighs in the low- to mid-20-ton range. Size has implications for everything from thermal and electronic signatures to armor protection crew and transportability. The Army specifies that two MPFs need to fit inside a C-17 airlifter so they can be flown to airfields to support expeditionary forces. According to Miller a C-17 will hold three fully armored BAE light tanks and with its armor removed one could even fit in a C-130 Hercules the workhorse of the Army. “You can get your hands on a C-130 in a combat theater” Miller says referring to the larger number of Hercs compared to C-17s. BAE’s MPF carries a three-man crew (a commander gunner and driver) like its M8 predecessor and a small crew requires less support in the field. Added benefits of the tank’s size include a smaller profile as well as a smaller radar cross-section making it harder to target BAE says. Image: Wikimedia Commons Wikimedia Commons General Dynamics “The basic vehicle design from the chassis to the turret electronic architecture and power generation all offer growth” GD Land Systems Director Tim Reese told Popular Mechanics. Growth potential stems from the fact that the company’s MPF is large somewhere in the 30 to 40 ton range. A pair of its light tanks will fit on a C-17 as the Army requires Reese says. General Dynamics’ prototype has been described as combining a chassis based on its AJAX family (pictured) of light armored vehicles with its M1 Abrams turret design and elements of its Griffin tank demonstrator. Reese says this new tank “uses their lessons in a purpose-built vehicle” while adding what he calls a few advanced technologies “that are unique.” The size of GD’s MPF enables it to better accommodate technological growth including new sensors and protection systems the company says. It also eases incorporation of a new battery (likely lithium) and power management system. With more available space in its turret and driver's station the tank also yields better livability and division of work for its four person crew (a commander gunner loader driver) according to MPF program director Scott Stilson. “If you have to spend long periods in the vehicle warfighters should see less fatigue.” The extra real estate offers five paths of egress for the tank commander and crew including hatches in the side of the hull. “Those are lessons learned from Iraq and Afghanistan during rollover situations” Reese says. General Dynamics maintains that size helps with placing future sensors and weapons possibly including lasers. The ability to separate ammunition storage from the turret is another benefit.

Speed & Power

The speed of a light infantry brigade is generally governed by the pace at which its soldiers march and overcome opposition. But with the arrival of the air-droppable ISV forward elements of IBCTs can now move at over 60 mph cross-country.

BAE Systems The M8 Buford could do about 47 mph depending on conditions and BAE says its MPF can reach 45 mph. Reports say BAE will use a 550 horsepower turbo diesel and Miller says that MTU (Detroit Diesel) is BAE’s supplier suggesting the engine could be a version of Detroit’s 15.6 liter DD16. BAE has also considered hybrid-electric powertrains though there are no current plans to integrate one. The company won’t reveal the MPF’s range but with similar weight/size to the M8 Buford the newer tank may match its predecessor’s legs around 280 miles. BAE’s MPF rides on a traditional torsion bar suspension but uses a composite rubber track (CRT) developed by Soucy Defense (pictured) rather than a conventional steel track. The CRT yields better fuel economy braking and acceleration reduces noise and weight and produces a better ride. “We didn’t really understand the benefit of the Soucy track” Miller acknowledges. “When we started driving the vehicles we noticed a big difference. You don’t have the constant bounce and vibration of a steel track.” Image: Soucy Defense Soucy Defense General Dynamics Any light tank supporting these fast-moving troops from the 82nd Airborne will need to keep pace. But Reese is confident that his firm’s MPF (pictured) “can keep up with the formation whatever it might be doing.” The company wouldn’t say what powerplant its tank uses or what speed it can attain but reporting suggests it has an 800 horsepower turbo diesel capable of top speeds around 45 mph (depending on terrain and the level of armor). General Dynamics also wouldn’t get into details about what range the tank might have but past light tanks like the Sheridan and M8 have published ranges of 250-350 miles. Reese says that GD’s MPF has “a lot more capability than past vehicles” suggesting the range might dip below these numbers. The tank will ride on traditional steel tracks using a lighter road wheel design with improved durability and lower noise and vibration according to General Dynamics. Its advanced suspension forgoes the traditional torsion-bar set up in favor of external hydraulic suspension units which bolt to the side of the hull offering a better ride and protection. The MPF will “be a real joy to motor cross-country. Soldiers will love it. It has great top speed good tactical range” Reese says. Image: General Dynamics General Dynamics

Firepower & Protection

A light tank is essentially artillery for the IBCT.

As Brigadier General Ross Coffman director of the Army’s Next Generation Combat Vehicle Cross-Functional Team told Army Times in 2018: “There’s no precision munition to remove bunkers from the battlefield to shoot into buildings in dense urban terrain...The MPF will be used to disrupt break in and breach those secure defensive zones.”

The Army required several common elements in both competitors including the main gun. GD and BAE will use a 105 mm NATO-standard M35 low recoil cannon. Sources put its maximum range at about 8975 yards (8200 meters). Both will use a Raytheon-made second-generation FLIR sight/sensor system and both will have scalable armor capable of being installed or removed in the field.

BAE Systems BAE’s armor can be installed by its crew with onboard tools in about three hours. It’s a bolt-on bolt-off affair that allows tailoring protection to expected threats. The tank also sports a new hull design to counter IEDs that weren’t envisioned when BAE designed the M8. “The front of the vehicle is sloped in such a way and is low enough that it’s pretty hard to hit” Miller says. “If you do get a shot at it the shape and size limit the chances of damage to the vehicle.” The crew will use a 21-round auto-loader enabling fire at rates up to 12 rounds per minute. Miller says the loader also allows the crew to chamber and then return rounds to the exact location where they were in the magazine. Like its competitor BAE’s tank will have a turret-mounted 12.7-mm heavy machine gun linked with its fire control system. It also has provision for a future active protection system or APS—a radar-guided system that typically fires patterns of explosive penetrators to defeat incoming rocket-propelled grenades or anti-tank guided missiles. The flat panel-radars and launchers for such a system can be easily removed BAE says. Image BAE Systems BAE Systems General Dynamics “We leverage the V3 fire control system of the Abrams tank” Reese says. In fact GD has said that its MPF turret has the same displays architecture and power distribution as the M1 Abrams SEPV3 turret (pictured). IBCT’s don’t have Abrams crews but some of those personnel will help stand-up the new MPF complements and be part of the soldier assessment of these new tanks. Reese adds that the turret has a purpose-designed commander’s independent thermal viewer similar to one in use with the Abrams but with new features. “It’s a capability we offer that we don’t think our competitors do.” One reason for the larger crew complement may be that GD’s MPF uses a manual loader rather than an autoloader. The company would not share details on its magazine capacity (possibly larger than BAE’s owing to size) or rate of fire though a dedicated loader crewman may put it on par with BAE’s rounds-per-minute. With a future APS in mind Reese cites GD’s previous experience with Rafael’s Trophy APS system on its Abrams tank. “We have the electronic architecture power and physical ability to mount whatever APS the Army ultimately chooses [for MPF].” Image: General Dynamics LCpl Kelsey J. Green / General Dynamics

Support and Serviceability

The Army has indicated that it wants to keep its IBCTs agile and that it “does not anticipate a significant increase to IBCT field maintenance to support the MPF.” That makes serviceability incredibly important.

BAE Systems BAE says its chief goal with its MPF was to keep things “logistically simple” from its size to its composite rubber track. “You’re not constantly tinkering with it to keep it moving” Miller says. The engine is located at the rear of the tank and can be cranked out on a cradle using a hand crank or power drill. The engine can even run while on the cradle and its modular design supports component replacement. Swapping one engine for another doesn’t require removing armor from the rear of the tank which speeds up the repair process. The tank can also be recovered by the standard HEMTT trucks already incorporated within an IBCT. “This is a vehicle going to an infantry brigade” Miller says. “They don’t have heavy vehicle recovery assets. You won’t need an M88 [heavy recovery vehicle] to go get one.” Image: BAE Systems BAE Systems General Dynamics General Dynamics’ MPF (pictured) has been designed with an emphasis on line-replaceable modules with self-diagnosis capability. “Actual repairs to the modules are much easier than on most versions of the Abrams tank” Reese says. The engine resides in the front of the tank and major components of the propulsion system—the engine transmission and accessories—are located in selected positions for easy access. Stilson says that “our power pack removal and installation is very quick” comparing its quick-disconnect electrical and hydraulic interfaces to similar layouts in the Abrams and Stryker vehicles. If soldiers have worked on an Abrams in their Army tenure they’ll feel at home maintaining the MPF Reese says. “We wanted to make it very familiar for some of the other [maintenance specialists] already in the fleet.” Image: U.S. Army / Sgt. James Harvey Sgt. James Harvey

The Soldiers Decide

The Army’s Ground Combat Systems office acknowledges that personnel at Fort Bragg are “excited about being able to be the first soldiers to operate a cutting-edge new combat platform.”

The tanks that GD delivered immediately stirred curiosity Reese says. “The soldiers were climbing all over them. They were excited. They wanted to hop inside and see how they worked.”

Miller expects a similar reaction from the troops when BAE’s prototypes show up at Fort Bragg. “We’ll get sense for whether [a simplified logistic model] is valued by the crews and commanders and whether they’re willing to trade off some other things to get that footprint.”

It’s worth noting that MPF isn’t the most friendly of competitions with both players aware of what’s at stake. The winner could also win over the Marine Corps which has already decided that its M1s are too heavy for future amphibious warfare; a light tank replacement could be the perfect solution.

Whoever wins the future of infantry firepower will be fought—and found—on the fields of Fort Bragg.",,,,,,,,,

In three interviews in this week’s DeviceTalks Weekly Podcast leaders from Asensus ActivSurgical and Memic explain how their systems will improve surgeon performance reduce errors and deliver the “democratization” of surgical robotics.

Guests this week include

Anthony Fernando CEO of Asensus Surgical (formerly Transenterix) outlines the company’s bid to push its Sehance system as a solution for laparoscopic procedures. Fernando who took over as CEO in 2019 explains why the company’s stock crashed in 2019 and details the changes he says have started its turnaround. Senhance offers more responsive surgical tools along with data that will help with surgical training and scheduling.

Todd Usen CEO of ActivSurgical left a job he loved at Olympus to lead a company that could revolutionize how surgeons see. The company’s ActivEdge system can be deployed with gold standard scopes and cameras creating a surgical WAZE-type system that highlights the trouble spots and threats in the surgical field.

Maurice R. Ferré the founder of Mako Surgical and now chairman of Memic Innovative Surgery says the company’s low-profile robot fits the budget and space constraints of hospitals and ambulatory surgery systems. Ferré explains why the company will be able to differentiate itself in a crowded field.

Ferré also shares stories about Mako Surgery’s creation giving credits to surgeons including the late Larry Dorr who passed away in January. He also provides details on the dinner that led to the $1.65 billion purchase by Stryker.

Ferré also explains why he believes companies like Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson may be arriving too late to the game.

Over the past few years my wife and I have stayed at Marriott brands ~20 times. We’ve sometimes been able to book straight into a one bedroom suite with either points or by finding a low enough cash rate but more frequently than not we’ve ended up booking a studio king or queen suite.

That’s not ideal for us especially since COVID hit. My wife teaches online and is sometimes up early for classes while I’m usually up until 3am. Being in a studio suite means we end up being more likely to wake each other up at night or in the morning. Pre-COVID it was less of an issue because we could go work down in the lobby but that’s something we’ve avoided since March 2020. Having a one bedroom suite avoids those problems as we can teach/work in the separate living room while the other one sleeps. It also means it’s quieter at night in general as you don’t hear anyone out in the hall; that’s useful for us as we travel with our dog and so she doesn’t feel the need to protect us from all the dangerous people that quite clearly want to break into our hotel room as they walk past our door at night 😉

That’s where Nick’s tip about the chat feature in Marriott’s app has come in handy. Any time we’ve been booked into a studio suite in the last few years I’ve taken a look on Marriott’s website a day or two before to see if there are any one bedroom suites available. If there are I’ll reach out to the property via the chat feature to ask for an upgrade due to my status.

With only one exception that request has always been granted. The only time they didn’t upgrade us via an app request their reply was that we’d need to wait until check-in to see if any one bedroom suites were available so even that wasn’t a hard no (I forget if we got an upgrade in the end at that property).

Being able to do this a day or two before you arrive can make a huge difference. Studio suites tend to be the most common room type at the properties we’ve stayed at so there are far fewer one bedroom suites available. Waiting to ask about an upgrade until you check in therefore risks that room type either getting booked by the time you arrive or earlier-arriving guests getting the upgrade.

A couple of quick things to note about using the chat feature in the Marriott app. First when it brings up your reservation in the app you don’t want to select the check-in option in order to ask about an upgrade. Instead you’ll see a couple of speech bubbles in the bottom right corner – that’s what’s used to open the chat feature.

Secondly it can sometimes take a little while to receive a reply so it’s not worth sitting around waiting to receive one. That’s especially the case if you’re messaging them late at night which is when I seem to remember to message them as I don’t usually get an answer until the morning. In theory you should get a notification on your phone letting you know that you have a reply but if it’s been 12+ hours try checking the chat feature again. I requested an upgrade last night for a stay beginning on Monday and didn’t get a notification but when opening the app this afternoon I noticed they’d already replied at 7am confirming that we’d been upgraded to a one bedroom suite (which is what prompted me to republish this post).

Here’s Nick’s original post:

~

My wife and I were pretty happy with how quickly we had transitioned our newborn son to sleeping in his own room/crib. As a result we weren’t prepared for the detrimental effect it would have on our sleep when we recently decided to make a 2-week road trip to visit friends and family — with him sleeping in a pack-and-play in the same room during the trip. After two weeks of sleep deprivation and the ride home seeming even longer than usual because of it I was thrilled when Marriott chat came through with a nice room upgrade over the weekend.

When we were a couple of hours from reaching our drive time limit on Friday I was happy to find the TownePlace Suites Quantico/Stafford had a room for just 10000 Marriott points (versus the normal room rate of $118 + tax).

A few minutes after booking I pulled up the Marriott app curious if I could make any special requests via the app. I was hoping for a slightly larger room; while the standard room is a studio I saw that the hotel also had 1-bedroom suites. I thought that a separate bedroom would enable us to set things up in a way so as not to wake each other up repeatedly and get slightly better sleep.

The app gave me the option to check in and choose my room. I was pretty sure that as a Marriott Gold member I wouldn’t see a meaningful upgrade over the standard room I’d picked (and Greg has previously written about this topic – See: Marriott Mobile Check In: Does it help or hurt upgrade chances?). However I also I saw that there was an option to “Chat with us”. I clicked through to start a chat.

I’ll be honest I didn’t expect someone to respond — and if they did I figured I’d be getting a Marriott rep in a call center who would add a note to my reservation at best. To my surprise I got a pretty quick response affirming that they would be happy to arrange a larger room.

Upon arrival I gave my name at the desk. Niecey the friendly check-in agent said that they were expecting me. She informed me that she had upgraded us to a 2-bedroom suite! I didn’t actually ask if she was the agent with whom I had chatted but I got the impression that she was the person who had responded to the chat. While the hotel itself shows a little wear the 2-bedroom suite was exactly what we needed. We ended up being able to trade off sleeping in a bedroom alone with the door closed allowing us to each get some uninterrupted sleep. That was awesome.

We even had plenty of room to eat dinner. TownePlace Suites is an extended-stay brand so I knew we would have a kitchette but I didn’t know we would end up using it. We had picked up takeout not anticipating what turned into a need for an immediate bath for Baby Rey. Having an oven to heat up our food and a roll of paper towels (since I forgot to grab extra napkins) turned the TownePlace Suites into a great decision.

Bottom line

Will Marriott chat get you an awesome upgrade every time? I’m sure it probably won’t. Did it help that I was staying at an extended stay property in a place that isn’t a major tourist destination? I’m sure it did.

On the other hand I’m equally willing to bet that it gave me a better chance at an upgrade than mobile check-in. I further wonder if chatting in the early afternoon or late evening might give you a better shot at an available discretionary upgrade. For instance by chatting a couple of hours before I got there maybe I scored an upgrade that someone else would have taken when they arrived before me. I have no way of knowing that’s true but it’s probably worth a shot.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbm9raWFtb2IubmV0LzIwMjEvMDMvMDcvbm9raWEtbW9iaWxlLXRvLWludHJvZHVjZS1uZXctbmFtaW5nLWNvbnZlbnRpb24tZHJvcC10aGUtZG90LWZyb20tbmFtZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nokia Mobile to introduce new naming convention drop the “dot” from names?!,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 423 Client Error:  for url: https://nokiamob.net/2021/03/07/nokia-mobile-to-introduce-new-naming-convention-drop-the-dot-from-names/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbm9raWFtb2IubmV0LzIwMjEvMDMvMDcvbm9raWEtbW9iaWxlLXRvLWludHJvZHVjZS1uZXctbmFtaW5nLWNvbnZlbnRpb24tZHJvcC10aGUtZG90LWZyb20tbmFtZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Commentary by Patrick Duffy | President | Houston

Last January we predicted steady growth for the Houston economy barring a “black swan” event and mentioned the “new Corona Virus in China” as an example. Little did we know that the virus would end up being the Godzilla of black swan events. On the heels of what had been a very robust economic expansion the virus and the global governmental response of massive shutdowns created one of the most dramatic economic crashes in the history of the world. U.S. GDP dropped an unprecedented 31.4% in Q2. While we saw a substantial recovery in the U.S. in Q3 (also an unprecedented 33.4%) and continued recovery in Q4 the lockdowns continue in many states. Most companies in the office sector are still in a work-from-home posture with their employees. Government and Federal Reserve Bank stimulus efforts continue to attempt to mitigate the permanent damage to the underlying economy caused by the virus and associated responses.

Houston had to Cope with a Double Impact

We had the same lockdown approach as most large metro markets and the global shutdowns reduced oil and gas demand by approximately 15% resulting in the lowest oil prices in history. In April of 2020 oil traded at a NEGATIVE $40 per barrel. The U.S. and Canadian rig counts historically averaging approximately 1500 active rigs dropped to 278 in June before “recovering” to 410 at year-end. With only one-third of average rigs active the companies engaged in engineering and oilfield services that support the upstream energy sector were hit very hard.

The good news is that energy demand is projected to surpass supply through year-end 2021 and oil prices have recovered to the high $40s per barrel as of this report. All indications are that we will see oil prices with upside pressure as reserves tighten and new production gradually comes online. This bodes well for the energy sector to see some stabilization and recovery in 2021.

Small businesses especially restaurants and local “mom and pop” retailers have been hit the hardest by the lockdowns with companies moving their employees to work-from-home and out of the typical high-density office markets. These small businesses depend on walk-in traffic which even with the lockdowns partially or entirely removed are still missing the usual client base supplied by nearby office users. Estimates of permanent closures for small businesses are in the 20% range nationally and Houston seems to be following that trend.

The Federal Reserve has signaled that they will continue to be accommodative with close to zero interest rates and liquidity injections as may be required through 21. The incoming administration has signaled massive plans for new spending and unfortunately potential tax increases; however it is unlikely that tax increases will be implemented before 2022. These supportive monetary and fiscal positions should continue to fuel recovery in 2021.

Other states notably California are losing companies and residents to Texas. The recent relocation of Hewlett Packard to Houston is a prime example. We expect this trend will continue to the benefit of Texas cities including Houston. Provided the vaccines prove effective and the global economy continues a steady recovery we believe the bottom has been reached in Houston and that 2021 will see moderate job growth and continued economic recovery. The jury is out on the long-term impacts on inflation of all the money printing that we have seen over the past several years. Real estate has long been a strong inflation hedge and will continue to be an asset of choice for those looking for returns and inflationary hedge over the mid-term.

Population Houston ranks among the leading metropolitan areas in the U.S. in population growth and is the fourth largest city and the fifth largest Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in the nation. Houstons’ MSA consists of nine counties and as of 2020 the region’s population increased by 7.6% since 2015 growing by 507666. The population is expected to increase by 5.4% between 2020 and 2025 adding 388203 new residents. Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land TX has 1581521 millennials (ages 25-39). The national average for an area this size is 1456929. Retirement risk is low in Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land TX. The national average for an area this size is 2077542 people 55 or older while there are 1606834 here. Racial diversity is high in Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land TX. The national average for an area this size is 2818578 racially diverse people while there are 4575975 here.

Jobs

From 2015 to 2020 jobs increased by 6.3% in Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land TX from 3227863 to 3431154. As the number of jobs increased the labor force participation rate decreased from 63.1% to 62.1% between 2015 and 2020. Concerning educational attainment 33.1% of Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land TX residents possess a Bachelor’s Degree or higher (0.9% above the national average) and 6.7% hold an Associate’s Degree (1.5% below the national average).

Recently Houston’s non-farm employment sector lost 141300 jobs annually (November 2019 to November 2020) due to the effects of COVID-19; however according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics the unemployment rate has recently decreased as 75200 jobs have been added in the past three months. Houston’s industry sectors that posted recent gains over the past quarter include non-durable goods trade/transportation/utilities retail trade professional/business services education/health services leisure/ hospitality and government.

Looking ahead Houston’s job growth is expected to increase 7% over the next five years.

Houston’s MSA ranks fourth among U.S. cities with the most Fortune 500 headquarters with twenty-two on the list. Four of the top five are in the energy industry.

Business Climate

Houston has long been recognized among the most competitive U.S. cities for corporate relocation and expansion activity and is internationally recognized as the global energy capital. The Houston-Woodlands-Sugar Land region operates the largest petrochemical plants in the U.S. the Houston Ship Channel. In addition to its diverse industries and educated/skilled workforce a key factor underscoring Houston’s business appeal is the fact that it is one of the least expensive major U.S. cities in which to conduct business. Significant benefits include the absence of state or city income taxes no state property tax as well as a moderate cost of living index. Houston’s strategic location and core strengths including an expanding healthcare sector cutting-edge medical advancements technological breakthroughs across industries and strong import/export trade activity uniquely position it to play a vital role in meeting national and global market demands. Houston has and will continue to stand as a global leader among U.S. metros and the world.

Houston's Major Industries

Port Houston is the #1 port in the nation for waterborne tonnage foreign waterborne tonnage and vessel transits. Port Houston is a 25-mile-long complex of about 200 private and public industrial terminals along the 52-mile-long Houston Ship Channel. Houston is the Energy Capital of the World and is home to more than 4000+ firms in the region with more than 40% of the nation’s base manufacturing petrochemical capacity. Houston’s airport system consists of 3 airports supports more than 190K regional jobs and contributes more than $36.4 billion to the local economy. The airport system served more than 58.7M passengers in 2019 and 41M year-to-date November 2020. The Texas Medical Center (TMC) the World’s Largest Medical Complex (1345 acres) consists of 61 member institutions. TMC’s workforce consists of more than 106K employees. The TMC sees 8M+ patients annually including 16K international patients. NASA’s Johnson Space Center resides on a 1700-acre campus and employs around 11K. Major employers within the complex includes some notable companies like The Boeing Company Lockheed Martin and Jacobs Engineering. Axiom Space plans to build the worlds first commercial space station at the Houston Spaceport at Ellington Field.

But the sassy United States-based Kenyan Caroline Wanga dusted herself from an early setback to earn a degree and 10 promotions up the corporate ladder in 13 years.

A fortnight ago she reached yet another milestone. She was appointed the chief executive officer of Essence Communications Inc and the chief growth officer of Essence Ventures in the United States.

Essence is an independent black-owned consumer technology company focused on merging content community and commerce to meet the evolving cultural and lifestyle needs of people of colour.

“Caroline will work with team leads across the organisation and run the day-to-day operations as well as oversee the independent review process” the company announced on their website.

Caroline said of her appointment: “I could not be more excited for the opportunity to lead this cornerstone of black culture into its next phase of growth innovation and impact alongside this incredible team of accomplished women particularly in this time of national and global reckoning on the systemic injustices that we face as black women and as a black community.”

She will be in charge of Essence magazine the publication that featured the Kenyan-Mexican actress Lupita Nyong’o in 2016. The magazine targets African-American women and covers fashion entertainment beauty and culture.

Born in Kisumu 43 years ago Caroline talked to the Sunday Lifestyle about her journey of ebb and flow at home and abroad being a teenage mother and college drop-out all that hardened her already inspired self and earned her the zeal laced with finesse to set her eye on whatever prize and win it.

She was raised at the precincts of Kenyatta University where her professor parents; Dr Pamela Obondi-Wanga from Kisumu and Dr Lucas Wanga from Mumias Kakamega County used to teach.

She says she enjoyed an environment which fostered academic excellence and the best of human character which infused a belief that she could do anything she wanted.

“In hindsight that foundation is still part of who I am today” Caroline remarked.

She schooled at Kenyatta University Primary School then moved to the US in 1988 with her mother and three brothers to join her father who was attending the University of Minnesota for his doctorate degree in educational psychology.

Growing up she had several diverse aspirations throughout her childhood — a pastor doctor Olympic heptathlete and other media unrelated professions like police officer teacher lawyer interior designer and a camp counsellor.

She missed all that landed a business course and ended up peaking in the media industry. Because her zeal knows no boundaries.

“I have the unmitigated gall to believe in a future for myself that others may not be able to see and encourage others to believe the same about their future” says the woman whose life slogan is “who you are is non-negotiable”.

Aside from her recent achievement she has been named a top executive in corporate diversity by Black Enterprise and one of Savoy’s most powerful women in corporate America. She is also a member of the Executive Leadership Council (ELC) the Talladega College Board of Trustees and the Intersectionality Culture and Diversity Advisory Board for Twitter.

She is also a former co-chair of the Retail Industry Leaders Association (Rila) Diversity and Inclusion Initiative.

She has so much on her plate including public talks to inspire youngsters but she still finds time for fun including listening to Kenyan music.

“I am obsessed with Afro-beats and specifically anything by Nyashinski” she stated adding that she misses home.

“Food…food…food! Ugali sukumawiki (kales) nyama choma (roasted meat) nyoyo (githeri) chapati ndengu maandazi kachumbari samosas chai sugar cane I could go on and on” she responded when asked what reminds her of her motherland.

Foreign country

Landing in a foreign country as a teenager Caroline struggled to fit into a new system while undergoing ordinary adolescence challenges. She was in her first semester of college on a track scholarship when she became pregnant. She gave birth to her daughter Cadence in 1995 and in order to care for her she dropped out and started working full-time in the non-profit sector.

“I became a mum before I became a legal adult. While there was understandable concern and disappointment about when I became a mother I also know it is what gave me the added grit and durability to hold on to my aspirations as I negotiated different paths to get there now that I was a mother” the introvert stated.

Her strength was her immediate extended and “chosen” family as they all played integral roles in her motherhood and adulthood journey.

“Cadence grew up with her and although the journey has had its definite highs and lows we are a stronger unit as a result of the journey. I wouldn’t say Cadence and I beat the odds I would say we redefined them and developed an unspoken covenant that has fuelled our life journey collectively and individually” she said.

It was Cadence who responded to our e-mails on her mother’s behalf. She introduced herself as Caroline’s manager for speaking engagements.

Life accomplishment

And her account sign-out indicated that she is a co-owner of WangaWoman LLC. We later learnt of their relationship and that they co-own WangaWoman an organisation they started with a vision to create a world where authenticity is democratised.

Caroline regards Cadence as her greatest life accomplishment.

Dropping out of college presented one of the most tumultuous rides of her life. In her attempt to run a full-time job and be a young mother she could not fit into the many different colleges and university programmes where she thirsted for an undergraduate degree. The struggle was just too much and she kept dropping out one school after another.

“Both my parents have their doctorate degrees and so the importance of education is prominent in my family” she noted.

After more than five years of several failed post-secondary academic attempts Caroline found out about the Texas College Single Parent Support System Programme that offered support for the single parents pursuing their undergraduate degrees.

“The supplemental transportation meal and housing support they provided allowed me to be a full-time student and full time mother with less need to work full time so I could complete my undergraduate degree in Business Administration which took two and a half years” she recalled.

There was no turning back for the woman who describes herself an intellectual flatulence as evidenced by her illustrious career.

Fervent to make it she started as an intern with the Target Corporation a distribution company at one of their centres in Tyler Texas. She continued in a variety of supply chain transformation roles as well as transformational leadership roles; human resource business intelligence digital and strategy capabilities.

This led to a serving as Target’s chief culture diversity and inclusion officer where she was responsible for Target’s strategic intent to champion an inclusive society with accountability for inclusive guest experiences a diverse and inclusive work environment and societal impact.

Philanthropy

“As a cultural catalyst I helped fuel Target’s business objectives through the company’s first-ever performance-based diversity and inclusion goals significantly improving areas including supplier diversity marketing philanthropy retention hiring representation and engagement.

“I also had responsibility for reshaping Target’s organisational culture. My journey with Target has two main themes. The first is a willingness to do something new and the courage to fail as I learned. I was not technically qualified for any of the roles I served in however great leaders and mentors saw potential and raw talent in me and guided me through each transition with the patience and the belief that I would learn the technical over time. I am eternally grateful for each one of them and pay it forward to others whenever I have the opportunity to do so” she said.

Her recent milestone places her on the map as one of the faces of successful black women in the US. She describes it as humbling.

“I have been blessed to be surrounded by strong black women my whole life. From my mum to my aunts cousins daughter friends colleagues leaders and mentors - I do not take it lightly and understand the obligation I have to pay it forward and represent a real black woman who has existed in the trials and triumphs of life and consistently practices failure recovery” Caroline said.

“I want every imperfect Black girl and woman out there like me to have an audacious personal agenda fuelled by their personal and professional purpose but defined by progress not perfection” she added.

Her leadership philosophy is steeped in helping others find their purpose pursue it indignantly and leverage it to impact the world. And she stands for authenticity and giving equal chances.

The apolitical trailblazer believes that although black women have been changing lives communities and the world since the beginning of time they most often go unrecognised for it.

“But for the past 50 years the evolution of black women’s history—and thus the evolution of the black woman — has been captured and curated in one place and one place only: Essence” she asserted.

This profile would be incomplete without mentioning Caroline’s taste for fashion particularly African-wear. In most of her pictures and videos she adorns vitenge accessorised with bead-wear and matching spectacles of round frames accentuating the look. Her imposing teeth-gap is a permanent adornment. A chin-up completes her look.

Asked how she accesses Africa-wear she replied “The beautiful thing about technology is that what is possible isn’t limited by what is immediately available. There are several African enterprises in the US that make a lot of traditional items available but I also directly engage with many businesses based in Kenya and other African countries directly.”

What drives this spirited woman? Her mission to thrive!

“Leaving this world with nothing left in my mind and in my heart by giving everything I can to help fulfil my purpose in this world as illustrated by Maya Angelou who said ‘My mission in life is not merely to survive but to thrive; and to do so with some passion some compassion some humour and some style’.

Self-compassion

“I am also passionate about self-compassion as illustrated by Audre Lourde who said ‘Caring for myself is not self-indulgence. It is self-preservation and that is an act of political warfare’” she said.

The disruptive role of social media on the traditional newsrooms in the age of technology has been apparent but like many other establishments in the industry Essence is making adjustments that positions them to a point of advantage.

For instance the annual virtual Essence Festival of Culture deemed as the world’s largest cultural entertainment and empowerment experience has gone virtual with celebrations spanning several days since it’s online.

The 2020 festival that took place over the July 4 weekend in New Orleans was the first of its kind and scale to be executed virtually during the pandemic.

The event — which annually draws more than half a million people — extended its reach engagement and impact via enhanced technology and streaming capabilities to touch more people globally.

“The social media has sped up the flow of information to the largest of audiences with the blurriest of lines on what is fact and what is not and the information is old as soon as it is live. Its presence has challenged the agility of traditional media operating models and we continue to learn more about how it manifests” Caroline observed.

They have now spread their tentacles to multiple platforms in their bid to strengthen their role of empowering millions of black women in diaspora; spotlighting how she navigates love relationships entertainment fashion beauty lifestyle travel faith and home through the lens of culture.

And to foster equity Essence programmes build a black woman’s acumen and prepare them to deal with the outcomes related to economic stability education employment health justice and civic engagement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbmFieXRlcy5jb20vYW5naGFtaS1qb3VybmV5LXB1YmxpYy1tYXJrZXRzL9IBPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbmFieXRlcy5jb20vYW5naGFtaS1qb3VybmV5LXB1YmxpYy1tYXJrZXRzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Anghami’s journey to the public markets: Everything you need to know,"Share WhatsApp Email 0 Shares

Last week Anghami became the first Arab technology company to announce that it’s going public through a listing on the Nasdaq (New York) later this year after merging with a SPAC. As part of the deal the company is expected to receive anywhere between $40 million and $210 million in cash from the SPAC and a separate PIPE investment to help accelerate its growth.

Yes I also had to reread this paragraph to digest it fully. What’s a SPAC a PIPE and why was this deal structured this way instead of the traditional IPO route that most companies undertake when going public?

This piece aims to answer these questions and is split into two parts. In the first I provide an overview of the music streaming industry and deep dive into Spotify and Anghami’s strategies and paths towards profitability. In the second I explore the Anghami SPAC deal and the fine print behind it.

Overview of music streaming

The traditional distribution model of music was disrupted in 1999 when Sean Parker unleashed peer-to-peer file-sharing and sucked profits out of the industry. To protect their profits record labels sued Napster (Sean’s company) into bankruptcy. However the genie was out of the bottle and by 2008 95 percent of music was downloaded illegally.

Around the time Spotify and Pandora launched subscription-based streaming which played a fundamental role in saving the industry and restoring some of its profits. Unfortunately the lion’s share of profits remained with record labels and streaming platforms struggled to turn profits and make their business model work.

Economics of music streaming

Streaming platforms make money through two main streams:

• Premium model: Charge customers a subscription fee for full ad-free access to content.

• Ad-based model: Charge advertisers to target free users with ads on the platform.

Platforms license music from record labels and pay them a small royalty fee whenever a user listens to one of their songs. In aggregate these fees add up to ~70 percent of total revenues which puts a massive strain on streaming platforms’ profitability. As a result all streaming platforms lose money as their thin gross margins can’t cover their operational expenses (R&D marketing and SG&A costs).

With 155 million paying subscribers and 199 million free users Spotify is the largest and most recognized independent music streamer. Yet the company has never turned a profit most recently posting a $300 million loss on $7.8 billion of revenues.

Spotify: Podcasts as a moat

To overcome the high royalty fees and pave a sustainable path towards profitability Spotify took a page out of Netflix’s book and turned its attention towards original content. Its new strategy was centered around two core pillars:

1) Podcasts: Spotify recently embarked on an acquisition spree to establish a podcast-centered ecosystem (The Ringer Anchor Parcast) and built a rich content library (The Joe Rogan Experience Kim Kardashian Obama). As podcasts capture a higher portion of users’ time Spotify will pay lower royalties to record labels and improve its gross margins (If I listen to a podcast on my drive to work instead of a song Spotify doesn’t have to pay royalties). Beyond royalty payments podcasts have also proven to increase user retention and user conversion to premium.

2) Data: An average user spends 25 hours a month on Spotify creating a ton of behavior data (Spotify collects 200 petabytes of user data compared to only 60 by Netflix). This data is used to improve recommendations (today recommendations account for 30 percent of music streamed) leading to higher engagement and higher conversions to premium subscriptions. Data also improves ad targeting (i.e. better knowledge of users through which music/ podcasts they listen to allows Spotify to serve them more relevant ads) which increases return on ad spend enabling Spotify to charge higher rates to its advertisers.

Visually Spotify’s flywheel looks something like this:

So far the new strategy has been working. Spotify has gradually improved its gross margins (by ~100 basis points a year) and investor excitement towards the company has renewed. Its stock nearly doubled since April 2020 after showing no growth in the first two years since the company’s IPO.

Anghami: Regionally focused and lean

Founded in 2012 by Eddy Maroun and Elie Habib Anghami was the first music streaming player in the Middle East. Since then the company has built a strong regional footprint adding 39K Arabic artists (600K songs) and 4 million international artists (56 million songs) to its platform which it serves to its 8 million monthly active users (MAU).

Similar to Spotify Anghami has lost money since its inception. However the company has been on a great trajectory over the past 4 years (2017–2020) as it has significantly improved unit economics by:

• Nearly doubling revenues mostly through new premium subscriptions.

• Increasing gross profits by 400 percent.

• Reducing EBITDA losses by 97 percent. In 2020 the company lost a mere $200000 on $31 million of revenues.

Today the company’s income statement looks like this:

Building on its strong footprint its partnership with artists and telco providers and its data Anghami aspires to:

1) Triple its user base by 2023 through reinforcing its position in existing markets (mostly Egypt and Saudi Arabia) and expanding into new geographies (i.e. neighboring countries in South Asia except India and Arab diaspora in the west).

2) Nearly double the share of paid subscribers from 17.5 percent today to 30 percent in 2023 while increasing ad revenues by 5-fold through improved targeting.

3) Launch new revenue streams such as live radio live concerts and branded content.

Achieving these targets won’t be easy especially if Anghami wants to do so while maintaining a sustainable competition position (instead of just focusing on growth). As such the management team needs to keep an eye on four priorities:

Efficient marketing: As Spotify Deezer and others (YouTube Apple Amazon) expand their footprint in the region the competitive rivalry between music streaming platforms will intensify. As a result customer acquisition costs will likely spike driven by higher marketing spend and more discounts which will dilute profits across the board. Striking a balance between growth and profitability will remain a key challenge for Anghami. Thus maintaining high marketing efficiency and a reasonable LTV/ CAC ratio should be a priority.

Continuous product improvement: User engagement is one of the most important metrics in music streaming given its influence on retention and user growth. To maintain high user engagement Anghami should adopt a rapid product development cycle to upgrade its recommendation engine and bring new features to customers. The company should also regularly tweak its ad-targeting algorithms to maximize return on ad spend for its partnering brands.

Original Arabic content: Like Spotify Anghami can’t solely rely on external content to drive its growth. It can’t also win focusing on foreign content. Instead the Middle Eastern player should double down on its Arabic-first advantage and build/ sponsor a rich library of original Arabic content (music and podcasts) catered to its core userbase (Arabic content accounts for 1 percent of Anghami’s catalog but 50 percent of streams).

Focused and lean approach: Anghami paved a path towards profitability by focusing on a sustainable growth model and maintaining a lean structure. Costs related to geographical expansion new product releases and running a public company can run out of hand. The leadership team should stick to their previous way of doing things by maintaining a lean structure and adopting a very tactical approach to the technological and product bets they make. A focused frugal approach remains the right one.

Most importantly Anghami will need a lot of cash going forward to fund growth marketing product innovation and content creation.

Thus the SPAC.

Anghami’s SPAC deal

What’s a SPAC and a PIPE?

The below is an excerpt from Sharif Farha’s primer (PDF) on SPACs. Sharif is one of the region’s best consumer investors and was the first to draw my attention to the beauty of Spotify’s flywheel and the company’s potential. Check out his company deep-dives at safehousecap.com.

A Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) is a shell company that lists on the stock market with the goal of acquiring or merging with a private company. By acquiring/merging with a private company that private company (or target) in turn becomes a publicly-traded company.

Here’s an example:

1. “SPAC A” raises $100mn from investors at $10 per share

2. “SPAC A” lists on the market with 10mn share

3. “SPAC A” identifies an interesting company “Target” worth $1bn

4. “SPAC A” acquires 10% of “Target” for $100mn

5. “Target” is now listed on the market and open to any investor to buy shares

6. Investors in “SPAC A” have a choice of redeeming their shares and get their $10 back (the original share price) or get a share in “Target”

Private investment in public equity (PIPE) is an instrument that public companies use to raise money from private investors. In the process private investors receive shares in the company in exchange for the money they invest.

Companies elect to go public or raise money through a SPAC or a PIPE as opposed to traditional methods (IPOs or secondary offerings) for multiple reasons:

• SPACs and PIPEs offer companies a quicker route to public markets due to fewer regulatory requirements

• SPACs/ PIPEs grant companies more control over their valuation and share price given they negotiate with one entity.

• SPACs/ PIPEs tend to lower transaction costs than IPOs.

• Going public through an IPO would require the company’s management team to go on roadshows to pitch the company to investors thus distracting them from running the business.

Details of Anghami’s SPAC

As part of the deal Anghami will receive cash through two separate instruments:

1) VMAC special purpose acquisition corporation (SPAC) a publicly listed entity that has raised $100 million in cash from investors. The final amount of money given to Anghami will depend on the number of investors that redeem their shares for cash (see point 6 in the example above). Therefore Anghami can receive anywhere between $0 (if all investors are unhappy with the deal and decide to redeem their shares) to $100 million (if all investors decide to go through with the deal and turn their shares into Anghami shares).

2) Private investment from external investors in the form of a PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equities) of up to $110 million. Shuaa Capital and Vistas Media Capital (parent of VMAC) are leading the PIPE raise and have already gathered commitments of $40 million. As such Anghami expects anywhere between $40 million (already committed) and $110 million (target amount) through this PIPE.

As such the deal’s total proceeds could fall anywhere between $40 million (assuming all SPAC investors redeem their shares and PIPE commitments remain at $40 million) and $210 million (assuming no SPAC investor redeems their share and PIPE commitments increase to the target of $110 million).

Proceeds will be partly used to:

• Cover the transaction cost estimated at $6.6 million

• Pay existing investors that wish to sell some of their shares (secondary sales). The secondary sales size is expected to range from $11 million (if proceeds are limited to $40 million) to $61 million (if proceeds equal $210 million).

The remaining cash ($142.4M in the best case) will be given to Anghami’s management team to fund the company’s initiatives.

In this deal Anghami’s Enterprise value was set at ~$220 million valuing the company at 7x EV/ 2020 sales a slight premium to Spotify’s current 6x EV/ 2020 sales (albeit Spotify’s stock price recently dropped 25 percent following the recent growth stocks sell-off).

Adding the cash received to the company’s Enterprise Value yields a market cap of $361.9 million (assuming all $210 million are received).

Overall the deal structure looks something like this:

Following the deal closing Anghami’s ownership structure will look as follows:

The story so far: On March 3 Maharashtra Power Minister Nitin Raut announced that a State Cyber Cell probe had found 14 Trojan horses in the servers of the Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company. These malwares had the potential to disrupt power distribution in the State. The announcement came in the wake of a report from Recorded Future a U.S.-based cybersecurity firm stating that a group linked to the Chinese government which it called ‘Red Echo’ had targeted 10 vital nodes in India’s power distribution system and two seaports. Recorded Future claims the cyber intrusions from China began in May 2020 amid heightened tensions at the border. It also suggested that these malwares could be the cause of the massive power outage in Mumbai in October 2020 . On Monday the Power Ministry said Chinese hacker groups had targeted various Indian power centres but these groups had been thwarted after government cyber agencies warned it about their activities. The Ministry said there had been “no data breach” from the threat.

How did Recorded Future track malware in Indian systems?

Recorded Future did not look directly into the servers of India’s power system. Instead it found a large number of IP addresses linked to critical Indian systems communicating for months with AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers connected to Red Echo. These servers had domains spoofing those of Indian power sector entities configured to them. For example it had an ‘ntpc-co[.]com’ domain which spoofs the original ntpc[.]co[.]in . AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers act as command-and-control centres for a malware known as ShadowPad.

Comment | Patching the gaps in India’s cybersecurity

What is ShadowPad?

ShadowPad is a backdoor Trojan malware which means it opens a secret path from its target system to its command-and-control servers. Information can be extracted or more malicious code delivered via this path. Mr. Raut had said that there was an attempt to “either insert or remove around 8 GB of data from the server”.

Security firm Kaspersky says ShadowPad is built to target supply-chain infrastructure in sectors like transportation telecommunication energy and more. It was first identified in 2017 when it was found hidden in a legitimate software produced by a company named NetSarang. Trojanised softwares or softwares that have dangers hidden in them like the eponymous Trojan horse from Greek mythology are the primary mode of delivery for ShadowPad.

How are ShadowPad and Red Echo linked to China?

Kaspersky states that several techniques used in ShadowPad are also found in malware from Winnti group “allegedly developed by Chinese-speaking actors”. Security analysis firm FireEye links ShadowPad to a group known as ‘APT41’ which it says overlaps with the Winnti group. Microsoft has been tracking another group under the name ‘Barium’. In September 2020 the U.S. Department of Justice announced that a federal grand jury had indicted “five computer hackers all of whom were residents and nationals of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) with computer intrusions affecting over 100 victim companies in the United States and abroad”. The U.S. Department of Justice confirmed that these were the intrusions that various security researchers were tracking using different threat labels such as ‘APT41’ ‘Barium’ ‘Winnti’ ‘Wicked Panda’ and ‘Wicked Spider’. The Department of Justice statement said the “defendants also compromised foreign government computer networks in India and Vietnam”.

Security firm FireEye also “assesses with high confidence” that ‘APT41’ “carries out Chinese state-sponsored espionage activity in addition to financially motivated activity potentially outside of state control” i.e. the group not only spies for the Chinese government but also does cybercrime when it suits them. The group has been known to target the video-game industry.

Recorded Future in its report notes large overlaps in the systems used by Red Echo and ‘APT41/Winnti/Barium’. “At least 3 of the [Red Echo] targeted Indian IP addresses were previously seen in a suspected APT41/Barium-linked campaign targeting the Indian Oil and Gas sectors in November 2020” it says.

What were Red Echo’s targets?

Recorded Future lists these as suspected targets: Power System Operation Corporation Limited NTPC Limited NTPC Kudgi STPP Western Regional Load Despatch Centre Southern Regional Load Despatch Centre North Eastern Regional Load Despatch Centre Eastern Regional Load Despatch Centre Telangana State Load Despatch Centre Delhi State Load Despatch Centre DTL Tikri Kalan (Mundka) Delhi Transco Ltd (substation) V. O . Chidambaranar Port and Mumbai Port Trust.

What is the objective of Red Echo?

Recorded Future says the kind of infrastructure sought to be accessed by Red Echo such as Regional Load Despatch Centres has minimal espionage possibilities. However it adds “we assess they pose significant concerns over potential pre-positioning of network access to support Chinese strategic objectives.” Prepositioning in cyber warfare means to have malware assets in crucial places that can be called on when an actual attack is launched.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbG9uZG9uaXN0LmNvbS9sb25kb24vbmV3cy90aGUtY2l0eS1vZi1sb25kb24taXMtZ2V0dGluZy1mdWxseS1lbGVjdHJpYy1ydWJiaXNoLXRydWNrc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The City Of London Is Getting Fully Electric Rubbish Trucks,"Maire Rose Connor

The City Of London Is Getting Fully Electric Rubbish Trucks

The City of London Corporation will soon become the first UK authority to run a full fleet of Electric Refuse Collection Vehicles (ERCVs).

These five new zero-emissions trucks — the first of which arrived at Guildhall on 4 March — will collect waste and recycling from residents of the Square Mile without contributing to air pollution in the local area.

In contrast to the traditional diesel rubbish trucks the new 18 tonne and 26 tonne ERCVs are powered by lithium-ion batteries. These are designed for the short routes you typically find in urban environments: each of the City ERCVs are able to complete a full route on a single battery charge.

The new environmentally-friendly fleet is part of the City Corporation's plan for at least 90% of the Square Mile to meet World Health Organisation guidelines for nitrogen dioxide by 2025.

These stipulate that annual levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) should not exceed 40 micrograms per cubic metre — and in recent years the capital has taken huge strides towards this target. Between 2016 and 2019 the annual NO2 average fell by an average of 21% across monitoring sites Londonwide boosted by the introduction of the Ultra-Low Emissions Zone and initiatives like London's first 'zero emission' road which City Corporation began piloting last year.

That said there's still plenty of work to be done. In 2019 the City of London had the second-highest levels of toxic air particles known as PM 2.5 in the capital exceeding WHO's annual guidelines by 2.6 micrograms per cubic metre. Here's hoping that along with other green measures the new ERCV fleet can help make the borough's air a whole lot cleaner.",,,

What Happened: The entrepreneur teased the reveal of the electric pickup in a tweet.

Update probably in Q2. Cybertruck will be built at Giga Texas so focus right now is on getting that beast built. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 6 2021

Musk said the present focus has to be on building the Gigafactory in Texas where the vehicle will be built.

Why It Matters: In October last year Musk had said that the Cybertruck was going to be “better than what we showed.”

In May last year Musk went on a test drive of the Cybertruck with comedian Jay Leno and remarked that the vehicle was “pretty close” to the final version but the proportions needed to be 5% smaller to fit in a standard garage.

Price Action: Tesla shares closed nearly 3.8% lower at $597.95 on Friday and fell 0.28% in the after-hours trading.

Investors are probably quite happy that an ""affordable"" model is finally going after those mass-market customers.

But the average Tesla fans are probably more curious to see if this is a cool car. After all many other manufacturers make EVs as well but they're usually not as well planned or interesting.At first glance the Model 2 is a bad idea. Tesla is known for cutting corners the wrong way sometimes and with a base price of $25000 there's a lot that can go wrong. There are a lot of unknowns too starting with the platform it will use to the markets that will be targeted and how.Until more info becomes available we can at least enjoy a sketch from YouTube's favorite car designer TheSketchMonkey. He was inspired by the official sketch posted by the manufacturer but tries to make a ""photo-realistic rendering of this car.""So why start with a Tesla Model 3 ? Well the artist argues that using existing parts like the headlights is a good way to keep costs down. Of course the Model 2 is supposed to be a compact hatchback so the proportions have to be modified accordingly.The digital creation also gets new parts such as the hidden door handles for the back and a kink in the rear glass pointing toward the top of the hatch opening. In our opinion this doesn't seem like the Tesla way of doing things. Yes the company makes electric cars but innovation is the reason why they're so popular and there's not a lot of that here.We're sure that the actual production car will have outside-the-box features though it probably won't be as cheap as they promised. Tesla base models have a habit of arriving late and being discontinued soon after because people just like the full-spec versions more.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vaG93LXRlc2xhLXdpbGwtZGVyYWlsLWVsZWN0cmljLXZlaGljbGUtY29tcGV0aXRpb24tMjAyMS_SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZXNsYXJhdGkuY29tL2hvdy10ZXNsYS13aWxsLWRlcmFpbC1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLTIwMjEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Tesla’s Elon Musk will derail EV competition in 2021,"By

In June 2020 I wrote a newsletter called “How Tesla’s Elon Musk dunks on the competition just as their momentum builds” where I dissected Tesla’s strategies to derail competition in its footsteps. It seems that anytime a competing automaker is about to make a substantial step forward Musk or Tesla releases an update that simply takes away any attention from anyone else. In this week’s newsletter I want to talk about what Elon Musk and Tesla can do in 2021 to combat an expanding EV market and take momentum away from the companies that claim they are “the next Tesla.”

Rivian

With Rivian coming to the market soon with its R1T pickup and R1S SUV later this year Tesla has a unique opportunity to halt the oncoming automaker’s momentum. Rivian headed by CEO RJ Scaringe has an adventurous outdoorsy appeal to its consumers and its reservation holders a strategy that truly speaks to the EV drivers who choose electric powertrains because of their environmental impact. Rivian is likely the first electric car company that will see its products regularly used in offroad settings just what they’re geared for.

Tesla has always had a relatively luxurious connotation with its name as its cars are usually sporty sleek and perfect for open road driving where the accelerator can occasionally hit the floorboards (not suggested or recommended by me). However Rivian’s R1T which sports a traditional pickup truck design isn’t as talked about or as popular as the Tesla Cybertruck. On frequent occasion the Cybertruck seems to come out of nowhere with a newly-released modification or design update at the hands of Elon Musk. With Musk revealing that the Cybertruck has been modified and reduced in size by 3% there is no reason that Tesla won’t show new pictures of the all-electric “Cyberpunk” inspired pickup when Rivian is about to gain momentum. The conversation will almost surely switch back to Tesla because of its name the truck’s “polarizing” design and Tesla’s notoriety in the segment.

This is a preview from our weekly newsletter. Each week I go ‘Beyond the News’ and handcraft a special edition that includes my thoughts on the biggest stories why it matters and how it could impact the future.

The R1S is a little bit tougher of a cookie to crack for Tesla because it doesn’t have anything that really matches the design of Rivian’s SUV. The only thing that could derail attention from the R1S are details about Tesla’s electric van. However with the Cybertruck Roadster and $25k vehicle projects being talked about already and delays due to battery constraints there isn’t much hope to hearing about the Tesla Van in the near future.

Even still something simple as renders or Musk even mentioning the possibility of an electric van will drive media into a frenzy. It will likely be one of the only things talked about in the automotive world for several days. While Rivian will release its R1S it will get coverage but Musk and Tesla will take priority I’d assume.

Lucid

Lucid is a company that seems to have the best chance of competing with Tesla in terms of electric car performance. The Lucid Air Dream Edition Limited is one of the premier electric vehicles in terms of performance and it proved it by setting records at the Laguna Seca raceway in California. Arguably the most sporty electric car since the Model S the Air has Tesla roots as Lucid’s CEO and CTO is Peter Rawlinson a former Tesla employee who helped with the Model S project.

The problem for Lucid is that Tesla has the Roadster coming out within the near future. Lucid has already delayed production due to the pandemic and it won’t come until later this year. Tesla has put the Roadster on hold several times as it is still in development for a few meteoric features like hovering that Elon Musk seems hellbent on figuring out. While the Lucid Air has incredible performance and range that is impressive in its own right it doesn’t hold a candle to the performance range or suspense that Tesla Roadster fans have felt. Updates to the Roadster are unbelievably sought after by enthusiasts and any small detail is eaten up instantaneously by those who are interested in the vehicle. It is fair to assume that if Lucid announces its initial deliveries of the Air Tesla could counter it with an update to the Roadster big or small.

Not to mention Tesla could singlehandedly take most of Lucid’s appeal away with a quick 10-second clip of the Model S Plaid+ doing a quarter-mile drag. Many people would be interested in the Air’s most robust performance package until they see the 1.7-second 0-60 MPH from Tesla’s new Model S powertrain.

Legacy Automakers and OEMs

There are a lot of advantages here and one of the biggest could be Tesla’s introduction of Giga Texas later this year. More than a production plant this facility is set to be an entire experience. A boardwalk entertainment tours you name it. Giga Texas will be a production facility that puts much of its competition to bed simply because of its appeal. It will likely be the most immersive personal “tour” experience that anyone ever has at a vehicle production plant. Who other than Tesla to make it happen?

Tesla doesn’t have to do much different than what it has done for the past few years to take momentum away from legacy automakers. Continuing to build highly-effective revolutionary electric cars is all Tesla needs to do to convince people that it is ahead of legacy car companies in this front. Not much needs to change.

Tesla does have its work cut out for it in Europe though. European EV sales figures are dominated by Volvo Kia Renault BMW and Volkswagen. Tesla doesn’t have a car in the Top 20 in Europe yet this year according to the EV Sales Blog. With Giga Berlin coming later this year as well this will surely change. My guess is the Model Y cracks the Top 5 no later than three months after Giga Berlin’s initial rollout simply due to demand the appeal of the crossover body style in Europe and the distinct advantage Tesla has over legacy car companies in terms of software.

Despite the tumble on Wall Street Tesla still has plenty of time to turn 2021 around. With the EV sector growing this year as new manufacturers release their first products Tesla has an opportunity to show that they’re still able to compete with the young guns of the EV industry. Tesla is sure to remain the top dog and it could take some simple derailing of competition just like it has done for years.

By PAUL LAMBERT

Dallas-based Texas Instruments (TI) offers its 30000 employees career and support groups for Christians Muslims and Jews time-off flexibility around religious holidays and serenity rooms for prayers or worship.

Software company Salesforce has a career and support group focused on religion Faithforce that has been the company’s fastest growing employee group since it was introduced in 2017.

Alphabet/Google’s Inter Belief Network and American Airlines’ various faith-focused employee resource groups earned them high rankings this year on the list of Fortune 200 companies with faith- and belief-friendly corporate workplaces.

These and other major companies say that respecting religious freedom at work not only is the right thing to do but also can lead to happier more productive employees and a better bottom line.

TI employee Jason Rosen speaking of his faith-friendly workplace said “When I’m bringing my whole self to work that makes me want to give my all to Texas Instruments. …You’ve enabled me to be who I am and I want to use that whole self and give it back to you.’”

Addressing faith and belief at work starts with recognizing the reality of faith and belief among employees. The Religious Freedom Center offers training to help managers and workers develop knowledge and skills in environments of accommodation and action to make it happen.

The diversifying world economy supports the trend toward accommodating faith at work. Markets are expanding globally creating a more diverse and more religious customer base. All but one of the 10 fastest-growing economies each year since 2017 have been countries with big religious majority populations. This means the great majority of potential customers in emerging markets have a deeply held religious worldview.

Global data tracking religious affiliation shows a similar trend toward religiosity. The Pew Research Center calculates that religious affiliation in the world will grow to 84 percent by 2050. This has major impacts on market growth in a global economy. Any company that hopes to grow its global footprint must better understand and accommodate global customers including their religious and cultural worldviews.

But it isn’t just a macro issue. At Intel for example faith-based employee resource groups have had a positive impact on employee recruitment and retention and on revenue said Craig Carter an Intel manager and controller at the 2020 Faith@Work Conference.

In Silicon Valley 57 percent of the tech workforce is foreign born according to a recent study by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Silicon Valley Competitiveness and Innovation Project. With national diversity comes religious diversity with many workers coming from religious-majority countries such as India and Iran.

Companies seeking to attract and keep this talent must have policies in place that accommodate and protect religious diversity and belief. I’d also note: A workplace that embraces diversity also welcomes atheists agnostics and those of no faith.

Employees who feel accommodated in their religious beliefs at work and see others accommodated as well are better employees says TI software engineer Zonera Javed who moved to the U.S. as a child.

“For many people of faith our religions aren’t something we can toggle on or off depending on where we are during the day. And that shouldn’t be the case or the expectation” Javed said speaking at a conference last fall about her workplace experiences as a Muslim. “We spend a lot of time at work and by having an environment that allows us to truly feel at home our work thrives and our companies perform better.”

Sadly U.S. businesses have a long way to go in creating faith-welcoming workplaces. Thirty-six percent of American workers — 50 million people — say they have experienced or witnessed hiring discrimination or verbal abuse based on religion and other forms of religious disparagement or discrimination according to a 2014 survey by the Tannenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding.

In another report the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that workplace religious discrimination complaints were nearly twice as high as complaints about sexual orientation in 2018.

For many companies accommodating employees’ faith and belief at work may sound scary and hard. In my role with the Freedom Forum’s Religious Freedom Center I’ve worked on these topics with some of the companies I’ve mentioned and I don’t see it that way. It’s a small investment that pays immeasurable dividends.

It’s time for all employers to recognize the power of faith and belief accommodation and empowerment. It’s not only a fundamental right and the right thing to do it’s also good for business.

Daniel Ray Caldwell 49 of The Colony Texas will stay behind bars until his trial in Washington D.C. The Dallas Morning News reported.

After hearing testimony during several detention hearings in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas Magistrate Judge Kimberly Priest Johnson decided no conditions of release would ""reasonably assure the safety"" of the community.

Caldwell was arrested by FBI agents on Feb. 10 at Texas Instruments his place of employment in Richardson Texas authorities said. He was fired following his arrest.

At a detention hearing on Feb. 22 Assistant U.S. Attorney Tracey Batson argued that Caldwell's alleged actions on Jan. 6 ""indicate a lack of respect toward law enforcement"" and that ""his own words put him inside the Capitol.""

DOJ CHARGES TEXAS MAN WITH DOUSING 15 OFFICERS WITH CHEMICAL SPRAY AT CAPITOL RIOT

According to an indictment unsealed Wednesday Caldwell is now charged with seven counts: civil disorder; assaulting resisting or impeding certain officers using a dangerous weapon; entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon; disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon: engaging in physical violence in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon; disorderly conduct in a Capitol building; and act of physical violence in the Capitol grounds or buildings.

Video footage captured on mobile devices and later obtained by law enforcement allegedly showed Caldwell ""assaulting federal agents and engaging in disruptive or disorderly conduct on the lower west terrace of the Capitol Building"" FBI Special Agent Seth Webb wrote in the official statement of facts filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington on Feb. 8.

According to the court documents a Twitter account with the handle @chris_sigurdson shared two links on Jan. 27. The first was to a YouTube video titled ""Storm The Capitol w/ dream floral."" Caldwell wearing an ""olive drab in color hoodie dark glasses on a camouflage hat camouflage assault pack and camouflage trousers"" was seen ""spraying a mist at police who were attempting to stop protesters from getting up the Capitol steps.""

The documents included screenshots of the video.

The second link shared on Twitter was to a video interview published by ProPublica. It appeared to have been recorded on Jan. 6 at 4:54 pm in the lobby of the Renaissance Hotel in Arlington Va. Caldwell wearing the same outfit as earlier in the day with a red ""Guns SAVE Lives"" sticker added to his hoodie is heard recounting events outside the Capitol answering questions from two female voices off-camera.

""Probably 10 minutes after we started storming a big fight broke out and the guns go off and one girl got hit in the neck"" Caldwell said recalling how police fired rubber bullets. ""Then the fights started and they took their guys and somebody grabbed her and they took off.""

""We stayed there and they kept spraying pepper spray"" he continued referring to officers. ""I was like 'Dude do it again and I'll spray you back.' And he did and I sprayed back; got like 15 of them and that's when they shot me with that big canon with rubber bullets.""

A witness interviewed by the FBI said Caldwell participates in Airsoft Military Simulation (MilSim) ""which is a live-action in person simulation of armed conflict scenarios conducted by civilians that involve airsoft plastic projectiles launched by replica weapons but do not involve actual firearms"" the court documents said.

The witness described Caldwell as a ""huge White supremacist"" and ""a complete wacko."" The witness also said Caldwell would bring a real firearm to the course and had to be corrected on multiple occasions to return the firearm to his vehicle.

CAPITOL RIOTER 'QANON SHAMAN' CLAIMS IN NEW INTERVIEW THAT OFFICERS 'WAVED' HIM INTO BUILDING ON JAN. 6

But at a detention hearing his ex-wife Kambria Ann Caldwell refuted that claim arguing that Caldwell is not a White supremacist and that he was friends with Black and Latino co-workers. She testified that her ex-husband receives VA disability services due to a traumatic brain injury he sustained in the early 1990s.

She also told the judge that Caldwell’s 13 rifles and four handguns are no longer in the home they’ve lived in together with their son since 2016 even after their marriage dissolved.

His attorney John Hunter Smith pointed out that Caldwell has not been identified in photos or videos inside the building on Jan. 6. Caldwell served in the Marines for five and a half years and was honorably discharged Smith said. He worked in the semiconductor industry for over 25 years.

The Justice Department said that more than 300 individuals have been charged in connection to the Capitol insurrection. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick's death remains under investigation.

""Regarding any connection to Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick we are not commenting or providing additional information on this active investigation"" Melinda Urbina a spokeswoman for FBI-Dallas Division previously told Fox News last week responding to a question about whether Caldwell’s case could be linked to Sicknick.

Capitol Police said the medical examiner’s report on Sicknick's death following the Jan. 6 attack is ""not yet complete."" Investigators are ""awaiting toxicology results and continue to work with other government agencies regarding the death investigation.""

""Officer Sicknick's family has asked for privacy during this difficult time and that the spreading of misinformation stop regarding the cause of his death"" the statement said.

Chip Gaines he of the Chip and Joanna Gaines team has written another book “No Pain No Gaines: The Good Stuff Doesn’t Come Easy” and it will hit bookshelves March 16 W Publishing Group spokesperson Allison Carter said in a press release.

“With hard-won lessons and personal stores from Chip ‘No Pain No Gaines’ is a by-the-bootstraps manual for building a network you can count on—one that requires faith in people hope and a willingness to grow even when it hurts” a book description states.

“So how ‘bout it? Say goodbye to the status quo to sleepwalking to a life set on autopilot and greet each glorious day with your purpose and passion blazing bright in your heart” Gaines is quoted as saying in the press release. “There’s no time better than this minute this second this breath.”

Carter said Magnolia.com will carry the book as will Walmart Target Barnes & Noble Amazon and other booksellers. Its list price is $26.99.

Corner Stop in Texas Monthly

Yet another Waco purveyor of barbecue has been profiled by Texas Monthly this one Corner Stop at North 26th Street and Colonial Avenue where proprietor Mitch Davis specializes in deep-fried rib tips.

“Today he sells a whopping 1600 pounds of rib tips each week” the profile states noting that diners may order the original or spicy version. Customers also may order breakfast sandwiches barbecue or triple-meat cheeseburgers but so far the battered and fried tips are crowd favorites.

Every day but Sunday Davis opens to offer baskets of original deep-fried rib tips for $7.89 or the spicy version for $8.79.

When he is not running his restaurant he fills the pulpit at Mount Carmel Baptist Church according to longtime Texas Monthly barbecue critic Daniel Vaughn’s profile.

On the barbecue side of the operation pitmaster Lloyd Ware “uses a pit fashioned from an old propane tank” according to Texas Monthly. Friends and neighbors drop off their spare wood behind the smokehouse leaving Ware time and resources to cook 16 briskets a week. A plate with two sides fetches $12.

Vaughn’s trips to Waco recently have also yielded articles praising Guess Family Barbecue and Honky Tonk Kid BBQ.

H-E-B remodel

H-E-B’s promised remodel of its Wooded Acres Drive store has started the giveaway being the installation of fencing. H-E-B is spending about $14 million to expand the store from 90400 to 108300 square feet tweak the department layouts and bring “a completely remodeled exterior design featuring warm and contemporary materials in a bold architectural style” according to a press release announcing the project last year.

H-E-B plans to keep the store open throughout the process proceeding in phases until its completion expected late this year.

H-E-B has been hush-hush about some project details possibly indicating it wants to keep the final look under wraps until a formal unveiling or until work progresses to the point shoppers decipher the clues.

Site Selection win

Texas for the ninth straight year has won Site Selection Magazine’s “Governor’s Cup” for its appeal to companies wanting to build or expand.

The magazine has awarded the Governor’s Cup annually since 1978 using proprietary information from Conway Projects Database.

The Rice study quantifies how high school girls benefit from a two-week summer physics camp before they begin formal study of the topic. Credit: Office of STEM Engagement/Rice University

Even a small effort up front can boost the abilities and confidence of girls as they anticipate taking challenging science courses.

A long-running summer program at Rice University and elsewhere that trains high school girls in basic physics concepts has proven successful in helping them thrive when they take on full courses the next year.

When leaders of Rice's two-week day camp looked at similar programs beyond Houston they found participants scored 3% better in high school physics than their counterparts who did not have the equivalent summer experience.

""That doesn't seem like a lot but it's really hard to move the needle on student outcomes so 3% is significant"" said Carolyn Nichol an assistant research professor in the Department of Chemistry and director of the Rice Office of STEM Engagement (R-STEM).

The results are detailed in an open-access study by Nichol lead author Ericka Lawton and co-authors Carrie Obenland and Matthew Cushing of R-STEM and Christopher Barr of the Rice Office of Research in the American Physics Society journal Physical Review Physics Education Research.

The study is one of two led and recently released by Nichol. The other analyzes the effect of long-term professional development for teachers in engineering education. That study by Nichol lead author Christina Crawford of R-STEM and co-author Obenland appears in the Journal of STEM Outreach.

The high school study collected years' worth of generalized data from participating districts for students who studied chemistry but did not participate in a camp and the same data for those who did. That gave researchers a baseline to compare results for the same set of students after they all took high school physics.

""There wasn't a self-selection bias where people could say 'Oh girls who go to a physics camp in June already like physics'"" she said noting Rice and its counterparts typically recruit students from underserved schools. ""The girls who were part of the study were matched so their chemistry scores were the same. We didn't base this on girls who were already accelerating in science.""

The study was based on a philanthropic effort by Rice alumna and trustee Wanda Gass '78 an engineer who helped develop the first commercially viable digital signal processor during her career at Texas Instruments. She subsequently founded the nonprofit Design Connect Create to encourage girls to pursue STEM (science technology engineering math) studies.

Design Connect Create runs summer camps for multiple school districts across Texas. Nichol said the study is great validation for the physics program that will ideally lead to similar courses in other science-oriented topics.

""When I talk to these girls at Rice and often they really don't want to be here"" she said. ""They're very quiet at the start because for the most part they are being forced to come by their parents. But by the end they form really wonderful bonds with the other girls. Within two weeks they are sharing skills and become trusting of each other.

""I think that's the real reason they go back and are successful in physics"" Nichol said. ""They just get this confidence that they can do it.""

The second study sought to show the value of professional development for teachers whose coursework touches on engineering topics but who are not themselves engineers. The researchers followed up with teachers who took the 45-hour graduate level course at Rice in 2018 and 2019 to see how they incorporated engineering into their classrooms.

The study found that based on a set of attributes for adult self-motivation teachers showed significant improvement in overall self-efficacy—the belief in their own ability to succeed—in engineering instruction.

""I'm an engineer because my dad was an engineer"" said Nichol who has a doctorate in chemical engineering. ""We want engineering in K-12 classrooms because a lot of kids don't have role models and we want them to understand that an engineer is somebody who designs and creates new things.""

She said the program that best exemplifies what Rice offers is the NanoEnvironmental Engineering for Teachers course which gives participants rigorous hands-on experience working on water sustainability projects. The course a collaboration with the Rice-based and National Science Foundation-backed Nanotechnology Enabled Water Treatment Center is also offered at Arizona State and the University of Texas at El Paso.

That’s the indoor steel-framed rock-climbing gym in the Ripon Crossing shopping center – current home to Les Schwab Tire Center Tractor Supply Co. and Boat Country (coming soon: Burger King Popeye’s Chicken Shell Gas Station & Convenience Store with a Tommy’s Express Car Wash) – at 1450 Garrison Way.

“We are finalizing the bouldering and kids’ area along with the rest of the finishing details on the construction portion of the project” Jonathan Meek said.

He’s the Ripon resident and developer of the total 19335-square-foot facility dedicated to climbing – featured are a 55-foot-high lead wall along with a 15-meter speed wall 16-foot bouldering wall and a kids’ climbing area.

DeGraff Development is handling the construction.

“Alpine’s 55-foot walls are complete with ropes and climbing routes” said Meeks who recently had USA Climbing Route Setter of the Year Joey Jannsen help with the opening set.

The gym will also feature free weight cardio equipment TRX benches medicine balls mobility equipment yoga high intensity interval and cross fitness classes.

Meeks announced that a founding membership deal will go on sale in the coming weeks.

Those signing up will have a variety of options of climbing. Included will be top rope auto belay and lead – rental gear from climbing shoes harness and belaying devices will be available at the front desk or for purchase at the gym’s full-service retail shop.

Manufacturers it seems have not found this an easy segment to supply. But Valtra now offers a solution that appears to be economically sustainable writes Stehan Cloete.

- Advertisement -

Valtrac the South African distributor of Valtra tractors recently introduced the Valtra A2R-series standard-format tractor and the A3F-series narrow-configuration tractor. This article focuses on the A3F but the A2R plays a key role in the existence of its smaller sibling as we shall see.

The A2R is the ideal general workhorse with the versatility to accomplish anything from headland maintenance to demanding soil preparation work and planting. This standard-configuration tractor has all the equipment to cover a multitude of farming tasks and provides ample space for ballasting.

A specific role

The A3F by contrast is a narrow-configuration specialist tractor designed for orchard- and vineyard-related tasks.

- Advertisement -

This type of tractor is sometimes a unique machine in a manufacturer’s line-up and when volumes do not reach a certain number the manufacturer may not deem it worthwhile to a support the model in the long run.

This is where the A2R may benefit the A3F: they share most of their components. The combined sales volumes of the standard-format A2R and the A3F should be substantial giving the buyer of an A3F peace of mind.

Engine

The A3F’s AGCO Power three-cylinder turbo-intercooled common-rail engine comes in a 63kW and 71kW specification the latter being one of the most powerful in this segment. To meet required emission standards AGCO uses a no-maintenance gas recirculation system.

Although the machine seems fairly basic elsewhere its designers have not skimped on electronic technology under the bonnet. This makes for a highly economical powerplant even at low speeds and assists with maintenance by allowing access to engine diagnostics.

The power take-off (PTO) is an independent 540 rpm drive with a six-spline shaft. It engages hydromechanically on the open-station model and electro-hydraulically on the cab tractor.

The A3F has high lift capacity and hydraulic flow to easily accommodate all implements in this class.

Hydraulic flow ranges from 42ℓ/ min to 55ℓ/ min at 180kPa with two or three control valves.

The 71kW-model A3F has flow control which is recommended for continuous flow requirements when hydraulic motors on implements are driven.

With a 3 135kg lift capacity at the eye any implement in the tractor’s category can be operated and no metal was spared when designing the drawbar.

The standard 12-forward eight-reverse transmission with creeper gear ensures that all operating speed requirements can be met. The vehicle speed range starts at 045km/h which is ideal for harvesting and pruning tasks. An independent double disc clutch adds to the performance.

A 12-forward 12-reverse with mechanical reverser option is also available with an independent double disc clutch standard on all tractors.

All models are mechanical 4WD with a mechanical differential lock and 380/85R24 tyres.

Productivity

The reduced turning radius makes it easy to negotiate the headland and turn into the next row quickly and easily helping improve productivity.

The external width of the A3F varies from 1 327mm to 1 578mm but the tractor’s narrow geometry does not limit the implements that can be used.

The A3F is surprisingly comfortable given that it is a narrow-configuration tractor. All controls are arranged around the operator with comfort in mind. The cab tractor has excellent visibility and an adjustable steering column which makes it easier to enter the cab.

An optional activated carbon filter fitted to the cab configuration provides a safe operating environment when spraying chemicals.

The Electric Highway Coalition – made up of Southern Company American Electric Power Dominion Energy Duke Energy Entergy Corporation and the Tennessee Valley Authority – wants to collaborate on a network of DC fast chargers from the Atlantic Coast through the Midwest and South and into the Gulf Coast and Central Plains regions.

Southern Company and the others are each taking steps to provide EV charging solutions within their system service territories. The announcement represents an unprecedented combined effort to offer EV drivers convenient charging across different utility footprints and allow uninterrupted travel.

The Edison Electric Institute estimates 18 million EVs will be on U.S. roads by 2030. While many drivers recognize the benefits of driving an EV such as the ease of low-cost home charging some have expressed concern with the availability of charging stations during long road trips. With collaborative efforts like the Electric Highway Coalition energy companies demonstrate to customers that EVs are a smart choice regardless of distance.

The coalition will provide drivers with effective efficient and convenient charging options to enable long-distance electric travel. Sites along major highways with easy access and amenities for travelers are being considered as coalition members work to determine final charging station locations. DC fast chargers can get drivers back on the road in 20-30 minutes.

“At Southern Company we are committed to being a leader in building a clean and sustainable energy future for our customers and that includes continuing to increase the reach of electric transportation for more and more drivers” said Chris Cummiskey executive vice president chief commercial officer and customer solutions officer at Southern Company. “By increasing the number of EV fast-charging stations across our footprint we are providing drivers with additional transportation options that are reliable efficient and more convenient while helping reduce carbon emissions for the benefit of our communities we serve.”

Being a founding member of the Electric Highway Coalition is another part of Southern Company’s larger focus on electrification of the transportation industry and commitment to sustainability and clean energy. Along with the systemwide goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 last year Southern Company announced an internal fleet electrification goal where the company plans by 2030 to convert to electric 50% of its electric companies’ fleet vehicles in the auto/SUV/minivan forklift and ATV/cart/miscellaneous equipment segments.

The Electric Highway Coalition welcomes interested utilities to join as it seeks to extend the reach of network. Additionally its members support and look forward to working with other regional utility transportation corridor electrification initiatives.

These agricultural investments largely unnoticed and unchecked represent a potentially catastrophic blind spot.

“Animal protein and even dairy is likely and already has started to become the new oil and gas” said Bruno Sarda the former North America president of CDP a framework through which companies disclose their carbon emissions. “This is the biggest source of emissions that doesn’t have a target on its back.”

We’re hiring! Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. See jobs

By pouring money into emissions-intensive agriculture banks and investors are making a dangerous bet on the world’s growing demand for food especially foods that are the greatest source of emissions in the food system: meat and dairy.

Agriculture and deforestation largely driven by livestock production are responsible for nearly one quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. By 2030 livestock production alone could consume nearly half the world’s carbon budget the amount of greenhouse gas the world can emit without blowing past global climate targets.

“It’s not enough to divest from fossil fuel” said Devlin Kuyek a senior researcher at GRAIN a non-profit organization that advocates for small farms. “If you look at emissions just from the largest meat and dairy companies and the trajectories they have you see that these companies and their models are completely unsustainable.”

Those trajectories could put global climate goals well out of reach.

The American banks that are the four leading financiers globally of fossil fuels —JP Morgan Chase Wells Fargo Citigroup and Bank of America—all to varying degrees have made climate action more of a priority. But these and other major global banks continue to funnel dollars into companies that trade in “soft commodities”including beef soy timber and palm oil that are linked to the destruction of forests and critically important ecosystems.

A battery of recent analyses by sustainable investment and environmental advocacy groups has tracked the dollars. JP Morgan Chase for example has directed more than $450 million since 2016 to leading Brazilian meat packers that environmental groups claim have direct ties to deforestation and to recent devastating fires in the Amazon. BNP Paribas and HSBC are among the banks that have committed to stop funding deforestation from agriculture but still continue to provide billions to companies that have not.

Though they have promised to address climate change Rabobank Morgan Stanley Barclays and Goldman Sachs continue funding agribusinesses directly or indirectly involved in deforestation or high-carbon agriculture.

The banks either declined to comment for this article or did not respond to requests for comment. HSBC and Morgan Stanley pointed to their sustainability commitments online.

“We’re still trying to get the banks to recognize that the land-use sector is part of the climate problem” said Hana Heineken a senior campaigner with the Rainforest Action Network an advocacy group that has extensively tracked how banks have financed deforestation. “As things stand right now there is still a disconnect between banks saying they’re going to address climate change in their portfolios and what they’re going to do about financing.”

The world’s largest asset managers—BlackRock Vanguard and State Street—sell investment funds marketed as “sustainable.” But some of these funds contain agribusiness companies blamed for cutting down tropical forests. And the asset managers are among the biggest investors in major meat and dairy companies including JBS the world’s largest beef producer. None of these asset managers has a formal policy on deforestation environmental groups say.

When reached for comment the asset managers pointed to their sustainability platforms online and noted increased efforts to address deforestation and climate impacts from agriculture in their portfolios. In early 2020 BlackRock acknowledged the climate impacts of certain agribusiness practices and said it would push for greater disclosure of sustainability measures from companies in its funds.

The world’s food system needs to feed a population expected to hit 10 billion by 2050 meaning that the system will have 3 billion more people to feed than it did a decade ago. Global investors and banks see an opportunity in these numbers and in some cases are doubling down.

The climate impact of this could be disastrous with emissions from the food system projected to rise by nearly 60 percent if they stay on their current path.

Faced with these dire numbers some critics are increasingly calling for divestment from the food and agriculture companies with the biggest climate impacts—especially giant livestock and grain companies—much as they’ve called for divestment from fossil fuel companies.

Others are simply calling for more vigilance in policing destructive farming practices and the financial institutions that support them. They’re also pushing for more support for farmers and farming methods that use fewer resources emit fewer greenhouse gases and replenish soils.

“We need food” said Moira Birss climate and finance director for Amazon Watch. “And we don’t need fossil fuels.”

As demand for food rises the world’s banks and investors will ultimately determine whether an increasingly taxed food system fuels a climate collapse.

Big Banks Have Big Impacts

Agriculture is the biggest driver of deforestation globally responsible for half of all recent tree loss and more than 90 percent in the tropics.

Palm oil soy and cattle are the largest commodities behind that loss with cattle accounting for from half to two-thirds as agribusiness interests or their suppliers cut down or burn forests to open up more pasture to graze the animals or cropland to feed them. These commodities known as “soft commodities” because they are grown not extracted pose the most significant risks to forests.

They are also the keys to profit for the agriculture and food industries.

Clearing forests releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide and destroys their ability to store carbon. It’s also a major cause of soil erosion and biodiversity loss which create yet more risk to the global food supply and to public health as the coronavirus pandemic has so clearly illustrated. With the destruction of large ecosystems biodiversity plummets. The species that survive tend to be the ones that harbor and spread disease.

While the burning of fossil fuels remains the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions emissions from agriculture would have to be slashed to stay within the 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius targets of the Paris climate agreement. That’s even if the rest of the economy including the energy and transportation sectors adequately decarbonized.

Stopping deforestation is one of the fastest ways to limit carbon emissions. Yet the world’s biggest banks and asset managers are fueling the problem instead.

The UK-based group Global Canopy examined the companies with the greatest exposure to deforestation including financial institutions. It found that despite making commitments to stop deforestation by 2020 as of 2018 not a single company was on track to cut deforestation from its supply chains. These included a range of companies that rely on commodities tied to deforestation including McDonald’s and PepsiCo.

Banks Global Canopy concluded were the biggest laggards: “Financial institutions are behind companies in setting commitments and policies on deforestation. Of the 150 financial institutions assessed nearly two thirds had no financing policy for any of the four key forest-risk commodities” their report said. In its 2020 analysis the group found 63 percent of financial institutions still did not have deforestation policies.

This despite the banks’ outward claims and commitments to tackling climate change.

In fact the world’s major banks are accelerating their funding of commodities tied to deforestation in Latin America Africa and Southeast Asia. Among the top banks funding “forest-risk” commodities—those potentially responsible for deforestation —are JP Morgan Chase and Rabobank the world’s leading agricultural bank which has said it does not fund deforestation in any areas of Brazil.

Many of their commitments—public and much applauded—have come since the Paris climate agreement. Yet as with the funding of fossil fuels the money they are investing has ballooned since the historic accord. Overall global banks have increased their lending to commodities linked to deforestation by about 40 percent funneling $154 billion in credit from December 2015 when the agreement was signed to April of last year.

Most of these forests are being converted into cropland to grow grain to feed livestock or to pastureland to graze cattle. The conversion doesn’t just destroy forests releasing carbon dioxide in the process it multiplies the number of animals that emit methane an especially potent greenhouse gas.

Financial think tanks and green investment groups in report after report have found that major global banks have made promises to stop financing deforestation but have not lived up to them. Not a single major bank that has committed to stop financing deforestation from soft commodities has done so completely or quickly enough according to a December report from BankTrack.

And no American bank has required its clients to adopt no-deforestation policies.

JP Morgan Citigroup and Bank of America are among the top US-based creditors of American commodities giants Cargill Bunge and ADM which supply major American food businesses from McDonald’s to Walmart.

These grain traders have made commitments to stop deforestation but continue to come under fire for their vast soy plantations one of the largest drivers of deforestation in South America.

Cargill and Bunge did not respond to requests for comment.

Edel Bach a spokesman for JBS said the company has a “zero-tolerance approach to illegal deforestation” and “has made extensive investments… to monitor its entire Amazon value chain to ensure it is illegal deforestation free by 2025.”

Jackie Anderson a spokeswoman for ADM explained that the company has a no-deforestation policy is a signatory to a moratorium on deforestation in the Amazon and is a founding member of the Soft Commodities Forum an effort to stop deforestation and land conversion in the soy supply chain.

Recent research has found that despite making these commitments the major grain traders are still producing commodities that are tied to deforestation in areas of Brazil beyond the Amazon. These same companies continue to be blamed for deforestation linked to palm oil in Southeast Asia much of which ends up in products made by top international consumer goods companies.

The Role of the Asset Managers

The biggest asset managers led by BlackRock are also significantly invested in the meat and dairy industries and in other commodities linked with deforestation.

Though meat and dairy account for less than 1 percent of their total assets under management BlackRock Capital Group and Vanguard are the meat and dairy industries’ largest shareholders according to Feedback Global.

Blackrock and Vanguard are also JP Morgan’s largest shareholders.

BlackRock Vanguard and State Street—“The Big Three” asset managers— have $12 billion invested in producers linked to deforestation including the major grain traders ADM Bunge and Cargill and the meatpackers JBS Marfrig and Minerva according to a recent analysis by Friends of the Earth. ADM Bunge Cargill and JBS in turn indirectly and directly supply some of the world’s biggest consumer goods companies including PepsiCo Nestlé and Unilever.

The report puts much of the blame on the big asset managers. “Powerful investors have consistently undermined meaningful action by agribusinesses and the consumer goods sector writ large” the analysis said.

The asset managers say they have no control over the companies in their funds because the majority of their investment products are passively managed index funds. These types of funds follow a major market index like the S&P 500 which means the index manager actually controls which companies are in the fund.

“Every dollar that BlackRock manages belongs to our clients and more than 90% of our equity assets are invested in index-based funds that our clients choose” a spokesman for BlackRock responded in an email. “We cannot selectively divest from individual companies in indexes that may present sustainability risks.”

A Vanguard spokesperson said that while there is “no industry acknowledged specific exclusion regarding deforestation” Vanguard’s sustainability funds track an index that filters out companies that fail to align with principles outlined by the United Nations. (These do not explicitly mention deforestation.)

State Street and Capital Advisors pointed to their sustainability statements online.

But critics say that the Big Three and other major asset managers are getting a pass and that they could exclude certain companies from their basket of investments if they implemented no-deforestation policies or structured their products differently.

“They could put in place explicit screening tools” said Matthew McLuckie managing partner at Posaidon Capital a London and Zurich-based green investment firm. “If you are going to support a net-zero transition or Paris alignment how can you be holding companies chopping down tropical forests?”

In emailed responses to questions about their deforestation practices McDonald’s Nestlé Unilever and Walmart said that they had made commitments to source their products only from deforestation-free areas: McDonald’s said it would eliminate deforestation from its supply chain by 2030; Nestlé said it would stop sourcing soy and palm from deforested areas by 2022 and stopped buying Brazilian soybeans from Cargill in 2019; Unilever said its supply chains would be deforestation-free by 2023; Walmart said it would stop sourcing beef in deforested areas of Brazil by 2022 among other commitments. PepsiCo did not respond to a request for comment.

Disclosure is Voluntary

Over the last decade investors and regulators have pushed companies including financial institutions to disclose their carbon emissions.

Disclosure is a key first step toward giving investors and banks the information they need to make informed decisions about where to put—or not to put— their money.

Guidelines like those outlined by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and platforms including the CDP (formerly the Climate Disclosure Project) have prompted greater responses from a growing number of companies that see climate change as a risk.

Without disclosures banks and investors aren’t equipped with information about the greenhouse gas impacts of the companies including banks that they invest in or support.

But these disclosure requirements are voluntary and critically they don’t comprehensively reveal the extent of deforestation or other climate risks in companies’ agricultural supply chains.

The TFCD guidelines the most robust and widely used explicitly say that banks don’t have to disclose emissions from agriculture. Rather the task force “suggests banks define carbon-related assets as those assets tied to the energy and utilities sectors.”

That means for banks at least in the framework of the TCFD agriculture isn’t a “carbon-related” asset so banks don’t have to reveal the extent to which they finance them.

Critics say this allows banks and the companies they finance to hide behind their supply chains. JP Morgan’s first report using the TCFD guidelines for example contains no mention of the bank’s investment in commodities with ties to deforestation.

Most of the emissions from agriculture and food companies come from their “Scope 3” emissions—emissions not from their direct operations but from their supply chains. Nearly 90 percent of food and agribusiness company emissions fall into this category experts say but only a fraction of the companies report them. Of the world’s top food and beverage companies only 16 percent disclose emissions from their agricultural supply chains.

Many companies don’t report on the deforestation in their supply chains at all. Those include Domino’s Pizza and Mondelez. And even those that do disclose may not depending on the company include a complete picture of emissions from deforestation or importantly the conversion of land from forest to pasture or cropland.

A Domino’s spokesman said the company provides information on sourcing for its U.S. products on its website and is currently developing a climate strategy. Mondelez did not reply to a request for comment.

Part of the problem is not just the general murkiness of supply chains but a lack of common principles for measuring emissions from land conversion and deforestation.

“In greenhouse gas accounting of Scope 3 emissions it’s challenging to get high quality data because they don’t have a lot of transparency in their supply chains” said Cynthia Cummis a greenhouse gas accounting expert with the World Resources Institute. “The science behind land-based emissions is challenging and there isn’t agreement on the best methods.”

Companies can take advantage of that critics say. The data self-reported to CDP by the companies is not audited by a third party and critics say CDP’s rating system rewards companies for having a policy on deforestation even if that policy is weak.

“In effect you’re taking a company’s word” said McLuckie. “Investors are left largely in the dark.”

‘This is Just About Money’

Demand for “green” investments that meet environmental standards has grown in recent years as progressive investors pressure companies to address climate change. “Impact investing” has gained traction with investors and sustainable funds now control more than $1 trillion in assets doubling according to a 2020 analysis by Morningstar over the three years before the study.

A 2019 report from the Croatan Institute found that impact investing now accounts for more than $17 trillion—or one in three dollars—of the more than $51 trillion in assets under professional management a 42 percent increase over 2018.

In a January 2020 commentary BlackRock acknowledged that agribusinesses have a significant climate impact especially because of their links to deforestation and said that the company would engage with those companies to improve their performance.

“Amongst other things we ask companies to disclose any initiatives and externally developed codes of conduct e.g. committing to deforestation-free supply chains to which they adhere and to report on outcomes ideally with some level of independent review” the company reported.

But some of BlackRock’s sustainable investment funds contain large agribusiness companies with ties to deforestation. For a company to be included in the fund it needs to provide an inventory of its greenhouse gas emissions but not its Scope 3 emissions.

“You have huge agroindustrial companies —chemical fertilizer seed monopolies— in these so-called sustainability funds” said Mark Campanale executive director of Carbon Tracker. “If they’re the answer we’re asking the wrong questions.”

Giant fund managers establish criteria for the risk they’ll take on in their portfolios but because of the lack of transparency and uniform standards on disclosure they may not know the extent of the emissions from any given company.

Companies with supply chains linked to deforestation often defend themselves by saying that the supply chains are too complicated to monitor effectively and that doing so would be prohibitively expensive.

Some companies notably Unilever are investing millions to clarify their supply chains so investors and consumers know exactly where their products are sourced. But many companies hide behind their supply chains some analysts say.

“They try to do everything they can to be intransparent in their supply chains” said Gerard Rijk senior equity analyst with Profundo a Netherlands-based research group that tracks supply chains and investing. “It’s clear they’re not trying hard enough. This is just about money.”

One initiative the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) created a system that enables financial institutions to assess their “financed emissions.” Like supply chain emissions a financial institution’s loans and investments are Scope 3 emissions and represent the vast majority of their emissions.

In July Morgan Stanley became the first U.S. banking giant to join PCAF. It was followed soon after by Bank of America and Citi. As of February 2021 PCAF included 101 financial institutions representing more than $21 trillion in assets.

But PCAF’s methodology a work in progress does not yet encompass carbon emitted from land-use conversion when land is changed from forest to crop or pastureland one of the biggest sources of emissions from agriculture.

Doubling Down

To feed 10 billion people by 2050 the world needs to produce 50 to 70 percent more food.

For investors those are appealing figures.

“Demand is going up and there’s a lot of money to be made” said Merel van der Mark coordinator of the forests and finance coalition for the Rainforest Action Network.

In a 2018 report Valoral Advisors said there were roughly 440 funds in the food and agriculture sector up from 38 in 2005. Those funds managed around $73 billion in investments. “The last 10 years have seen the emergence of the global F&A sector as an institutional asset class with increasing interest from private and institutional investors alike” Valoral said referring to the food and agriculture sector.

Indeed investors seem to be doubling down in part because they’re getting a strong message about future demand. That’s true for food of all kinds but especially for meat and dairy as appetites and incomes rise in developing countries.

A marked uptick in agricultural investing occurred after the 2008 financial crisis when global food prices spiked and investors began seeing opportunities especially in farmland.

“Within the financial sector there’s just been an evolving and growing effort to find returns wherever they can and it’s moving beyond your traditional investments” said Kuyek of GRAIN. “That’s part of the reason you’re seeing investment in agriculture.”

The profits to be made from meat and dairy are especially enticing largely because of rising demand but also because low grain prices have made it increasingly cheap to produce beef and milk at lower costs.

“There’s been a meat-ification of diets particularly in the US Europe Brazil and Australia and increasingly China” said Daniel Jones a senior campaign manager with Feedback. “We know that meat and dairy is a climate issue but why is it that meat and dairy continues to grow? Is it an insatiable human appetite for meat? Probably not.”

Saying but Not Doing

As investors increasingly move toward investing in sustainable investment funds and impact investing grows shareholders and green-focused asset managers have been pushing companies to tackle their climate impacts.

They do this through a range of actions including putting forward shareholder resolutions requesting climate action.

Because the giant asset managers are often the largest shareholders in corporations—including banks—their votes can determine whether a resolution passes or not. And for the most part even asset managers that have committed to addressing climate change often have failed to support climate-related resolutions. In 2020 for example BlackRock and Vanguard voted against climate-related resolutions more than 80 percent of the time.

On agriculture-specific resolutions the numbers are even lower.

In cases where BlackRock did vote with shareholder proposals in favor of climate action the companies it targeted were largely energy companies not those with agricultural supply chains and links to deforestation. Since 2012 the Big Three have voted against or abstained from 16 shareholder proposals aimed specifically at deforestation. (In a notable exception BlackRock voted in 2020 to support a shareholder proposal at Procter & Gamble that asked the company to report on its efforts to eliminate deforestation in its supply chain).

“There’s absolutely a big gap full-stop” said Jessye Waxman shareholder advocate with Green Century Funds. “I think this speaks to the broader questions about what it really means for a firm to be addressing climate risk comprehensively. If you want to address climate risk you need to address agriculture.”

Feedback Global and other critics contend that engagement—from appealing to companies directly to shareholder resolutions—isn’t working. They’re now calling for divestment from carbon-intensive agricultural and livestock companies.

Still other critics say that banks and investors have an opportunity to influence companies toward more sustainable forms of agriculture.

“Our call isn’t for full and immediate divestment from the agriculture industry as it essentially is for fossil fuels” said Birss of Amazon Watch. “It’s not the same. We can’t say it’s all terrible.”

But she added “If irreparable harms to the climate come from the production of food those who are carrying out the production of that food and the people providing the one necessary ingredient —finance—have a responsibility to ensure those irreparable harms aren’t happening.”

Since its founding in the mid-60s Seaway Bank now a division of Self-Help Federal Credit Union has embraced a mission of social justice and economic equality. Established in 1965 to counter discriminatory lending practices on Chicago’s South Side Seaway now continues that mission of providing fair financial services and products to the South Side’s African American community through a $14.2M investment in the renovation of its historic headquarters on 87th Street.

Through the complete renovation of its historically significant headquarters Seaway will continue its half-century long commitment to the South Side by not only providing critical financial resources for local homeowners and businesses through loans and bank accounts but also by creating high-quality office space and meeting facilities to community partners – facilities that are very rare in these neighborhoods and therefore mostly unavailable to South Side residents. The result will help fuel catalytic change for economically challenged communities of color in the greater Chatham area and beyond.

When renovations are complete next month Seaway will share the space with nonprofit and small business tenants who will contribute to the ongoing revitalization of the surrounding neighborhood while providing employment and housing opportunities and other needed services. The building will also feature a flexible multi-purpose room available to community groups within and outside typical business hours.

The final overhaul and modernization will include over 9000 square feet of retail and office space; over 5000 square feet for the institution’s partner tenant Neighborhood Housing Services; more than 7000 square feet of tenant space on its second floor; and a high-quality community meeting facility in its basement. The design and renovation were spearheaded by Brook Architecture a Chicago-based practice providing design services to public private and non-profit organizations. The firm is headed by RaMona Westbrook.

Its first tenant Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago Inc. (NHS) was welcomed this past July. NHS has a long-standing presence on Chicago’s South Side and setting up shop at the Seaway headquarters will allow them to widen their efforts to help low and moderate-income homeowners in the historic Chatham neighborhood.

The project would not have been possible without New Market Tax Credits (NMTCs) from the National Community Investment Fund (NCIF) a 501(c)(4) nonprofit investment fund that invests in mission-oriented banks and other financial institutions in order to increase access to services and catalyze economics in low-income and underserved communities; Benefit Chicago a collaborative effort to create jobs build wealth and tackle other social and economic challenges; and the Brownfields Program which provides grants and technical assistance to communities states tribes and others. U.S. Bank is serving as the equity investor.

Seaway plans to host an open house in May to welcome current and future members and borrowers community groups and more. Those interested in securing space within the new facility may contact Brika Eklund at [email protected]. Questions about the open house may be directed to [email protected]

Self-Help Federal Credit Union (CA IL WA WI)

Self-Help Federal Credit Union was chartered in 2008 to build a network of branches that serve working families and underserved communities. With 19 branches in California 6 branches in Washington 10 branches in Illinois and 1 branch in Wisconsin over $1.6 billion in assets and serving more than 99000 members Self-Help Federal is one of the fastest-growing low-income designated credit unions in the country. It is part of the national Self-Help family of non-profit organizations whose collective mission is to create and protect ownership and economic opportunity for all. For 41 years the Center for Community Self-Help and its affiliates have provided almost $10 billion in financing to help over 184000 low-wealth borrowers buy homes start and build businesses and strengthen community resources.

Cambodia has run a dual-currency system since United Nations peacekeepers arrived to oversee elections in 1993 bringing with them U.S. dollars which circulated in tandem with riel providing much-needed currency stability amid postwar reconstruction.

National Bank of Cambodia Governor Chea Chanto said in September that demand for the riel had increased an average of 16% a year for two decades with annual economic growth rates of 7.8% adding that fewer U.S. dollars in circulation would give the central bank greater control over the economy.

“I firmly believe all ministries institutions companies enterprises and those who actively participate in the process of developing the banking system promote the use of the riel which is our national currency” he said in January.

The central bank has introduced small- and large-denomination riel notes ranging from 100 to 100000 riel (about $25) but their arrival caused confusion and rumors among traders in the local markets that U.S. $1 and $5 notes had been banned.

That started a rush to offload dollars and prompted Prime Minister Hun Sen to step in and say “There is no prohibition like the rumors being spread.”

Targeting 'unbanked population'

Cambodia’s first digital currency Bakong is designed to allow payments between traditional banks and other financial institutions on smart phones and computers and was introduced late last year.

Developed by Japanese financial technology firm Soramitsu the government is hoping Bakong will bring the “unbanked population” -- about 70% of the population who never or rarely use a bank now -- into the banking system.

Bakong is also aimed at enabling the central bank to crack down on money laundering and the black economy and stabilize the riel in the absence of the U.S. dollars.

David Totten a financial analyst with Emerging Markets Consulting said Bakong would facilitate faster cheaper and more secure payments between clients of different financial institutions.

“The idea behind that is that it will facilitate more financial inclusion so more Cambodians will sign up for financial services” he said.

“That will facilitate the development of e-commerce and in the longer term it is hoped that that will encourage adoption of the riel and eventual replacement of the U.S. dollar for all financial transactions in Cambodia.”

A unique history

Money has a unique history in Cambodia with the riel introduced following independence in 1953 and an end to French colonialism.

Under the 1975-79 rule of the Khmer Rouge money was abandoned banks abolished and the central bank blown up as Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot tried to force an agrarian society on Cambodians resulting in a genocide that claimed about 2 million lives.

A dual currency economy also recalls the days when Cambodia was seen as an economic disaster and struggling to rebuild after a 30-year war that ended in 1998. It is that type of history that politicians and bureaucrats negotiating offshore investments would prefer to leave behind.

Brendan Lalor a director with Ernst & Young in Cambodia said the central bank had raised eyebrows by becoming the first central bank in the region to embrace a digital currency enabling Cambodians who work in the cities to send money back to the provinces at cheaper rates.

He said almost $60 billion was transferred within the country through different payment options in 2019 and the adoption of Bakong is “a very important development for the Cambodian economy.”

“What they’re trying to achieve with Bakong is to effectively bring all the currencies platforms the Apps etcetera e-payments e-wallets onto one platform that the central bank the NBC can control through the blockchain technology.

“Blockchain is basically like a ledger. It records all transactions and that will facilitate instantaneous transactions both for the payments of goods and services but also for transferring from one account to another” Lalor said.

Adding to a sense of urgency is the state of the Cambodian economy which has buckled under the COVID-19 pandemic and withdrawal of some trade perks by the European Union because of the country’s human rights record.

Chea Chanto also noted Cambodia holds international reserves of $20 billion more than the three-month minimum for developing countries. He was voted central banker of the Year Asia-Pacific for 2020 by the financial magazine The Banker.

“I am confident that we are on the right track to catch up quickly and with some pioneering infrastructure such as Bakong Cambodia is leading the region and even presents an example of a revolutionary payment platform led by a central bank on the global scene” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9mb3ItbWlubmVzb3RhLWhvdGVsLWluZHVzdHJ5LW5vcm1hbC1jb3VsZC1iZS1hLXllYXItb3ItbW9yZS1hd2F5LzYwMDAzMTA5MC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For Minnesota hotel industry normal could be a year or more away,"Jim Alderman was set to fly from North Carolina to Minnetonka a year ago to start his new role as chief executive of Radisson Hotel Group Americas when the phone rang.

""I got a call March 10 saying the governor was shutting the state because of COVID"" Alderman recalled. ""So on my very first day as CEO we closed the [headquarters] office and told everyone to come and take what they needed home.""

As COVID infections spread nationwide Radisson's guest bookings plummeted. ""By mid-March we took a real punch in the mouth. Business was down 80% overnight"" Alderman said. ""Devastating isn't enough of a word. ... God. It's been terrible.""

Radisson with 39 hotels in Minnesota and 613 in the Americas wasn't alone in being pummeled by COVID-19. Hotel owners nationwide are wishing hard for a recovery but few expect it will be swift even as vaccinations rise and state-imposed gathering restrictions loosen.

""The hospitality industry was hit extremely hard by this"" said St. Paul-based Hospitality Minnesota board Chairman Howard Anderson. ""We are hopeful we will get back to normal in 2022 or 2023.""

One billion hotel rooms went unsold helping ""2020 set a record for the worst performance by U.S. hotels"" according to a new report by hotel analytics firm STR. COVID-19's damage even surpassed the Great Recession which left 786 million hotel room nights unsold.

Last year U.S. hotel revenue plunged 49% as guests filled only 39% of all available rooms.

The Twin Cities has fared far worse. Hotel occupancy in the metro tumbled to 21% last year and dropped again — to 14% in January the state's Explore Minnesota agency reported.

Guest visits were so weak STR said Minneapolis and St. Paul hotels recorded ""the lowest occupancy among the Top 25 markets"" in 2020.

The hotel slowdown is expected to cost Minnesota about $173 million in lost state and local tax revenue for the year according to the American Hotel & Lodging Association and Oxford Economics. Few are surprised.

""We saw the cancellation of over 400 events"" in Minneapolis last year including the 2020 NCAA Division I wrestling championship that was supposed to bring 40000 fans to U.S. Bank Stadium in downtown said Melvin Tennant chief executive of the city tourism bureau Meet Minneapolis. ""For 2020 we saw devastation.""

Twelve of 47 Minneapolis hotels temporarily closed. While a majority have reopened it's unclear when the Crowne Plaza Northstar Delta Hotel Minneapolis Northeast Le Meridien Chambers and Sheraton Minneapolis Midtown might reopen their doors Tennant said.

Now as vaccination efforts begin to ramp up the area's open hotels still face an uphill climb.

The Intercontinental Hotel Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport received some financial assistance from the Metropolitan Airports Commission last spring and is currently negotiating for more.

Marriott and Hilton hotels both recently reported losing hundreds of millions of dollars to the pandemic.

Worker layoffs and furloughs flourish. Last year more than 116429 Minnesota leisure and hospitality workers lost their jobs to COVID including the 41100 shed in December the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) reported.

Still industry watchers said there are small signs of progress.

Hotels near Lake Superior and the North Shore report doing well. The half-built Courtyard by Marriott hotel that was burned by arsonists last year in downtown St. Paul is being rebuilt and will open this year.

Next year United Properties still expects to open Minneapolis' first five-star hotel — the Four Seasons — at Washington and Hennepin avenues in downtown.

Blocks away the Rand Tower hotel on S. 6th Street and Marquette Avenue just celebrated its Dec. 2 grand opening — after a $110 million renovation that converted the historic art deco office building into a hotel.

Business in December proved a dud but ""it's getting better. We've gotten creative"" said Rand co-owner Nick Peterson.

To pull in guests the 26-story Rand now offers private six-course dinners for up to six people with contactless ""knock and drop"" service.

It is catering intimate birthday parties for COVID-weary families and hosting themed whiskey-tasting nights.

The extra pamperings have helped nudging bookings above 25% some days. ""We are just plugging away"" Peterson said noting that he and his partners are prepared to ride out COVID's storm.

The Radisson Hotel Group temporarily shut 20% of its North American hotels last year ""because the occupancy was so low"" said CEO Alderman. All but 10 reopened but business is still off.

""January to be candid was a bit disappointing"" he said. Americans ceased traveling due to bad weather and worries about new coronavirus strains from England Brazil and South Africa.

Even so ""my crystal ball is so bright"" Alderman said. ""We're seeing some really good green shoots across our portfolio especially with last-minute bookings.""

He's thrilled the Radisson Blu Mall of America was 94% full Valentine's Day weekend. Destination places such as Duluth and the North Shore benefited as city dwellers dashed to rural areas and outdoor adventures.

Bookings in Duluth and at Radisson's rural Country Inn & Suites properties did much better its urban hotels he said.

""We are looking at very possibly the best six to seven months of travel starting from late May or June"" Alderman said. ""There are some people who will get out and will travel saying 'I can't take it anymore.' There's a lot of pent-up demand.""

Radisson Hotel Group is betting big he is right. It will soon open new hotels in Florida the Dominican Republic and Aruba.

Anderson who is also operations vice president of ZMC Hotels said his crystal ball is bit more ""murky.""

He expects lodging won't return to normal levels until late 2022 or 2023 — after most people are vaccinated and families feel safer venturing out.

Business is down 50% at the five hotels ZMC owns in Hibbing Duluth and Superior Wis.

The draw of Lake Superior as a COVID fatigue reliever is credited for preventing a steeper decline.

But full recovery will require more than a lake. It needs the return of Duluth's adored concerts festivals sporting events and firework displays Anderson said.

Tennant at Meet Minneapolis is also yearning for his city's ""demand drivers."" Events at U.S. Bank Stadium Target Field TCF Stadium Orchestra Hall and Hennepin Avenue and other venues typically draw 30 million-plus visitors a year. They will return he said.

""People are ready to get out"" Tennant said. ""We are [predicting ] a huge resurgence once that all-clear sign is given.""

A new report by the UK charity War on Want exposes how a core part of what sustains that occupation is a military judicial system characterised by violations of international law.

The report – Judge Jury and Occupier – is a deep dive into the diverse ways in which Palestinians’ rights are being violated – from arrest through interrogation conviction and jail time. It reflects the experiences of Palestinian lawyers and human rights groups. The prisoners’ rights organisation I lead Addameer was proud to contribute evidence.

One of the report’s important contributions is to make clear that despite the Oslo accords and establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA) for Palestinians in the West Bank there has been and remains no escape from Israel’s military judicial system.

Regardless of the existence of the PA penal code and judiciary which operate with limited autonomy in parts of the occupied territory all Palestinians wherever they reside in the West Bank remain subject to the jurisdiction of Israel’s military courts if they fall foul of certain laws.

The impact of this military judicial system is far-reaching and profoundly discriminatory.

Since 1967 for example Israel has decreed more than 411 Palestinian organisations illegal including all the major Palestinian political parties. Palestinian civilians are then prosecuted for “membership and activity in an unlawful association” a key tool in Israel’s repression of anti-occupation activism.

Public order offences meanwhile include the charge of “incitement” defined as any attempt “to influence public opinion … in a manner which may harm public peace or public order”. Palestinians can also be detained for “bringing into hatred or contempt or the exciting of disaffection against” authorities.

Other charges heard by the military courts include being in Israel illegally – that is those caught looking for work without a permit – as well as traffic violations. The latter accounts for some 40% of all Palestinians brought before the military courts each year.

The military judicial system is part of a “separate and unequal” reality. In contrast to Palestinians Israeli settlers arrested in the West Bank are tried in civilian courts inside Israel. Two populations two different legal systems – Israel’s largest human rights group is therefore right to call this a form of apartheid.

Within this wider discriminatory system there are specific and serious violations of international law.

One such violation is torture a method that the report documents is used routinely along with other cruel and degrading acts to extract confessions from Palestinians during interrogations (access to a lawyer can be denied for up to 60 days). These confessions are then used as the primary evidence to secure convictions in the military courts. One example of many is Tariq a school counsellor arrested in 2019 for allegedly being a member of a proscribed organisation; his ordeal included beatings stress positions and verbal abuse. Another transgression of the law concerns the fact that most Palestinian prisoners are held in prisons within Israel despite the fourth Geneva convention’s prohibition of the transfer of prisoners from the occupied territory into the occupying state.

All of this occurs within a system that – as I know from my own years of experience defending people in the military courts – cannot be “reformed” but rather must be abolished.

Any occupying power is obliged to act in the interests of the occupied population; Israel by contrast is violating Palestinians’ civil and political rights. In addition as UN special rapporteur Michael Lynk has laid out after half a century Israel’s “role as occupier … has crossed a red line into illegality”.

Britain has a particular role and responsibility. An important element of Israel’s military rule in the occupied West Bank is the Defence (Emergency) Regulations enacted by the British mandate in Palestine in 1945. Today the UK government approves the sale of weapons components and military technology to Israel as well as imports of Israeli-made military technology.

The report thus calls for the UK government to implement a two-way arms embargo and also urges the government to increase support for Palestinian human rights defenders and organisations.

Applying meaningful pressure on Israel to end its occupation and military judicial system is the necessary response to a historical wrong and a present injustice. For the Palestinian men women and children subjected to a Kafkaesque denial of their liberty this is not just necessary it is urgent."
UBER,Uber,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHk0OWVyLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDMvMDYvd29tZW4tYXQtcmlzay13aGVuLXVzaW5nLXViZXItb3ItbHlmdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Women at risk when using Uber or Lyft - Daily Forty-Niner,"A once-beloved transportation option frequented by bar-hoppers and partygoers rideshare services like Uber and Lyft have become the faces of thousands of sexual assault cases.

Initially deemed a safe way for women to get around as an alternative to drunk driving or walking home alone at night rideshare companies have been forced to address the harsh reality that drivers and passengers are both at risk when using these services.

According to AbuseLawsuit.com an organization that provides resources and support for survivors of sexual abuse and assault several characteristics of rideshare services put both drivers and riders in danger including a lack of sufficient safety features in comparison to taxis.

Since rideshare drivers operate using their own vehicles there often lacks plexiglass or plastic windows separating the front and back seats something that can act as a protective barrier between strangers.

Rideshare services also often operate during nights and weekends which tend to be times of high crime and features like Uber Pool that allow shared rides increase the risk of passenger-on-passenger assault.

Uber released a safety report in December of 2019 that revealed nearly 6000 sexual assault cases between 2017 and 2018. Of the reported cases 54% involved accused drivers and 45% involved accused passengers.

Rina Poh a fourth-year management major at Long Beach State said she had an experience with an Uber driver making sexual comments toward her which she said made her “uncomfortable.”

Women are more likely to be victims of sexual violence than men according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The organization found that Uber passengers made up 92% of victims of “non-consensual sexual penetration” between 2017 and 2018 and “female drivers are at risk of unwanted touching sexual violence or other acts of sexual misconduct.”

Isabelle Wang a first-year math education major at Long Beach State said she feels unsafe using rideshare services as getting into a stranger’s car is “frightening” and tries to remain alert during her trips.

During one of Wang’s “relatively uncomfortable” Uber trips the driver had explicit text messages visible on his phone from the backseat where she was seated.

“It has made me much more cautious when riding” Wang said. “[I] always hover over the ‘help’ button in case anything goes wrong.”

Among hundreds of lawsuits against Uber one from a woman in Oregon sued the company in January 2020 for over $1 million. According to the lawsuit the driver allegedly made sexual remarks touched her legs and sexually assaulted the woman after locking the back doors and forcing her to sit in the passenger seat.

Though the company has faced lawsuits due to sexual assault allegations since 2017 “little is known about these early lawsuits” AbuseLawsuit.com said because Uber “used mandatory arbitration clauses to settle claims of abuse” before 2018.

In May 2018 Uber eliminated its policy of mandatory arbitration which previously had customers consent to resolving any disputes outside of a court. This forced silence of victims according to AbuseLawsuit.com kept the public unaware of these cases and may have contributed to female passengers feeling a false sense of security when using rideshare services.

Uber has since implemented safety features such as mandatory background checks for drivers annual screenings for drivers’ criminal history verification of driver identification and most recently coronavirus-related regulations.

First-year pre-production major Lillian Li said she “doesn’t like the idea” of using rideshare apps.

“I’m a woman so being alone in a car alone with a stranger just seems straight up dangerous. It’s just not a chance I really want to take” Li said. “It’s just not something I’m comfortable with.”

The organization maintains that while companies like Uber have made steps in the right direction women must understand the risks of continuing to use rideshare services.

It is recommended that women avoid riding alone whenever possible especially when intoxicated and share their location and trip information with friends and family as well as sit in the back seat.

Wang said she makes sure to ride with someone she knows whenever possible to make herself feel more safe.

“I think it’s always good to stay cautious and aware for your your own safety” Wang said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aGlza2V5cmlmZi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8wNy9lbGRlcmx5LXNvdXRoZXJuLWNvdXBsZS11c2luZy11YmVyLWZvci10aGUtZmlyc3QtdGltZS1pcy10aGUtdHlwZS1vZi13aG9sZXNvbWUtY29udGVudC13ZS1uZWVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elderly Southern Couple Using Uber For The First Time Is The Type Of Wholesome Content We Need,"Marty and Ray thank you for this gem.

Identity theft may be to blame,"Zacharias 74 of Weston retired as a registered nurse 20 years ago. She doesn’t drive for Uber and never has.

But the documents also reported that Zacharias had earned $13807 as an Uber driver last year. And that was patently false.

The two “1099″ tax documents that arrived at Susan Zacharias’s home last month accurately stated her name address and the last four digits of her Social Security number.

As she read the documents which were generated and sent to her by Uber two thoughts sprang to mind: “Identity theft” and “Oh what a pain this is going to be to straighten out.”

Zacharias said her personal data were stolen by hackers who penetrated the US Office of Personnel Management in 2013 when her husband worked for the government. It was one of the biggest security breaches in history involving more than 20 million records.

Zacharias’s theory is that someone who actually did drive for Uber last year (and who did earn $13807 as an independent contractor) gave the ride-hailing giant her data when they applied to be a driver.

Zacharias thinks the would-be driver posed as her because they knew their own information would disqualify them due to a serious criminal conviction or poor driving record brought to light in a mandatory background check by Uber.

“It really worried me that someone possibly a felon was merrily driving around as me creating a potentially dangerous situation” Zacharias said.

Zacharias urgently attempted to contact Uber but her e-mails and calls went unanswered for weeks. Besides worrying about criminals tooling around as Uber drivers Zacharias wanted Uber to correct the tax documents to avoid the hassle of the Internal Revenue Service thinking she owed taxes on income she hadn’t earned.

Frustrated by Uber’s lack of response Zacharias contacted me. I reached Uber and explained the situation. A couple days later Uber said it had deactivated the Uber account of the person posing as Zacharias and said it was working on corrected filings to the IRS.

How many Uber drivers are out there using fake identities? Uber won’t say how many complaints like Zacharias’s it has received. But an accountant I talked with said these kinds of cases are cropping up with greater frequency among his clients and sent me a link to a Web page Uber set up for people who have received erroneous tax documents from the company. (The accountant said that page wasn’t easy to find on Uber’s website and indeed it wasn’t; I sent Zacharias the link to it.)

Identity theft is increasing rapidly in the United States according to a recent report from the Federal Trade Commission a consumer protection agency that serves as a clearinghouse for identity theft reports.

Last year almost 1.4 million cases were reported to the FTC more than double from the previous year and more than three times the number in 2018.

“Identity theft is a terrible crime” Uber said in a statement to me. “When we learn that an individual is fraudulently using the app we take immediate action including working with law enforcement. Uber is constantly updating and strengthening processes to protect against fraudsters’ ever-evolving schemes.”

Here are the steps you should take if your identity has been stolen or if you suspect it has as recommended by the FTC:

File a report with the FTC

The FTC won’t directly investigate your complaint but it will add it to the millions in its files. Investigators and prosecutors use the data to detect patterns and to prioritize targets.

The report you file on the user-friendly FTC website will give you an officially filed account of what happened that you can later furnish to companies and other government agencies as needed.

The FTC will also help you organize what it calls a “recovery plan.” (As an aside if you notice an unauthorized purchase on your credit card which was not the kind of identity theft Zacharias faced begin by calling your credit card company and tell them to freeze your accounts while you change your logins passwords and PINs).

In Zacharias’s case Uber failed to respond to her many attempts to contact it adding a lot of aggravation.

Alert the IRS

If the identity theft has tax implications let the IRS know by filling out and filing a simple one-page identity theft affidavit known as IRS form 14039. You may also consider obtaining from the IRS an “Identity Protection PIN” a six-digit number that prevents someone else from filing a tax return using your Social Security number.

Not everyone is eligible for an identity protection PIN. The IRS says you must be a “confirmed victim” of identity theft and have already resolved whatever issues the theft of your identity created for you with the IRS.

The IRS says on its website that “you must pass a rigorous identity verification process” to obtain an identity protection PIN.

Notify credit agencies

There are three tools available to protect you from having an identity thief open a new line of credit (loan or credit account) in your name: initial fraud alert extended fraud alert and credit freeze. All are free according to the FTC.

You can obtain a one-year initial fraud alert by contacting one of the three major credit bureaus TransUnion Equifax or Experian. That company must then alert the other two. When you have an initial alert on your credit report lenders must verify your identity before issuing new credit in your name.

An extended fraud alert also requires lenders to verify your identity before issuing new credit in your name but it remains in effect for seven years unless you have it removed sooner.

You can also opt for a credit freeze which is more drastic than a credit alert. It prohibits potential new creditors from accessing your credit history unless you first lift the freeze.

Notify the local police

You may be required to provide credit agencies with a police report in order to obtain a credit freeze or credit alert. The FTC recommends that you provide police with a copy of the identity theft report you filed with the FTC. You should also be prepared to provide a government-issued ID with a photo and proof of your address (mortgage statement rental agreement or utility bill).

This comes on the back of its partnership deal with Chinese auto manufacturer CIG Motors Co. Limited which will also establish a vehicle assembly plant in the state.

Recall that the Lagos government has in recent times been making efforts to crackdown on ride-hailing startups including Uber and Bolt. The moves hinted at the government’s ulterior motive of entering into the lucrative e-hailing market.

So far these are the facts we have gathered about the government’s Lagos Ride scheme as well as concerns raised by e-hailing driver-partners (Uber and Bolt drivers).

1000 SUVs to be Deployed in 6 Months

The Lagos state government has disclosed that a total of 1000 sports utility vehicles (SUVs) will be deployed under the scheme. These vehicles are expected to be unveiled in the next six months according to the government.

Source: Twitter/@followlasg

Going by this Lagos Ride vehicles may probably launch out on Lagos roads sometime in September 2021 other things being equal.

Social Intervention Scheme

Lagos Ride is one of the state’s social intervention programmes directed towards the provision of job opportunities and poverty alleviation for residents of the state as well as the empowerment of persons in underserved communities.

Also the government says it wants to “create a seamless multi-modal transportation system” through the scheme.

Hire Purchase Model

The Lagos Ride e-hailing service would operate a hire purchase model for drivers. Vehicles are owned by the government so drivers might be hired as employees until they complete payment for the vehicles and not independent contractors/partners.

Lagos state Governor Babajide Sanwoolu

According to the government the Cooperative Society in the Ministry of Wealth Creation and Employment would oversee the lease of the new SUVs to drivers for four years. During that entire period drivers would have to pay a monthly instalment fee.

What this could mean is that the government would charge a commission on drivers’ monthly total earnings as the state would expectedly hold the funds coming through. At the end of the four (4) years drivers can then complete an outright purchase of the vehicles.

Mobile App or Not?

The Lagos government describes its Lagos Ride service as an e-hailing taxi scheme. Therefore one may not be wrong to expect it to work with a web or mobile app. However there is no indication of the presence of an app yet.

Should it come with an app one wonders whether the app will be available to all interested drivers just like Uber and Bolt. If this were to be the case then any driver could register on the platform.

However it is also possible that the app is only accessible to the drivers whom the government leases the cars out to. What would then result is that only those who are selected by the state can drive with Lagos Ride.

Uber/Bolt Drivers React..

As regards the pending launch of Lagos Ride some Uber and Bolt drivers who spoke to Technext have expressed a number of concerns on issues such as regulation transparency and unfair competition.

Weighing their Concerns

It is only right that Uber and Bolt drivers are worried about potential draconian regulations which could further be enforced by the government. After all such regulations forced bike-hailing startups like Max ORide and Gokada out of business.

A Bolt driver who spoke on behalf of his colleagues said:

We had almost the same opinion. Some were scared they will put Uber/Bolt partners out of jobs as they did e-hailing bikes. Bolt Driver

“We believe the Vehicle Inspection Officers VIO and Lagos State Traffic Management Authority LASTMA will start targeting those of us who are yet to complete our car papers for e-hailing” he said.

He added that the government has asked drivers to get some extra documents costing N17000 without which they would not be able to work with Uber/Bolt. The Bolt driver was perhaps referring to the mandatory auto hackney permit (N15000) and Lagos State Drivers’ Institute (LASDRI) certification (N2000).

“Some of us have not done it because Uber/bolt has not made it mandatory” he said.

In a chat with Technext President of the National Union of Professional App-based Workers (NUPA-BW) Comrade Ibrahim Ayoade also echoed regulatory concerns:

We’re not sure how government wants to go about helping app-based drivers on the platform because they may introduce new regulations and policies that would favour them in the system. They may frustrate Uber/Bolt drivers out of market. Comrade Ibrahim Ayoade

Comrade Ibrahim Ayoade President of NUPABW

Ayoade goes on to talk about why the driver onboarding process for Lagos Ride may not be wholly transparent due to political interference.

“Our fear is how transparent the programme would be. Anything the government puts hand to is always hijacked by politicians without any knowledge of the particular business. Let me give you a typical example. During Fashola’s time as governor they gave out yellow cabs but today you don’t see most of those vehicles out again because of mismanagement.”

He then called for the government to engage the union before going ahead with the Lagos Ride scheme.

Lagos government should learn from previous mistakes and work with us to give good information about the gig economy. They are looking at the money that would come out of it but there is more to it.

The NUPA-BW boss however acknowledged that the scheme could still prove beneficial. He explained that e-hailing drivers would have more vehicles to work with and the competition could pressure Uber/Bolt to better support their driver-partners.

Meanwhile Bolt/Uber drivers have questioned whether the Lagos Ride scheme is sustainable. Many do not see the Chinese SUVs surviving Lagos roads stating that high vehicle maintenance costs and fuel consumption could drive up fares thereby reducing the market appeal to riders.

Ayoade agrees with this position stating that fares could be on the high side compared to Uber/Bolt which the bulk of riders may not be able to afford.

Going forward it remains to be seen how the Lagos Ride scheme will eventually play out."

As the pandemic drags on big chains like Target and Nordstrom are looking for ways to keep consumers coming back to their stores.

One go-to strategy is the store-within-a-store concept. It’s a way for one retailer to join forces with another by setting up a pop-up shop within their stores.

Industry analysts say the approach has benefits for both parties. For instance department store Kohl’s (KSS) is adding as many as 200 Sephora mini shops inside of its stores in 2021 as a way to expand its beauty and cosmetics category. For Sephora the deal helps the retailer expand its market to Kohl’s (KSS) shoppers.

Meanwhile Target is opening mini Apple shops in a handful of its stores as it strives to become a one-stop shop to meet all of its consumers’ needs.

“From Sephora co-locating in Kohl’s to Apple in Target stores these collaborations bring complementary customer traffic and added income especially for the host retailer” said Burt Flickinger III managing director of Strategic Resource Group. It’s also a way to get shoppers to visit stores more frequently he said.

“For stores like Kohl’s or Nordstrom shoppers maybe go once a month or once a quarter. By adding a store-in-a-store now you can get a Kohl’s shopper returning more often for their beauty and cosmetics needs” said Flickinger.

A number of merchants have already joined forces. Here are a few of the most recent “shop-in-shop” collaborations:

Nordstrom welcomes mini shops for this $2995 home gym

Nordstrom is debuting tonal mini shops in March in a handful of its department stores. Kimberly White/Nordstrom

Nordstrom and at-home fitness startup Tonal have teamed up to launch a handful of Tonal mini shops inside Nordstrom stores.

The Tonal-branded pop-up stores are debuting this month in 40 Nordstrom locations across 20 states. The 50-square-foot shops will be located in the women’s activewear department.

Nordstrom said shoppers can see a demo of the gym or try a workout for themselves.

The home gym from San Francisco-based Tonal mounts to the wall like a flat screen television and uses “digital weights” where the resistance is personalized. The startup is backed by a slew of investors and athletes including Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors.

Industry analysts said the crossover appeal of this partnership is a good fit for consumers because Tonal’s pricey gyms could entice fans of Nordstrom a chain considered to be high-end among its department store peers. The partnership also comes at a time when Nordstrom is battling sales declines and adapting its strategy to changing consumer preferences.

“Retailers right now are looking for ways to boost customer traffic” said Robert Passikoff a retail industry expert and founder of consulting firm Brand Keys. “The Nordstrom (JWN)-Tonal partnership makes sense because it fits well with the customers of both brands. For Tonal it’s a very smart way to get its products in front of more consumers because everyone knows Nordstrom (JWN) so it will benefit from this sense of borrowed equity.”

Sephora and Kohl’s make up a deal for beauty

Kohl's

Makeup sales have been walloped by the pandemic. But that’s not stopping Sephora from adding more stores outside of struggling malls.

Sephora is set to open mini shops inside Kohl’s (KSS) stores with the first 200 locations debuting in fall of 2021.

The partnership with Kohl’s will replace an earlier one that Sephora struck with JCPenney that is slated to end in the next few years.

For Kohl’s the collaboration allows it to attract younger consumers with wider array of beauty products and prices.

“Beauty is an area where Kohl’s is currently underdeveloped so it doesn’t capture much spend from shoppers who are already in its stores” said Neil Saunders retail industry analyst and managing director of GlobalData. “Adding a Sephora automatically resolves this issue and it also makes Kohl’s a more interesting destination which may help to drive foot traffic.”

From Sephora’s perspective Saunders said Kohl’s provides access to many off-mall locations where Sephora is currently underrepresented.

Kohl’s expects to have as many as 850 “Sephora at Kohl’s” shops in its stores by 2023 as well as an online shop later this year.

Call it a Mac mini

A concept rendering of the new Apple destination rolling out in select Target locations. Target

Target is opening scaled-down versions of Apple stores at some of its US locations this year.

Target (TGT) said an “enhanced Apple shopping experience” is rolling out to 17 stores in the coming months with redesigned sections that include new lighting and displays for shoppers to experiment with an expanded assortment of Apple products.

Target is also updating Apple (AAPL)’s product page on its app and website. Customers will still need to visit an actual Apple (AAPL) store for product repairs.

Target is rolling out the new Apple mini-stores at five locations in Texas and four in Florida with the remaining scattered across various states including New York Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. The new Apple sections will be added to more Target stores in the coming years.

It’s the latest high-profile partnership Target has struck as it continues to evolve into a one-stop destination for customers who are increasingly looking to avoid shopping at malls.

Sephora’s rival Ulta has its own Target

Ulta Beauty is debuting its mini cosmetics shops inside of Target stores in 2021.

As with Sephora’s mini shops in Kohl’s this deal is expected to help Ulta (ULTA) which sells a mix of drugstore beauty and pricey brands that aren’t normally found in big box stores reach younger and more budget-conscious consumers.

For Target it expands the retailer’s growing beauty business with new brands it didn’t carry before.

The 1000 square-foot mini shops will initially launch in 100 Target locations and on Target.com and then ramping up to several hundred Target stores.

“The benefit for Ulta is increased exposure. Ulta has an incredibly successful track record and before the pandemic was posting consistently strong growth” said Saunders.

After starting the week on a positive note benchmark indexes S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average withdrew and slipped to a one-month low before ending the last session. They were down 1.34% and 1.11% respectively early Friday. Earlier sentiment had improved after jobless claims came in below economists’ forecast.

After a relatively quiet period consolidations seem to be making a comeback. Continuing its acquisition spree Accenture clinched at least four deals this week with the buyout of UK-based talent consultancy Cirrus Logic topping the list.

The professional services firm also agreed to buy Brazil-based robotics solutions provider Pollux and Australian logistics consultancy GRA. The other business that joined the Accenture fold is technology solutions provider REPL Group.

Agilent Technologies agreed to acquire Resolution Bioscience for $695 million while Taco Bell owner Yum! Brands bought artificial intelligence provider Kvantum. The other key deals include Digital Turbine’s purchase of Israel-based mobile advertising company Triapodi Ltd and the $1.45-billion acquisition of UK-based Capco by Indian software giant Wipro.

Once again retailers dominated the earnings scene with department store operators Kohl’s and Target Corp. publishing their latest statistics on Tuesday followed by discount chain Dollar Tree on Wednesday. The next day Kroger Company and warehouse giant Costco Corp. delivered mixed results for their most recent quarters amid tough-year-over comparison.

Chipmaker Broadcom’s first-quarter report was the other major announcement of the week. As Wall Street approaches the fag end of the earnings season Oracle’s third-quarter financial report is probably the most-awaited announcement next week — scheduled for March 10.

Prior to that H&R Block and Dick’s Sporting Goods are expected to report on March 9. As the week progresses Ulta Beauty will be unveiling fourth-quarter numbers on March 11.

I used to beg my mom to buy me magazines that were basically just pictures so I could cut out the makeup looks hang them on my door and fantasize about being a teenager who wore chokers and frosted lipstick—not the dorky 8-year-old I was. I was too young to actually rock the ’90s makeup trends myself but looked up to celebs (hi Spice Girls!) who were pushing boundaries with their strong makeup looks.

To make my dream of being a ’90s icon come true I decided to re-create iconic beauty looks to see if they’d hold up. According to Janice Kinjo a New York-based groomer and celebrity makeup artist the ’90s were all about overly plucked thin eyebrows brick-brown lipstick lined with a dark brown lip liner. Frosty lip gloss was paired with frosty eyeshadow.

I wasn’t so committed to this project that I’d pluck my eyebrows (I made that mistake back in the early ’00s) but I decided to go hard on the matte and frosted trends that dominated the era.

Trend: Too-light foundation with blue-grey shadow

Kinjo did her best to explain this unexplainable trend Angelina Jolie rocked in 1998. “The ’90s were influenced by the grunge/goth look so having a lighter/white foundation was accepted” she said. “However people with darker complexion didn’t have many options for foundations and powders therefore makeup looked gray.” It seems people also didn’t know about a thing called flashback.

To get my complexion this light I mixed the Manic Panic Dreamtone Flawless White Liquid Foundation ($13.95 at Amazon ) with my It Cosmetics CC+ Cream in Light ($39.50 at Ulta). Can you imagine being as beautiful as Angelina Jolie and letting your makeup artist do this to your face for the red carpet?

For my eyes I used About-Face Matte Fluid Eye Paint in Matte Midnight Blue ($24 at About-Face). I put a few dots on my lids and tapped them upwards with my finger. Then I dabbed the shade Lava Stone from the KKW Beauty Crystalized Eyeshadow Palette ($45 at KKW Beauty) to intensify the matte effect. I finished with black eyeliner for the wings.

My favorite part of the look was using my most-complimented lip shade the ultra-affordable Wet N’ Wild Megalast Matte Lip Color in Mochalicious ($2.59 at Target). I dabbed some highlighter in the middle of my lips for that frosty effect.

Trend: Cut-crease and nude lips

The iconic cut-crease eyeshadow look on Naomi Campbell was created by celebrity makeup artist of the ’90s Kevin Aucoin. Although it’s decidedly the most adaptable for today’s trends it wasn’t easy to create and it took me a few times to get it right. You’ll probably find the trend easier if you’re already a cut-crease pro.

First I used the shade Buzzing from the KKW Beauty Matte Honey Pressed Powder Palette ($45 at KKW Beauty) all over my eyelids up to my brows. Then I applied the darker brown color Stung on the top half of my eye only blending upwards. With makeup remover on a cotton swab I created an exaggerated cut in each crease before filling it in with more of the lighter shade to set the contrast.

Kinjo has an alternative method that’s a little easier. “Cut crease placement and shape can be confusing since all of our eyes are shaped differently” she says. “The simplest method for me is to line your eyes a little bit thicker than you normally would furrow brows and then look up eyes to the ceiling.” This transfers your eyeliner to your eyelid naturally and voilà—cut crease line.

Continuing the ’90s contrast I lined my lips with KKW Beauty Honey 3 Lip Liner ($12 at KKW Beauty) and used the same shade to create a fake beauty mark. I filled in my lips with the shade Honey 1 a lighter nude lipstick. I finished by dusting my cheeks with KKW Beauty Honey Blush in Honey Pot ($24 at KKW Beauty).

Trend: White eyeshadow and glossy lips

Because contouring wasn’t a trend in the ’90s this look favored by Reese Witherspoon in 1997 made me feel like my face looked round. Even though I don’t contour on the regular I do cut my cheekbones with blush that brings my bone structure upwards. But the ’90s was about putting blush on the apples of your cheeks which I felt instantly transformed me into an 8-year-old.

For that ultra-light eyeshadow I grabbed the About-Face Matte Fluid Eye Paint in White Noise ($24 at About-Face). The formula is easy to blend all over your entire lid and stays put once dry. I lined the corners of my eyes and on my lower lashline About-Face Pearly Shadow Stick in Pearly Cloud Blue ($21 at About-Face).

Since faux eyelashes were less popular in the ’90s I applied just a coat of No7 The Full 360 Mascara ($10 at Target). I completed the look with Paint-It Matte Lip Color in Ask Nicely ($22 at About-Face) and swiped Lime Crime Wet Cherry Lip Gloss ($18 at Ulta) on top for that juicy look.

And yes I had a tattoo choker at the ready to complete my look. Maybe I’m not so far off from a ’90s teen after all."

The training was conducted by the Jamaica Business Development Corporation (JBDC) under the Organisation of African Caribbean and Pacific States-European Union (OACPS-EU) Development Minerals Programme Phase II.

Among the areas covered by the training were how to build a successful enterprise formulating a detailed business and quarry plan preparing business proposals to access financing knowledge sharing.

The Development Minerals Programme is financed by the EU and the United Nations Development Programme and implemented by UNDP.

It aims to build the profile improve the management of and foster better livelihoods for people working along the development minerals value chain in countries like Jamaica that are a part of the OACPS.

Development minerals include industrial and construction materials dimension stones and semi-precious stones.

Director of Mineral Economics and Development at the Ministry of Transport and Mining Dennis Miller in his address at the virtual closing ceremony on March 4 noted that the training will help to achieve the programme’s goal of enhancing business skills in the development of the minerals sector.

He commended the course participants and urged them to use the skills learned to grow their operations.

Chief Executive Officer of the JBDC Valerie Veira said that the agency is committed to helping businesses to survive and prosper through the provision of technical and business support services.

“We are proud of this initiative. We would like to use Jamaica as an example to other countries in the Caribbean and small islands in the Pacific to promote a better mining sector” he said.

For his part UNDP Resident Representative to Jamaica Denise Antonio noted that the programme has strengthened the capacity of the beneficiaries to manage development in the sector in a sustained way “in order to unleash its potential and move to the next level.”

Deputy Head of the EU Mission to Jamaica Fredrick Ekfeldt said that the programme is “a good example of how the nation can maximise its resources while adapting to socio-economic changes and respecting the environment.”

In his remarks President of the Jamaica Bankers Association Jerome Smalling in his remarks said that the organisation “stands ready to support the sector towards sustainable growth.”

UAL,United Airlines Holdings,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzA2L3doeS1hcmUtdGhlcmUtY292aWQtcmVzdHJpY3Rpb25zLW9uLWFyZW5hcy1idXQtbm90LXBsYW5lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I'm outraged by United Airlines' COVID policy after a jam-packed flight,"I knew going on vacation during a pandemic wasn’t the smartest thing to do. I risked coming into close contact with strangers on TSA lines and baggage carousels. I understood Florida restaurants could be overcrowded and under-regulated the golf courses lawless the pools too populated the casinos virtual coronavirus petri dishes.

What I didn’t realize was how a greedy airline would exponentially increase my risk of dying from COVID-19 with the full blessing of my government.

I had originally booked a vacation to a Caribbean beach and golf resort. The Bahamian government seemed to be effectively mitigating risk by having all travelers produce a negative COVID test result before flying there and get tested again upon arrival at the resort. But the CDC still listed the country as a Level 3 risk — nonessential travel not recommended — so I canceled.

There was always Florida just left of the Bahamas and with fewer conch fritters.

The CDC and FAA had little to say about air travel to the Sunshine State; no negative test results or even temperature-taking were required. Just sign an easy form on your phone saying you don’t have symptoms promise to social distance and to quarantine once you’re back yadda yadda. The complete lack of urgency was almost comforting.

But clues that the skies would not be so friendly began arriving in text messages from the airline saying it expected a “fuller flight” and that I could change to “other flight options” at no extra charge.

The CDC and FAA have little to say about domestic air travel right now despite the ongoing pandemic. Getty Images

The airline text didn’t actually point to or give data on these less-crowded flights. And I would have to cancel my weekend flights to presumably book a midweek nighttime route. I’m sure people back at the hedge fund wouldn’t mind me taking a few extra days with no notice. If I worked at a hedge fund.

So onward I marched through Newark-Liberty’s Terminal C.

The waiting area was my first warning to turn back. No chairs were roped off for social distancing and my friend was immediately asked by an older woman if she could sit next to him. Nice that she was polite but couldn’t Typhoid Mary see the row of empty seats across the way?

Common sense eroded further once we boarded the Embraer aircraft with its 24 rows of four seats two on each side of a center aisle.

Every seat was filled.

Apparently six feet of social distancing is a foreign concept in the deadly skies. You had people sitting at most two feet in front of you two feet in back of you and one person inches to the side of you. You would have had more room on a rush-hour rickshaw in downtown Mumbai.

In New York City right now you can’t stand at a bar and restaurants must operate at only 35 percent of capacity. Madison Square Garden with its 150-foot-high rafters can fill only 10 percent of its seats — and every fan must have proof of a negative COVID test. Even cavernous outdoor stadiums are being held to a 10-percent (or less) limit right now.

But in this flying aluminum beer can where non-screened passengers would be breathing the same communal air for three hours seemingly not a thought was given to cutting capacity. With a plane half full they could have alternated rows of empty seats and doubled the space between passengers.

Maybe I’ve been living in Cuomo-land too long but I was stunned to learn the government allows this. It’s every airline for themselves. A few have limited capacity. But many like United fully book flights. I understand the airlines are bleeding money and need customers. I also know they are about to get another $14 billion in taxpayer cash in the latest COVID bill their third bailout in a year. They can afford to fly with fewer fannies in the seats for a little while longer.

While arenas like Madison Square Garden only allows 10 percent capacity there are no such restrictions on airports. Getty Images

United says blocking off seats is only a “public relations strategy — not a safety strategy” and it is instead focused on enforcing mask-wearing and disinfecting planes with “hospital-grade” cleaners.

That didn’t improve passengers’ peace of mind. We sat in our casket-like seats afraid to move about the cabin scared to cough terrified to hear a sneeze and eyeing each other suspiciously. Is that girl’s mask slipping under her nostrils? The guy with the goatee doesn’t seem to have a proper seal. You could practically hear the Xanax bottles popping.

The good news is that most commercial jets have pretty good air filtering and circulation systems. Powerful fans and high-efficiency particulate absorbing (HEPA) filters “are 99.9 percent effective” in removing particulate contaminants such as COVID-19 experts say.

The bad news: That filter won’t do much when Mike from Massapequa sneezes his sagging Metallica mask failing to catch all of the 30000 droplets — potentially carrying 200 million virus particles traveling at 200 mph — from his nose to your neck.

Paul McPolin is The Post’s deputy Sunday editor and is known to travel only as far as his Super Bowl pool winnings will take him. After vacation he finally got his second vaccine shot.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Just a few years after the Girl Scouts were founded by Juliette Gordon Low in 1912 the tradition of troops selling cookies began. The first Girl Scout cookies were sold by the Mistletoe Troop in Muskogee Oklahoma in 1917 — the scouts baked cookies and sold them in a high school cafeteria as a service project according to the Girl Scouts official website. Several other troops began baking and selling cookies throughout the ’20s and ’30s and in 1935 the Girl Scout Federation of Greater New York raised money through the sale of commercially baked cookies for the first time. The following year the national Girl Scout organization began the process of licensing the first commercial bakers to produce cookies that would be sold nationwide by troops.

Now selling cookies has become a Girl Scout tradition with people all over the country clamoring to get their hands on a box of Thin Mints or Samoas. This year’s prices range from $5 to $6 a box — each local Girl Scout council sets their own pricing based on factors that include ingredients market size and shipping costs so prices may vary by region CNBC reported — but those first Girl Scout cookies were sold for just a quarter. Take a look at Girl Scout cookie prices throughout the years.

School Party Gifts and Food

1920s: 25 to 35 Cents per Dozen

In July 1922 The American Girl magazine published by Girl Scouts of the USA featured the first official Girl Scout cookie recipe. The recipe was created by Florence E. Neil a local director in Chicago who approximated the cost of the simple sugar cookies to be 26 to 36 cents for six to seven dozen cookies.

Throughout the 1920s Girl Scouts around the U.S. baked their own versions of the sugar cookie and sold them door-to-door for 25 to 35 cents per dozen according to the official Girl Scouts website.

1933: 23 Cents per 44 Cookies

The next reported cookie price was actually a decrease from the previous decade. According to the official Girl Scouts website in 1933 the Girl Scouts of Greater Philadelphia Council baked cookies and sold them in the city’s gas and electric company windows for 23 cents per box of 44 cookies. They also sold six boxes for $1.24.

In November 2015 the Girls Scouts of Eastern Massachusetts announced that cookie prices would be increasing 25% to $5 per box CNBC reported. The Girl Scouts of California’s Central Coast also raised their prices from $4 to $5 that year. Some local councils in other parts of California and Hawaii had already raised their prices to $5.

“The council sees the increase as an opportunity to offset natural price increases for running the cookie program — from the cost of raw materials and bakery production to transportation” Tammy Gentry vice president of marketing for the Girl Scouts of California’s Central Coast told CNBC.

Long revered for its unpredictability and deep roster of potential race winners the Estenson Racing prodigy grew into a virtually unstoppable force during his first full season as a professional winning eight of 15 races and running away with the title.

Still just 17 years old and not technically old enough to graduate to twin-cylinder competition Daniels will be back to defend the #1 plate in 2021. But even though he should only continue his stratospheric trajectory as a rider he’s got a target on his back big enough to be seen from outer space and his rivals are salivating at the prospect of a rematch.

Daniels said “I guess you could say there's a little bit of pressure just because no one has ever won back-to-back Singles titles at least since AFT took over the series. But to be honest this is only my second pro year. I'm only 17. In my opinion I still have a lot to learn and a lot of room to grow and improve. Last year was obviously awesome and we got the championship but I think we can be much better in 2021.

“I've been training pretty hard. I spent the first part of the winter down at Johnny Lewis' and trained there for a little bit. And then I was able to move to Palm Coast which is real close to Daytona Beach and train with JD Beach Kolby Carlile and Davis Fisher. I stayed in a rental house and learned from them. They're all obviously in really good shape. And then I was able to go to the motocross track and ride with Briar Bauman and Jared Mees -- obviously the top athletes of our sport. I feel more prepared than I've ever been.”

When asked if he could point to a rider or two that he saw as his biggest competition heading into the new season Daniels was stumped (“It's really hard to pinpoint one guy. The class is so stacked.”).

Instead he went down the list of what is unquestionably a talent-laded roster.





The Veterans

Photo: Red Bull KTM Factory Race Team



Max Whale (No. 18 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-F)

“Max is a top-notch rider and he’s going to be on top-notch equipment with top-notch people behind him over at Red Bull KTM Factory Racing. Even though he finished second in the championship last year we didn't race together all that much -- I never found myself in a big battle with him other than Springfield and DAYTONA a little bit. But when he came over to the States his last year in Amateur Nationals and I was able to race with him quite a bit. He's obviously got a few more years of AFT under his belt now and he's grown tremendously. He's going to be even tougher now that he's with the factory KTM team.”









Henry Wiles (No. 17 American Honda/United Rentals CRF450R)

“With riders like Wiles the AFT Singles class isn't a stepping stone any more -- it's a full-on Expert class. He's the winningest TT rider in the history of our sport. Henry is obviously tough no matter the bike or the team... He's an outstanding dirt tracker and he'll make it work. I think he'll be even better this year growing with the Honda team and getting more notes.

“(Peoria) I think will be fun. Henry has obviously shown that he knows what he's doing there and he's got some secrets. I'm just looking to go there and learn and treat it like any other race. Obviously I want to win and I won there in 2019 and got my first professional win. If I had to guess I'd say that's going to be a really tough race against Henry for sure.”









Mikey Rush (No. 15 Estenson Racing Yamaha YZ450F)

“Mikey was doing really well at the beginning of the year but right in the middle of the season he started having some problems with his body that set him back a little bit. And obviously he had a mechanical problem at the Indy Mile and crashed at Springfield. All that set him back but he's going to be tough this season. He's got more notes and he's been doing a lot of testing and training this offseason. He's another one just like Henry -- a really good athlete who's won Grand Nationals. Those guys are tough every time the green flag drops.”









Morgen Mischler (No. 13 Roof Systems DFW/Duffy Fleet Services KTM 450 SX-F)

“If you look back Morgen's been in the mix for a long time. He's got a lot of racecraft especially on the big clay ovals. I'm pretty sure he's with the same team again this year so they'll continue to grow. He'll be tough on the type of tracks he excels at. I'm pretty sure we'll see some more good races between him and me like we did last year.”









Shayna Texter-Bauman (No. 52 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-F)

“Unfortunately she had a down year. All of us have had bad races bad years or whatever. I don't think it's the end of Shayna or anything like that. She'll bounce back and she'll be a contender like she was in 2019. 2020 was kind of a weird season for all of us including me winning the title. I think there's a bit of an asterisk next to my name since we didn't have any TTs or anything. I want to go out there and win the championship with the schedule a little more back to normal. She'll be tough like always.”





The Rising Stars





Trent Lowe (No. 48 Suzuki Motor of America/WBR RM-Z450)

“I grew up racing against Trent Lowe since we were on 65s along with Jeremiah Duffy who races Production Twins now. I've raced with him for a long long time. Trent has now joined Wally Brown Racing on the Suzuki. That's a really good bike and a really good team. Trent is a good rider and I think he had a few podiums last year. He'll continue to get better and better.”









Brandon Kitchen (No. 105 Husqvarna Motorcycles/Vance & Hines)

“It took Brandon a little while to get out of his local district when he was an Amateur. The only time I really raced with him was our last year in Amateur Nationals in 2018. He’s now on Husqvarnas still kinda doing it himself like he has been but he's been improving constantly. I expect after winning a race last year he'll be a top-five championship contender in 2021.”









Trevor Brunner (No. 21 American Honda/United Rentals CRF450R)

“I raced with him a little bit on 80s and 250s. It took him a little while to get out of his district as well but once he did I raced with him at Amateur Nationals every year. He's on the Honda team with some really good guys behind him and some good motorcycles. He showed what he could do last year as a rookie. It’s kind of funny; I think as a rookie he won his sixth race and I won my sixth race and we both finished 11th in points and got Rookie of the Year. We had pretty much the same rookie season. So I expect him to be another tough competitor along with his teammates (Wiles and Cole Zabala).









Kody Kopp (No. 143 Smartop/Jones Honda/Latus Motors CRF450R)

“Obviously Kody with his dad being Joe Kopp he's no slouch. Years ago I spent some time with him. My dad worked for factory Triumph and we went and stayed at their house and stuff. I watched Kody come up through the Amateur ranks on 250s 450s and now turning professional. It's funny -- I remember my dad telling me when I was a little kid beating some of the older pro guys he'd say ‘Someday you're going to have to race against yourself and you're going to have a little guy coming to beat you.’ It’s not quite like that -- Kody is only a year younger than me but I kind of see myself in him in some ways. He goes to some of these races and just cleans house. He's going to be tough for sure and he's on a good bike with a good team behind him.”





The List Goes On…

Jared Lowe (No. 243 Lowe Racing/Babylon Racing Honda CRF450R)

Ian Wolfe (No. 157 I.S.W. Racing/Shelly Smith & Sons Towing Honda CRF450R)

Jacob Cascio (No. 121 Jackson Rancheria/Cascio Racing Yamaha YZ450F)

Hunter Bauer (No. 124 NKR Canada/Waters Autobody Racing KTM 450 SX-FFE)

Aiden RoosEvans (No. 26 Waters Autobody Racing KTM 450 SX-FFE)

Ryan Wells (No. 94 1st Impressions Race Team Honda CRF450R)

Tanner Dean (No. 38 1st Impressions Race Team Honda CRF450R)

“It's good to see because we have quite a few rookies coming in -- Jared Lowe Ian Wolfe Jacob Cascio Hunter Bauer who’s a fast kid from Canada -- it's good for the sport to see the young talent coming in in big groups like there are.

“You’ve also got Aiden RoosEvans moving to Waters Autobody -- they'll be a good effort. 1st Impressions is now turning into a real strong Singles team having two riders the caliber of Ryan Wells and Tanner Dean and good bikes. And I'm definitely forgetting some because there are just so many riders who could win a race.”





Dallas Daniels (No. 1 Estenson Racing Yamaha YZ450F)

“On Facebook everybody is like ‘This guy is on a new bike he's going to be tough and this guy is on a new team this guy has a new mechanic…’ But to be honest everybody gets better every single year. We all get faster and faster. All I can do is worry about my program and do everything I can to make myself a top-notch rider and try to defend my title. If I worry about all these other guys by the time I figure it out it'll be too late. So I just make sure my body and my mind are prepared and everything else will come.”

The biosphere includes Elk Island National Park as well as several provincial parks and protected areas east of Edmonton some of which you might not have heard about.

Cooking Lake-Blackfoot Provincial Recreation Area

""We are seeing an enormous increase in usership"" says Alison Cole visitor experience coordinator with Alberta Environment and Parks.

More people are discovering the Cooking Lake-Blackfoot Provincial Recreation Area east of Edmonton which contains 170 kilometres of trails for cross-country skiing snowshoeing mountain biking and horseback riding Cole says.

You can see more from the Cooking Lake-Blackfoot Provincial Recreation Area on Monday at 11 a.m. on CBC TV and CBC GEM.

""During this COVID pandemic we've seen an incredible growth in visitation"" she says.

Visits to the recreation area have doubled with an average of 2600 vehicles entering in August alone Cole says.

""They're coming out; they're discovering it; they're falling in love with it.""

Smith Blackburn Homestead

Located in Lamont County this 30-hectare site east of Elk Island National Park is filled with walking trails in a mix of forest and wetlands.

This area opened to the public in the fall of 2020 and is managed by the Edmonton and Area Land Trust (EALT).

The Smith Blackburn Homestead is an important spot for many bird species and like the rest of the biosphere holds historic and traditional significant for the Cree Ojibway Saulteaux Nakota Sioux and Blackfoot.

Golden Ranches

Golden Ranches Conservation Area includes a mixture of mature aspen forest and open grassland.

This property is managed by several partners including the Nature Conservancy of Canada EALT Alberta Conservation Association Ducks Unlimited Alberta Fish and Game Beaver Hills Biosphere Reserve Association and Strathcona County.

The 1400 acres started as a working ranch in 1950 but about a decade ago the owners decided to sell to the partnership so the area could be open to the public for hiking geocaching and birding.

Strathcona Wilderness Centre

Cross-country skiers love the Strathcona Wilderness Centre at 52535 Range Road 212 in Ardrossan. Right now the trails the disc golf course and equipment rentals are open. You will need to leave the dog and bikes at home.

Miquelon Lake Provincial Park

Unlike the Cooking Lake-Blackfoot Provincial Recreation Area a day-use area with no camping Miquelon Lake Provincial Park has a campground with 273 spots for RVs or tents which you need to book ahead.

Tip: Check the Monday and Tuesday before the weekend for last-minute cancellations.

Miquelon Lake is part of the Beaver Hills Dark Sky Preserve and is a nice spot to watch the stars.

Elk Island National Park

Star gazing is also a part of the programming at this national park.

Of course the bison which are particularly active in July and August are a huge draw but there are also elk deer and more than 250 bird species.

At Elk Island National Park there's a beach boardwalk canoe launch playground and picnic areas. The campsite has 75 non-serviced sites 15 walk-in sites and five oTENTiks if you're looking for a little glamping.",,,,,,,,,

Policy responses to the financial and economic crisis exacerbated existing gaps in health coverage but reforms introduced in 2019 are closing these gaps and addressing other long-standing health system problems. Informed by evidence the reforms are expected to reduce unmet need and financial hardship. They represent a major step towards universal health coverage.

Gaps in coverage before the financial crisis

The health system in Cyprus has always relied heavily on out-of-pocket payments which reflects a large gap in population coverage low levels of public spending on health persistent budget and capacity constraints in public facilities fragmented service delivery and a large and underregulated market for privately provided health services.

Austerity aggravated underlying problems

Before the crisis Cyprus was one of only two or three countries in Europe to base entitlement to publicly financed health care on income. In 2013 in response to the financial crisis the government restricted the basis for entitlement even further linking it to payment of social security contributions as well as income. As a result the share of the population without public coverage rose from 15% to 25%. The government also increased user charges (co-payments) and reduced public spending on health. These policies increased waiting times encouraged health staff to move from public to private facilities and shifted health care costs onto households at a time of rising unemployment poverty and income inequality. Between 2009 and 2015 the share of people experiencing unmet need for health and dental care grew and the number of households with catastrophic health spending doubled.

Post-crisis reforms aim to transform the health system

After the crisis in 2019 the government began to implement the long-debated General Health System (GHS). To shorten waiting times improve care quality and reduce out-of-pocket payments the GHS strengthens the role of the national purchasing agency (the Health Insurance Organization) in buying services from both public and contracted private providers.

The GHS has also introduced major improvements in coverage policy changing the basis for entitlement from income and payment of contributions to residence which allows all legal residents to be covered for the first time; simplifying and reducing user charges; and reinforcing protection mechanisms – there is now an annual cap on all co-payments for everyone with a more protective cap for children people receiving the guaranteed minimum income and pensioners with a low income.

“This is the biggest reform since independence not only because it ensures the whole population is covered and will reduce waiting times for patients but primarily because it minimizes out-of-pocket payments and offers significant financial protection to all beneficiaries” said Marios Kouloumas President of the Pancyprian Federation of Patients Associations and Friends which represents all the patient organizations in Cyprus.

Greater public investment in health is needed to sustain progress towards universal health coverage

The 2019 reforms bolstered Cyprus’s ability to meet the health and economic challenges of COVID-19. A key test now once again in difficult circumstances is whether the government can continue to secure public investment in the health system and keep the reform agenda on track. Reducing fragmentation lowering waiting times and improving access quality and financial protection will require steady growth in public spending on health and continued effort to strengthen the purchasing of health services.

WHO supports countries to move towards universal health coverage – leaving no one behind

Financial protection is at the heart of universal health coverage which means that everyone can use the quality health services they need without financial hardship. Linked to WHO’s General Programme of Work the European Programme of Work places universal health coverage as one of the three priorities for the WHO Regional Office for Europe. Through the WHO Barcelona Office for Health Systems Financing the Regional Office undertakes context-specific monitoring of financial protection in over 30 countries including Cyprus.

The Barcelona Office also provides tailored technical assistance to countries to reduce unmet need and financial hardship by identifying and addressing gaps in coverage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vc2ZiYXl2aWV3LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzL3VuaXZlcnNhbC1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLXRyaWVzLWFnYWluL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Universal health care: California tries again,"“A single-payer health system represents the belief that health care is truly a human right. Our current system results in unjust outcomes and these inequities are underscored especially now exacerbating economic downturns for working families who have lost their income and meaningful access to health care.” – Assemblymember Ash Kalra co-sponsor of AB 1400 along with the California Nurses Association (CNA).

by Barry Hermanson

California Assemblymember Ash Kalra D-San Jose and joint authors Assemblymembers Alex Lee D-San Jose and Miguel Santiago D-Los Angeles introduced Assembly Bill 1400 on Feb. 19.

AB 1400 would guarantee comprehensive high-quality health care for all Californians as a human right leading the nation in the larger fight for health care justice. The principal coauthors of AB 1400 are Assemblymembers David Chiu D-San Francisco and Phil Ting D-San Francisco Sens. Lena A. Gonzalez D-Long Beach Mike McGuire D-Healdsburg and Scott Wiener D-San Francisco.

I’ve been a vocal critic of all three of my San Francisco representatives in Sacramento on the issue of health care. Each claims to be an advocate.

One before he was elected talked about family medical issues emphasizing his personal commitment to achieving universal health care. SB 562 in 2017 was the last time major healthcare legislation was considered in Sacramento.

The quote I remember the most was from Assemblyman Ting Chair of the Assembly Budget Committee: “How are we going to pay for it?” Since 2017: silence.

Legislation finally. “Comprehensive high-quality health care for all Californians.” What kind of leadership can we expect to see from the authors and coauthors of AB 1400? Their voices are needed to lead a massive overhaul of our healthcare delivery system into one that provides care to every person in California.

In 2017 the author and coauthors of SB 562 did not lead. They disappeared as the bill died in the Assembly.

“The new system called CalCare would expand coverage to nearly 3 million uninsured Californians and provide rich benefits including dental care generous prescription drug coverage and long-term care according to the bill language which was obtained by California Healthline before the measure was introduced.” https://khn.org/news/article/new-single-payer-bill-intensifies-newsoms-political-peril/.

Last November California voters were asked to approve new safety regulations covering dialysis clinics serving 80000 patients. Opponents of Prop. 23 spent more than $105 million in their successful campaign to defeat it.

Over the last decade the leadership of the California Democratic Party has blocked single-payer legislation preferring improvements to Obamacare instead. The chair of the Assembly Health Committee opposes single-payer.

Will AB 1400 move further through Sacramento than SB 562 did in 2017? Gov. Gavin Newsom before he was elected campaigned as an advocate for single-payer. Supporting or opposing AB 1400 could be the most important decision of his term in office. Will he lead?

In my December column I talked about the death of my friend and colleague Don Bechler who led an organization called Single Payer Now. He always had postcards supporting healthcare legislation. They were used to educate and identify voters and build a database of supporters. In addition to using the postcards to encourage legislators to take action Don believed we must be prepared to win at the ballot box.

If AB 1400 passes and is signed into law by Gov. Newsom this fall opponents will no doubt put an initiative on the 2022 ballot to repeal it.

Last November California voters were asked to approve new safety regulations covering dialysis clinics serving 80000 patients. Opponents of Prop. 23 spent more than $105 million in their successful campaign to defeat it. Advertisements featured patients pleading with voters to reject the initiative saying they could die if it passed.

AB 1400 will impact nearly one fifth of the California economy not just one small segment of it. Billions in profits are made every year in the delivery of health care in California. Our opponents’ campaign will have unlimited funding.

I support AB 1400. Talking to voters about the bill will help identify and organize supporters. Identifying and registering millions of voters will help defeat an extremely well-funded opposition.

Winning better health care in California will not be easy but it is possible. Your help is needed in this fight.

Our research indicated that 17.05% of those who had outpatient healthcare needs could not access to required healthcare services or ignored self-medication to meet their healthcare needs. A previous study conducted in Iran [16] showed that almost 36% of individuals in need did not seek any outpatient healthcare services which is far from our findings. It seems that former research did not adjust unmet need for self-medication. According to both definitions the prevalence of unmet need in Iran is much higher than it was reported in the previous studies in Europe [6 9 28]. Let alone some studies in South Korea [11 15] reported a higher rate of unmet need in comparison to those in our research. As need concept and accordingly SUN is a normative issue as well as a multi-dimensional outcome [18] the discrepancy between different studies could be justifiable. Compared to most previous studies that reported annual prevalence we reported biweekly SUN for outpatient healthcare services that could provide a more precise picture of this unwanted outcome.

Taking into consideration the reasons behind unmet healthcare need could help decrease its occurrence [18]. We observed that accessibility solely related to nearly 40% of the overall unmet need for outpatient healthcare services. In addition while about 4% of the studied people forgot their needs due to the availability of healthcare services most of them collectively experienced unmet need due to accessibility and availability of healthcare services that was highly related to the organization and financing of the healthcare system. Hence the need for appropriate and evidence-based policies in both healthcare organization and financing is clear to decrease most of unmet need in Iran. We advocate more attention to facilitate access to the outpatient sector within the ongoing Health Transformation Plan to decrease unmet need in Iran [29]. On the other hand only about 12% of observed unmet need was categorized as unmet need due to acceptability of healthcare services. This kind of unmet need is strongly related to the expectations and circumstances of the clients which is likely to be decreased through enhancing health literacy [30]. Previous studies carried out in other settings reported different reasons for unmet need. While in some European countries [20] and Canada [31] acceptability or availability of healthcare services caused unmet need in Serbia [6] and South Korea [11] like our finding unmet need due to accessibility were prevalent.

Our study revealed that poor health status was the only significant factor that increased unmet need in the three estimated models. This was in line with former studies [9 11 12 14] that showed worsen health status could increase unmet need for healthcare services. Poor health status was the strongest predictors of unmet need in the first and second regression models. Compared with the individuals who had one outpatient need those with two or more outpatient needs were at a higher risk of facing with overall system-related unmet need and unmet need due to acceptability of healthcare services. This indicates that the Iranian healthcare system might presumably suffer from high degrees of inequity at least within its outpatient sector [27]. We strongly recommended provision of healthcare services for those with higher needs which could in turn lead to improving vertical and horizontal equity in Iran.

Education was the other significant factor that modified unmet need in the three estimated models. While less educated individuals suffered from unmet need and those caused by the performance of the health system they showed rather unexpectedly a lower chance to expose unmet need due to accessibility. Less educated people suffered from financial strains that made them vulnerable to unmet need due to the performance of the health system. Nevertheless their needs were not overlooked due to healthcare services acceptability. This might be associated with lower expectations of the health system among this group. This finding is inconsistent with the results of previous studies in Iran [16] and Europe [9] in which no significant association was found between education and unmet need and the studies carried out in Canada [12 22] that showed higher education could increase unmet need. Nonetheless a large number of previous studies [6 11 20 32] affirmed the positive association between lower education and overall and system-related unmet need. In the present study gender and marital status had no significant association with unmet need and their different causes. A recent study in Iran also found no significant relationship between these factors and outpatient healthcare utilization [33].

We found that employed people were in a higher risk of facing with overall unmet need and the ones caused by the responsibility of the health system which is in line with the previous studies [6 11]. Employed people may neglect their needs to bring enough affordability for their dependents. We observed different effects of age groups on unmet needs in Iran. First in contrast with previous studies [6 9 11] the middle aged group had a higher chance to face with SUN. One explanation for this finding could be the Iranian parents ignoring or at least not prioritizing the healthcare needs of themselves to meet the needs of their dependents. Let alone that many individuals in this age group were employed people whose higher unmet need is expected. Former study in Iran also showed that the middle-age and employed people had decreased rates of healthcare utilization compared with their peers [33]. We advocate paying greater attention to the healthcare needs among middle-age individuals to guarantee healthier labor force. Second the elderly had a lower odd to experience unmet needs. This could be the result of prioritizing elderly citizens as a target group by the Iranian health system [6 9]. Iran has a relatively comprehensive pension schemes for retired citizens [34] which seems that covers most healthcare expenditures for the elderly. We recommend the expansion of basic health insurance in Iran [27 34] to increase the access to required healthcare services and decrease the responsibility-related SUN among older Iranians. Third we observed that aging could increase the acceptability-related SUN. While acceptability-related SUN were less prevalent among higher age groups in Europe and Canada [9 12] other study in South Korea [11] found no significant association between acceptability-related SUN and age. It seems that opportunity cost of devoting enough time for healthcare seeking among middle-age and older adults is high in Iran which might be related to the economic depression.

As far as enabling factors were concerned our research revealed that lower economic status was accompanied with higher odds of overall unmet need and unmet need due to performance of health system. This might indicate that poor individuals predominately suffered from unmet need due to the health system responsibility. In line with our finding other studies [9 11 14 16 21] also showed that lower economic status was associated with a higher degree of overall unmet need as well as system-related unmet need. Poor people not only had lower affordability but also might live in areas with worse access to healthcare services which might in turn make them vulnerable to unmet need. Our study also showed that having complementary insurance could not only decrease the probability of overall unmet need but also bring down unmet need related to the health system. The odds ratio of basic health insurance was significant only in the second model. Further we observed that basic health insurance significantly decreased only unmet need due to the responsibility of the health system. As complementary health insurance might not be accessible to disadvantaged groups policy makers need to do their utmost efforts to create inclusive basic insurance programs to tackle unmet need effectively. Previous studies [32 35] also confirmed the protective effect of health insurance against unmet need.

Rigor of study

Despite providing valuable evidence on the feature of unmet need in Iran this study had some limitations that need to be acknowledged. First we used the IrUHS to measure the unmet need related to healthcare services. This survey was intrinsically designed to study the utilization of healthcare services and did not have any questions about clinical conditions such as history of chronic disease or activity daily living that could decrease comparability of our results with those of previous studies. However it provided an opportunity to estimate unmet need in the 2 weeks prior to the survey that could reduce recall bias. It is recommended that future studies to use specific questionnaire with wide-range questions about health status in Iran which will help more effective measurement of unmet healthcare needs in Iran. Second this cross-sectional study could not necessarily bring any causality association between different predictors and unmet need which is required to be studied in the long-term. Third this study did not use supply-side variables such as provider’s characteristics that might modify the unmet need. Finally we only studied the unmet need in the outpatient sector that could not reflect a complete picture of such an unwanted outcome in the entire health system of Iran. Hence the status of unmet need in the inpatient sector especially after HTP needs to be addressed in future studies.

The death of Joyce Echaquan who bravely recorded her own racist encounter with two health-care workers proves that cultural change is needed in Canada's health-care system to prevent further deaths and harm to Indigenous and other racialized patients.

Unlike the absence of response in the death of Brian Sinclair the federal government acted on pleas from Echaquan's family and community as well as individuals and groups across Canada to address racism in Canadian health care. Federal Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller and Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett hosted a series of national dialogues.

The most recent held in late January brought together more than 400 people representing Indigenous partners governments educational and professional institutions and health-care organizations to share calls to action and discuss plans with the premise that substantial interruption of ongoing racism can only happen through dialogue.

We acknowledge and value this national dialogue. However the government of Canada's response remains tepid.

Tangible commitments are minimal.

WATCH | A Jan. 28 2021 report on Ottawa's promise to address racism in health care:

Ottawa promises to address anti-Indigenous racism in health care Duration 1:55 Ottawa has laid the groundwork to overhaul the health-care system to make it safer for Indigenous peoples promising to address racism and have more community involvement.

They include supporting the co-development of distinctions-based (First Nations Inuit and Métis) Indigenous health legislation $4 million to improve physician training and $2 million to the First Nations governing authorities of Manawan Atikamekw Council and Atikamekw Nation Tribal Council in Quebec for training and education on the right to access equitable social and health services.

These commitments are inadequate.

First distinctions-based legislation does not address jurisdictional issues and may not have helped someone like Brian Sinclair who died in 2008 after sitting ignored for 34 hours in the emergency department at Winnipeg's Health Sciences Centre. Mr. Sinclair was a non-status Anishinaabe man who accessed services as a citizen of Manitoba.

Second all health-care staff share a responsibility to confront Indigenous-specific racism. Directing funding only to physician training misses the fact that the fatal racism suffered by Brian Sinclair Joyce Echaquan and many many others occurred in encounters with nurses and other hospital staff.

Furthermore education while valuable is insufficient without broader structural transformation in conjunction with accountability mechanisms policy directives and organizational change.

Enshrine anti-racism in Canada Health Act

Alongside education we recommend a direct and universal measure: adding anti-racism as a sixth pillar of the Canada Health Act.

The act outlines five pillars that provinces and territories are bound by in order to receive health-care funding: universality comprehensiveness accessibility portability and public administration.

We came together as the Brian Sinclair Working Group during the inquest into the 2008 death of Brian Sinclair in which a judge ruled that racism would not be considered as a factor. We hosted provincewide discussions on structural racism and the inadequate provincial response. We also issued a report with recommendations.

The Brian Sinclair Working Group released its interim report in 2017. The group also hosted provincewide discussions on structural racism and the inadequate provincial response. (Brian Sinclair Working Group)

Since Joyce Echaquan's death we renewed our efforts and proposed that anti-racism be a guiding value for all health-care systems organizations and providers.

More specifically we as a group asked that all stakeholders in the health-care system (including the federal government the provincial government health authorities unions professional organizations and post-secondary institutions that deliver services and train the next generation of health professionals) adopt anti-racism policies and implement meaningful strategies.

This will require resources committed to providing anti-racism training accountability mechanisms program review and independent investigations to hold institutions accountable to these mandates.

We concur with the recommendations from recent inquiries reports and guidelines that eradicating racism in health care requires a national effort. We contend that adding anti-racism to the Canada Health Act would trigger the development of universal policies and programs to interrupt systemic and interpersonal racism in health care across health systems throughout the country.

To date more than 2000 individuals and organizations have signed our open letter calling on the federal government to adopt anti-racism as a pillar of the Canada Health Act. (The letter can be found on the Anti-racism as a Sixth Pillar of the Canada Health Act Facebook group.)

A denial of basic human dignity

On Nov. 5 2020 Sen. Mary Jane McCallum tabled a motion to call on the government to adopt anti-racism as the sixth pillar of the Canada Health Act stating that ""concerted action at the highest levels of influence and authority in Canada is required to disrupt racism in the Canadian health-care system.""

While Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller has not officially ruled out this approach his department maintains a ""carrots over sticks"" (education not law) approach to addressing racism in Canada.

Although every Canadian is entitled to constitutional and human rights protections against discrimination the horrific treatment of Indigenous individuals within health-care systems demonstrates an ongoing denial of basic human dignity that is deeply rooted in Canada's history of colonialism and segregation.

Measures to increase accountability to the Canada Health Care Act are needed to raise standards of care to existing commitments to public administration accessibility comprehensiveness universality and portability.

Enshrining anti-racism as a sixth core principle would acknowledge the cultural change needed to prevent further deaths and harm to Indigenous and other racialized patients."

MEMPHIS Tenn. (AP) — Clyde Robinson treasures the acre of land he inherited a verdant space tucked into a cul-de-sac in a south Memphis neighborhood surrounded by houses and trees beside a railroad track.

For more than five decades he nurtured it while his relatives lived in a home on the property then maintained the land after a fire destroyed the house. The 80-year-old retired cement mason pays the taxes and cares for the property in Boxtown a neighborhood that began as a community of freed slaves in the 1860s.

Now he finds himself defending it.

Robinson's land is coveted by Valero Energy and Plains All American Pipeline and their joint venture the Byhalia Connection. They want to build an underground 49-mile (78-kilometer) pipeline to carry crude oil to the Gulf Coast which they say will bring jobs and tax revenue to the region. The pipeline would run through wetlands and under poor predominantly Black neighborhoods like Boxtown named after residents used material dumped from railroad boxcars to fortify their homes.

Robinson isn't alone in thinking it's a bad idea. The land sits over an aquifer that provides drinking water to more than 1 million people. Environmentalists and the local Democratic congressman see an opportunity for the Biden administration to reverse the industry-friendly policies of former President Donald Trump.

Robinson has refused an offer of $8000 for an easement on his property and is fighting the project in court.

“My dad says ‘How are they going to take what’s mine?’” said Marie Odum Robinson’s daughter. “It’s just not fair.”

The Byhalia Connection would link the east-west Diamond Pipeline through the Valero refinery in Memphis to the north-south Capline Pipeline near Byhalia Mississippi. The Capline which has been transporting crude oil from a Louisiana port on the Gulf of Mexico north to the Midwest is being reversed to deliver oil south through Mississippi to refineries and export terminals on the Gulf.

Environmentalists activists and local politicians say the companies are putting oil profits ahead of the people who live along the pipeline's path. Some fear a spill would endanger waterways and seep contaminants into the Memphis Sand Aquifer which gives Memphis its slightly sweet-tasting drinking water. The pipeline connector would traverse well fields that pump water from the aquifer into the water system.

In a letter to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers the Southern Environmental Law Center said the clay layer above the aquifer “has several known and suspected breaches holes and leaks.""

Opponents suspect environmental racism — the practice of placing toxic factories landfills and other polluters in minority neighborhoods and indigenous areas where voiceless residents only realize the danger after people get sick. They say Boxtown where homes had no running water or electricity as recently as the 1970s was chosen because residents are Black and low income.

During a recent rally against the pipeline activist Justin Pearson said the project reeks of racial injustice.

“Black lives matter don’t just matter when we get lynched by police” Pearson said. “They matter when we are in our homes and our children are outside playing on our land.”

Pearson and others bristled when a Byhalia Connection land agent said during a community meeting that the pipeline developers “took basically a point of least resistance” in choosing the path.

Byhalia Connection spokeswoman Katie Martin said the comment doesn't reflect the company's views.

“What should have been said is that we really truly look for the least collective impact to the community” Smith said.

Project officials have reached deals with some landowners on the planned pipeline’s route. A few holdouts like Robinson have been taken to court. The pipeline’s lawyers are seeking eminent domain long invoked by governments to claim private property for public-use projects.

Robinson's lawyers say no statute in Tennessee gives a company the right to take property for moving oil from one refinery to another. Circuit Court Judge Felicia Corbin Johnson said during a hearing Thursday that she has concerns about whether the pipeline company can claim eminent domain.

The Southern Environmental Law Center and others also have opposed the Byhalia Connection's approval using Nationwide Permit 12 which helps fast-track pipeline construction by allowing developers to skip an environmental assessment and public comment period on projects that cross rivers streams and wetlands if they can show their project will have minimal environmental effects.

Plains has said construction could begin within months though the ongoing legal battle may delay that.

U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen a Memphis Democrat has asked the Biden administration — which already has canceled the presidential permit for the much-disputed Keystone XL pipeline — to tell the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to rescind the Byhalia Connection’s permit.

“The proposed Byhalia Pipeline would impose yet another burden on Black neighborhoods in southwest Memphis that have for decades unfairly shouldered the pollution burdens of an oil refinery and coal- and gas-fired power plants” Cohen wrote.

Byhalia Connection representatives say the pipeline will make refineries along the artery more efficient and poses no threat to the aquifer.

“Our pipeline is going to be typically 3 to 4 feet underground and the drinking water segment of the Memphis Sand Aquifer is far deeper than that” said Martin the pipeline project’s spokeswoman.

Plains has owned and operated pipelines in Memphis without problems and measures will be put in place to ensure the aquifer’s safety Martin said adding a promise of jobs and tax revenue.

“Our goal for this project is to safely and responsibly build and operate a pipeline that will be a long-term benefit to the community” Martin said.

Byhalia Connection has given more than $1 million to the Memphis community for various causes. But Robinson says no amount of money or talk will convince him to give up what's his.

Ambling across the land one recent sunny day he picks up trash with a stick that he leans on to trudge up a hill. He talks about dreams of building a senior care center or a children's playground someday.

Leaning on his stick Robinson looks down at the green grass shakes his head and compares his situation to slavery — when members of his own family were not compensated for working the land.

“The Bible says the evildoers will be with you always"" he said shoving his hand into his jeans pocket. “That's what this is. They want to come in and take.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

En este contexto definir estrategias digitales para sobrevivir a la crisis y aumentar las ventas en las redes sociales es indispensable.

Una de las claves es integrar los diferentes canales de atención y distribución aprovechando las redes sociales y aplicaciones como WhatsApp al mismo tiempo que brindan una atención personalizada a sus clientes.

Estas son algunas de las tendencias que los expertos consideran claves para aquellos que piensen abrir su propio comercio online.

Tiendas online. Un estudio anual sobre eCommerce de la Cámara Argentina de Comercio Electrónico (CACE) registró en 2020 un crecimiento del 124% con respecto al año anterior. Hubo más de 1.284.960 nuevos usuarios que se volcaron al canal online alcanzando un total de 20.058.206 compradores. En cantidad de productos el crecimiento anual fue del 74% y la cantidad de órdenes de compra aumentó un 84%.

Para los comercios es fundamental contar con una tienda online que funcione bien y en la que los usuarios tengan una buena experiencia y logren tenerle confianza.

Es fundamental conocer como operan las principales redes sociales para poder competir en ellas. Fito: Bloomberg

“La tecnología nos brinda muchas herramientas para aumentar el ticket de compra como vitrinas digitales promociones personalizadas y estrategias de marketing digital. En este sentido la inteligencia artificial es una gran aliada a la hora de desarrollar soluciones que lleven a los usuarios a una conversión” explicó Antonio Rivero director comercial de Napse firma especializada en la transformación digital.

Redes sociales. Para aprovechar el poder que tienen estas aplicaciones es importante plantar bandera en la mayor cantidad de plataformas ya que una mayor cobertura abre la puerta a futuros compradores.

Para entender como operan y conocer sus secretos es fundamental explorarlas para sacar el mayor provecho de cada una y descubrir sus posibilidades.

Por ejemplo Facebook cuenta con un marketplace propio Instagram ofrece la posibilidad de etiquetar productos en las fotos que subimos WhatsApp Business permite crear catálogos de productos en el perfil y segmentar los contactos para hacer promociones o difusiones más personalizadas.

""En esta nueva realidad la gente quiere ser atendida en el mismo canal en el que habla con sus amigos y familiares y no sólo eso sino que quiere tener la opción de elegir el canal y ser reconocida en todos ellos sin tener que repetir información o rellenar largos formularios"" advierte Leandro Olivier director para ventas en Zendesk.



El marketplace de Facebook se pueden comprar o vender productos sin comisiones.

Opciones de pago. En los últimos años la diversificación de los medios de pago creció enormemente y es importante que los comercios den respuesta a esta tendencia aceptando la mayor cantidad posible.

“A partir de 2020 los medios sin contacto (contactless) las billeteras digitales y opciones como link de pago crecieron en popularidad” agregó Martín Malievac director de Investigación y desarrollo de Napse.

Físico y digital. En 2020 junto con el crecimiento del comercio electrónico hubo un boom del envío a domicilio: según el mencionado estudio de la CACE más de la mitad de las compras online fueron entregadas a través de esta modalidad.

Bimo la billetera digital de Clarín.

Sin embargo para que estos funcionen correctamente y sin errores humanos los comerciantes deben contar con soluciones de integración de los canales físicos y digitales lo que se conoce como omnicanalidad.

“Con estas herramientas los comercios estarán listos para ofrecer una experiencia de compra completa con opciones diversas que dejarán al cliente satisfecho con cualquier decisión tomada sea la compra en la tienda con entrega en casa” dijo Rivero.

Humanizar lo digital. Así como en el universo del trabajo en el cual las empresas están aprendiendo a mantener las relaciones humanas en el medio digital los comerciantes también deben evitar que el cliente se sienta un número en la tienda.

Para lograr una experiencia de compra única y positiva es fundamental humanizar la atención durante todo el proceso.

Es importante utilizar datos y herramientas para entender los sentimientos de las personas y lo que es interesante para ellas generando una conexión afectiva y no apenas efectiva con los clientes.

""Para hacer frente a esto muchos están invirtiendo en inteligencia artificial los bots de respuesta y las capacidades de autoservicio para reducir el volumen de solicitudes que llegan al tiempo que se acelera la respuesta al cliente y se prioriza el contacto humano para los casos más complejos"" señala Olivier.



Para lograrlo este trato debe abarcar todos los canales de contacto. Por ejemplo en las redes sociales siempre es mejor brindar una respuesta rápida y personalizada en vez de automáticas.

Contar con un canal tan popular como WhatsApp es fundamental es importante brindar un teléfono de contacto para aquellos clientes que lo prefieran y por último no descuidar el trato en la tienda física.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxhc2V4dGEuY29tL21vdG9yL25vdGljaWFzL3ZlbnRhcy12ZWhpY3Vsb3MtdXNhZG9zLWNhZW4tMTY2LWZlYnJlcm9fMjAyMTAzMDQ2MDQ0ZmJiYjUzMzNhNDAwMDFiMzUxOTAuaHRtbNIBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmxhc2V4dGEuY29tL21vdG9yL25vdGljaWFzL3ZlbnRhcy12ZWhpY3Vsb3MtdXNhZG9zLWNhZW4tMTY2LWZlYnJlcm9fMjAyMTAzMDQ2MDQ0ZmJiYjUzMzNhNDAwMDFiMzUxOTAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las ventas de vehículos usados caen un 166% en febrero,"El mercado español de vehículos de segunda mano alcanzó las 143.828 transferencias en el mes de febrero lo que supone una caída del 166% en comparación con el mismo periodo de 2020 según datos de la consultora MSI para la Federación de Asociaciones de Concesionarios de la Automoción (Faconauto).

Tal y como ha indicado Faconauto febrero sigue la tónica de los meses anteriores ya que los vehículos de uno a cinco años son los que presentan subidas. Los automóviles de uno a dos años han aumentado un 27% sus entregas y los de dos a tres años lo han hecho un 45% mientras que los de tres a cinco años han subido sus transferencias un 55%. Del otro lado los coches de entre seis a diez años han bajado un 126% las ventas y los de más de diez años un 17%.

Para el presidente del consejo de administración de Niw.es Ignacio de Benito destacan los vehículos jóvenes de uno a dos años como ""los más competitivos del segmento"" con resultados que muestran una tendencia hacia una ligera recuperación del mercado. ""Los usados de menos de cinco años mantienen el interés por sus excelentes ventajas y siguen compitiendo en primer nivel con los coches nuevos contribuyendo a la renovación del parque automovilístico"" ha añadido el directivo.

Según el director de comunicación de Faconauto Raúl Morales el mercado continúa en la misma línea de los últimos meses debido a la situación sanitaria aunque la previsión es que empiece a crecer previsiblemente en el segundo trimestre con un contexto sanitario más certero.

EL RENTING CONTINUA SIENDO EL CANAL DE VENTA PREFERIDO

En relación a los canales de venta el renting ha sido el único que ha visto incrementadas sus ventas en un 223% como sucedió en el mes de enero. Las bajadas más acentuadas han estado protagonizadas por el 'rent a car' con una caída del 456% y las matriculaciones tácticas con un 282%. Por su parte el canal de particulares ha bajado en un 167% las importaciones un 157% y la compraventa un 156%.

Asimismo los concesionarios han tenido una cuota de mercado de más del 20% y sus operaciones han retrocedido un 89%. Respecto a los carburantes la gasolina y el diésel siguen acaparando la mayor parte de las transferencias del mercado aunque ambos han tenido descensos en la venta de este tipo de vehículos un 192% y 17% respectivamente. Además los eléctricos y algunos híbridos continúan también aumentando sus ventas ya que los diésel/eléctrico enchufables que han aumentado un 426% los gasolina/eléctrico enchufables con un 1455% y los gasolina 'mild hybrid' un 1244%.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbm9ydGUuY29tL2FjdXNhbi1hLXVuLWl0YWxpYW5vLWRlLWZyYXVkZS1lbi12ZW50YXMvYXIyMTM4MDcz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Acusan a un italiano de fraude en ventas,"SEGURIDAD

La asociación madrileña le manifestó oficialmente a la Presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid: ‘Su decepción por la grave situación que vive la tauromaquia y por no poder celebrarse festejos y por el contrario sí otros espectáculos culturales’.

‘Estamos trabajando para que la Comunidad de Madrid no se quede sin toros este año y consideramos diversos escenarios para una programación en Las Ventas a lo largo de la presente temporada’

Isabel Díaz Ayuso ha argumentado en la misiva que: ‘Estamos trabajando para que la Comunidad de Madrid no se quede sin toros este año y consideramos diversos escenarios para una programación en Las Ventas a lo largo de la presente temporada. En función de la evolución de la pandemia poder abordar en condiciones de seguridad dicha planificación para la Monumental. Es importante tener en cuenta la necesidad de controlar no solo los aforos sino los accesos lo cual es especialmente complejo en una plaza de toros’.

‘Y además estamos trabajando junto con el sector para intensificar la actividad taurina en el conjunto de la región a lo largo de 2021 y 2022’

La máxima responsable de la Comunidad señala en la carta: ‘Y además estamos trabajando junto con el sector para intensificar la actividad taurina en el conjunto de la región a lo largo de 2021 y 2022’. Por otro lado Díaz Ayuso afirma ser aficionada y defensora de la tauromaquia: ‘Respeto y estimo enormemente el mundo del toro su importancia en la economía el empleo y por descontado y muy en particular los espectáculos taurinos’.

La Presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid también valoraba el volumen monetario: ‘Somos conscientes que genera un impacto económico de 414 millones de euros y 50.000 empleos vinculados en la región. El Gobierno al que represento ha apoyado la tauromaquia desde el inicio de la legislatura y lo seguirá impulsando a favor’.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL2dlc3Rpb24ucGUvZWNvbm9taWEvZW1wcmVzYXMvaXN1enUtZS1jb21tZXJjZS15LXZlbnRhcy1wb3ItZGVsaXZlcnktaW1wdWxzYXJvbi1lbi1wYXJ0ZS1yZWN1cGVyYWNpb24tZGUtY2F0ZWdvcmlhLWRlLWNhbWlvbmVzLW5jemUtbm90aWNpYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Isuzu: e-commerce y ventas por delivery impulsaron en parte recuperación de categoría de camiones,"“De enero a marzo las ventas tuvieron un comportamiento normal pero durante el segundo trimestre se fueron a cero con la cuarentena impuesta por el Gobierno para mitigar la propagación del COVID-19. No obstante a partir de julio la demanda nos tomó gratamente por sorpresa” revela Julio Aguilar Saldivar gerente de camiones de Isuzu Perú.

Este incremento en la demanda ha dejado con buena inercia a la categoría para arrancar con fuerza el 2021 precisa. Tan es así que ya en enero y febrero de este año la venta de camiones logró repuntar en 15.4% con 1808 unidades registradas según la Asociación Automotriz del Perú (AAP).

Este crecimiento también ha sido muy bien capitalizado por Isuzu que registró un repunte en este primer bimestre de 52.4% (346 unidades) respecto a similar periodo del 2020 manteniéndose en el primer lugar de la tabla y lejos de su segundo competidor (Hino).

“Pese a la nueva cuarentena que se dio el mes pasado hemos logrado tener un buen performance y apuntamos a cerrar el 2021 con una expansión de 38% lo que nos llevaría a vender alrededor de 1825 unidades (más que en 2019) y a ganar un punto porcentual de participación” estima.

El año pasado el fabricante japonés de vehículos industriales y comerciales colocó 1320 unidades y cerró con un market share de 11.1%.

Mercado

En tanto el mercado también aspira a concluir en el 2021 con un importante crecimiento de 32% aproximadamente detalla Aguilar.

Destaca que afortunadamente desde el pasado periodo la marca (parte de General Motors) se ha venido preparando a nivel de stock para soportar la creciente demanda y no registrar problemas de aprovisionamiento.

Señala que el boom del e-commerce y las ventas por delivery fue lo que en parte impulso la recuperación de la categoría de camiones y confían que así seguirá siendo. Acota que sus clientes son básicamente emprendedores que buscan una unidad de menor capacidad de carga para hacer repartos cómodos y seguros en viajes largos y cortos.

Entre las unidades más solicitadas de la marca figuran la NQR de 6.5 toneladas de capacidad y la NQR doble cabina por su versatilidad en el traslado de alimentos o carga pesada asegura.

A la fecha Isuzu tiene siete concesionarios y un total de 13 puntos de venta y posventa en todo el país los cuales por ahora no aumentarán.

Finalmente menciona que al igual que en otras empresas el nuevo coronavirus aceleró la ejecución de su proceso de digitalización de esta manera desde el año pasado implementaron el programa Socio del Camino que tiene por objetivo brindar asesoría virtual personalizada a sus clientes así como a todos aquellos que están interesados en adquirir un vehículo para iniciar o potenciar su negocio."

Although many Americans reflexively use recycling bins less than one-third of plastics are reworkable. Even that figure is misleading since particles like food residue can get materials rerouted to the trash. In 2017 just 8.4 percent of all plastics found new life according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The unfortunate truth is that recycling can’t keep us from drowning in polymer-based refuse.

For more than 20 years Chinese companies helped hide the problem by buying about 700000 tons of paper and plastic from the US every year. Cheap labor there meant people could sort objects which made it simple to separate trash from treasure. In the case of tricky combos like bags full of mixed materials for instance workers could pull bottles from heaps of greasy takeout boxes. But in 2018 worried about the amount of sheer junk like cling wrap coming in China banned all rubbish imports save for 99.5 percent pure plastic.

Back in the US plants are now chipping away at our mountain of garbage by improving automation. Some facilities use cameras to spot plastic bags that could tangle up sorting machines or deploy robotic arms to shake bottles out of the irksome sacks. Others use blasts of air to separate paper from plastic based on weight. But those small tweaks won’t be enough. To handle our nation’s plastic trash—262 million tons a year or 234 pounds per person according to analysis by the global risk consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft—we’d need to increase our recycling capacity by more than tenfold.

[Related: How to actually recycle]

Some experts argue that we should just waste less. “Not producing trash in the first place will always be better than having something to recycle” says Jenna Jambeck a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Georgia. To shrink our pool of would-be recyclables US companies will have to prioritize selling long-lasting objects over single-use goods—and change the way they wrap them. Many products come in packaging designed for immediate disposal Jambeck says which accounts for 40 percent of plastic use. Consumers can pressure manufacturers to do better by seeking out companies that employ reusable or biodegradable wrappers. “Every time we can make a choice to not use single-use plastic it makes a difference” Jambeck says.

In the era of COVID-19 and its remote blended working environments it is distressing to see job postings that are misaligned with the current times. There is a need for companies to address how they engage with fresh talent and employees.





On the second day of YourStory’s Future of Work event in a fireside chat with Senior Editor of ﻿YourStory Media﻿ Ramarko Sengupta Gopinath Pullaihgari Director - Human Resources Verizon India spills the beans on becoming an employer of choice for tech talent in India.

He shared insights on how Verizon India is planning for the future of work for their employees and amplifying its position as an employer of choice.

Gopinath comes with over 20 years of experience in managing human capital across HR roles and geographies. Before joining Verizon in 2012 Gopinath played integral roles in the HR departments of JP Morgan Chase & Co. Optimus Global Services and Xansa. He has successfully led pioneering initiatives in talent transformation and is known for innovative HR practices.

Speaking on blended and remote work environments and increasing employee engagement in the present scenario he said “The pandemic was an eye opener. It broke a lot of glass ceilings that we earlier never thought we could break.”

At the fireside chat Gopinath spoke about Verizon India’s sustained growth. “The tech talent here (in India) gives us an edge in terms of everything that we do - that is how I would summarise India's sustained growth over the last 20 years. Our focus is to move to become a strategic centre and a centre for innovation just not for our tech arm but for the organisation as a whole. And that is the journey we are currently on” Gopinath said at the fourth edition of Future of Work.

Gopinath Pullaihgari (Director - HR Verizon India) in conversation with Ramarko Sengupta (Senior Editor YourStory) at the Future of Work 2021

Further he talked about how tech talent is now increasingly led by millennials and GenZ workforces and how tech companies are gearing up for the expectations taking on the dynamically changing roles. “A few years back...we clearly laid down the facts that we wanted to be an innovation centre and a strategic arm that drives businesses and business goals” he added.





When Verizon India first started working remotely it lacked the ‘collaboration’ piece in the larger puzzle. In line with this challenge Verizon acquired video conferencing company BlueJeans for around $500 million in April last year. “It was an important strategy” Gopinath said.





Since 2014 Verizon India has been on a mission to build an inclusive and empowering culture. “Like every other company in India we started the narrative with gender” he said. A large part of the women employees were in junior roles and that was the first challenge that Verizon went on to solve. “We went about addressing that in a strategic way. The first step was sensitising our leaders and workforce” he added.

“The narrative is now shifting from unconscious biases to conscious inclusion” he said.

Over the last few years there has been greater emphasis on gender-pay parity at Verizon India. Moving forward as the company looks to build on its empowering culture its narrative is ‘supply of diversity.’ Verizon India will be focusing on inclusion of people from the backward and BPL communities. Last year it was recognised as one of the leading companies to work with people with disabilities from an infrastructure perspective.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm94eWdlbi5jb20vc25hcHBlZC9jcmltZS1uZXdzL2xhdG95YS13b29kYXJkLW11cmRlcnMtaHVzYmFuZC1lZHdpbi1kYW5pZWxzLXdpdGgtY2hlZXNlLWtuaWZl0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3h5Z2VuLmNvbS9zbmFwcGVkL2NyaW1lLW5ld3MvbGF0b3lhLXdvb2RhcmQtbXVyZGVycy1odXNiYW5kLWVkd2luLWRhbmllbHMtd2l0aC1jaGVlc2Uta25pZmU_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woman Stabs Husband With Cheese Knife Over 30 Times And Claims It Was An Intruder,"Edwin Daniels ""had stab wounds in his head in his face in his tongue in his esophagus his hands his abdomen so he was brutally brutally stabbed"" a prosecutor told ""Snapped.""

Woman Stabs Husband With Cheese Knife Over 30 Times And Claims It Was An Intruder

The future looked bright for couple Edwin Daniels and Latoya Woodard. They had two young daughters and a new home — but it all came crashing down after an affair sent one of them over the edge.

How to Watch Watch Snapped on Oxygen Sundays 6/5c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Oxygen App.

Edwin Lee Sinclair Daniels was born in Brooklyn New York in 1982 the third of four children. “He was my teddy bear. You always wanted to hug him squeeze him. He was always very friendly” sister Sally Walker told “Snapped” airing Sundays at 6/5c on Oxygen.

In 1994 when Daniels was 12 his family moved to Florida and in high school he began dating a friend of his sister’s. They had a son together born in 2002 but eventually split up. According to his siblings Daniels was a devoted father though. To support his family he turned his lifelong interest in technology into a career working for Verizon.

Latoya Woodard

“He lived for his kids. He worked hard to provide for his kids. As a father he was always there” brother Tony Barhoo told producers.

Then in 2007 Daniels began dating Latoya Woodard. Woodard was a Florida native with three sons from a previous marriage. She had served in the U.S. Navy but was accused of desertion and received an “other than honorable discharge” The Daytona Beach News-Journal reported in 2020. She claimed she had left her post because she was unable to arrange for child care.

Daniels and Woodard eventually moved in together and had two daughters. After being together for almost a decade the couple married in 2016. Following their wedding the family moved into a big new home in Deltona Florida north of Orlando. Also living with them was a friend of Woodard’s named Crystal Lyde.

“Crystal is Latoya’s best friend from the military” Edwin’s sister Claudette Daniels told producers. “She needed somewhere to stay and my brother had his beautiful home. He had an extra bedroom.”

It seemed like an ideal time for the group but on the night of April 13 2018 Lyde called 911.

“My roommate was stabbed. I think somebody might have broken in or something” she is heard saying on tapes of the call obtained by “Snapped.” “He’s not moving at all. I’m sorry his wife’s just flipping out right now.”

Volusia Sheriff's Office Deputy Sarah Jackson was one of the first responders to arrive at Daniels and Woodard’s home. “There was blood everywhere” she told “Snapped.” “You could clearly see there was a struggle.”

Daniels had numerous stab wounds and was pronounced dead at the scene. He was 35 years old.

""Woodard told detectives she was sleeping in the master bedroom when Daniels was murdered and that he must have been killed by an intruder in the house"" Volusia County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Andrew Gant told Daytona Beach radio station WNDB at the time.

However the bed in the master bedroom was made. Despite Woodard’s tales of an intruder there were no signs of forced entry. Nothing was missing from the home ruling out a robbery.

Detectives removed several knives from the home including one found in the kitchen sink which ""appeared to be a cheese knife” Volusia Sheriff's Office Detective Peter Bethea told producers.

Edwin Daniels

At the scene Woodard was hysterical and hyperventilating. She was taken to a nearby hospital. Upon her release she was interviewed by detectives and her clothing was collected as evidence.

Detectives asked Woodard about her relationship which she described as “normal.” “We fight. We argue. Then the next day we love each other” she says in video footage of her police interview obtained by “Snapped.”

Woodard said on the day of the murder she had come home from work in the afternoon and asked Lyde to pick up her kids at school. She said she was tired and went to bed. Later she was awoken by a loud bang and came downstairs to find Daniels injured.

Detectives then interviewed Lyde but her timeline didn’t match up with Woodard’s. Lyde claimed Woodard didn’t come home until approximately 7 p.m. and then Lyde went to Walmart. When she returned she saw Woodard who told her to call 911. Lyde asked what happened but Woodard was too hysterical to give an explanation.

Detectives compared Lyde’s statement to her 911 call and found even more discrepancies. On the 911 call Lyde said she heard a commotion before going to Walmart.

When confronted with the tapes Lyde admitted that when she left for Walmart Daniels was home and that he and Woodard were fighting. She said when she returned home she went upstairs to drop off her things then came down and found Woodard crying over Daniels' body.

When detectives asked Woodard about Lyde’s version of events she said her friend was lying. “She was very defensive” Volusia Sheriff's Office Detective Shon McGuire told producers.

Both Woodard and Lyde were released from custody while detectives continued their investigation. On April 16 Daniels’ autopsy revealed the extent of his injuries which included a staggering 34 stab wounds.

“He had stab wounds in his head in his face in his tongue in his esophagus his hands his abdomen so he was brutally brutally stabbed. He had a depressed skull fracture” prosecutor Heatha Trigones told producers.

The ferocity of the attack led authorities to believe it was a crime of passion performed by someone who knew the victim.

Daniels’ wounds matched the cheese knife discovered in the home and his blood was found on Woodard’s shirt.

Detectives also learned that Woodard had a boyfriend named Allan Roberson. He was 26 years old and worked with her at a fast food restaurant. They went to Roberson’s job and spoke with his employer who said he had “a meltdown” at work on the day of murder according to Trigones. Woodard was seen visiting Roberson that afternoon.

When detectives located Robeson he refused to talk to them without a lawyer present. Authorities pulled his and Woodard’s phone records which showed extensive communication between them.

“There was talk of a pregnancy and a miscarriage. Never any discussion of that in the text messages with her husband but there is discussion where she’s texting Allan Roberson saying ‘I feel like a failure as a woman’ talking about her miscarriage so it was clearly a serious relationship” Trigones told producers.

After two unsuccessful attempts to interview Roberson he was subpoenaed in Sept. 2018. Authorities offered him immunity if he agreed to testify against Woodard. “He was less than truthful” Trigones told “Snapped.”

Audio of the interview shows Roberson dodging questions claiming he couldn’t recall events that happened just five months earlier. On recordings of his police interview obtained by “Snapped” he describes his relationship with Woodard as “friends with benefits that was off and on.”

“Almost every question he 'doesn’t remember.' It was clear to all of us that he was trying to protect her” Trigones told producers.

Roberson claimed that on the night of the murder he was home with his mother and sister. Phone and computer data confirmed his alibi.

Though Roberson’s interview generated no evidence the fact that he went to such lengths to protect Woodard indicated the depth of their relationship. Authorities felt they had enough to arrest her if not him. Woodard was arrested on Nov. 15 2018 Orlando Florida ABC-affiliate WFTV reported at the time.

Besides the affair authorities believe the murder was also motivated by money.

“Edwin he had a $100000 Prudential Life Insurance. He had it through his work and Latoya tried to claim it relatively soon after he was murdered” McGuire told “Snapped.”

On Feb. 7 2020 Latoya Woodard was found guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her husband Edwin Daniels. It took the jury less than two hours to arrive at the verdict according to The Daytona Beach News-Journal.

Woodard was sentenced to life in prison on July 15 2020 As Florida does not offer parole she will spend the rest of her life behind bars. Now 37 Woodard is currently incarcerated at the Homestead Correctional Institution for women.

Fossil Gen 5 LTE: Specs Price: $349

Colors: Black blush

Size: 45mm

Display: 1.28 inch AMOLED

Battery life: 24 hours

Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 3100

Memory: 1GB RAM 8GB storage

Water resistance: 3 ATM

Supported carrier: Verizon

What’s a company to do when updating a smartwatch? For Fossil the answer could’ve been fitness-related turning the fashion-first wearable into a more formidable Fitbit rival. The company could have swapped Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 3100 chip for the newer Snapdragon Wear 4100 too. But instead it added LTE in a time when many people are staying home.

As Fossil's first smartwatch with independent cellular capabilities the Fossil Gen 5 LTE Touchscreen Smartwatch ($349) is an iteration of the two-year-old Fossil Gen 5 that lets Android users with Verizon cellular plans free their wearable from their smartphone. For those who are out and about these days this version of Wear OS’s most relevant smartwatch can take calls send messages and use apps even when their handset is MIA.

The best smartwatches  like the Apple Watch Series 6 and Samsung Galaxy Watch 3  have offered LTE options for several generations now. So even if this Fossil Gen 5 LTE is a little late to the party it’s worth figuring out whether its new feature is actually a welcome guest or simply an attempt to distract us from Wear OS’s ongoing deficiencies.

Fossil Gen 5 LTE: Price and availability

The Fossil Gen 5 LTE costs $349 for both the Black or Blush models. That’s about $50 more than the Gen 5’s original price of $295. Now you can get the non-LTE version of $199 though making it one of the best cheap smartwatches . The non-LTE version offers a greater variety of styles and colors as well.

And when you get the LTE version you’ll need to prepare for additional fees. With a Verizon Unlimited plan it costs $10 per month (the same as Apple Watch and Galaxy Watch) for LTE support. You’ll also use Verizon’s Number share service meaning the number for your companion smartphone and your Fossil smartwatch will be the same.

Fossil Gen 5 LTE review: Design

Fossil creates beautiful wristwatches both smart and not. Keeping with the brand’s design sensibilities the round 44-millimeter Fossil Gen 5 LTE features sleek stainless-steel bezels and a familiar three-button array.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

It’s still oversized on small wrists especially when worn alongside the petite Garmin Lily  but the benefit is a large and legible display.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

The silicone straps of the model I tested are more conducive to working out than say the optional leather or steel mesh ones you can interchange. But I was cautious about exposing the Fossil Gen 5 LTE to excessive sweat or other elements: It’s rated 3ATM for water resistance whereas most smartwatches made for activity are rated 5ATM. 5ATM means the smartwatch can withstand swimming workouts in shallow waters. 3ATM means the smartwatch is only splashproof so take it off before taking a shower.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

For some that’s suitable. Unlike the lightweight Fossil Sport which is made for movement the Fossil Gen 5 LTE feels more lifestyle focused. It’s less for the runner who wants to stream music or pay for a coffee and more for the professional who needs to be reachable or connected at all times.

Fossil Gen 5 LTE review: Going phone-free

For this review Fossil sent me an LG Stylo 5 — far from one of the best phones  but a phone that’s set up for Verizon Number Share. After I paired the Fossil Gen 5 LTE to the WearOS app on the Stylo it was ready to operate solo. That meant I could leave the phone behind when I went for walks to the grocery store and some other errands. It's one of the few LTE-capable WearOS smartwatches; if you want something much more luxe check out our Montblanc Summit 2+ hands-on.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Since the number wasn’t tied to my personal contacts or messages I didn’t receive many notifications besides Gmail. I did however make a few calls from the temporary number. According to the receiver my voice sounded clear on the other end but more distant compared to when I called on my Apple Watch with cellular.

If you have the older Gen 5 you can make calls and send texts from your wrist as long as your smartphone is nearby. Both versions offer on-board GPS so again the key benefit you’re getting from the LTE version is the ability to ditch your phone for a while.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Maybe if I were going out more regularly I’d reap more of the benefits of an LTE smartwatch but I couldn’t appreciate the freedom as much as I would’ve liked. I’m sure I’m not the only one in this position these days.

Fossil Gen 5 LTE review: Wear OS

Wear OS gets a bad rap and I can’t say it’s not deserved. I recently wrote about how the Google Assistant voice detection feature hasn’t worked for months  and not many people noticed. Including me — when I tested the best Google Assistant commands from my wrist I manually activated it through the Fossil Gen 5’s tile-based menus.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

The menus still lack the app variety and sophistication of Samsung’s Tizen OS and Apple’s watchOS. Even the Fitbit Versa 3’s interface which I thought seemed slow during testing felt more responsive than the Fossil Gen 5. The Snapdragon Wear 4100-packed TicWatch Pro 3 offers a significantly improved Wear OS integration making me wish Fossil upgraded the Gen 5 LTE’s chipset especially for the price.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

One thing that’s getting better about Wear OS is Google Fit. Health services are more competitive than ever these days and while Google hasn’t gone as far to launch an Apple Fitness Plus rival it has expanded the data you see in your Google Fit profile. It launched a camera-based respiratory rate reader for Pixel phone users earlier this year. When I tracked an outdoor walk I found my step count and heart rate matched my Apple Watch’s measurements. Apple Samsung and Fitbit all track more workout types though.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

It’s important to note that while Wear OS does work on both Android and iOS you’ll need an Android to use the LTE capabilities of the Fossil Gen 5. You’ll also want to know that the Fossil Gen 5 LTE doesn’t ship with the latest software update so you won’t get features now found on the regular Fossil Gen 5 like native sleep tracking or Fossil’s new wellness app. You’ll still get Wear OS apps like Pandora Nike+ Run Club Spotify and Google’s entire suite of programs of course.

Fossil Gen 5 LTE review: Battery Life

Like the regular Fossil Gen 5 the Fossil Gen 5 LTE has a number of battery management tools that lets you determine how long you want your smartwatch to last. Forever isn’t an option but based on how you use the watch you’ll experience different staminas.

You can choose from Daily Custom Extended and Time Only. Based on my experience Daily and Custom will get you somewhere between 14 and 24 hours which is a little short by smartwatch standards. Extended grows that window to a few days (at the expense of most features) while Time Only turns the Fossil Gen 5 LTE into a normal-looking wristwatch.

No matter how I use it my Apple Watch Series 6 lasts just around 24 hours. Although the consistency is conducive to a charging schedule it would be nice if using less features rewarded me with longer battery life like it does with the Fossil Gen 5.

Fossil Gen 5 LTE review: Verdict

As the first Wear OS smartwatch with cellular support in the U.S. the Fossil Gen 5 LTE had big shoes to fill. Fossil still makes some of the best wearables in terms of both functionality and fashion and now customers have an LTE option.

But should they take it? I wish Fossil introduced more tangible upgrades for the Gen 5 LTE especially for the price. Since the standard Gen 5 now costs $199 the company is asking for an additional $150 for LTE support. That’s pricer than Apple’s premium for Cellular — for a watch with an aging chipset nonetheless. If you’re looking for an affordable LTE watch the Apple Watch SE with Cellular starts at $329. You’ll need an iPhone though.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ybXVsYXJhcGlkYS5uZXQvZW4vZjEtMjAyMS1saXN0LW9mLXBhcnRuZXJzLXNwb25zb3JzLWZvci1lYWNoLW9mLXRoZS0xMC10ZWFtcy_SAVxodHRwczovL2Zvcm11bGFyYXBpZGEubmV0L2VuL2YxLTIwMjEtbGlzdC1vZi1wYXJ0bmVycy1zcG9uc29ycy1mb3ItZWFjaC1vZi10aGUtMTAtdGVhbXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,F1 2021: List of partners/sponsors for each of the 10 teams,"The sport is incomplete without of partners and sponsors and all the F1 teams have found good support all these years with the list growing always.

How he earns his living is worlds apart from the traditional business of Bay Street.

For the past few years Dobson has been trading in cryptocurrencies stockpiling a horde of digital coins that have suddenly skyrocketed in price. In the real world he lives off of cash savings but on the Internet he works in myriad ways to harvest these tokens.

He considers it his full-time job.

""I'm very frugal with my money"" Dobson said. ""I focus my time stocking up on these coins so that when they explode [in price] I can take advantage of it.""

Prices for these cryptocurrencies which have less familiar names like ether and nano are exploding because they're riding on the coattails of bitcoin which has been on a feverish run. The going rate has catapulted from about $9000 per bitcoin a year ago to a peak of roughly $58000 in late February according to CoinDesk .

The tidal wave has showered digital wealth on Dobson and other Canadians with a stake in the game while attracting large players from Wall Street like never before.

Bitcoin's flirtation with mainstream acceptance and the gravity-defying climb in the price — along with some white-knuckle dips — have made headlines around the world and even captured the attention of the doubters.

Underneath the mania is a potential sea change in the world of finance that observers say was made possible by a global pandemic. And what's at stake is nothing less than a war for the future of money.

But there are plenty of skeptics. They warn bitcoin is a highly speculative investment play with no real value backing it up and that investors run the risk of crushing losses.

Oliver Dobson estimates banks handle only 10 or 20 per cent of his finances. He says he manages the rest in crypto networks. (Submitted by Oliver Dobson)

Create money out of thin air'

The rally has made Dobson's seemingly bizarre occupation all the more lucrative. Among other methods he said he uses bitcoin to buy other digital coins on crypto exchanges and sell them when they rise in price. He also keeps his eye out for so-called airdrops where crypto startups release free tokens or coins as part of a marketing stunt.

""If you're asking me how do you make your money? I guess in a way you just go try random stuff and they might just create money out of thin air and hand you some.""

The new wave of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies has its share of colourful characters. It also has some heavy hitters from legacy finance.

Wealthy investors and big institutions such as PayPal Holdings Inc. Mastercard Inc. Visa Inc. and Tesla Inc. are embracing bitcoin in various ways signalling broader approval of crypto for the first time.

The 2018 rout

To understand how this happened and what it all means it's helpful to look back at the last bitcoin wave which ended when investors watched vast sums of wealth get wiped out in a brutal crash.

Invented as an alternative to national currencies in the depths of the financial crisis in 2009 bitcoin enjoyed one of its sharpest climbs almost a decade later in 2017. The going rate escalated from less than $3000 per coin to nearly $20000 in six months.

This bitcoin boom was driven not by big institutions like banks and pension funds but by amateur regular investors making a bet on new technology said Alex McDougall the managing director of portfolio management at the bitcoin and digital asset fund manager 3iQ in Toronto.

People were drawn to an alternative to the legacy banking system McDougall said. Bitcoin and its underlying technology presented a possible end-run around these gatekeepers allowing people to do their own banking without a large financial institution.

""We saw this potential move towards a radically open world and an entire new generation of wealth could be created in an entirely different type of market participant"" McDougall said.

""We also saw a ton of scams and fraud and a bunch of quite frankly B.S. that sprung up around the market.""

The price of bitcoin ultimately crashed in 2018 dropping more than 80 per cent in a year. Left in the ashes were people who lost their life savings.

Monty Kohli a cryptocurrency investor in his early 20s at the time didn't face catastrophic losses but still watched up to $8000 in wealth disappear. Despite the setback he believes in the ethos of decentralized finance and continues to have money invested in digital coins but it's money he said he can afford to lose.

Now 25 Kohli said he's a bitcoin banker. He said he loans out tokens in a secondary crypto market where he collects interest though he maintains a day job working in the finance department of a Toronto company.

""My time horizon for investing is quite long and so that's where I can also afford to take some risk in my portfolio"" he said.

While long-time core believers like Kohli remain in the game some bigwigs on Wall Street are suddenly stepping in from the sidelines. And that's part of what makes this latest bitcoin wave so different.

COVID-19 fuelling the latest bitcoin rally

""There is relentless demand"" said Edward Moya a New York-based senior market analyst with the currency trading company Oanda Corp. ""What we're starting to see is Wall Street Main Street are really embracing the crypto world. Even when we have significant sell-off days there is still strong demand and it's global.""

Moya said the arguments in favour of an alternative to government-issued currency haven't changed all that much but critical conditions have shifted in the past year making that case more persuasive.

""If we did not have COVID we would not be talking about bitcoin right now"" he said.

Central banks around the world have been pumping trillions of dollars into their economies to help them survive crippling lockdowns and various restrictions meant to control the spread of COVID-19.

A major concern with all the pandemic-related stimulus is that it threatens to 'devalue or debase' national currencies said Gavin Brown a senior lecturer and associate professor of financial technology at the University of Liverpool. (Gavin Brown)

A major concern with all of that stimulus is that it threatens to ""devalue or debase"" national currencies said Gavin Brown a senior lecturer and associate professor of financial technology at the University of Liverpool. ""The purchasing power is less because quite simply there's more of it and therefore it's worth less.""

Bitcoin on the other hand is ""not controlled by a central bank; it doesn't have any domicile; doesn't have any formal governance structure like you would expect with a company or a nation state"" Brown said.

""Instead the supply of bitcoins is controlled by mathematical code and computer code which means that the supply side of bitcoin is known at all times. It will never be more than 21 million [coins in circulation].""

Critical infrastructure allows for big investments

Cash was already on the decline for years while the pandemic has accelerated demand for fast and convenient digital payments analysts at the investment bank J.P. Morgan said in a recent report.

""The pandemic has boosted demand for digital services and also for 'alternative' currencies as multiple rounds of stimulus accommodative monetary policy and excess savings have boosted money supply leading to record inflows into bitcoin investment vehicles.""

Another important change is that critical storage infrastructure required to hold large sums of bitcoin for institutional investors is now available. Tesla revealed in early February it had bought $1.5 billion US in bitcoin something that ""would have been almost impossible just a couple of years ago due to the lack of institutional controls and infrastructure at play"" Brown said.

It's not only easier for some large institutions to invest the academic said it's also more publicly acceptable — entirely different than the 2017 surge.

A bet or an investment?

Some bright minds in finance don't buy all of the enthusiasm. Stephen Poloz the former governor of the Bank of Canada said in an interview that bitcoin is more of a speculative investment play than it is a currency.

""Even the pros who deal in bitcoin often use the word 'bet' rather than 'invest' which suggests in our minds it's sufficiently volatile; it really is close to gambling as opposed to actual investment since the asset itself has no intrinsic value"" said Poloz a special advisor at the law firm Osler Hoskin & Harcourt.

""But that doesn't mean that it can't become mainstream.""

Poloz said the Toronto Stock Exchange took important steps in this direction by listing two bitcoin exchange-traded funds. It means investors can put money into bitcoin under a regulated system of controls that ensure those investments are backed by the coins.

Dobson the crypto token trader said the funds traded on the stock market and other developments such as PayPal's foray into bitcoin represent the antithesis of why cryptocurrencies exist in the first place.

""Would you appreciate it if you agreed yesterday to buy a car paying in bitcoin and then you go to pick it up today and it cost you 16 percent more today than yesterday? - Stephen Poloz former governor of the Bank of Canada

""The whole point of cryptocurrency is that it's peer-to-peer decentralized digital currency; it's immutable it's uncensorable and it's yours purely yours"" he said.

""They don't give you access to withdraw your coins so you never actually own them.""

Dobson estimates that banks handle only 10 or 20 per cent of his finances and he manages the rest in crypto networks.

""Dollars don't make more dollars"" he said meaning he can make higher returns holding onto cryptos than national currencies ""so I keep basically everything I possibly can out of dollars. I do everything in my power to make sure that the amount of Canadian dollars that I'm holding is the smallest amount that I can get away with.""

But Poloz argues bitcoin can't replace national currencies in part because it takes far longer to process transactions. If for example someone used bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee the drink would likely be cold by the time the payment cleared. While the technology could theoretically improve to make payments faster he said there is no fundamental value behind the coins leaving the price vulnerable to wild swings.

""Would you appreciate it if you agreed yesterday to buy a car paying in bitcoin and then you go to pick it up today and it cost you 16 per cent more today than yesterday?"" he said. ""That's not the kind of volatility that you can endure in something that is being used for payments.""

'A real seismic shift'

There is no shortage of predictions of where bitcoin's latest wave is headed. The financial services firm UBS Wealth Management reportedly warned investors there is little stopping cryptocurrency prices from falling to zero. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she worries about potential investor losses.

Brown the fintech academic from the U.K. said there probably will be a correction or drop in the price of bitcoin over the coming weeks and months but he expects the appeal of a decentralized currency won't disappear.

""It allows them to move money without a payment intermediary"" he said. ""The idea of doing banking without a bank ... that is a paradigm that flies in the face of not just centuries of financial development but millennia. That's a real seismic shift.""

Still Brown doesn't believe bitcoin will someday dominate global finance. Where this is ultimately headed he predicts is a digital currency war.

There are three groups that Brown believes will be competing for supremacy: decentralized coins like bitcoin; corporate coins such as one launched by J.P. Morgan and the currency Facebook proposes; and finally future digital currencies backed by central banks.

Sir Tom Jones was the guest on this week’s edition of BBC Two's Later… with Jools Holland and during his appearance they spoke about his new album Surrounded By Time. Jools wanted to know why Sir Tom had chosen the songs specifically to appear on them and the conversation turned to one of the last things his wife said to him before she died.

“The whole record seems to go through - not only have you celebrated this birthday you’ve lost a wife recently - you’ve been through a lot lately” Jools remarked. “I don’t want to go on like a tabloid paper but it’s been a hard few years. Has that all come into play when trying to make this [album]?” “Yes” Sir Tom replied. “Songs take on a different meaning from experiences that you’ve had in life. “So after living for 80 years I thought ‘let’s do an album with songs that I’ve collected over the years but songs now that mean more to me now than before’.

This is a historic step towards achieving the goal to ensure equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines globally in what will be the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history.

Cargo carrying life-saving COVID-19 vaccines has landed in Fiji to support the @FijianGovt in protecting people against this disease.



Many thanks to all our partners and donors for making this historic moment a reality.@FijiPM @FijiAirways @Nadokoulu @UNICEF @UNICEFSupply pic.twitter.com/G3x0EgdWKV — UNICEF Pacific (@UNICEFPacific) March 6 2021

The arrival of 12000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine marks the first batch of vaccines to arrive in the Pacific region under the COVAX Facility in its unprecedented effort to deliver at least two billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021.

Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama in receiving the vaccines at the Nadi Airport yesterday evening stated that this is a small yet important step towards protecting Fijians from a plague that has claimed millions of lives around the world.

“These vaccines represent more than the way back to normal life; they are the shot of life our economy our industries and thousands of Fijian breadwinners need. It is about bringing back jobs reconnecting families across borders and reclaiming Fiji’s rightful place in the world” Prime Minister Bainimarama stated.

Prime Minister Bainimarama added that the only way we can ensure Fijian’s health and wellbeing is through being vaccinated along with the rest of the world. Moreover under the digitalFiji umbrella an online registration portal will ensure a smooth nationwide roll-out of the vaccinations.

Dr. Seth Berkley CEO of Gavi the Vaccination Alliance emphasized that “COVAX's mission is to help end the acute phase of the pandemic as soon as possible allowing global equitable access to vaccines against COVID-19.”

“The successful arrival of these vaccines is the product of global solidarity and partnership and a recognition that we need to vaccinate those on the front lines of the pandemic and the most vulnerable in every corner of the world to ensure that all corners of the world are safe” said UNICEF Pacific Representative Sheldon Yett. “We thank the Government of Fiji for their leadership and our partners for making this possible.”

“WHO is proud to play our part in achieving this milestone in Fiji” said the Acting WHO South Pacific Representative Dr. Akeem Ali. “With the support from partners Fiji has worked incredibly hard to be in a position to be able to receive the vaccine from COVAX. I would like to acknowledge the hard work by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services team in preparing for the arrival of vaccines from identifying priority groups developing tracking systems to upskilling their staff to be able to safely deliver this vaccine. This arrival means that frontline workers and high-risk populations can begin to be vaccinated. WHO will continue to work alongside our colleagues from the Ministries of Health in Fiji and across the Pacific to continue to plan for their use of COVID-19 vaccines.”

The Fijian Ministry of Health and Medical Services is targeting frontline staff in line with global recommendations. This will include frontline healthcare workers selected Fiji Airways staff; Airports Fiji Limited staff; Fiji Immigration Department; along with quarantine workers as the recipients of this first batch of vaccines to support the opening of Fiji borders.

For several months COVAX partners have been supporting governments and partners in its readiness efforts in preparation for this moment. They have been especially active in working with countries benefitting from the Advance Market Commitment (AMC) an innovative financial mechanism to help secure global and equitable access for COVID-19 vaccines. This includes assisting with the development of national vaccination plans support for cold chain infrastructure as well as stockpiling of half a billion syringes and safety boxes for their disposal masks gloves and other equipment to ensure that there is enough equipment for health workers to start vaccinating priority groups as soon as possible.

Vaccines are now arriving in batches to supported countries following the necessary preparatory work to ensure immediate administration of vaccines to priority groups identified by national governments in their vaccine deployment plans. Fiji has completed preparatory work in good time and therefore able to receive allotted vaccines from COVAX today.

As vaccines start to roll out around the world they should complement and not replace proven public health measures. It is also important to expand access to rapid diagnostics and treatments such as oxygen and dexamethasone as advocated for by the ACT Accelerator. Fiji like other countries will continue to apply tried-and-tested measures to successfully prevent and control transmission such as physical distancing masks ventilation and hand hygiene alongside robust programmes to test trace isolate and treat.

The COVAX mechanism is offering a portfolio of vaccines suitable for a range of settings and populations and is on track to meet its goal of delivering at least two billion doses of vaccine to participating countries around the globe in 2021 including at least 1.3 billion donor-funded doses to the 92 lower-income COVAX Facility participants supported by the Gavi COVAX AMC. Fiji welcomes the arrival of this batch of vaccines and look forward to receiving additional batches needed to complete the vaccination of all eligible Fijians.

Prime Minister Bainimarama also thanked organisations behind the COVAX Facility including GAVI the WHO UNICEF and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Initiatives and other development partners that contributed to COVAX to help bring the vaccines to Fiji.

On 6 March Fiji became the first country in the Pacific region to receive the COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX initiative.

“Had a productive meeting with @CharlesMichel. Appreciate @eucopresident commitment to strengthening Africa-Europe ties including with the private sector. We look forward to collaborating on equitable access to vaccines & improved management of current & future pandemics” President Kagame tweeted

Information from the Office of the President says that the officials “are in Rwanda to support the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination campaign with vaccines obtained through COVAX and to advocate for international collaboration for equitable access to vaccines.”

“Broad range of bilateral regional and global topics reviewed today with President @PaulKagame of Rwanda. Focus on concrete action to fight pandemic and prepare post-COVID-19 recovery” Michel tweeted.

Earlier during the day the visitors witnessed the inoculation activity in rural Bugesera district Eastern Province where Michel tweeted; ” In Africa now in Rwanda. In Mayange Health Centre proud to witness the inoculation of first anti-COVID-19 vaccines brought by COVAX. EU is one of the main contributors to this international solidarity initiative.”

Between March and 5 and 6 Rwanda launched COVID-19 vaccination campaign with high risk categories which include health practitioners COVID-19 social distancing volunteers teachers journalists elderly people defence forces inmates with underlying health conditions those who have disabilities or are over 65 years are being among others.

According to Rwanda’s Ministry of Health nearly 160000 people have been vaccinated so far while the target is to reach 7 million in near future.

“Thank you @RwandaHealth for setting an important example by having a clear vaccination strategy that prioritizes those most at-risk and vulnerable – great to see that work begin” wrote Seth Berkley CEO of Gavi the vaccine alliance this afternoon."

U.S. District Judge Colm Connolly granted a request Thursday by the National Retail Federation the Washington Legal Foundation and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America to file a brief in support of Walmart's motion to dismiss the case.

The Justice Department filed the suit against Walmart on Dec. 22 in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. It claims that Walmart filled large numbers of invalid opioid prescriptions through its pharmacies among other violations of the Controlled Substances Act.

The Bentonville retailer has more than 5000 pharmacies in its stores and clubs nationwide.

Court records describe the National Retail Federation as the world's largest trade association representing retailers from the U.S. and more than 45 countries. The federation submits supporting briefs ""in cases raising significant legal issues for the retail community"" according to the documents.

The Chamber of Commerce of the United States is the world's largest business federation. Its function includes representing the interests of more than 3 million businesses and professional organizations ""in matters before Congress the Executive Branch and the courts"" according to the filings.

The Washington Legal Foundation is described in the court documents as a nonprofit public-interest law firm and policy center.

These organizations said in their brief that the Justice Department is wrong to hold a company responsible for its employees ""filling allegedly improper prescriptions without any allegation that the employees who filled the prescription possessed knowledge of irregularities in the prescriptions.""

This approach the brief states means a company can be found to ""knowingly"" violate a regulation if one employee reports information to a compliance department and another employee no matter how distant fills a prescription while unaware of the report.

""If [Justice Department] uses a company's own findings as if they are part of an interconnected 'hive' mind"" it will have ""deeply troubling far-reaching effects"" according to the brief.

The case is United States of America v. Walmart Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores East LP.

Walmart filed a suit on Oct. 22 against the Justice Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration seeking to resolve inconsistencies in the agencies' rules and their enforcement under the Controlled Substances Act.

That suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.

Federal Judge Sean Jordan dismissed the suit on Feb. 4 ruling that the defendants had not waived ""sovereign immunity"" in the case. Sovereign immunity means the government cannot be sued without its consent according to Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute.

Walmart said the next day that it would appeal. The judge's decision ""is purely procedural based on when the federal government can be sued and does not resolve the public health concerns raised on our case"" the company said.

Walmart's suit was filed preemptively in response to the Justice Department's threat to sue the retailer for ""continuing to fill opioid prescriptions of certain licensed doctors -- many of whom are still authorized by DEA to prescribe opioids to this day"" the retailer said in court documents.

""When a patient presents a pharmacist with an opioid prescription written by a doctor who is licensed by a state medical board and credentialed by DEA to prescribe controlled substances the pharmacist must make a difficult decision"" according to Walmart's complaint.

""The pharmacist can accept the doctor's medical judgment and fill the opioid prescription or second-guess the doctor's judgment and refuse to fill it -- a decision the pharmacist must make without the benefit of a medical license examining the patient or having access to medical records"" the company said in court records.

(WYMT) - Middlesboro Police officers say a traffic stop led to three arrests Saturday evening.

They say a traffic stop was conducted on a black Ford F-150 involved in a burglary at Slusher Family Dental.

Upon arrival deputies learned that an air compressor was stolen. Through surveillance cameras from a neighboring business deputies learned the registration number of the car involved in the burglary and get a brief description of the two suspects.

Later around 4:20 p.m. outside the Middlesboro Walmart a truck matching the description was spotted and pulled over.

Deputies noticed an air compressor in the bed of the truck. While being read their rights the driver police say 49-year-old David Roark confessed to the burglary. A passenger 21-year-old James Madden was also found to have been involved in the burglary as he was wearing the same clothes as one of the suspects in the surveillance video police added.

The front passenger 36-year-old Anthony Morrison consented to a search during the stop in which two bags of meth were found as well as $177 in cash.

Roark and Madden were both charged in relation to the burglary while Morrison was charged with trafficking.

Some experiences were shut and not all guests followed rules but I still felt the Disney magic.

I even liked certain changes and hope the impromptu parades and character interactions stick around.

After months spent mostly indoors my husband and I decided to visit Disney World for our 10th wedding anniversary.

We packed our bags and flew to Orlando Florida in September — three months since the theme park reopened its gates on July 11 and six months since they shuttered on March 16 — for a four-day vacation.

As a lifelong Disney fan and someone who writes about theme parks for a living I had been closely monitoring the news regarding Disney World's reopening and despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's advice to avoid nonessential travel my husband and I made the decision to check it out.

The trip was unlike any other I've taken to Disney World and I found that this time understandably there was no escaping reality — even in ""the most magical place on Earth."" I had no problem following COVID-19 protocol by practicing social distancing and wearing a mask and I had a good time.

It will feature galleries and hundreds of artifacts fresh from the Disney vaults and an immersive environment of sight and sound. The Walt Disney Company partnered with SC Exhibitions to begin production on the exhibit that celebrates a century of innovation history and Disney's legacy SC Exhibitions said.

The 15000 square foot yet-to-be-named exhibition will showcase stories and characters from the Walt Disney Company from 1923 to 2023 SC Exhibitions CEO Dieter Semmelmann said.

""The Franklin Institute is thrilled to debut this world premiere exhibition in Philadelphia during the remarkable 100th anniversary of The Walt Disney Company"" President and CEO of the Franklin Institute Larry Dubinski said. ""We look forward to celebrating the legacy of a creative empire synonymous with imaginative storytelling innovation discovery and wonder that spans generations and delivers widespread undeniable global appeal.""

After the exhibition launches at the Institute in February a second global exhibition is set to launch in March.

Historian and internationally recognized Walt Disney expert Paula Sigman Lowery said many of the objects featured in the exhibit have never been seen outside the company's archival animation and Imagineering vaults.

“It’s thrilling to bring Disney’s crown jewels – art memorabilia costumes props and one-of-a kind treasures – to public view – and to explore the story of one of the world’s most creative entertainment companies"" she said.

SC Exhibitions is collaborating with TK a Berlin-based collective of architects visual artists and entertainment technology experts for the third time to create this exhibit.

TK previously brought in the ‘Marvel: Universe of Super Heroes’ to the Franklin Institute in 2019 which brought in rare and original Marvel artefacts like the publisher's own comic book pages costumes and props.

The Franklin Institute closed last fall when the city imposed stricter COVID-19 restrictions. It reopened in January 2020.

The Institute is open Wednesday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFnZXdlc3QuY29tL1RyYXZlbC9GYW1pbHktVHJhdmVsL1RoZW1lLVBhcmtzLUhhdmUtQmlnLVBsYW5zLWZvci0yMDIx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Updates at Disney and Universal Theme Parks for 2021,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelagewest.com/Travel/Family-Travel/Theme-Parks-Have-Big-Plans-for-2021 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFnZXdlc3QuY29tL1RyYXZlbC9GYW1pbHktVHJhdmVsL1RoZW1lLVBhcmtzLUhhdmUtQmlnLVBsYW5zLWZvci0yMDIx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjEvMDMvZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLXNwcmluZy1icmVhay1jYXBhY2l0eS1hZDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney World is Running out of Park Reservations for March - Inside the Magic,"If you have been to Disney World during the ongoing pandemic you likely have had to get used to a few park operational changes. One of the biggest differences for Guests is that they now need to make a Disney Park Pass reservation in order to gain admission into a Disney theme park. With capacity being reduced to 35% snagging a Disney Park Pass to your park of choice can be difficult depending on the date park and time of year. Now it seems that amid the pandemic Spring Break will be as crowded as possible this year.

One way Guests can map out what days are available for Disney Park Passes would be to check the availability calendar. We did just that and noticed that in the middle of March there are already four days where EPCOT Magic Kingdom Disney’s Animal Kingdom and Disney’s Hollywood Studios are all already at capacity.

As you can see above March 15-18 are greyed out which means that there are no parks available for Guests to choose from. Another interesting thing to note is that there are no green days left in March. This means that every day for the rest of the month already has one or more Disney parks at capacity. Therefore if there is a date that you were planning on visiting Disney World this month it would be best to grab a Disney Park Pass as soon as possible to ensure you have a spot in the park.

If the park you want to visit is already at capacity for the date you pick there is still a chance you can enter! If you have a Disney pass that has the ability to allow for Park Hopping Guests can Park Hop to their park of choice after 2:00 pm so long as they have entered the park of their Disney Park Pass reservation. Be sure to call the capacity hotline 407-560-500 before Park Hopping to ensure that your next Disney Park will be allowing Guests in especially on days when all Disney Park Pass reservations are sold out.

I’m so glad that I did. This little snack needs to be added to your must-eat list. Immediately.

The spoon bread which features jalapeños bacon and house-made whipped honey butter is new to The Honey Bee-stro this year and sells for $4.75. The spoon bread is the size of a standard muffin but don’t let its seemingly small size dissuade you from giving it a try.

While you might be tempted to think it’s just a piece of corn bread it’s not. While it does have a corn meal texture the spoon bread has a bit of a pudding-like consistency thus calling for the need to use a spoon to eat it.

Once you dig in you’ll find whole kernels of sweet corn in the spoon bread and an overall lovely bed of warmth coming from the jalapeños used in the recipe. The house-made whipped honey butter (read that again: house-made. Whipped. Honey. Butter.) on top of the bread is incredibly good and proved to be the perfect counterbalance for the jalapeños’ heat. The entire thing is topped by a piece of crispy bacon.

I didn’t know what to expect with my first bite of the spoon bread. I was delightfully surprised. I now have my first dish at this year’s festival that I’ll be purchasing again and if you’re making a visit to the festival I heartily ask that you consider adding it to your must-eat list.

If you have something that you’d recommend that I add to my festival must-eat list please let me know in the comment section below.

Officially Opens Zack Snyder's Justice League Exhibit After Slight Delay,"Earlier this week DC fans in Dallas Texas shared images from “The Dreamscapes of Zack Snyder's Justice League” exhibit revealing the film's Knightmare sequence and Snyder's original plans for multiple Justice League films.

The posted photos included the Knightmare costumes for Mera and Deathstroke early storyboards from Snyder's Justice League trilogy and weapons carried by Jared Leto's Joker and Harley Quinn in 2016's Suicide Squad.

A number of these spoiler-heavy photos were quickly taken down sparking confusion surrounding the exhibit's potential opening. However a happy ending has come about for those wanting to attend this impressive display...

WARNER BROS. OFFICIALLY OPENS THE SNYDER EXHIBIT

According to @JackEJensen the Zack Snyder Justice League Exhibit in Dallas did not open on March 5 2021 per Warner Bros.'s request.

Despite this decision the Twitter account for Zack Snyder's Justice League has now officially announced that the exhibit will open from March 6 2021. The display will be open everyday from 12pm to 8pm CST at the AT&T Discovery District in Dallas with a maximum capacity of 20 people.

The announcement was accompanied by new images from the showcase including an up-close look at the Superman militia outfit a display of the Flash's Justice League suit and photos of Mera and Batman's Knightmare costumes.

Many were confused by the initial decision to shut down the exhibit speculating that this may have been made in tandem with the takedowns of leaked images to prevent further spoilers. WarnerMedia Head of Comms Johanna Fuentes debunked these claims saying that the showcase's opening was postponed as the team ""were not done setting up.""

Fuentes also shared that the exhibit will remain open in Dallas Texas for ""the next few months.""

WHAT THE SNYDER CUT EXHIBIT REVEALS

The Zack Snyder's Justice League Exhibit in Dallas revealed two things: the Knightmare sequence from Snyder's cut and Snyder's original vision for a Justice League trilogy.

The director has let it be known that the Knightmare universe would've played a significant role in his Justice League 2 where Superman would've been the villain. It very much appears that the Knightmare sequence will now play a prominent role in the Snyder Cut instead continuing where the director left off in Batman v Superman.

While it may have initially seemed that the studio didn't want any more information about the film getting out ahead of its March 18 release it now seems clear that the exhibit was just not ready to be shown off to the public. This does seem strange to show off a good amount from the film's production before it has even released but perhaps there are even more secrets not present in the display that are still being kept under wraps.

The event is scheduled on the first day the governor's order goes into effect lifting public health measures.

""For an establishment I think to host a party and advertise it publicly is a slap in the face to health care workers who are on the front lines watching and seeing death every single day"" Houston resident Brittany Vasquez said.

The flier was posted and promoted on the Instagram of Concrete Cowboy a popular night club on Washington Avenue in Houston.

Another resident said he won't be attending but believes they have the right to do what they want.

""I do believe it's the personal businesses right to decide for themselves what dress code they want to enforce whether that's a mask or no mask"" Max Levy said. ""I think at the same time it's your right to stay home or shelter in place.""

Concrete Cowboy has since changed out that flier but local leaders say that's not enough.

They are now demanding the event be canceled.

""Having a mask off party in the middle of a city that has every potential variant of the COVID disease spreading is not only irresponsible but deadly"" Texas State Representative Ann Johnson said.

A doctor who's been working around the clock treating COVID patients also weighed in saying he understands COVID fatigue but we've come to far to let up.

""You want to open your business you want to open your store. Open the store. I have no problem with that what I have a problem is some using the mask others not using the mask and like I told you for this to work we both have to wear it"" Chief of Staff at United Memorial Medical Center Joseph Varon said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkZ3VsbHkuY29tL2Rpc2NvdmVyeS1sYXVuY2hlcy1uZXctZG9jdW1lbnRhcnktdmFuZGUtYmhhcmF0LWZsaWdodC1peDEzNDQtMTAxNTk1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,discovery+ launches new documentary Vande Bharat Flight IX1344,"Amidst the pandemic that has taken the lives of millions perhaps the only hope is the security of being in one’s own country among your loved ones in a place that you call home.

Korea Times photo by Choi Won-suk



By Anna J. Park



Waste management companies appear to be growing more attractive for profit-seeking private equity funds (PEFs) not only due to their indispensable roles in the consumer-oriented environment but also by coinciding with the environment social and governance (ESG) criteria for measuring sustainability which is becoming crucial in attracting investments.



The latest deal that has caught the attention of market watchers was waste disposal business Eco Management Korea (EMK)'s recapitalization raising the firm's secured debt to 370 billion won ($327 million) from 110 billion won. Recapitalization is a financial investment method that raises new capital by borrowing additional secured loans from banks. Through the process initial investors can take back their principal while the remaining debt will be paid when the business is sold at a higher price.



Through the successful capital restructuring deal led by venture capital firm IMM Investment and state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB)'s private equity department EMK's corporate value has risen to about 800 billion won ($709 million) roughly doubling from the firm's value assessed in 2017.



IMM Investment purchased EMK for around 400 billion won in early 2017 and KDB's PE department joined the funding deal as a General Partner (GP) operating and managing investors' capital in the fund. Market watchers estimate that the corporate value of EMK which operates over 10 local waste management firms and services ranging from collection to energy recycling could rise further to one billion won in the next few years.



Another case illustrating lucrative gains by private equity firms investing in local waste disposal businesses was SK Engineering & Construction's acquisition last September of EMC holdings Korea's biggest waste management firm.



Private equity firm Affirma Capital sold its full stake in EMC Holdings to SK E&C for 1.05 billion won amid heated competition among bidders. Given that the waste disposal firm's corporate value stood at around 125 billion won when Affirma Capital decided to invest the private equity firm gleaned more than an eight-fold profit in just four years.



SK Group bought the waste management corporation after anticipating that Korea's waste disposal market could grow into one of the most profitable businesses in the future in addition to their positive social implications for ESG investments particularly from a sustainable development perspective.

Consistent with the European Green Recovery and its aspiration to shift to a more circular economy P&G has been the first FMCG company to join the RecyClass initiative a certification approach for recycling requirements to help deliver the goal of making plastic packaging circular with traceability along the whole value chain. P&G obtained a record high of 12 product and technology approvals on its packaging across Hair Care Home Care and Fabric Care brands confirming they meet the Design-for-Recycling criteria guidelines determined by RecyClass.

P&G Shave Care brands Gillette and Venus are making strides to eliminate 545 metric tons of plastic over a year by moving to recyclable carton packaging ia.e. the equivalent of over 55 million water bottles. Moving towards a reuse model breathes longevity into existing products to minimise waste. Household haircare brands Head and Shoulders Pantene Herbal Essences and Aussie launched at scale a new reusable 100% aluminium bottle alongside its recyclable refill pouch made using 60% less plastic enabling consumers to maximise product lifecycles.

“Much has changed in the last year but our commitment to enabling and inspiring positive impacts through our supply chain our brands and our partnerships has remained the same” said Virginie Helias P&G Chief Sustainability Officer. “We are innovating to accelerate the development of the circular economy: from spearheading the Holy Grail intelligent sorting concept reducing our use of virgin petroleum plastic and increasing recycled material content to developing alternative refill models at scale. This is a combination of innovation and collective action.”

Reducing plastic use and increasing circularity

RecyClass’ key focus is to drive plastic packaging circularity P&G is named as the first FMCG company to join the initiative an independent platform originated from Plastic Recyclers Europe (PRE). P&G has received 12 product and technology approvals for its brands Oral B Tide Ariel and more all of whom have redesigned their packs to make them recyclable and meet the RecyClass requirements. This cross-industry collaboration is essential to drive scale and deliver on P&G’s circularity goals.

Higher recycled content means reducing dependency upon fossil fuel. More than 10000 tonnes of recycled plastic are now used every year across P&G Fabric and Home Care brands in Fairy Mr Proper Swiffer and Lenor.

Breathing new life into existing materials by efficient recycling

Recyclable packaging is often the most familiar starting point to engage with the notion of a circular economy. Improving the recycling rates is essential to bring a new life for exiting materials. Led by P&G in 2015 Project HolyGrail is an award-winning technology designed to enhance packaging waste sorting in the EU with the objective to improve both the quality and quantity of recycled plastic. This watermarking technology is gaining momentum and is now expanding as part of AIM the European Brands Association key initiatives. More than 120 companies from across the value chain are participating in this pioneering project. Outside sorting data management and consumer engagement are key pillars to the initiative. Increasing consumer participation and adopting advanced sorting technologies are essential to improve the recycling rates in Europe. P&G is hopeful that this effort to demonstrate the potential of the technology will be recognised by the European Commission and incorporated into their plans for the reform of the Packaging & Packaging Waste Directive.

Beyond efficient sorting to enable circularity easy-to-recycle materials should be used at scale. Ensuring packaging remains functional whilst meeting the requirements for recycling systems across Europe is crucial to P&G’s innovation work.

In Europe P&G’s Fabric & Home care brands including Ariel Lenor and Dash pods bags and Fairy Automatic Dishwashing capsules bags started transitioning from a multilayer non-recyclable flexible packaging to a single layer recyclable packaging made of Polyethylene. This new packaging follows local eco-design criteria to ensure the films are compatible within local recycling streams. Improving the packaging of everyday items such as Oral B’s first HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) tubes is another example of how millions of households can now recycle their toothpaste packaging in existing streams. In the same bathroom Gillette and Venus have introduced brand new modern and sustainable packaging on their refillable razors range which sees the brand switch from plastic packaging to recyclable cardboard packaging.

Break the cycle to end waste through Reuse

Moving towards a consumer reuse consumption model breathes longevity into existing products to minimise waste. P&G enters the next phase with LOOP following pilot programs in New York and Paris. The 18 months pilot has taught us the importance of disruptive innovative refillable packaging that delights and is convenient. Through e-commerce expansion LOOP is looking to derive more consumer insights such as purchase cycles the preferred offers and the environmental impact at use. More learnings are essential to secure a reuse Model which delivers all the environmental and the consumer benefits.

In addition the cross-industry efforts with LOOP P&G is innovating with a breakthrough scaled model on reuse. P&G Hair Care brands Head & Shoulders Pantene Herbal Essences and Aussie are now able to make huge difference to how people combat bathroom waste. A new reusable 100% aluminium bottle and recyclable refill pouch en-masse is now available in many stores across Europe. This will enable 200 million European households to recycle reduce and reuse. This will result in 300 million fewer plastic bottles being produced yearly.

Some progress has been made in terms of consumer awareness building creation of producer responsibility organisations and listing of authorised recyclers and dismantlers. Yet the process is far from streamlined.

Collection of e-waste is still an enormous challenge. And the bulk of e-waste is still handled by the informal sector. Besides there are unverified reports of large quantities of e-waste being imported for refurbishment and re-exports. These often leak into the un-regularised recycling system.

So what can be done to regulate the waste stream ensure safe recycling and maximise its potential? Atin Biswas and Siddharth Ghanshyam Singh of the Centre for Science and Environment make vital suggestions on the way forward in their latest report ‘E-Waste Management in India: Challenges and Agenda’.

Emphasising that “the role of the informal sector in the recycling business needs to be re-positioned so that it can provide cost-effective opportunities without discounting environmental safety and amenable labour conditions” the authors chart out a six-point agenda to improve e-waste handling in line with environment goals.

First and foremost they feel it is crucial to fill the data gap. For this an inventory of e-waste collected and recycled by authorised recyclers and the amount that’s imported is of utmost importance. Only if every State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) files reports on the generated and recycled numbers can we have an overview of the challenge of managing this waste stream.

The authors point out that under the direction of the National Green Tribunal the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has created an e-waste review portal; in the last update provided by CPCB in February 2020 only 29 SPCBs and Pollution Control Committees had begun filing the required quarterly returns. Besides none of this data had been released in the public domain. Import of e-waste too needs regulation with details on permissions given and status of recycling available.

For the law to be effective there is need for stringent enforcement of Extended Producer Responsibility targets. The authors feel that the integration of the formal and informal sectors is a must as also proper mapping of stakeholders.

Informal e-waste hubs must be monitored to ensure that workers have adequate safety and suitable compensation. Producers of electronic goods must be held liable for environmental toxicity due to improper handling or leakages.

Of equal priority is incentivising recycling schemes. The five per cent GST levied on recyclers in the formal sector must be waived. This and other measures will make recycling economically viable.

Last but not least consumer awareness campaigns need to be stepped up. It should be mandatory for manufacturers to carry information about safe disposal in advertisements as well as on the packaging.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHA6Ly9icmlnaHRlcmthc2htaXIuY29tL3NvbGlkLXdhc3RlLW1hbmFnZW1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solid Waste Management,"4 wards to be identified; 100% waste collection will take place: SMC Comm

The ship with 3711 people aboard remained quarantined off Yokohama Japan for more than a month and in the aftermath of that outbreak cruise ships were turned away from ports worldwide over fears of contagion leaving thousands of people stranded at sea.

In the late 19th century there was another story of a plague ship that struck fear into the hearts of bystanders onshore.

In the summer of 1878 the steamboat John D. Porter was on its way up the Mississippi River towing a freight of 14 barges. People thought little of it when the boat stopped at a city called Vicksburg on July 24 to drop off two sick crewmen.

The same day a New Orleans newspaper reported that 14 people in that city had been diagnosed with yellow fever and seven of them had died. It was the very place where the Porter had picked up its cargo only days before.

This illustration depicts a yellow fever victim in a Jefferson Street home in Memphis. It's from a series of images entitled The Great Yellow Fever Scourge: Incidents of Its Horrors in the Most Fatal District of the Southern States. (Bettmann Archive)

Back on the river the crew of the steamer didn't hear the news right away. As they continued upstream word began to spread along the shorelines. Residents of Vicksburg telegraphed ahead to Memphis Tenn. to warn the city that both crewmen the Porter had left behind had died.

The Porter was refused berth at Memphis. When confronted about the illness bedevilling his vessel the captain admitted that three men had died but claimed their deaths were the result of ""too free use of ice water while overheated.""

The residents of the communities that lined the Mississippi weren't so cavalier. As rumours that the Porter was ""a floating pest-house"" spread up and down the river the captain's coverup went from figurative to literal. He seems to have ordered that the boat's name be concealed with a canvas to prevent people ashore from hounding the vessel.

The occasional port disbelieving the hearsay still allowed the Porter to dock which enabled sick or frightened crew members to disembark carrying the fever with them. New crew members took their places only to become infected themselves.

By the time the towboat reached Cincinnati the crew were ready to get off but they were forbidden to lay anchor. Instead officials sent two doctors aboard and cut the vessel loose.

Now a complete pariah the Porter meandered aimlessly upriver stopping occasionally in the dark of night so the crew could bury their dead but moving on again before morning. Legend has it that locals patrolled the riverbanks with rifles to chase the boat away if it came too near the shore.

Finally the steamer's engine broke down and the crew were able to jump ship leaving the boat and its barges below an Ohio town called Gallipolis. Curiosity-seekers perhaps thinking the vessels were safe now that they had been abandoned went to gawk at the deserted hulk. One after another they too succumbed to the saffron scourge.

One woman came down with yellow fever after wearing clothing that had been taken off the boat. Another who had gone aboard to rescue some starving birds died just days later.

It became clear to everyone that the fever wasn't being transmitted person to person. There was something about the boat and barges themselves that was causing the infection and they were eventually towed back to Cincinnati and burned.

Three years later a Cuban doctor named Carlos Finlay would theorize that yellow fever was spread through the bite of infected mosquitoes and he would be proven right before the turn of the century.

The summer of 1878 was unusually hot and humid and the Porter's barges half-filled with bilge-water became a breeding-ground for the insects. Everywhere the boat made land the flies dispersed leaving a wake of disease behind.

Twenty thousand people perished in the Mississippi Valley epidemic that summer before cooling temperatures drove the mosquitoes into hibernation.

The towboat alone wasn't responsible for the spread of the illness. Tens of thousands of people fled afflicted cities dispersing the fever widely throughout the region.

The Porter's tragic journey though was the most memorable event of the outbreak a cautionary tale about the truth of Health Minister John Haggie's observation early in our own pandemic that ""the virus only moves when people move."" Unlike the Diamond Princess and other cruise ships which strived to contain COVID when the disease was identified aboard the Porter steamed rashly ahead.

“Despite the unfavorable and unstable winter weather conditions in the Persian Gulf the drilling operations of phase 11 of South Pars are underway without interruption and so far 4180 meters of drilling has been done” Hamid-Reza Masoudi said.

According to the official the drilling operations of the mentioned phase begun on December 14 2020.

He pointed out that in order to achieve early production from this phase drilling operations will be conducted in two stages saying: “In the first stage a descriptive well and three production wells will be drilled and completed and then after the installation of the phase’s platform eight more wells will be drilled and completed.”

Emphasizing that Petropars tries to make maximum use of the capacities and capabilities of domestic companies and workforce in developing this phase Masoudi said: ""This project has so far offered direct employment for about 500 people while creating indirect job opportunities for about 2000 people.”

Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh on December 14 2020 ordered the official beginning of the drilling operations for the first well of Phase 11 in the Persian Gulf waters.

An offshore drilling rig belonging to Mapna Drilling Company was settled at the mentioned phase’s SPD-11B platform on November 6 2020.

In the early production stage the output of this phase will reach 500 million cubic feet (equivalent to 14 million cubic meters) per day.

In November 2016 Iran signed a $4.8 billion agreement with a consortium including France’s Total China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Petropars a subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) on development of phase 11 however Total and CNPCI pulled out of the project in 2019 due to the U.S. sanctions.

Currently Petropars is developing the phase 11 project after its partners left the contract.

The South Pars phase 11 project will have a production capacity of two billion cubic feet per day or 370 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The produced gas will be fed into Iran's gas network.

South Pars is the world’s largest gas field covering an area of 3700 square kilometers of Iran’s territorial waters.

The giant field is estimated to contain a significant amount of natural gas accounting for about eight percent of the world’s reserves and approximately 18 billion barrels of condensate. The field is divided into 24 standard phases.

Laws was only half-kidding about the building burning down. With so much high-powered electrical infrastructure and a massive climate-control system humming along leaving the building without monitoring or maintenance might have been disastrous.

Nearly a year after the first COVID-19 lockdowns went into effect shuttering stadiums around the country around 3000 Flyers fans took their seats in the Wells Fargo Center on Sunday for the first time since the pandemic began.

The mood was festive if a bit quieter than in pre-pandemic times: 3100 people in an arena built for 20000 can make only so much noise. The city’s recently relaxed rules about indoor gatherings still require arenas such as the Wells Fargo to admit only 15% of their total capacity. But returning fans said they were thrilled to be back walking beneath a balloon arch that read in giant letters “Welcome Back Fans.”

As fans first entered the stadium Gritty the Flyers’ ubiquitous mascot shot streams of confetti at them. A handful of fans started a “Let’s Go Flyers” chant for TV cameras. “I’m so happy” one man exclaimed to no one in particular.

“It’s fantastic — it’s like coming home again” said Tom Hales of Collegeville. He and his wife Robbie have been season-ticket holders for a decade. He had few expectations for the game he said: “The Flyers are gonna win. That’s about it.”

Robbie Hales said she’d already been vaccinated and Tom Hales added he was “taking all precautions whatsoever.”

Fans were required to wear masks at all times unless eating or drinking and their seats in the stadium were marked with yellow seat covers spaced several seats and rows apart to ensure social distancing. Arena officials said they were operating on a two-strike system to enforce masking regulations: People caught without a mask would first be offered a written warning. They would be kicked out for a second violation.

“Communication has been important — if you don’t prepare fans it’s not going to work” said Phil Laws the general manager of the Wells Fargo Center. “There will be some fans that won’t make it to the end. Mask wearing is a key tenet of our safety plan.” He added that more than two dozen arenas have already opened around the country and that the Wells Fargo had consulted with other teams on how to implement safety measures successfully.

Interviewed on their way into the game several Flyers fans said they weren’t particularly concerned about contracting the virus. “I’m not concerned about no virus not at all” said Robert Bales of Secane Pa. He said he had bought tickets in the first seconds they were made available online. “I’m a pure Flyers fan — I’ve had season tickets for over 30 years” he said.

Still fans stuck to the arena protocols with nearly all keeping masks on. Cases of COVID-19 in New Jersey New York and Delaware have been increasing and in Philadelphia the case count seems to have plateaued. Even as he announced relaxed restrictions at the arena last week Philadelphia Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said that “the increasing number of cases in this region are reason to be concerned” adding that everyone in the city should wear masks and limit interactions with others until more people are vaccinated.

Several fans who came to Sunday’s game said they’d already been vaccinated. “We wouldn’t risk it otherwise” said Michelle Cho a health-care worker and Washington Capitols fan from Baltimore who drove up with Oscar Monzon a Baltimore firefighter who’s also been vaccinated.

Others said they were pleased with the arena’s safety protocols which included hand sanitizing stations and cashless payments at food and merchandise kiosks. Many were season-ticket holders who had been prioritized in ticket sales for the first game. The past year in sports fandom they said had been one like no other.

“It’s been a little up and down with emotions this year” said Tracey Lynch of Williamstown N.J. “We’ve been doing a lot of shouting at the TV instead of in the stadium.”

Despite the festive atmosphere the pandemic and the new normal it’s created were inescapable — between the signs reminding fans they wouldn’t be allowed in if they had COVID symptoms to the near-empty hallways and food kiosks. At commercial breaks announcers encouraged fans to show off their masks for the arena cameras and broadcast reminders of the new social distancing rules.

Still the hallmarks of a Philadelphia home game are hard to shake despite all that’s changed this year. In the game’s first period some of the loudest chants by far were boos directed at the referee.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS9uZXdzL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1mbHllcnMtZmFucy1yZXR1cm4td2VsbHMtZmFyZ28tY2VudGVyLWNvdmlkMTktcGFuZGVtaWMv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS9uZXdzL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1mbHllcnMtZmFucy1yZXR1cm4td2VsbHMtZmFyZ28tY2VudGVyLWNvdmlkMTktcGFuZGVtaWMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flyers Fans Return To Wells Fargo Center For 1st Time Since COVID-19 Pandemic Began,"PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- Flyers fans returned to Wells Fargo Center for the first time since COVID-19 closures shut down live sports in Philadelphia and beyond exactly one year ago.

About 3100 lucky fans were the first to get a chance to watch the Flyers live in nearly one year and while things may look a little different this year one thing that hasn't changed -- the passion of Philadelphia fans and Flyers Nation.

""It's exciting you know it's been a long year. Just getting back out there hearing fans come in even though it's 3000"" Daniel Redcay who works at Wells Fargo Center said. ""That's a start but just ready for the game night atmosphere again.""

""It's good to be back"" one fan said.

""We've waited for this for so long now"" another fan said.

For the first time in almost exactly a year fans were welcomed back inside Wells Fargo Center to watch the Flyers at home against the Capitals a 3-1 loss.

""It's just a lot of fun to see the players and hear everybody cheer"" Brandon Hoff said.

About 3100 fans -- 15% of capacity -- were greeted by Gritty and a sea of Orange and Black along with some safety changes.

""We've gone contactless we've gone cashless"" Mike Shane the CBO for the Flyers and Wells Fargo Center said.

Mobile tickets and in-seat concessions along with social-distanced seating were set up to reduce touchpoints and crowding.

""Really easy and even parking we bought it online beforehand and was able to scan it and in we go"" one fan said.

Something both fans and the nearly 400 employees who were able to come back to work Sunday say is worth it.

""They really are taking precautions making everyone feel safe"" Redcay said.

""It's nice to be able to get back to a bit of normalcy even though we still have to wear these masks. But hey if that's what it takes to see a live game that's fantastic"" Hoff said.

And despite the pandemic precautions one constant is the Philly sports pride that can't be rivaled.

""We had the most home wins in the league last year at the time of the shutdown and we have the best fans in the league and that's not a coincidence"" Shane said. ""The fans here bring an energy and you've heard the players talk about it all week. They cannot wait to get the fans back in here. It's going to be a special night and a special second half of the year. We're looking forward to it.""

And these fans hope to pick up right where they left off.

The Flyers have three more home games this week and you can sign up on the Flyers' website to be put on the ticket waitlist. Tickets will be randomly drawn.

The first Sixers' home game with fans is March 14.

Yes folks the game that we have been waiting for all year is finally here! The one where the Flyers faithful will once again be able to walk through the doors of The Wells Fargo Center on South Broad Street.

It has been almost a year now since the Flyers were able to play in front of their fans thanks to the spread of the global pandemic known as the COVID-19 virus. 362 days to be exact. Since that game against the Boston Bruins on March 10th 2020 where no one knew while exiting the arena that night that it would be their last for quite some time.

Where since the much-anticipated return to play last season for the playoffs up in the bubble in Toronto Canada things have not been the same. With not even the bars open Philadelphia fans were then forced into quarantine destined to sit on their couch and cheer for the team they loved instead of standing shoulder to shoulder at a game next to someone that they may not know but have a common bond and mutual respect for because they wear the same jersey as they do while screaming in perfect unison for the Flyers to “SHOOT THE PUCK” while on the power play.

What about the game day food? It just hasn’t been the same at home. If your anything like me you’ve been missing that GIANT slice of Lorenzo’s & Son’s Pizza that your significant other is always tries to steal from you. Those Chickie’s & Pete’s famous Crabfries and the welcomed shrieking of “Ice Cold Beer Who Wants An Ice Cold Beer?” coming from your favorite beer man who is making his way down your row at the exact moment the old bay from the fries is tickling the back of your throat.

For all these reasons and more this writer is more than willing to give up his nice lower-level view of the games and ascend once again to the rafters where he belongs. In order to make space for the hard-working fans of the Flyers that have not so patiently been waiting for this day to come.

Now the NHL and state officials may have not yet allowed the stands to be packed once again but a small percentage of fans screaming obscenities at the refs after a blown call or just cheering after the Flyers lay a bit hit will be better than the (politically correct) previously recorded crowd noise the powers at be have been pumping through the loudspeakers to simulate fan noise.

Who knows this may just the thing to get the struggling Carter Hart back on track. Who last season won 20 of his 25 games played at home while managing a 1.63 goals against average and .943 save percentage during those games.

Regardless of the fact if the Flyers win or lose tonight this is a step in the right direction for sure. A much-needed sense of some kind of new normalcy if you will.

Hope to see you tonight at the game! GO FLYERS!!!!!

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- A limited number of Philadelphia Flyers fans were finally allowed back into the Wells Fargo Center on Sunday night a year after the COVID-19 pandemic forced sweeping changes to professional sports.

The crowd was smaller but it was loud and energetic making up for a year of not being able to cheer on their team. Fans said as soon as they heard tickets were available they grabbed them.

""We've always been die-hard Philly fans and once we heard they'll let us back in we immediately knew we had to go to the game"" said Derek Swayze of Glassboro New Jersey.

Gritty was there waiting as 3100 fans made their way into the Wells Fargo Center to watch the Flyers take on the Washington Capitals.

Flyers fans chanted ""Let's Go Flyers! Let's Go Flyers!"" early in the contest something you could hear with just an artificial soundtrack up to this point this season. They loudly booed and directed catcalls at the officials after Travis Konecny was whistled for goaltender interference in the first period.

During a stoppage in the second period they saluted Oskar Lindblom who returned to the ice this season after battling cancer for much of last season with a loud ovation

""March 10th was the last time there was a home game. We've been season ticket holders we just couldn't wait to get back into the stadium. Our kids grew up here so it's awesome to have them back in here"" said Shaun Long of Middletown Delaware.

Officials say they have put a lot of precautions in place including touchless ticket scanning and concessions spaced-out seats in the stands and mask-wearing unless you're eating or drinking at your seat.

""We understand there might be moments when the mask might slip down we're going to use common sense about it. There's going to be a low tolerance for not wearing a mask and not adhering to that policy"" said Phil Laws the building general manager at the Wells Fargo Center.

On Sunday the Wells Fargo Center will welcome back Flyers fans for the first time in nearly a year. The game will have special meaning for one Bucks County family.

Russell Thompson 78 has never missed a home opener. The dedicated fan who is now in end-stage heart failure and receiving hospice care was invited to Sunday's game.

""He's situated great. He can see everything. He's in his bed which we're very thankful for. We didn't have to take him out of his bed. So he's comfortable he's happy. We're very thankful"" said Thompson's daughter Judy Uragano during Sunday's game.

Flyers coach Alain Vigneault was also excited to have the support.

""There's no doubt having fans and feeling their emotion and their energy will be a boost for us"" Vigneault said prior to the game.

Despite the return of fans the Flyers couldn't pull off a win getting defeated by the Capitals 3-1. The team will host Buffalo Sabres on Tuesday night at home.

PAULSBORO New Jersey (WPVI) -- Fire investigators said two children rescued from a house fire in Paulsboro Gloucester County are in critical condition.

The fire started around 4 a.m. Saturday on the unit bock of West Washington Street.

Tisha Holloway said her stepmother lives in the home. She was asleep at the time and so were her grandchild son and two unrelated children she was babysitting.

""My little brother didn't know that the other two kids were there. He just knew that his mom and his nephew were in there"" said Holloway.

She said her brother was able to get his mom and the baby out but the fire quickly engulfed the house making it too dangerous to get to the other two children.

Mayor Gary Stevenson said police arrived to the scene initially and were told there were children in the burning home.

""The house is completely gutted. There are huge holes in the floor from what I can see being fire chief for many years in this town; it looks like it started in the living room"" Stevenson.

Officers tried to gain entry into the house but were driven back by the flames and smoke.

Firefighters responded within five minutes the mayor said.

Crews put up ladders and were able to rescue two children from the second floor.

The children were initially taken to Crozer Hospital's burn unit and then transferred to St. Christopher's Hospital for Children.

Neighbors and family stood outside the home for hours Saturday in disbelief this could happen to the woman who lived there.

""She is the neighborhood mom like she's here for everybody. She feeds everybody; summertime we have barbeques. She turns nobody away"" said Holloway.

The Red Cross is helping the family with living arrangements. The community is also rallying to raise money for the beloved woman.

There are currently vacancies at Heacham Hunstanton Downham Lynn Sandringham Massingham Outwell Swaffham West Walton and Wells.

The Norfolk appeal is part of a national We Need More recruitment drive to find people looking for a challenge and keen to help their community.

Peter Oxford Downham electrician and firefighter

Working as an on-call firefighter means being involved in a wide range of activities from responding to emergency calls to carrying out work in local communities and providing fire prevention advice to keep everyone safe.

On-call firefighters must live or work within five minutes of an on-call station and respond to 999 calls via an alerter system. They also attend weekly training nights.

Margaret Dewsbury cabinet holder for communities and partnerships at Norfolk County Council said: ""When we talk to our on-call firefighters here in Norfolk they tell us they enjoy having an exciting and challenging role that fits in around their life and main career.""

Firefighter Natalie ;Kibgilka (44790186)

Chief Fire Officer Stuart Ruff said: ""We are not looking for a particular type of person as every member of our team brings something different and valuable.""

He said that there is a particular need for day time cover at some of the rural stations and with more people working from home in their primary career they could be perfect candidates.

He also thanked employers across Norfolk who release staff to commit to the service.

Peter Oxford is an on-call firefighter at Downham whose regular job is an electrician. ""I can tell the service when I am available and when I am not and it means I can be really flexible depending on what is happening with my working day and my colleagues and employer are supportive if I need to go.""

Tom Gilham (44847815)

After many years travelling all over the world Natalie Kibgilka from Sandringham now works from home in the travel industry. ""I wasn't seeing anyone and missed being part of a team and I wanted to do something that didn't involve looking at a computer all day."" she said.

She went to Sandringham fire station saw the watch manager and joined in 2019. ""I absolutely love it"" she said.

Tom Gilham is a chef at Massingham. There have been times when he has been cooking and had to hand over to dash off on a call. ""The pub and the fire station are at the heart of the community and it is great to be a part of both"" he said.

New brochures have been released outlining what is involved and there will be a question and answer session for people to find out more online on Thursday March 18 at 7pm. To register an interest email marketing@norfolk.gov.uk. There is also a facility on the website for potential applicants to request a call back with a member of staff to find out more.",,,

Rather the $86 billion is a taxpayer bailout for about 185 union pension plans that are so close to collapse that without the rescue more than a million retired truck drivers retail clerks builders and others could be forced to forgo retirement income.

The bailout targets multiemployer pension plans which bring groups of companies together with a union to provide guaranteed benefits. All told about 1400 of the plans cover about 10.7 million active and retired workers often in fields like construction or entertainment where the workers move from job to job. As the work force ages an alarming number of the plans are running out of money. The trend predated the pandemic and is a result of fading unions serial bankruptcies and the misplaced hope that investment income would foot most of the bill so that employers and workers wouldn’t have to.

Both the House and Senate stimulus measures would give the weakest plans enough money to pay hundreds of thousands of retirees — a number that will grow in the future — their full pensions for the next 30 years. The provision does not require the plans to pay back the bailout freeze accruals or to end the practices that led to their current distress which means their troubles could recur. Nor does it explain what will happen when the taxpayer money runs out 30 years from now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2Jha3gtbmF0dXJhbC1nYXMtY28yLTEuNTkzODk1NNIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS41OTM4OTU0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How natural gas is emerging as both villain and saviour in the climate change battle,"Jaeson Cardiff often faces the question whether his industry is good for the environment or merely helping to delay the inevitable transition away from fossil fuels.

Cardiff is the founder of CleanO2 which collects carbon fumes and exhaust from industrial buildings for use in soap and detergents.

At his office in Calgary he describes how interest in his business has grown exponentially by increased awareness about climate change and the dangers of greenhouse gas emissions.

In the past two years CleanO2 has grown from having one employee to 10 with operations expanding to the U.S. and Japan.

Still he finds himself at the forefront of the debate about natural gas which is increasingly characterized as either a saviour or a villain in whether it helps or hurts the environment.

For Cardiff he sees a definite role for natural gas for years to come.

""It isn't a case of a steady state industry where they're just trying to make natural gas the long-term solution; we're all working together toward trying to decarbonize this industry"" he said.

WATCH | Why there is still a need for natural gas:

Natural gas needed for many years to come Duration 1:34 There isn't a low-cost alternative yet for heating industrial buildings and other uses according to Jaeson Cardiff with CleanO2

For decades natural gas was regarded as a clean-burning fuel especially compared with oil and coal. It's a reputation the industry is trying to keep intact but in some recent cases it's losing the battle.

For instance new pipelines are facing stiff opposition throughout North America including a relatively small project from Pennsylvania to New York known as the Northeast Supply Enhancement (NESE) pipeline.

Regulators in New York denied a water permit for the proposed project over the potential adverse impacts on the New York Bay. The developer Williams Companies said the project failed because of politics.

""That project is a perfect example of where we label and demonize things"" said Alan Armstrong chief executive of Williams during the CERAWeek by IHS Markit event this week.

The pipeline would have replaced heating oil with natural gas which should have reduced emissions and also lowered utility bills he said.

""We're really depriving ourselves of a lot of great emission reduction opportunities and cost savings at the same time and we're reducing our own reliability in our markets. It just absolutely makes no sense to me"" Armstrong said.

Some describe it as the ""tobaccofication"" of the industry.

Emissions from burning natural gas are lower than using oil or coal. For instance coal power plants are being phased out in Alberta in favour of natural gas which some experts are calling ""a climate action success story"" as emissions from the province's electricity sector are estimated to have fallen nearly 50 per cent from 2015 to 2020.

Still critics say the overall benefits of natural gas aren't as good as they are cracked up to be.

It's largely because of transportation and leaks. When natural gas is moved around the world there can be emissions from liquifying the fuel and shipping it. There is also concern about methane leaks during production and transportation.

Methane is considered to be 25 times as harmful as carbon dioxide for the atmosphere.

For those reasons some have even described natural gas as the ""new coal.""

""New studies have shown there is significantly more fugitive gas than studies showed five years ago and the gas is also a bigger contributor to climate change than was understood"" said James Browning with the Global Energy Monitor.

In Canada the natural gas industry could grow in the coming years as one liquified natural gas export facility is under construction and a second could break ground later this year.

Some natural gas pipeline companies in the country are beginning to blend hydrogen with natural gas for home heating as a way to reduce emissions.

The role of natural gas in the future may ultimately depend on different parts of the world according to Ed Whittingham a Calgary-based clean energy consultant and former executive director of the Pembina Institute an environmental policy think-tank in an interview.

Without question he said natural gas will continue to be used in Canada for heating homes and providing electricity. However it's a limited interim role considering the country needs more non-emitting sources of electricity.

""That can include natural gas provided we're not taking the CO2 that is a byproduct and putting that up into the atmosphere"" he said pointing to the use of carbon capture technology to ensure the emissions are stored underground or used in cement plastics and other products.

Natural gas may be more useful in developing countries that don't have the same hydroelectric solar or wind resources as Canada.

""Let's face it fossil fuels are still cheap"" he said.

""Right now the massive struggle is how do we lift not just hundreds of millions but billions of people out of poverty in the world and provide them with access to the affordable electricity that we've all come to rely on and use to power our lifestyles? How do we provide that to them in a non-emitting way?""

That's why the world's use of natural gas in the future will depend on how much energy demand grows the cost of each type of energy and how quickly technology advances among other factors.

WATCH | The future of natural gas around the world:

A limited role for natural gas in Canada Duration 1:12 Why demand for natural gas may not grow in the future according to Ed Whittingham a Calgary-based clean energy consultant

For Cardiff with Clean02 even though he's certain natural gas will still be relied upon for decades to come he's already beginning to research how his business will adapt to make soap and other products if hydrogen use ever takes off.

""There are a lot of companies that are currently moving in that direction and we're among them. We have some technologies that we're developing to help transition into that hydrogen economy. It just seems like a natural fit"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzA3L3doeS15b3UtZG9udC1vd24tdGhlLXJpZ2h0LXRvLXJlY2xpbmUtaW4teW91ci1haXJwbGFuZS1zZWF0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why you don't own the right to recline in your airplane seat,"Who owns the space behind your airplane seat: you reclining or the squished laptop user behind? And who owns your online life: you clicking around or Facebook selling your most intimate data?

Turns out these puzzles are both the same puzzle and they share a single answer: you lose. The prize goes to those who know how the simple rules of ownership really work.

James Beach is a large guy over six feet tall. On a United Airlines flight from Newark to Denver the businessman lowered his tray table and attached his Knee Defender. The Knee Defender is a simple plastic clamp available for $21.95 that locks the seat in front. Its website claims the clamp will ""stop reclining seats on airplanes so your knees won't have to."" Assured of his workspace Beach opened his laptop.

The Knee Defender claims are real. When the passenger sitting in front of Beach tried to recline her seat didn't budge. Outraged she slammed her seat back popping out the Knee Defender and jolting Beach's laptop. He quickly jammed her seat back up and reattached the clamp. She turned around and threw her drink at Beach. The pilot changed course to Chicago for an emergency landing and both passengers were removed from the plane.

This conflict keeps erupting—most recently on video. On an American Airlines flight from New Orleans to North Carolina Wendi Williams reclined her seat. The man behind was in the last row so he could not recline. Instead he tapped the back of Williams's seat repeatedly like an irritating metronome. Her video of this high-altitude fracas quickly went viral.

After each incident the blogosphere boomed back and forth with indignant commentary. Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres defended Williams: ""The only time it's ever okay to punch someone's seat is if the seat punches you first."" Delta Air Lines chief executive Ed Bastian took an opposing view: ""The proper thing to do is if you're going to recline into somebody you ask if it's OK first."" Williams didn't ask.

So who's right?

Williams's view is simple: her armrest button reclines her seat so the space belongs her. My home is my castle and anything attached to it is also mine.

Attachment is the most important ownership principle you've never heard of. It's why landowners in Texas can extract underground oil why California's Central Valley is sinking why Alaska can sustainably manage Bering Sea fisheries – and why occasional homeowners feel justified in shotgun blasting drones hovering above their backyards. Attachment is what translates two-dimensional boarding passes land deeds and maps into three-dimensional control of valuable resources.

But attachment is not the only ownership rule in play. At the beginning of every flight all seats are in the ""full upright and locked position."" At that moment Beach had exclusive use of the space in front of him. He had first dibs on the wedge. First-in-time is a second core rule for claiming mine. Kids assert it on the playground; adults invoke it up in the air. It's mine because I was first. Recall that Beach actually took physical control of the wedge with his Knee Defender. And there's a third rule. Possession. Nine-tenths of the law. Mine because I'm holding onto it. Possession means I get to defend my workspace.

Air travel brings into sharp focus three conflicting rules—attachment first-in-time and possession.

Each side picks the story that gives it the moral high ground each side wants ownership bent toward its view. But there is no natural correct answer to mine versus mine battles. Ownership is always up for grabs.

When we ask audiences about the Knee Defender conflict the answer is always the same whether we're talking with our law students at Columbia and UCLA or a non-law crowd. Most people respond with versions of ""It's obvious."" But when we ask for a show of hands people generally split between Williams and Beach—and everyone looks at each other with incredulity. In a 2020 national poll about half replied ""If it can recline I'm reclining"" and the other half said ""No just don't do it."" Everyone feels in the right as did Williams and Beach. That's why Williams felt justified in posting her video and Beach didn't hesitate to shove the front seat forward. Don't mess with what's mine.

Why are these conflicts breaking out now? There never used to be rage around reclining. Until recently airline seats had greater pitch or space between seats—enough both for reclining and for lowering the tray table. No one thought to ask who controlled the space because it didn't much matter. But airlines have been shrinking the pitch in economy class down from 35 inches not that long ago to just 28 inches on some planes.

There's a lot at stake for the airlines: one inch of pitch saved per row can add up to six extra seats per flight to sell. To grow profits airlines are squeezing ever more passengers inside a fixed steel tube—at the same time that people are growing bigger and tray tables have become precious computer stands. The stakes are high for passengers as well. In the COVID-19 era each inch of personal space can feel like a life or death matter. So passengers get angry at each other. But why aren't they angry at the airline?

It turns out neither Beach nor Williams really own the wedge of reclining space. The airlines do. And they are savvy pros at ownership design. As Ira Goldman the inventor of the Knee Defender (whose website traffic increased five-hundred-fold after the Denver flight incident) described: ""What the airlines are doing is they're selling me space for my legs and they're selling you the space—if you're sitting in front of me—they're selling you the same space to recline. So they're selling one space to two people.""

Can the airlines do that?

Yes. In 2018 the Federal Aviation Administration declined to regulate airplane seats leaving their design to the airlines. In turn the airlines use a secret weapon that lets them sell the same space twice on every flight. The weapon is strategic ambiguity a sophisticated tool of ownership design. Most airlines do have a rule—the passenger with the button can lean back. But they keep it quiet. Flight attendants don't announce it.

Ambiguity works to the airlines' advantage. When ownership is unclear—and it's unclear far more often than you might imagine—people mostly fall back on politeness and good manners. For decades airlines have counted on high-altitude etiquette to defuse conflicting claims. That's why Delta CEO Bastian said you should ""ask if it's okay"" to recline. Passengers negotiate among themselves as they angle ahead in line nudge elbows over shared armrests and jostle for overhead bins. Money rarely changes hands. (One study though suggests about three-quarters of passengers would agree not to recline if the person behind offered to buy them a drink or snack.)

But as airlines continue to shrink the pitch unspoken rules over the front-to-back squeeze are breaking down and everyone ends up looking unreasonable. Goldman saw ownership ambiguity as a business opportunity and created a technological solution. The problem though is that a unilateral move to lock the seat violates customs of politeness. It feels like taking something without asking.

The Knee Defender may seem like a silly novelty item but it reflects one of the great engines for innovation in our society: as valued resources become scarcer people compete more intensely to impose their preferred ownership rule and entrepreneurs find ways to profit.

The same clash profoundly reshaped the American West in the 1800s—but there it was farmers against ranchers. The huge cattle drives we love to watch in westerns existed only for a few decades. The numberless herds being moved to market were often roaming over private land but homesteaders had no ability to keep them out. Cows couldn't read No Trespassing signs and fencing was too expensive. So cowboys drove cattle over unfenced miles to rail yards in Abilene and Dodge City.

Then in 1874 Joseph Glidden patented his double-strand barbed wire hailed as ""The Greatest Discovery of the Age."" This invention as simple as the Knee Defender suddenly provided a cheap effective tool to exclude cattle drawing a line where homesteaders could make their stand. The Glidden wire was described as ""lighter than air stronger than whiskey cheaper than dust."" Ranchers fought back engaging in fence-cutting wars that led to shootings and deaths.

By resolving ownership ambiguity in favor of homesteaders Glidden's invention transformed the Great Plains. Small ranchers went out of business as they had no path to get cattle to market. Cowboys became hired hands on large-scale ranches. For many Native Americans barbed wire—""the Devil's rope""—effectively ended their nomadic way of life. Barbed wire was essential to creating the No Trespassing version of ownership that defines so much of modern life in America.

Changes in the technology of ownership can be painful embittering the range wars on the Great Plains and the knee wars at thirty-five thousand feet. Just as barbed wire gave farmers a way to fence out cattle the Knee Defender gives passengers a cheap tool to exclude recliners. Both technologies offer people an effective way to assert their preferred claim over ambiguously-owned resources.

There is a difference though: while farmers made barbed wire ubiquitous many airlines have banned Knee Defenders. As experts in ownership design airlines know how to profit from strategic ambiguity. They could ""pre-cline"" seats fixing them at a set angle but prefer to keep selling each wedge of space twice. This way angry passengers turn against each other with their competing stories rather than blaming the airlines which engineered the conflict. Still better—for the airlines—the discomfort creates a profitable market for higher-priced seats with more legroom and less hassle.

This is the real story driving Knee Defender conflicts.

The identical ownership conflict is playing out today on the Internet a far more consequential and less tangible arena than airplane seats. Our clickstreams reveal much of our private lives—what we buy whom we follow where we live even how we vote. This may seem a world apart from Knee Defenders and barbed wire but it's the same dilemma.

Facebook Google and other Internet titans are reclining their data trackers into our virtual laps earning billions in advertising fees by assembling uncanny profiles based on our likes and looks. Like the airlines tech companies are experts in profiting from ownership ambiguity. They assert a labor claim – the fourth ancient ownership rule. ""It's ours because we worked for it."" The companies created the cool websites we love to visit. They argue this labor earns them the right to collect our data and then sell ads that stalk us creepily around the Internet.

But if you know the rules of ownership you can push back. Clickstreams could be ours because of our self-ownership ""It's mine because it comes from my body."" This is the fifth ownership rule and it's every bit as valid as the labor claim.

One of the central questions for our time is choosing the rule that resolves ownership ambiguity online. Self-ownership or labor? A few places like the European Union and California have taken small steps toward giving us the digital equivalent of Knee Defenders and barbed wire. ""It's mine. Keep out!"" But most everywhere the answer remains up in the air. And continued ambiguity over which story should rule favors the tech companies.

Remarkably there are just six simple stories that everyone uses to claim everything. We've already seen five: first-in-time possession attachment labor and self-ownership. The last one is family – ""it's mine because I'm in the family"" – governing marriage and divorce birth and death. That's it.

And here's the point. Conflicts of mine versus mine go on around us all the time mostly out of view until something like a Knee Defender makes them painfully visible. Then we have to choose not just for reclining seats and online clickstreams but for every resource battle from climate change to wealth inequality. If you are not the one choosing who gets what then someone else is choosing for you.

Some Las Vegas hotels ban outside food & drinks

Miles to Memories notes that the Virgin Las Vegas resort that’s opening soon has a surprising policy which is mentioned in the FAQs:

Can we bring in our own food & beverage? Outside food and beverage is not permitted in our guest rooms. Our resort offers an array of restaurant offering including pre-stocked in-room minibars and 24-hour room service for your convenience.

So yeah apparently you can’t bring outside food & drinks into your own guest room at the Virgin Las Vegas. This is totally bizarre to me but upon digging a bit deeper it seems that this isn’t the only hotel with such a policy.

For example it would appear that Encore at Wynn Las Vegas has a similar policy:

Outside food and beverage as well as coolers are not permitted at the resort and casino. Guests arriving with these items will be required to discard these items or leave them in their vehicle for the duration of their visit.

Is this outrageous policy actually enforced?

I should mention that my interest in Las Vegas is virtually non-existent so I’m not the target customer for these properties. I didn’t love Las Vegas pre-coronavirus and I sure as heck won’t love it post-coronavirus.

Still I’m kind of in disbelief that this is actually a policy because it’s so outrageous. It’s one thing if they said you can’t cater your own party in a suite without going through the hotel but the way these rules are written you couldn’t even bring a Starbucks iced coffee a Diet Coke a protein shake or a bag of almonds into your room.

I have a few immediate thoughts here:

I wonder if this policy will be enforced; if you enter the hotel with a CVS or liquor store bag will they really search you?

Even if this policy isn’t widely enforced it rubs me the wrong way; I don’t want to go into a hotel knowing I’m violating rules and could be kicked out for doing something very reasonable

I understand hotels (particularly in Las Vegas) are very much trying to push their own F&B outlets but there’s a fine line between that and not giving people the ability to eat what they want in their room

When staying at hotels during the pandemic I’ve found myself getting food from outside the property more often given the limited selections available and my general desire to dine in my room rather than in an indoor restaurant; sometimes I pick up something sometimes I order through Postmates or Uber Eats and sometimes I just get snacks at a drugstore

Bottom line

It would appear that multiple Las Vegas hotels have policies banning all outside food and drinks. I’m not sure whether this policy is actually enforced on a widespread basis but this has to be one of the most ridiculous hotel policies I’ve ever seen. I totally get hotels want to push their own outlets but this crosses the line in my opinion.

Las Vegas hotels often forget they’re still in the business of hospitality even if they try to operate like factories.

Were you aware that some Las Vegas hotels have policies like this? Do Las Vegas hotels actually enforce these rules?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0b25saW5lLmNvbS9uaWNvbGFzLWNhZ2Utd2Vkcy1yaWtvLXNoaWJhdGEtaW5zaWRlLXRoZWlyLWxhcy12ZWdhcy13ZWRkaW5nLTE2MTc4NdIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0b25saW5lLmNvbS9uaWNvbGFzLWNhZ2Utd2Vkcy1yaWtvLXNoaWJhdGEtaW5zaWRlLXRoZWlyLWxhcy12ZWdhcy13ZWRkaW5nLTE2MTc4NT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nicolas Cage Weds Riko Shibata: Inside Their Las Vegas Wedding,"Nicolas Cage is officially a married man again!

ET has learned that the 57-year-old actor said ""I do"" to 26-year-old Riko Shibata. According to court documents the two wed in Las Vegas Nevada on Feb. 16 with Shibata taking Cage's last name.

A source tells ET that the couple chose that date to honor the birthday of Cage's late father August Coppola. For the ceremony which was held at Wynn Las Vegas the bride wore a handmade Japanese bridal kimono from Kyoto that had three layers. As for the groom he sported a Tom Ford tuxedo.

Shibata walked down the aisle to her favorite song Winter Song by Kiroro and the two exchanged traditional Catholic and Shinto vows that included poetry by Walt Whitman as well as a haiku.

After the wedding the happy couple was joined for a small celebration attended by Cage's ex-wife and good friend Alice Kim and their 15-year-old son Kal.

""It’s true and we are very happy"" Cage said of tying the knot in Las Vegas.

The couple first met in Shiga Japan over a year ago and Cage first announced his engagement during a radio interview with his brother Marc ""The Cope"" Coppola for Q1043 New York. Of how the proposal came to be the Leaving Las Vegas actor explained ""She left New York and went back to Kyoto Japan and I went back to Nevada.""

""I hadn't seen her for six months and we [were] really happy together ... really excited to spend that time together"" he continued. ""So I finally just said Look I wanna marry you' and we got engaged on FaceTime.""

Cage revealed at the time that he bought his then-fiancée a black diamond engagement ring. ""Her favorite color is black so she wanted the black gold and the black diamond"" he shared. ""So I found it and customized and personalized it. And I actually sent it to her Fedex. So we're engaged!""

This marks the fifth marriage for Cage who was previously married to Patricia Arquette (1995-2001) Lisa Marie Presley (2002-2004) Alice Kim (2004-2016) and Erika Koike (2019).

The happy couple were pictured surrounded by white candles and green foliage in the hotel's Primrose Courtyard as the masked officiant Reverend Richard E. Walter performed the ceremony before the newlyweds walked hand in hand back into the hotel.

After the wedding the bride and groom who met in Shiga Japan over a year ago held a small celebration attended by Cage's third wife Alice Kim - with whom he has remained good friends - and their son Kal.

A state of Nevada marriage certificate obtained by DailyMail.com earlier Friday shows Riko has taken Cage's name and is now known as Riko Cage.

She is 30 years younger than Cage and four years younger than his first son Weston Cage.

They were seen together again in New York the following month.

Cage announced their engagement in an interview with his brother Marc Coppola's radio show in August.

He said at the time: 'She left New York and went back to Kyoto Japan and I went back to Nevada and I haven't seen her for 6 months.

'We're really happy together and we're really excited to spend that time together so I finally just said ''Look I wanna marry you'' and we got engaged on FaceTime.

'I got her a black diamond engagement ring.

'Her favorite color is black so she wanted the black gold and the black diamond.

'I customized and personalized it and I actually sent it to her FedEx.'

Ceremonies at the Wynn Las Vegas wedding salons can cost between $1590 for an 'elopement affair' and $29990 for an 'elegant affair'.

A brochure handed out by the venue states: 'Your wedding plans may include a simple reception of cake and champagne or a seated multi-course dinner.

'Whatever you choose the catering staff at Wynn Las Vegas will assist you in creating a most memorable celebration.'

The venue has two indoor salons - the Lavender Salon and slightly smaller Lilac Salon - and an outdoor venue called the Primrose Court. Photos from Cage's nuptials show the couple opted for the outdoor venue.

The wedding came less than two years since Cage notoriously asked for an annulment four days after his fourth marriage to Erika Koike on March 23 2019.

The Leaving Las Vegas actor argued that he was too intoxicated to understand what he was doing.

He also claimed that Thai restaurant owner Koike did not tell him 'the full nature and extent of her relationship with another person'.

Video footage of the moment the couple went to apply for their marriage license showed an intoxicated Cage screaming 'She is going to take all my money' and 'Her ex is a druggy'.

Koike could be heard saying: 'Baby I am not asking you to do this.'

Pics also emerged of the pair apparently having an argument outside the Bellagio just hours after they got married there.

Cage was granted a divorce from Koike in July 2020 according to official documents.

Gas vanquished coal cutting both carbon dioxide emissions and wholesale electricity costs.

But to renewable-energy advocates gas' days are numbered — at least as far as building big power plants such as the one Xcel Energy is planning in Becker Minn.

They say an emission-free combination of new wind and solar — coupled with a fleet of grid batteries for power storage — is cheaper and just as reliable as a new gas plant.

""If we want to take climate change seriously we can't build new fossil-fuel plants"" said Ellen Anderson climate program director for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy. ""The time has come to move on from fossil fuels.""

Not so fast say Xcel and for that matter the utility industry: Gas will be needed for some time to ensure grid reliability particularly as coal plants close.

""Natural gas is the right fuel to bridge us into the future and integrate renewables into the system"" said Christopher Clark Xcel's president for Minnesota. ""This is a major transition and it's important to do it in a way that respects affordability and reliability.""

The debate over Xcel's gas plant promises to get hotter this year.

The legislature and then-Gov. Mark Dayton bypassed the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission and approved Xcel's roughly $800 million plant four years ago.

But the PUC still has a significant say over the gas plant as it undertakes a long-awaited review of Xcel's long-term power generation plans.

Minneapolis-based Xcel must show the PUC that the gas plant is in the public's — and ratepayers' — best interest particularly in comparison to new renewable-energy projects.

The PUC has authority too over whether Xcel can eventually recover the plant's costs from its customers. Plus Xcel's proposed gas supply pipeline to the new plant — which is likely to cost a few hundred million dollars — must be approved by the PUC.

""We strongly feel the law doesn't make the gas plant a done deal"" said Allen Gleckner energy markets director for research and advocacy group Fresh Energy in St. Paul. ""It is not guaranteed.""

Future of gas

Xcel by far Minnesota's largest electricity producer isn't alone in facing a gas-plant battle.

Such fights have flared across the country including the Upper Midwest where Duluth-based Minnesota Power plans to build a $700 million gas plant in Superior Wis. which would be co-owned by Dairyland Power Cooperative.

The PUC narrowly approved the Superior plant despite an administrative law judge's recommendation that it be denied. Opponents appealed the PUC's decision citing the lack of a Minnesota environmental review.

In October the Minnesota Court of Appeals agreed and the matter is now before the Minnesota Supreme Court.

Clean-power groups argue that Minnesota Power's and Xcel's new gas plants are not needed particularly since both utilities have goals of producing 100% carbon-free power by 2050.

Xcel the nation's leading wind-power utility was the first U.S. electricity producer to make such a pledge.

""Xcel has said it is going to be 100% carbon free by 2050 but at the same time it has said it will build a new gas plant by 2027"" said Annie Levenson-Falk head of the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota a ratepayer watchdog group.

The two goals don't line up she said. The gas plant's life span is 40 years. If Xcel shutters the plant early ratepayers will be left paying for a ""stranded"" asset said Levenson-Falk and other gas plant opponents.

""There is pretty strong evidence that it will be a stranded asset and that it is not necessary for it to be built"" she said.

The costs of large capital investments like a power plant are treated as an asset that is depreciated over a long stretch of time. If a plant closes early undepreciated costs remain stranded on a utility's books.

Clark dismissed the idea that ratepayers could be left holding the bag. Xcel has successfully converted major coal plants to gas in Minneapolis and St. Paul and it plans to close its last four big coal generators — three of which are in Becker — between 2023 and 2030 he said.

""We have demonstrated with the coal plant transition we can do it cost effectively.""

As for the incongruity of a new gas plant and Xcel's carbon-free-by-2050 goal Clark said the company is betting on advancements in technology.

For instance he pointed to the possibility of hydrogen a carbon-free source of power that has tantalized many in clean-energy circles. ""We plan to build our gas plant to run on hydrogen and have additional space for equipment to run on hydrogen"" Clark said.

But using hydrogen as a substitute for gas could prove quite expensive.

Now hydrogen can't even be blended into existing natural gas pipelines beyond a relatively low threshold because of issues related to cracking and weakening pipeline steel as environmental group the Sierra Club noted in a PUC filing.

Energy options

Natural gas has long been viewed as a so-called ""bridge"" fuel from coal to wind and solar. Coal emits about twice as much carbon dioxide as gas.

But like coal gas can provide steady electricity helping to even out the variability of solar and wind power.

The advent of fracking has freed up enormous supplies of gas making it a cheaper alternative to coal. The result: Gas has replaced coal as the top U.S. fuel for electricity generation.

In Minnesota coal was still number one in 2020 with a 25% share of in-state generation but that's down from 53% in 2011. (Those data don't include significant coal power produced in North Dakota and exported to Minnesota electric co-ops.)

From 2011 to 2020 gas has risen from 6 to 20% of Minnesota generation and wind power from 13 to 22% according to the Minnesota Department of Commerce. (Nuclear power comprised 26% in 2020 solar 3%.)

The coal generators slated for closure in Becker are huge together providing nearly 1900 megawatts of production capacity for Xcel. The company said its roughly 750-megawatt gas plant to be built in Becker would help replace that lost power.

The gas plant is one element of Xcel's ""Integrated Resource Plan"" a 15-year forecast with a particular focus on the next five years.

Xcel's resource plan also includes tripling its solar-power production by 2030 adding legions of new wind turbines and significantly increasing its energy-efficiency programs reducing its power production needs.

The company also plans to extend the life of its Monticello nuclear power plant from 2030 to 2040.

Environmental and clean energy groups have welcomed the renewable power and energy efficiency proposals. But in filings with the PUC they said Xcel could add a lot more renewables and battery storage without the gas plant.

They note that in its forecasting Xcel never modeled a scenario that didn't include the gas plant. Using Xcel's own modeling software Fresh Energy the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy (MECA) and two other clean energy groups concluded that the gas plant wasn't the low-cost alternative.

The Citizens Utility Board using a different model came to the same conclusion.

A recent report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance concluded that new wind and solar farms are already cheaper in some parts of the country than new gas plants like the one Xcel intends to build.

Building out far more battery storage than Xcel has planned for Minnesota will ensure the grid remains reliable the clean energy groups say. Batteries like fossil fuel and nuclear plants can inject power into the grid as needed.

Still the technology of batteries must improve — currently they can store a limited amount of power — before they can be counted on for reliability utility industry executives say.

""I hate to bet against technology but I think [clean power advocates] might have a little bit of a rosy view"" said Emily Fisher senior vice president for clean energy at the Edison Electric Institute a trade group whose current chairman is Xcel CEO Ben Fowke.

Whatever the view on batteries the PUC will be exploring such non-fossil fuel options as it reviews Xcel's long-term resource plan; it's legally obliged to.

""The law is very clear"" said the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy's Anderson. ""If you build a new fossil-fuel plant in Minnesota you have to show that renewables are not in the public interest.""

There are hundreds of Confucius Institutes across the globe. Named after the famed Chinese philosopher CSU’s Confucius Institute offers Chinese language and culture classes to the community at large.

These education centers have faced bipartisan opposition in recent years mainly due to its reliance on Chinese government funding. The 2021 National Defense Authorization Act which passed Congress on New Year’s Day after an override of a presidential veto included language that restricted Department of Defense research funding at universities that host a Confucius Institute.

According to Kathleen Fairfax the vice-provost for international affairs at CSU the DOD funds too much to justify keeping its Confucius Institute open.

“We have all sorts of funding from the department of defense for various projects whether they be independent kinds of research projects on a specific initiative whether it be student funding in terms of graduate fellowships” Fairfax said. “And we would never want to jeopardize any of the good stuff that's happening with some of these funded projects simply because of a small amount of money we're getting to put on some cultural programs.”

In contrast Fairfax said the Chinese government subsidizes about $150000 a figure that pales in comparison to Defense funding.

Fairfax said even without that funding CSU plans to continue offering cultural enrichment programs.

“It's always nice to have a little financial support to do great programming but we'll find a way to get some programming done without that money” Fairfax said. “So I'm confident that we're going to continue on with our mission of people-to-people diplomacy.”

Two people were employed through the Confucius Institute. One had planned to leave the university at the end of the year while the other will be absorbed into Fairfax’s department.

A growing number of U.S. universities have shuttered Confucius Institutes. In 2019 the federal government withheld funding from university critical language programs if there was an Institute on-campus which led to several closures.

Recently President Joe Biden’s nominee for CIA director Williams Burns told the U.S. Senate Committee on Intelligence he recommends shutting down Confucius Institutes viewing them as propaganda tools.

“Programs such as Confucius Institutes fund Chinese-language learning and provide the CCP direct access to university officials” Burns wrote. “Beijing uses this access to spread positive portrayals of China and steer conversations from topics sensitive to the CCP.”

Fairfax said she hasn’t personally seen any attempts from the Institute to spread propaganda. She said the center’s focus is on equal cultural exchange.

“It really is limited to community engagement on language and culture” Fairfax said. “I can't speak for every single Confucius Institute in the U.S. but I have not seen it as a national threat or a national security threat at all but I understand the larger implications of intertwining Chinese government funding and U.S. universities.”

CSU’s Confucius Institute will close in June. The Community College of Denver also housed a Confucius Institute which closed last September due to “budgetary and environmental circumstances.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpbmtsaXZlLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvd2lsZC1nb2FsdGVuZGVyLWthYXBvLWthaGtvbmVuLXByb3ZpbmctaGUtYmVsb25ncy1pbi1uaGzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wild goaltender Kaapo Kahkonen proving he belongs in NHL,"Kaapo Kahkonen has won his past six games and while it might be too early to be talking goaltending controversy some would argue it’s created tough decisions for the Wild in the crease.

That’s not how coach Dean Evason sees it.

“You guys think of it as a tough decision” Evason said. “As coaches we think of it as an easy decision because we can go either way and we’re going to make the right call.”

“They have both played well and ping-ponged a little bit off of each other” Evason added. “We are real happy with both guys and we feel very comfortable with either in the net.”

Not bad considering Kahkonen was expected to spend at least part of this season in the minors.

After general manager Bill Guerin signed Cam Talbot to be the starter this offseason Kahkonen looked like the unquestioned odd man out with Alex Stalock in line to be the backup.

That wasn’t the case as Stalock missed the start of this season with a reported heart condition.

It was a classic Wally Pipp situation from there as Kahkonen proved too good to take out of the lineup and Stalock was placed on waivers. He was claimed by the Edmonton Oilers last week.

“It’s obviously sad to see him go” Kahkonen said. “I guess that’s part of the business. I’m treating everything the same way. Just trying to focus one game at a time.”

In other words Kahkonen isn’t changing his approach despite the fact that his spot on the roster is now secured.

“I felt good about my game” Kahkonen said. “I feel like I belong in the NHL. It’s still a work in progress. You’ve got to work every day and every night.”

That work has paid off so far as Kahkonen boasts a 9-4-0 record a 2.30 goals against average and a .918 save percentage. He’s actually been better than Talbot in every statistical category.

Asked what’s been working so well for him this season Kahkonen couldn’t pinpoint one thing in particular. That probably speaks to how dialed in he is at the moment.

“We have that confidence that if something breaks down in front of us he’s going to be there” defenseman Brad Hunt said .”He’s such a great kid and has a really bright future in this league. He just keeps it simple. He’s not flashy by any means and when the save needs to be made he makes it.”

That’s been especially true away from the Xcel Energy Center. He has a 6-1-0 record a 1.73 goals against average and a .935 saver percentage on the road this season.

“I approach every game the same way” Kahkonen said. “I’m not that aware of my stats whether they’re at home or on the road. I just know we’ve won a bunch of games and that’s all that matters to me. I’m just happy we’ve been winning games. We obviously want to win a bunch more games here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vb2lscHJpY2UuY29tL0VuZXJneS9FbmVyZ3ktR2VuZXJhbC9XaHktSHlkcm9nZW4tTmVlZHMtTnVjbGVhci1Qb3dlci1Uby1TdWNjZWVkLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Hydrogen Needs Nuclear Power To Succeed | OilPrice.com,"For carbon-free hydrogen to play a significant role in decarbonization it will need to be produced in large quantities at low cost to compete with hydrocarbons. In a future power system heavily dependent on intermittent renewables hydrogen will likely find economical use in power storage for grid balancing. However for an actual ‘hydrogen economy’ to arise hydrogen will have to expand into the so-called ‘hard to abate’ sectors where a large portion of carbon emissions occur. Hydrogen for direct heat in industry and hydrogen-derived fuels (synthetic fuels such as ammonia and synthetic hydrocarbon fuels produced from hydrogen and CO2) would displace the liquid hydrocarbons now used in heavy industry (cement chemicals steel) heavy shipping and aviation.

The International Energy Agency sees this shift as necessary to eventually reach carbon-neutrality in the global energy system. In its Sustainable Development Scenario emissions in the industrial and transport sectors remain stubbornly high in 2040 far exceeding those in the power sector where significant reductions have occurred (and reach actual negative emissions by 2070).

The IEA’s scenario sees hydrogen ammonia and synfuels composing 1.5% of global energy consumption in 2040 but rising to almost 10% in 2070 as hydrocarbon fuels see steep declines. But the agency does not set out a clear path toward this outcome.

Some entrepreneurs claim they can already provide carbon-free hydrogen at $2/kg. But others see that a much steeper fall is required toward $0.90/kg for hydrogen-based fuels to replace liquid fuels at a large scale in the aviation and shipping sectors. Whether this can be achieved even by mid-century is unclear leading many observers to call for various forms of a carbon tax to make clean hydrogen viable.

In any event reaching the lower price points will require innovation including innovation in nuclear power. The future of green hydrogen may well depend on research and innovation occurring now in advanced reactors and nuclear fuels in the United States and abroad.

Going nuclear

A nuclear plant’s electricity and heat can power electrolysis for carbon-free hydrogen production. The concept is just beginning to be demonstrated at existing light water reactors in the US.

Researchers are also looking at utilizing light water reactors for high-temperature steam electrolysis which offers efficiency advantages over lower temperature water electrolysis. This will require augmenting the heat produced by the plant to reach the temperatures required for more efficient steam electrolysis.

Related: India: OPEC+ Decision Could Derail Oil Demand Recovery This approach may prove viable while development continues on advanced high-temperature reactors. Meanwhile the development of small modular reactors to potentially produce electricity for low-temperature electrolysis is also occurring.

Much of the research in the US is occurring through programs at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) which is the lead national laboratory for nuclear energy research development and demonstration. INL is working with corporate partners on numerous projects including the demonstration of electrolysis technology currently operating light-water nuclear plants.

Important support for INL’s ongoing work with commercial partners comes from the U.S. Department of Energy's H2atScale initiative. As part of this the country’s largest nuclear plant operator Exelon Corporation has agreed to host a 1-MW electrolyzer at one of its plants which could be operating by 2023 producing hydrogen for use on-site or for sale. The demonstration will allow simulation of scale-up to a larger hydrogen production unit.

Another commercial partner is Energy Harbor Corp. which emerged from bankruptcy last year and continues to operate several nuclear plants. The company is planning a demonstration of commercial electrolysis at its Davis-Besse nuclear plant a single-unit plant located on the Lake Erie shore near Toledo Ohio. The two-year project will seek to deploy a 1- to 3-MW low-temperature electrolysis unit to produce commercial quantities of hydrogen.

A demonstration of high-temperature steam electrolysis is also being planned at a currently operating light-water plant. The process requires heat augmentation to power electrolysis for hydrogen production at high temperatures (approx. 1000 degrees C). Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy was recently selected for the demonstration with $11 million in federal funding.

“The project is the first of its kind in pairing a commercial electricity generator with high-temperature steam electrolysis technology” says Richard Boardman at INL. He is the national technical lead for the DOE Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program’s Flexible Plant Operations and Generation Pathway.

“The resulting hydrogen will initially be used at the power plant but it could eventually be sold to other industries – especially if followed by a scale-up in the hydrogen production capabilities” he adds.

INL intends to expand its cooperation with commercial partners to install hydrogen electrolysis systems in currently operating light water nuclear plants assembling electrolyzer stacks in order to continue to test and develop these systems. Moreover the lab is considering the eventual deployment of advanced high-temperature reactors specifically for steam electrolysis. Several different advanced reactor concepts are currently in development worldwide many being designed as microreactors or small modular reactors.

“Sodium-cooled fast reactors molten-salt reactors and high-temperature gas reactors could achieve greater efficiency in the process because their higher operating temperatures improve the efficiency of electricity generation” says Richard Boardman. “And electricity still makes up most of the power used in steam electrolysis.”

Small reactor speculations

The need for nuclear in carbon-free hydrogen production took on urgency in a recent panel discussion part of the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Forum entitled ‘Nuclear Beyond Power: Hydrogen Heat and Desalination.’

Kirsty Gogan who is Managing Partner at the consultancy LucidCatalyst in the UK said that according to her firm’s calculations the target price point of $0.90/kg can be reached by 2030 with ‘advanced heat.’ In this case the term refers to collections of small modular reactors.

LucidCatalyst published a report last fall called ‘Missing Link to a Livable Climate: How Hydrogen-Enabled Synthetic Fuels Can Help Deliver the Paris Goals.’ It conveys interesting proposals for the large-scale production of green hydrogen to occur much more quickly than what is envisioned in the IEA’s scenario.

The authors argue that large-scale production of green low-cost hydrogen for synthetic fuels cannot be done competitively with electrolysis powered by renewable energy perhaps not even by mid-century. They argue the actual land requirements for that would be too great. Moreover they point out that wind and solar power do not produce heat as a primary energy product and therefore can only be applied to less efficient low-temperature electrolysis.

They recommend instead “a new generation of advanced heat sources” which are actually advanced modular reactors (see report p. 26) which power electrolysis with heat. And they argue that the production of such reactors can occur in large numbers and economically with advanced manufacturing and standardization at or close to ports and shipyards.

Modern shipyards offer them important models of the kind of large-scale low-cost production they are seeking. One format would be a floating production platform moored near a harbor deploying high-temperature modular reactors for high-temperature electrolysis dedicated to the production of hydrogen and its conversion to ammonia for ship fuel. The report compares capital and operating costs for light water and molten salt small modular reactors to show the cost advantages of advanced nuclear technologies (report p. 49).

Another suggested format is a ‘gigafactory’ with small modular reactors built on the site itself for concentrated large-scale hydrogen production close to ports and rails. The report contains impressive illustrations of what these facilities might look like someday should they ever be built.

These ‘advanced heat’ schemes will no doubt be followed by many more in the years ahead as entrepreneurs seek to dramatically lower the cost of clean hydrogen and hydrogen-based synthetic fuels. Other panelists pointed to the real possibilities for advanced nuclear.

“The key will ultimately be producing the high temperatures needed to most effectively produce hydrogen’ said Seth Grae President and CEO Lightbridge Corporation which is a US-based company working on advanced nuclear fuels.

“Nuclear is the only feasible way to meet this goal” he said.

Some hope.

Natalie Perez sees some good signs when she looks around — the first really since the coronavirus fell upon Colorado. Her son is back in his fourth-grade classroom after almost a year of isolation and frustration. The family’s Denver restaurant is coming back to life.

“I feel like things are starting to feel back to normal and the worry is not as bad as it was in the beginning” she said.

It’s been a rough year for Perez and her family. When Gov. Jared Polis ordered schools closed last March her son Roman Ortiz joined kids across the state in opening his laptop and logging into his class from home. At first Roman did well.

Then came fall and what seemed at the time like an excruciating choice. It appeared Denver Public Schools would open and Roman would have the choice of going back to the classroom or learning remotely. He’d had some health issues when he was little. Perez and her husband went back and forth and decided to keep him at home.

“I’m just trying to make it the least stressful I can for him and I hope it goes well” she said then.

That meant a grueling routine. Many mornings Roman would log onto class from home in the morning sign off and reconnect from his mom’s car and then log back in from a small back room at the restaurant while his mom worked.

Hart Van Denburg/CPR News Natalie Perez at Barbacoa at El Oso the restaurant that her family owns on South Federal Boulevard in Denver. She’s navigating the stress of trying to figure out how and when her son Roman will return to school and has decided that he’ll stay home and learn online because of underlying health conditions during the pandemic.

Roman was isolated from his friends frustrated by his school work and acting out. Late last year Perez put him in therapy.

Then finally came January. Roman’s school Rocky Mountain Prep Southwest reopened and he went back.

“He comes home happy from school every day” Perez said.

“I just see him with more energy now and being less frustrated. Also he was having trouble sleeping and he's been dealing with that very well now and I'm so happy because it was a struggle almost every night.

“He’s eating really well and he's also started going to the gym with his dad. So that's something that feels a little normal like doing the afterschool and the rush and being busy.”

The family restaurant Barbacoa el Oso is doing a little bit better too. After a rocky year of lockdowns and limited capacity the regulars are starting to come back. “It's really exciting to see people I hadn't seen in over a year and it's crazy and they're coming back in and they're like ‘Oh my God it's been so long.’ ”

It will take a while though for a full recovery as people start to feel safe again.

“We had just opened like two years before and we were just starting to see the growth and then the pandemic happened” Perez said. “It kind of pushed us back all the way to the beginning. But I don't know we're just hanging in there and hopefully hopefully things will work out.”

Along with the trouble and turmoil of the year Perez said her family’s learned some things.

“We've slowed down a lot. Before I feel like we were always in a rush to get somewhere to do something and now it's like ‘Oh we got time. There's no rush for that.”

When the time is right and things are safer she said she wants to travel both to see her family in Mexico and to give Roman some new perspective.

“I just feel like you just never know what could happen” she said. “I just want to be able to show Roman that the world is really big and there's so much we can find out there. So yeah I just can't wait to get out of here for a little bit.”"

In line with its long-term commitment to reduce its carbon footprint Burger King U.K. has recently announced that it will launch vegan and vegetarian burgers for instance a plant-based version of its chicken ‘Royale’ burger in the coming weeks thus selling fewer beef options.

In an attempt to negate the effects of climate change fast food giant Burger King U.K. has decided to reduce beef on its menus and introduce more plant-based versions of its products at all 530 locations in the country.

Owned by Bridgepoint and led by Alasdair Murdoch Burger King U.K. is the second largest quick service restaurant (QSR) chain in the country.

The inclusion of plant-based menu items comes as a part of the chain’s new sustainability charter titled Burger King for Good in an effort to match its practices with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Last year the company had unveiled a plant-based ‘Rebel Whopper’ burger but due to pandemic it was unable to follow social distancing norms and had to drop it. Further while adverts claimed the Rebel Whopper was vegan in reality it had egg-based mayonnaise and was prepared alongside meat burgers. However this time the company made assurances that the new plant-based Whopper would be made suitable for vegans.

In an interview with i Murdoch said: “A new plant-based Whopper would appear on menus in the coming weeks as restrictions lift alongside a plant-based ‘Royale’ burger. Meat-free nuggets are also in the pipeline.”

Though Burger King U.K. is more famous for its beef burgers sourcing its meat from the U.K. and Ireland in the coming future several beef options will be dropped. Over time the volume of beef that the chain will sell will drastically reduce and within a decade up to 50% of Burger King U.K.’s menu could be plant-based.

Being good to the planet our people and guests is central to our values at Burger King U.K. and despite the challenges faced by the pandemic I believe this crisis has given us an opportunity to ‘build back better’ and drive through our company values which are integral to sustaining our business for the future. The underlying aim of the Burger King for Good initiative is to be transparent be accountable and work with others to ensure our business decisions are well informed and sound Alasdair Murdoch CEO of Burger King U.K.

However Murdoch was clear that the burger chain is not committing to ditching beef completely.“ We know the direction of travel we are embracing the direction of travel and we are trying to get ahead of it. But we are also still very proud of our beef.”

As to whether the chain would explore lab-grown meat the company said it would wait for costs to fall and for the technology to be successfully scalable. They added that in their view it will be a long time until customers accept cellular beef.

In the charter the chain has committed to reduce 30% of its food waste and source 100% sustainable soy timber coffee palm oil tea and paper. Furthermore it plans to combat waste by embracing campaign group WRAP’s food waste plan and will ban single-use plastic and will instead opt for 100% recycled or certified packaging by 2025. The charter also showed its support for animal welfare and diversity throughout Burger King’s supply chain.

Murdoch added that being good to the planet the people and guests is central to their values at Burger King U.K.: “Despite the challenges faced by the pandemic I believe this crisis has given us an opportunity to ‘build back better’ and drive through our company values which are integral to sustaining our business for the future. The underlying aim of the Burger King for Good initiative is to be transparent be accountable and work with others to ensure our business decisions are well informed and sound.”

This news comes shortly after Burger King outlets across the world have begun rolling out plant-based Whoppers to cater to an increasing number of sustainable consumers including in Japan South Korea and most recently Thailand. The chain also made global headlines when it teamed up with Impossible Foods back in 2019 to launch the Impossible Whopper across U.S. locations. It also debuted plant-based options with Unilever acquisition The Vegetarian Butcher in Europe and mainland China. Further Yum Brands the owner of Burger King U.S. signed a multi-year partnership with Beyond Meat last week.

Several other food chains are hopping on the bandwagon of meatless offerings with KFC joining forces with Beyond Meat Quorn & Lightlife while Pizza Hut partnered with Beyond Meat to bring plant-based meat pizzas across the U.S.

McDonald’s too took this trend a notch higher and developed its own-brand meatless line called McPlant with the burgers presently being trialled in Denmark and Sweden before a wider roll-out in other markets.

Chimps and orangutans given coronavirus vaccines after outbreak among apes at zoo

A group of chimpanzees and orangutans have been given Covid vaccinations at a US zoo following an outbreak.

The lifesaving jabs were given to the great apes at San Diego Zoo - and doses could be rolled out for cats and dogs in the future according to scientists.

Drug company Zoetis said it received a request for emergency doses after coughing gorillas tested positive for coronavirus in January.

The animals - five bonobos and four orangutans - have been given two jabs authorities confirmed.

In January The Mirror reported that several gorillas were tested for the virus after showing symptoms such as coughing and fatigue.

It turned out they had contracted Covid from an asymptomatic keeper.

It raised fears that apes could be particularly vulnerable to coronavirus.

Nadine Lamberski the chief conservation and wildlife health officer at the zoo said the outbreak had raised alarm bells.

She said: “That made us realise that our other apes were at risk.

“We wanted to do our best to protect them from this virus because we don’t really know how it’s going to impact them.”

There are currently no plans to vaccinate primates in UK zoos The Guardian reports.

The experimental jabs are not available in this country but bosses at London Zoo are said to be monitoring ways of protecting animals.

Amanda Guthrie head of wildlife services at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said: “Zookeepers take stringent precautions to ensure the safety of susceptible animals including wearing masks and gloves when preparing their food and cleaning out their enclosures.”

In a statement Dr Mahesh Kumar of drug developer Zoetis said: “We are proud to be able to assist the San Diego Zoo Global veterinary staff and the animals in their care with their recent Covid-19 concerns.

“It’s a great demonstration of how our CTED team can apply our capabilities to emerging infectious diseases adapt quickly to shifting market needs and play an important role in promoting public health by advancing animal care.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vaGF1c2EvbGFiYXJhaS01NjMwMzc4M9IBLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vaGF1c2EvbGFiYXJhaS01NjMwMzc4My5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An yi wa birrai rigakafin cutar korona a Amurka,,,,,,,,,,
