Mayor Wants 'Decisive Action' on the Federal Government's Return to Office Plans,"Efforts have been underway for a while now on return-to-office strategies and real estate assessments for the federal workforce following maximum telework during the initial phases of the coronavirus pandemic. But earlier this week the mayor of the nation’s capital asked for some more specifics: she said she wants “decisive action” by the federal government on what the future of the federal office will look like in order to help revitalize the downtown area of Washington D.C. after the pandemic.

“The federal government represents one-quarter of D.C.’s pre-pandemic jobs and owns or leases one-third of our office space” said District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser during her swearing in ceremony on Monday. “We need decisive action by the White House to either get most federal workers back to the office most of the time or to realign their vast property holdings for use by the local government by nonprofits by businesses and by any user willing to revitalize it.”

President Biden proclaimed during his State of the Union address in March that federal employees would be returning to offices setting an example for the country. There has been guidance from the top but agencies have been responsible for their own return-to-office policies and any flexibilities they may entail.

Bowser stressed the need to take back D.C.’s downtown as it is the “economic engine” that lets the capital city invest in schools the safety net and public works. Currently 25000 people live downtown but Bowser is seeking to add 15000 residents over the next five years and 87000 more (to bring the total up to 100000) ultimately.

Many federal agencies have their headquarters in downtown D.C. In the greater Washington D.C. area there were about 365300 federal employees as of November according to an online database run by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. That represents roughly 16.8% of the entire federal workforce.

An Office of Management and Budget official previously told Government Executive that “with most agencies having concluded reentry by the end of April and others concluding reentry in the following weeks the vast majority of federal employees either are or will soon be working at their official worksites and as appropriate doing so with updated work arrangements that advance agency missions including delivery of federal services.”

Regarding the mayor’s remarks the General Services Administration the federal government’s landlord and OMB “are working closely with agencies as they engage in space planning exercises that take into account current and future work environments” said an OMB official on Tuesday. In July OMB restarted a process launched under the Trump administration for agencies to assess their real property needs which directs them to consider what their future looks like after the pandemic.

Agencies were required to submit plans for fiscal 2024-2028 to OMB and the Federal Real Property Council by December 16 2022. Before the pandemic there has been a years-long process spanning multiple administrations to get the federal real estate footprint to an appropriate size.

“We are confident in the strength of this existing governmentwide capital planning process and the existing real property policy framework and believe it will identify appropriate office space portfolio reduction opportunities over time” the OMB official said. “Appropriations over multiple fiscal years will likely be required to fully implement agencies’ optimal portfolios.”

When asked during the briefing on Tuesday what the president views as the future for the federal workforce in D.C. and what that means for the downtown area in regard to the mayor’s speech White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration “follow[s] the science and listen[s] to the experts. I just don't have anything to announce today on any changes… as it relates to federal buildings and federal workers.” She reiterated the president’s remarks that the country is in a different place than when the Biden administration took over and touted its accomplishments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZmVkZXJhbG5ld3NuZXR3b3JrLmNvbS90b20tdGVtaW4tY29tbWVudGFyeS8yMDIzLzAxL3VoLW9oLXRoZS1tYXlvci1vZi1kYy13YW50cy15b3VyLWN1YmljbGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uh oh! The mayor of DC wants your cubicle!,"DC's mayor explains why she issued the president an ultimatum https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1-BOWSER-GOV-LEASE-12p-mcl.mp3

If you don’t want your office back the District of Columbia would like to turn it into a nice condominium or apartment.

That’s the gist of what freshly reelected Mayor Muriel Bowser said the other day. She wants more people to live in “downtown” Washington or establish businesses there. And she specifically called on the White House to either get agencies to fully re-occupy their “vast property holdings” in the city or give it up.

I’m presuming Bowser meant leased space. The General Services Administration’s Federal Buildings Service lists 55 government buildings in D.C. but it’s hard to tell from the list which ones are leased. The Jackson Place White House Service Center isn’t likely to go condo say nor the National Archives (great lobby though). But the big fancy “Constitution Center” building at 7th and D Streets Southwest is privately owned and leased to the government. It houses people from a half dozen agencies and encompasses 1.4 million square feet and lots of parking.

A Government Accountability Office report from last September showed that the GSA has in fact steadily trimmed both the number of leases it manages and the square footage — a process that’s been happening since around 2014. That reduction accelerated after the pandemic cleared out many offices. Now GSA manages fewer than 8000 leases down from a high of around 9600. It has 175 million square feet under lease down from nearly 200 million.

Beyond that it’s impossible to really know how intensively the government uses a given leased office. Do 80% of the staff telework 40% of the time? All that’s really out there are vague surveys and guesstimates as to precisely how much space the government will permanently need in a given location. It’s never static but what will the average be?

In 2023 every organization is going to have to decide once and for all what its work location policies are going to be and adjust its real estate to fit. With a fussy labor market still-frequent cases of various viruses and lots of people preferring telework that’s not going to be easy for management.

Published reports I’ve read though say that the upper hand seems to be sliding back to management. One story in the Wall Street Journal yesterday quoted the chief executive of Goldman Sachs: “We have nudged cajoled evolved. But the bottom line is we generally are operating pretty close to the way we operated before the pandemic.”

One of the local D.C. newspapers back in March published an editorial urging the re-population of federal offices mainly as a way of helping the District and the D.C. region’s mass transit Metro system economically. The Washington Post quoted President Joe Biden: “It’s time for America to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again. We’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person.”

Well not quite. Most employees come to the office sometimes. Which means most employees telework sometimes. Eventually the government will have to face the question of how much space it really needs. And of how it manages the space it does have. That is if in a workforce of 1000 500 are in their offices on a given day do agencies continue to pay rent on 1000 seats or do they switch to the drop-in “hotel” model and permanently give up space?

Madame Mayor is waiting.

The city issued three permits Jan. 3 for Danis Construction LLC to build three shell buildings at 400 Riverside Ave. at a construction cost of almost $2.46 million.

The project at Riverside Avenue and Forest Street in the Brooklyn/Riverside area is led by Jacksonville-based Southern Grounds & Co. owner Mark Janasik.

Southern Grounds is listed as the owner on the permit applications.

Hospitality Hub LLC led by Janasik paid $285000 for the 0.21-acre site Oct. 1.

The Hub Brooklyn tenant improvements would be done under separate permits.

The permits come more than two years after the Downtown Development Review Board approved the final design 6-0 at its Oct. 8 2020 meeting.

The project includes a Southern Grounds coffee shop and patio space.

Joseph Cronk and Cliff Duch partners in Cronk Duch Architecture said Sept. 10 that CD+urban is the project developer with partial ownership and Cronk Duch Architecture will be the tenant in the studio and loft space.

CD+urban is a studio within Cronk Duch that is focused on consulting planning designing and branding urban infill projects with an emphasis on re-emerging neighborhoods.

Cronk said the group adjusted the programming to add a rooftop bar and adjust to the growth of the mid-Brooklyn area.

The three buildings comprise space for Alder & Oak restaurant and bar; a rooftop bar; loft space for CD+urban; and a Southern Grounds coffee shop and patio space.

Cronk said the rooftop bar likely will be branded as SkyBar.

Alder & Oak is Janasik’s concept that offers local and coastal-inspired wood-fired cuisine and Prohibition-style cocktails.

Janasik said Oct. 9 2020 that he plans to expand Downtown’s Brooklyn neighborhood with a coffee bar and “seasonally fresh” restaurant concept.

He said Southern Grounds was working with Cronk Duch Architecture to fill retail spaces and the kitchen at the proposed The Hub Brooklyn.

The project is led by Jacksonville-based Southern Grounds & Co. owner Mark Janasik.

“It’s certainly a quaint gathering spot with the open courtyard design” Janasik said.

“It’s a place to meet friends a place for weekenders” he said. “Gathering together is a huge part of what The Hub is and part of Southern Grounds’ philosophy.”

The restaurant menu and the courtyard design connecting the business concepts will be similar to the Southern Grounds Neptune Beach location he said.

Janasik said the restaurant will be fast-casual with food from local farms with “globally inspired cuisine.”

The Southern Grounds owner envisions a 1930s-style “prohibition kitchen” serving cocktails in the bar space.

Cronk told the Downtown Development Review Board the “DNA” of The Hub Brooklyn is to “blur the lines” between the public pedestrian right-of-way and “internal street” feel of the courtyard.

The project is across the street from the Fidelity National Information Services Inc. campus.

Janasik said the small interior space and emphasis on outdoor dining was intentional for the post-coronavirus market.

Cronk said the character has changed to a more midcentury white stucco with mixed materials “to draw inspiration from the automobile dealer history of the area.

“The site was the old Studebaker showroom” he said.

The group does not anticipate returning to the DDRB because the design intent is consistent with original approvals he said.

The site at southwest Riverside Avenue and Forest Street puts it across the street from the Fidelity National Information Services Inc. headquarters that will house more than 1700 employees.

Cronk said the public parking structures and street parking as well as private lots will be the primary parking for patrons.

“There will be an emphasis on pedestrian and biking access to the destination” he said.

Cronk said in September he is working on a concept to use the studio space as an architectural studio Monday-Wednesday and then for a creative-oriented purpose such as events exhibits lectures and private functions Thursday-Sunday that tie into the roof terrace and bar space.",,,,,,

Insider Intelligence broke down the top 10 banks in the US by assets with key insights as to how they got there where they plan to go in the future and how smaller banks can compete in the industry.

Do you work in the Financial Services industry? Get business insights on the latest industry trends companies and technologies with data-driven market research & forecasts.

The Federal Reserve has rolled out a list of top US banks by assets and we’ve broken down exactly how these financial service giants manage to stay ahead of the competition. For decades banks have been merging partnering and expanding—so much so that the top four banks accounted for 50% of all US banking assets last year.

In addition to having more than a trillion dollars in consolidated domestic assets JPMorgan Chase Bank of America Citigroup and Wells Fargo increased their tech spending to meet the growing demand for efficient mobile banking apps and compete with neobanks and other fintechs.

The incumbents’ shift towards digital strategy gave them an edge among customers—from traditional to early adopters—regardless of their level of comfort with technology. This demonstrates that digital payment options are no longer complementary but crucial in today’s mobile-first world.

These are the top 10 banks in the US by assets with key insights as to how they got there where they plan to go in the future and how smaller banks can stand out in a competitive industry.

1. JPMorgan Chase – $3.31 Trillion

By targeting digitally-savvy consumers and introducing artificial intelligence (AI) to its offerings JPMorgan Chase has been able to outperform its competitors. JPMorgan is playing the long-game by acquiring millennials through digital channels—in hopes of eventually converting them to higher-value customers.

Additionally JPMorgan is investing heavily in banking technology and had the biggest tech budget of all banks in 2019 with $11.4 billion. A key focus of these funds is identifying use cases to implement AI techniques—such as leveraging voice assistants to enable investment banking clients to access analyst reports and stock exchange information.

In addition to keeping tabs on direct competitors JP Morgan is also keeping tabs on how companies in other sectors are marketing to clients. “We look across all industries—it may be totally unrelated to financial services” says Allison Beer. “When we find some delightful customer experience I’ll screenshot it on my phone and show it to my team as inspiration” adds Beer.

Chase’s mobile banking strategy is key to its growth as a top US bank. Insider Intelligence

2. Bank of America – $2.41 Trillion

Bank of America has been able to cut costs and appeal to young users by adapting strategies for the digital age. The bank’s digitized branches–which allow customers to access contactless ATMs and connect with call centers via video-conference technology—accumulated half the traffic of nearby branches only five months after launching in 2017.

Bank of America’s digital-only services have also re-defined what the company offers its customers. Its voice-enabled assistant Erica allows customers to make peer-to-peer (P2P) payments as well as bill payments. Since officially launching in 2017 Erica has surpassed 15 million users.

What’s more digital payments network Zelle allows users to digitally send real-time payments to friends and family. By integrating this feature into its mobile app Bank of America has opened the door for increased consumer engagement.

Among the new financial service products to launch this year Bank of America released a business-to-consumer (B2C) payout solution that gives users greater flexibility with payments; a new credit card meant for business travelers; and a new credit card tied to a cash rewards program.

3. Citigroup – $1.714 Trillion

For four years in a row Citibank has been named the “Best Bank for High-Net-Worth Families” by Kiplinger’s Personal Finance. For customers that maintain $200000 in deposit retirement and investment accounts the bank grants them access to its Citigold Package.

Insider Intelligence’s Mobile Banking Competitive Edge Study also shows that Citi took the top spot for digital money management tools as rated by consumers. Its in-platform features—including the ability to view recurring charges and see a financial wellness score—helped Citi secure a spot as one of the best banks in the US.

As for the future of growth it’s all about ensuring “that every product we deliver at Citi is digital first” says Michael Naggar chief digital officer of Citibank’s US consumer bank. “Today digital means taking transactions out of the call center and branch and digitizing them. But our goal is connecting analog and digital so that people can’t see where one ends and the other begins” adds Naggar.

Now due to rising interest from its customers Citigroup is looking into launching crypto services such as financing trading and custody. What’s more it narrowly beat out Wells Fargo this year securing the top 3 spot in assets of the big four banks in 2022.

4. Wells Fargo & Co. – $1.712 Trillion

Wells Fargo is following the lead of top competitors by targeting millennials through mobile financial services. Pay with Wells Fargo is a mobile service where users can access their most used payment features before signing into the app. Additionally Wells Fargo’s app Greenhouse helps customers simplify their bills and track spending.

Over the last year Wells Fargo has been optimizing its business to focus on sectors with strong revenue-generating potential like credit cards. For example the financial services firm has a new suite of Visa credit cards which will directly challenge a joint card from PayPal Synchrony Financial as well as Citigroup’s Double Cash per Bloomberg.

Joining the contactless payment market has also bolstered Wells Fargo’s position as a leading bank. This is not surprising as 78% of the top 100 US merchants are now accepting contactless transactions and 44% of US consumers prefer contactless payments per Insider Intelligence research.

5. U.S. Bancorp – $591.21 Billion

U.S. Bancorp the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association earned a spot on the list of top US banks due to its commitment to compete with tech giants making their way into the banking industry.

With Facebook Amazon Apple and Google all announcing their desire to launch financial services U.S. Bancorp was inspired to improve its own technology. According to Terry Dolan chief financial officer of U.S. Bancorp “the bank plans to partner with fintechs in order to maintain competitive banking technology.”

6. PNC Financial Services – $553.39 Billion

PNC Bank stands out as a top US bank due to its specialized customer perks and original products and services. For example PNC offers mobile payment options to corporate clients who hold Visa commercial cards—allowing them to leverage popular mobile wallets like Apple Pay.

What’s more PNC has taken steps to combat fraud a growing problem in the financial industry and the digital world—including piloted credit cards with card verification values that periodically refresh. While fraudsters may be able to guess three-digit CVV codes relatively easily due to the limited number of permutations periodically changing CVVs makes stolen data less valuable.

Most recently PNC responded to the rise in digital banking by rolling out hybrid branches called solution centers—housing self-serve tools such as video teller machines ATMs and mobile workstations while in-person staff assist with more complex needs. The hybrid approach is a strong tactic that aligns well with consumer preferences. For example a 2020 KPMG survey showed that once the pandemic eases customers would be less likely to visit branches to manage accounts (6%) or check balances (8%).

7. Truist Financial Corporation – $534.19 Billion

Truist is the bank formed by Branch Banking and Trust Company (BB&T) and SunTrust at the end of 2019. According to the Federal Reserve’s 2019 figures BB&T and SunTrust were ranked 11th and 12th in bank assets respectively.

Now operating over 2000 branches in 15 states and Washington D.C. the combined bank offers consumer and commercial banking asset management securities brokerage mortgage and insurance products and financial services.

8. Goldman Sachs – $513.91 Billion

A newcomer to the top ten Goldman Sachs is a well known global investment banking management and securities firm. Its clients have access to a variety of financial services including banking products through Marcus—its online banking division that made its debut in fall 2016 and began offering personal loans per Bankrate.

While its investment banking arm experienced a hit in Q3 of 2022 Goldman saw its consumer and wealth management revenue increase 18% YoY due to credit card balances and higher interest rates. Additionally its fixed income saw 41% YoY growth—helping Goldman exceed analysts’ estimates. The firm has also announced a full overhaul of its products and services to mitigate its losses in other areas.

9. TD Bank – $394.33 Billion

In addition to having extensive influence abroad TD Bank has become one of the largest banks in the US due to its integration of artificial intelligence and utilization of digital technology.

TD Bank has partnered with KAI Consumer Banking to launch Clari an AI-powered chatbot in Canada. Clari answers customers’ questions via text message and notifies them when credit card payments and when a payment is made. As Clari has significantly cut down the call volume in Canada it is likely that TD Bank may develop a similar chatbot for its US branches.

In another partnership the company teamed up with fintech provider Amount to leverage its suite of digital lending tools—including fraud detection and account verification.

10. Capital One – $391.81 Billion

Capital One has made the list of top US banks likely due to its ongoing commitment to digital transformation. Capital One increased its technology staff from 2500 in 2011 to 9000 in 2019 helping launch Eno—its AI-powered chatbot similar to Bank of America’s Erica.

Despite its major data breach in mid-2019 the bank also came first on our Banking Digital Trust Report where it was the frontrunner on all six pillars of trust: security privacy reputation reliability ease of use and feature breadth. Capital One’s high scores likely stemmed from its recent large-scale cloud migration which has improved service continuity facilitated upgrades and reinforced security protocols to get back into customers’ good graces.

Capital One also acquired fintech United Income in 2019 a digital platform that offers wealth management services for people transitioning into retirement. This combination allows the firm to offer technological capabilities with human facets. For example by providing access to a team of wealth managers this makes Capital One appealing to consumers who still desire human interaction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDIzLzAxLzAzL2JsYXplLWJsdWUtbGlnaHRzLWRvd250b3duLWNpbmNpbm5hdGktZGFtYXItaGFtbGluLWJpbGxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blaze of blue lights in Downtown Cincinnati for Damar Hamlin Bills,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Blue lights are aglow across Downtown Cincinnati from Paycor Stadium on the Ohio Riverfront to Fifth Third Bank’s headquarters on Fountain Square as the nation watches and prays for Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin.

The game has been indefinitely postponed.

The NFL announced an update on the game Tuesday afternoon saying it will not resume this week and no decision has been made if it will be played at a later date.

After the Baltimore Ravens lost Sunday to the Pittsburgh Steelers Cincinnati could seal up the AFC North with a win over Buffalo.

Bengals’ head coach Zac Taylor walked across the field at Paycor Stadium Monday night to talk to the Bills’ head coach Sean McDermott and then both coaches sent their teams to the locker rooms.

Taylor also went to UC Medical Center where he was photographed behind the wheel of a vehicle as he drove away by our media partner at the Cincinnati Enquirer.

JACKSONVILLE Fla. — We have an update on a solar panel company that many of you have emailed our ""Ask Anthony"" team about in the past few months.

We found court documents that reveal USA Energy Savers filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy on November 29th. Chris Redman the owner of USA Energy Savers also known as R Solar Group is listed as an authorized representative.

This all started with our first story in November. We interviewed Monique Bates a disabled veteran who purchased solar panels from the company a year ago. She contacted First Coast News because she found out her warranty was invalid. That's on top of other issues she was having with the business.

After that story aired we received several emails from viewers with similar issues. Joshua and Regina LeValley bought solar panels from R Solar Group in May 2021.

At the time the company was known as USA Energy Savers. The owner Chris Redman filed paperwork in August of that year to change the name to R Solar Group with addresses in Jacksonville and South Carolina.

We discovered USA Energy Savers had an ""F"" rating with the Better Business Bureau.

I feel like we were completely scammed and I feel so dumb for trying to do the right thing"" Regina LeValley said.

The LeValleys thought they made a good investment. Like many others they just wanted to save money on their electric bill. But they say the panels are currently malfunctioning.

""I would like for him to make good on his claims. Either come and take his equipment and dissolve my loans for this equipment...or fix it"" LeValley added.

We went through Duval County Court records and discovered Christopher Redman and USA Energy Savers are being evicted from a property on Baymeadows on Jacksonville's Southside. That's not the same office listed for R Solar Group.

According to the court documents Redman has not paid rent at that office since June 1st and that equals to more than $32000.

There is a meeting of creditors happening Thursday January 5th at 1pm. That's where the debtor is questioned under oath about assets and liabilities. In some cases creditors can also question the debtor on those subjects too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vaW1wYWt0ZXIuY29tL2xldmFudGVzLWZvbGRhYmxlLXNvbGFyLXBhbmVsLXRoZS1wZXJmZWN0LWNvbXBhbmlvbi1mb3Itb3V0ZG9vci1hZHZlbnR1cmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Levante's Foldable Solar Panel: The Perfect Companion for Outdoor Adventures,"Levante is a startup producing an origami-inspired foldable solar panel. The origami technique allows a rigid surface to fold in an efficient way. Levante solar panel folds like origami it is compact and portable when closed.

The two founders of Levante Sara Plaga and Kim-Joar Myklebust are both experienced sailors. During their travels by sailboat they have often faced the need for clean energy.

“Several times we ran out of power in the boat. Waking up in the middle of the night hearing the battery alarm. We had to turn on the engine to not kill the batteries. The solar panels we had on the boat were never enough to cover our needs.” Says Kim.

The idea

Kim knew that satellites use origami-inspired solar panels. He understood that it could be a solution to install solar panels when small surfaces are available. After several studies on paper the prototype evolved into a wood and finally a functioning product.

Today Levante is working with an engineering company in Turin Man Evotech Srl to optimize the product for industrialization and to put it on the market. Another important partner for Levante since its start is Sailing Uma an international design consultancy with significant experience in the sailing industry.

From foldable to origami solar panels

Levante is the first origami solar panel available to the public. The product has an innovative and patented folding and self-supporting design. When it’s closed the panel is out of the way because it folds up in a compact structure producing 75 W in 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters.

The panel is 50% lighter than traditional solar panels. Thanks to the usage of a carbon fiber structure Levante panel is really robust and light. You can keep it closed when you don’t use it when you are sailing or when you want to remove it or transport it elsewhere.

The structure of the foldable solar panel

Levante co-founder Kim Myklebust has experience in the automotive industry. Born in Norway Kim moved to Italy to design racing cars. After working for several years in the motorsport industry for Dallara building Formula 1 and Formula 3 cars he quickly realized he wanted to do something meaningful for the planet.

Kim noticed that almost 40% (around 250 kg) of the carbon fiber used in the production of a single racing car was discarded. When he started to design Levante’s solar panel he wanted to use that same carbon fiber that was seen as waste. To do that the company started a collaboration with its partner Advanced Composites Solutions to begin recycling carbon fiber by recovering waste from the automotive industry.

The solar panels on Levante are made of monocrystalline bifacial cells which are more efficient than polycrystalline. Furthermore it is quick to install and get ready to use.

Levante is truly a versatile solution. It can have a wide range of applications not just sailboats. From houses with limited outside space to other vehicles like RVs. Wherever you think there is no space for regular solar panels Levante’s origami foldable solar panel can make it happen.

The series began in 1991-92 with two games and has expanded to host 32 high school teams for 16 games. Afterward the teams and their fans get to enjoy a Bucks game.

Junior Jake Roth who scored a season-high 10 points in the game said its an experience he won’t forget.

“It was pretty cool playing on the Buck’s court — it’s not something every team gets to do” Roth said. “It was a cool opportunity.”

Head coach Travis Sysko who coordinated with Pardeville head coach Chris Lindert to schedule the game echoed Roth’s thoughts.

“It was pretty exciting when you think about the quality of players playing out there on a regular basis” Sysko said. “Getting a win makes it that much better. It’s one of the best basketball facilities probably in the world so for us to get an opportunity to play here was pretty special.”

Max Marty started the game by scoring seven of the Knight’s first nine points. New Glarus added to its lead with a 3-pointer from Breckyn Thompson and a bucket each from AC Strok and Lawrence Vasquez.

Pardeeville held close with free throws from Coy Haseleu but Ethan Friedrich’s solo nine-point run gave the Knight’s a 28-16 lead. During the run Friedrich grabbed a loose ball and sprinted down the court for a basket and scored another two points on a fast break.

Strok scored the remaining four points of the first half for New Glarus. He had control of the ball in the final seconds of the half but his pass to the post was tipped. Friedrich grabbed the loose ball and put up a contested shot that missed the mark as the buzzer sounded.

The Bulldogs started the second half on a 10-1 run. Eli Achterberg scored back-to-back points dribbling right through the Knight’s defenders. Caleb Gard and Austin Hohn then made a 3-pointer each.

Roth and Jack Leonard extended New Glarus’s lead to eight as Roth completed a three-point play at the charity stripe. Leonard then took a charge from Haseleu and scored on the other end of the court. Pardeeville worked its way back to a two-point game though with threes from Achterberg and Gard.

With an 8-1 run the Bulldogs took their first lead a 51-50. Haseleau completed a three-point play and Gard sank a three.

Thompson quickly gave new Glarus the lead back with a basket from beyond the arc but Hohn tied the game at 53 with his own basket. Roth responded with a 3-pointer and from then on the Knights never looked back.

Strok and Parman each converted a three-point play at the charity stripe for a five-point lead. Pardeeville drew within two but Roth and Friedrich went a combined 7-for-8 from the free-throw line down the stretch to pull away for the win.

Friedrich paced the Knights with 17 points while Roth who has consistently seen more minutes as of late finished with a season best 10 points.

“When your opportunity comes you have to make the most of it and he for sure did that today” Sysko said. “When you make the most of those opportunities that leads to more minutes. He was playing so well I didn’t want to take him out. It was a great opportunity for Jake and I’m proud of him.”

Thompson Parman and Strok all totaled 11 points. The remaining offense came from Leonard (seven points) and Vasquez (two points).

“We said from day one this is going to be a special experience and we wanted to give everyone an opportunity to say they played at Fiserv” Sysko said. “Everyone stepped in and gave a contribution which was great to see.”

Gard and Hohn paced Pardeeville with 18 and 17 points respectively. The third player in double figures for the Bulldogs was Achterberg with 14 points.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vYnVja3MvdmlkZW9zL2dpYW5uaXMtYW50ZXRva291bm1wby01NS1wb2ludHMtdnMtd2l6YXJkcy0xLTMtMjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Giannis Antetokounmpo 55 Points vs. Wizards | 1.3.22,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vYnVja3MvdmlkZW9zL2dpYW5uaXMtYW50ZXRva291bm1wby01NS1wb2ludHMtdnMtd2l6YXJkcy0xLTMtMjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E4519690>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Giannis Antetokounmpo just gets better by the day. On Tuesday night the Milwaukee Bucks star just dropped a new career-high in points.

Antetokounmpo went “Double Nickel” on the Washington Wizards. The two-time NBA MVP scored a new career-high 55 points in the Bucks‘ 123-113 win at Fiserv Forum.

Giannis hadn’t scored more than 45 points this season entering the night. Prior to that he hit 50 points three separate times in his career. The previous high was set on March 17 2019 when Antetokounmpo scored 52 against the Philadelphia 76ers.

But he came just an inch away from making even more history. The Bucks’ single-game record for points was 57. Milwaukee legend Michael Redd set the mark back in November 2006.

Giannis’ performance on Tuesday night startled and wowed the NBA world.

WorldWideWob pointed out that this has been a prodigious week in the Association.

Drew Hamm tweeted “Personally? I don’t think it’s fair that Giannis seems to get considerably better every year he plays.” Well yes fair. It is pretty absurd.

Bucks writer Ti Windisch tweeted “Giannis decided dropping 40 for the third straight game wasn’t enough so he made it a career-high 55… Repping the Milwaukee on his jersey made it all the better a loud and clear signal that he’s glad to be in the city. Legendary legendary stuff.”

Justin Wills pointed out a fun fact: “Giannis warned Michael Redd that he would break his single game Bucks scoring record. He almost did tonight.”

hat will it take to build the electric vehicles of the future? First and foremost it will take a workforce equipped with the skillsets required to design and produce the most advanced cars and trucks on the planet as well as the batteries that power them.

At Ford Motor Company the executives who run the manufacturing operations for North America are taking nothing for granted. That’s why they’ve turned to the talented people at the Tennessee College of Applied Technology (TCAT) for help.

Here’s how ideas spawned in Dearborn Michigan turn into action in Jackson Tennessee. Even before Ford broke ground September 23 at BlueOval City — its largest most advanced vehicle manufacturing complex in the company’s 119-year history — leaders at Ford were already working with educators in West Tennessee to figure out the best way to train the 5800 workers who will one day staff the nearly 6-square-mile campus in Stanton.

After all Ford’s spending $5.6 billion to build this new plant for producing electric trucks and a joint-venture facility with electric vehicle battery maker SK of Korea. With that level of investment the automaker is not about to skimp on training.

“We are looking at apprenticeship programs and identifying occupations that Ford will need in the plant” says Heath McMillian executive vice president of TCAT Jackson’s BlueOval City campus. “We are looking at traditional TCAT programming to support Ford and their local suppliers who might need training in the area. The initial goal will be the onboarding of the new employees for Ford BlueOval as the plant gets started.”

“TCATs are nimble and willing to work with regional employers to meet their needs. You will see that done on a very large scale here.”

­— Heath McMillian Executive Vice President Tennessee College of Applied Technology Jackson’s BlueOval City campus

TCAT operates 26 training centers around the state but this one will be its most advanced by far. First of all the state is investing $40 million to build this new training center just off Exit 42 on Interstate 40 adjacent to the BlueOval site. Ford has already identified over 130 specific skills that its new workers must have in order to fulfill their job responsibilities at the new production complex about 45 miles from Memphis.

“Stanton is basically a farming community” says McMillian. “We are bringing manufacturing education to them for the first time. Our job begins with outreach. Ford has already been on the ground and has been very involved in the community to help them understand what’s coming and how best to prepare for it. Their marketing team has been very involved in this process as we work to stand up these facilities and staff them.”

‘We Are Building the Future Here’

McMillian says the instructors for Ford will come from all over. Some will transfer from other TCAT centers across Tennessee. Others will be new instructors recruited from private industry in the region. “We’re looking for instructors who have considerable amounts of industrial experience” he notes. “Memphis for example has a large population of medical device manufacturing. In Jackson where I am located we have Toyota and other advanced manufacturing companies.”

A lot is riding on this gambit. Ford has set an ambitious goal of producing 2 million electric vehicles per year by late 2026. To hit that target BlueOval City must be operational by late 2024 or early 2025.

“We are building the future right here in West Tennessee” said Eric Grubb Ford’s director of new footprint construction. “This facility is the blueprint for Ford’s future manufacturing facilities and will enable Ford to help lead America’s shift to electric vehicles.”

In addition to its work with TCAT Ford is engaging locally in other ways. The company is working with the University of Tennessee to restore the stream waters flowing through the school’s Lone Oaks Farm and to expand STEM education to K-12 students in Tennessee.

“Ford gets very involved when they do a project like this” says McMillian. “Their North American training manager has moved to West Tennessee. He and I are working together on training development. I am working with their entire workforce development team.”

Automakers Like TCAT’s Track Record

Essentially TCAT will deliver to Ford what it already provides to employers around the state – just at a much larger level says McMillian. “TCATs are nimble and willing to work with regional employers to meet their needs” he says. “You will see that done on a very large scale here. It will be very Ford-centric. We will adhere to our model of delivering local competency-based education and training.”

McMillian adds that Ford is also coordinating training between its two new BlueOval investments — the one in West Tennessee and the other one in Glendale Kentucky. BlueOval SK is a joint venture with SK of Korea and is a $5.8 billion investment that will result in two new battery manufacturing facilities in Central Kentucky.

“There is some coordination between Tennessee and Kentucky” McMillian says. “We are cooperating with Kentucky a lot to make sure there is a lot of collaboration and alignment.”

Fortinet Threat Score – The ten toughest holes on the DP World Tour in the 2022 season

Throughout the 2022 season the DP World Tour teamed up with Fortinet to bring you the Fortinet Threat Score holes - the toughest on Tour.

These holes tested the world's very best and were often key in determining who was claiming titles as the season progressed. Here we look at what proved to be the top ten hardest holes from the 810 that made up the 2022 DP World Tour season across 45 courses.

Difficulty Rank: 10th Cazoo Open supported by Gareth Bale Course: The Twenty Ten Course Celtic Manor Hole 14: 485 yards – Par 4 Scoring average to par: +0.45 Playing just shy of half a stroke over par the par four 14th at Celtic Manor rounds out our top ten toughest holes on the DP World Tour in the 2022 season. This is the only hole in our top ten rundown which saw an eagle made while there were 49 birdies across the four days. The total of 64 double-bogeys or worse across the week is 25 more than the next highest total emphasising the challenge it posed to the field. Tournament winner Shinkwin was two under par birdieing the hole in the opening two rounds while Connor Syme was the only other player from the top ten to be under par on the 14th.

Difficulty Rank: 9th The 150th Open Course: St Andrews Old Course Hole 17: 451 yards – Par 4 Scoring average to par: +0.46 As was the case at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship the par-four 17th at St Andrews’ Old Course maintained its track record of being the hardest hole in The Open Championship. Only 22 birdies were made with Viktor Hovland the only player in the top five on the leaderboard to play it under par. Tournament winner Cameron Smith and runner-up Cameron Young both parred the hole across all four days. Despite bogeying the hole in the opening three rounds Jordan Spieth managed to finish in the top ten.

Difficulty Rank: 8th ISPS Handa World Invitational presented by AVIV Clinics Course: Massereene Golf Club Hole 17: 476 yards – Par 4 Scoring average to par: +0.46 The 17th hole at Massereene proved to be the toughest of the week as it alongside Galgorm played host to leading men and women players from the DP World Tour LPGA Tour and Ladies European Tour in Northern Ireland. In the one round played at Massereene by the full male field across the four days 54 bogeys or worse were made at the 17th. Tournament winner Ewen Ferguson was one of just eight players to make a birdie with only one other player in the top ten and ties doing so.

Difficulty Rank: 7th The Masters Tournament Course: Augusta National Golf Club Hole 11: 520 yards – Par 4 Scoring average to par: +0.48 The par-four 11th at Augusta was among the holes which underwent alterations ahead of the 2022 Masters. Historically the second hardest hole in the history of the Masters Tournament the tees were moved back 15 yards and to the golfer’s left. The move provided a greater risk to players who missed to the left and thus resulted in tougher approach shots into the green. Scottie Scheffler parred the hole all four days as he claimed his maiden Major Championship. The top five players on the leaderboard played the 11th in a combined two-over-par with only Cameron Smith (-1) playing it at par or better.

Difficulty Rank: 6th Alfred Dunhill Links Championship Course: St Andrews Old Course Hole 17: 495 yards – Par 4 Scoring average to par: +0.49 Once again the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship was played across three courses – the Old Course at St Andrews Carnoustie and Kingsbarns. The Road Hole at The Home of Golf was statistically the hardest playing all but half a stroke over par. Despite many of the field having played the Old Course a few months earlier at The 150th Open Championship only 15 birdies were made by the field across the four rounds at St Andrews with those playing in the final day making two visits. Tournament winner Ryan Fox played the hole in one over par securing victory - his second Tour win of the season - by one shot despite making a bogey at the 17th in the final round. Runner-up pair Callum Shinkwin and Alex Noren were one under and level par for the hole respectively.

Difficulty Rank: 5th DS Automobiles Italian Open Course: Marco Simone Golf & Country Club Hole 8: 503 yards – Par 4 Scoring average to par: +0.50 In an insight into what might be to come at this year’s Ryder Cup at Marco Simone the par-four eighth proved the toughest hole at last season’s DS Automobiles Italian Open. A mere 29 birdies were made by the entire field for the week. In addition there were 45 double-bogeys or worse considerably more than next highest-scoring hole. Robert MacIntyre mixed a bogey in the second round with a birdie in the third round as he played the hole in level par for the week. Matt Fitzpatrick who lost out to fellow European Ryder Cup hopeful MacIntyre in a play-off for the title was one over after making a five in the third round. None of the top ten finishers managed to finish the week under par at the eighth testament to the challenge it posed.

Difficulty Rank: 4th Porsche European Open Course: Green Eagle Golf Courses Hole 6: 475 yards – Par 4 Scoring average to par: +0.51 Just one hole separated the toughest and second toughest at Green Eagle Golf Courses last season. The sixth played half a stroke over par across the week. Over the four rounds of play 25 birdies were made by the field - only the par-three 13th saw fewer birdies. Samooja birdied the sixth in both the third and fourth rounds as he landed his maiden Tour win. In comparison his nearest challengers Wil Besseling Richard Mansell and Victor Perez all parred the hole on each day. Other than Samooja Marcel Schneider was the only player in the top ten to be under par on the sixth.

Difficulty Rank: 3rd Porsche European Open Course: Green Eagle Golf Courses Hole 4: 488 yards – Par 4 Scoring average to par: +0.53 Widely regarded as one of the toughest examinations on the DP World Tour Green Eagles Golf Courses - host venue of the Porsche European Open – boasted two of the ten hardest holes in the 2022 campaign. The fourth a 488-yard par four was the hardest hole on the course at last year’s edition. Tournament winner Kalle Samooja played the hole in one over par missing the fairway once across the four rounds as he made a bogey in the first round. Of the top ten and ties on the leaderboard at the end of the event nobody managed to play the fourth under par. The hole also produced 58 double-bogeys or worse – eight more than the next highest across the week.

Difficulty Rank: 2nd Genesis Scottish Open Course: The Renaissance Club Hole 18: 483 yards – Par 4 Scoring average to par: +0.62 For the first time the Genesis Scottish Open was co-sanctioned by the DP World Tour and the PGA TOUR with 14 of the top 15 players in the Official World Golf Ranking at the time in the field. Despite the calibre of the players on show at the third Rolex Series event of the season the closing hole at The Renaissance Club played more than six-tenths of a stroke over par. It only brought about six birdies across the four rounds of tournament golf. The top five finishers in the tournament were a testament to the difficulty playing it in a combined 11 over par. Tournament winner Xander Schauffele played this hole in three-over-par for the week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGNvdGl0YW5zLmNvbS9idHdhdGNoL2J0LWhlbHBzLWludGVycG9sLWRyaXZlLWRvd24tYWZyaWNhbi1jeWJlcmNyaW1lLzYwMjEuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BT helps Interpol drive down African cybercrime | Premium | TelcoTitans.com,"Join the TelcoTitans community and continue reading this article

The terms of their leases each have been extended through 2042 with further extension options thereafter.

In the nearly 670000 square foot transaction with Fox Corporation the lease extension will be effective December 2025 while the 486000 square foot lease transaction with News Corp will be effective December 2027.

As part of the lease extension agreements Ivanhoé Cambridge and its asset manager Hines will be embarking on a series of planned upgrades to the building which will include a renovated 6th Avenue lobby upgrades to the building's outdoor plazas and entrances and the creation of a new tenant lobby accessible from 47th Street. Work is expected to commence in late 2023.

The combined 1.152-million-square-foot lease was the largest of 2022 and largest in more than three years in Manhattan—supporting the fact that many companies still need and value office space to leverage the hybrid work environment. Midtown total leasing exceeded 21.0 million square feet in 2022—on par with the historical 20-year average of 21.2 million square feet—solidifying the resilience of the Midtown office leasing market in a post-pandemic world.

Jonathan Pearce Executive Vice President Leasing & Development Ivanhoé Cambridge stated: ""We are thrilled to be announcing these important transactions. FOX and News Corp are one of our largest tenant partners globally. This commitment made by Fox and News Corp is a clear vote of confidence in 1211 and Midtown Manhattan. It also underscores the importance that these leading companies place on having a dynamic workplace that supports its business activities as well as the attraction and retention of key talent and to offer a leading experience to its viewers customers guests and employees. We look forward to working with FOX and News Corp to ensure 1211 continues to provide an exceptional home for their organizations as their needs continue to grow and evolve.""

Michael McMahon Managing Director Asset Management Hines added: ""We are delighted to be extending the important and long-standing relationship that ownership has with both FOX Corporation and News Corp at 1211 Avenue of the Americas. The decision by these leading global media companies to remain at 1211 confirms the quality of the property and its infrastructure as well as the importance of its prime Midtown location to best support its business needs.""

Fox Corporation and News Corporation the pillars of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire have opted to renew their deals to occupy their respective headquarters at Ivanhoe Cambridge’s 1211 Sixth Avenue.

The 20-year deals represent a boon for the 45-story tower where the two companies’ combined 1.1 million square feet account for more than half of the rentable space the Wall Street Journal reported. They’re also a shot in the arm for the Manhattan office market which has seen both leasing activity and prospecting plummet.

Tenants leased just 4.9 million square feet of Manhattan office space in the fourth quarter according to Colliers the borough’s worst performance since the second quarter of 2021. The 46.5 percent decline in leasing activity from the third quarter to the fourth was the sharpest drop recorded since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Average asking rents in Midtown are down 7.6 percent from March 2020. Meanwhile data from VTS show that new business searches for new office space in 2022 were below half of the 2018 and 2019 levels.

Older buildings have been hit particularly hard as tenants particularly in the media and technology sectors seize the opportunity to upgrade their spaces. Ivanhoe Cambridge’s building at 1211 Sixth Avenue which opened in 1973 will undergo interior and exterior renovations as part of the lease agreements according to the Journal.

The leases come months after Murdoch proposed a merger of the two companies which separated in 2013. News Corporation’s assets include the Journal the New York Post and book publisher HarperCollins among others.

Fox Corporation and News Corp have signed separate long-term leases totaling almost 1.2 million square feet to retain each of their corporate headquarters at Ivanhoé Cambridge’s 1211 Ave. of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan. Their leases each have been extended through 2042 with further extension options thereafter.

In the nearly 670000-square-foot transaction with Fox Corporation the lease extension will be effective December 2025 while the 486000-square-foot transaction with News Corp will be effective December 2027. As part of the lease extension agreements Ivanhoé Cambridge and its asset manager Hines will be embarking on a series of planned upgrades to the building

“Fox and News Corp are one of our largest tenant partners globally.” said Jonathan Pearce EVP leasing & development North America Ivanhoé Cambridge. “This commitment made by Fox and News Corp is a clear vote of confidence in 1211 and Midtown Manhattan.”

Sign 20-Year Lease Renewals At New York Headquarters Building A Hopeful Sign For Return Of Midtown Manhattan Office Pulse,"Rupert Murdoch‘s News Corp. and Fox Corp. have signed 20-year renewals of their leases in their longtime shared headquarters in New York at 1211 Avenue of the Americas.

The updated agreements with Ivanhoé Cambridge a real estate subsidiary of a Québec investment firm span 1.2 million square feet of office space. Together they represent the largest commercial lease deal of 2022 as well as the biggest in Manhattan since 2019. Along with the interior space the renewals call for renovations of the plaza and outdoor spaces where Fox Sports and Fox News have hosted broadcasts. There will also be a new tenant lobby on 47th Street. Renovation work is due to start later this year.

In a time of deep uncertainty about the state of office life in general across the U.S. the renewals offer hope for a number of stakeholders including New York City officials commercial landlords and local businesses. Companies have had to implement waves of changes to their office strategies since Covid started sweeping across the country nearly three years ago. Commercial occupancy rates in Manhattan are still low with many employees opting to work remotely and the future of Midtown’s famously dense forest of skyscrapers is the subject of regular debate among policy wonks as well as average New Yorkers.

Particularly in the media business the string of postwar towers from 42nd to 57th streets on Sixth Avenue (as the Avenue of the Americas was known before 1945) has long had an outsized symbolic importance. NBCUniversal’s home at 30 Rockefeller Plaza remains intact but the street was also once home to companies like CBS Time-Life and McGraw-Hill. Today it is still known for its many office towers as well as landmarks like Radio City Music Hall and Carnegie Hall. Helped by its proximity to transit hubs it has fared better than other neighborhoods during the Covid era despite a relative lack of the kinds of ultra-modern corporate sites found in Hudson Yards or downtown. The Murdoch-dominated building 1211 opened in 1973 the same year as the original twin towers of the World Trade Center and bears all of the geometric design hallmarks of that era.

The office leases now run through 2042 and carry further extension options. Fox has almost 670000 square feet and its lease extension takes effect in December 2025. News Corp.’s lease for 486000 square feet gets extended at the end of 2027.

Overall Midtown total leasing exceeded 21 million square feet in 2022 Ivanhoé Cambridge noted which is on par with the historical 20-year average of 21.2 million square feet. The company said the level of activity demonstrates “the resilience of the Midtown office leasing market in a post-pandemic world.”

Jonathan Pearce EVP Leasing & Development North America at Ivanhoé Cambridge said Fox and News Corp. have placed a “clear vote of confidence in 1211 and Midtown Manhattan” with the reup. The renewal “also underscores the importance that these leading companies place on having a dynamic workplace that supports its business activities as well as the attraction and retention of key talent and to offer a leading experience to its viewers customers guests and employees.”"

With global logistics challenges also lingering from the pandemic’s darkest days Mexico could be one country to watch when investing in global trade this year via the Franklin FTSE Mexico ETF (FLMX).

Why look to a Mexico ETF now? Consider its potential to benefit from the trade war between China and the U.S. which entered a new and potentially even more tense phase with the new U.S. export restrictions on semiconductors in China. Former President Donald Trump had formalized a long-brewing rivalry between the two countries with his tariff impositions but the semiconductor rules look more like a direct shot at China’s ability to compete with core parts of the American economy in tech.

Research from Bank of America shows that while the Chinese share of U.S. imports of manufactured goods has dipped to 16.7% Mexico’s share sits at 9.7% as of October – the highest point since 1997. Mexico has gained share in U.S. imports in areas like plastics and textiles with its wages lower than those in China and crucially a long and well-traveled border with the U.S.

That last point becomes even more important given that logistics challenges are still hanging around – 61% of logistics managers at major firms and trade organizations like the National Retail Federation told CNBC in a survey that their supply chains are still not working normally. Almost a third of those same managers added that they expected their operations to operate normally again in or after 2025 or never.

Mexico’s shared land border with the U.S. has its fair share of problems but its economy may be poised to benefit from taking on a bigger share of the U.S. import business. That’s where a Mexico ETF can benefit from global trade with FLMX a candidate to watch.

The ETF charges just 19 basis points to track the FTSE Mexico RIC Capped Index which includes large and mid-size companies in Mexico but more small-cap exposure than rival Mexico ETFs – as well as a significantly cheaper fee. The strategy has outperformed its ETF Database Category Average and Factset Segment Average over three months returning 12.6% in that time.

Global uncertainty looks to continue this year with geopolitics returning to investors’ minds in a big way last year. For those looking to navigate those challenges a Mexico ETF like FLMX could be an option to consider as the U.S. market looks increasingly to the South for business.

The asset manager with $68 billion in assets said in a Dec. 28 statement that it’s shuttering the VanEck Russia ETF (RSX) and the VanEck Russia Small-Cap ETF (RSXJ) citing the funds’ “inability to buy sell and take or make delivery of Russian securities.” New York-based VanEck said it suspended fund redemptions ahead of the expected liquidation and distribution of assets on or about Jan. 12.

The liquidations follow similar moves recently at issuers including BlackRock Inc. and Franklin Templeton which are closing Russia funds following the country’s invasion of Ukraine. Trading in Russian assets is difficult and illegal in many cases due to sanctions against the country and many ETFs no longer trade. VanEck stopped creating new shares in its Russia ETFs in March it said in a filing.

“A substantial number of the Funds’ positions” were made illiquid due to “geopolitical affairs and sanctions” VanEck’s statement read adding that the current environment makes it “impossible to manage the Funds consistent with their investment objectives.” VanEck didn’t respond to a request for comment from ETF.com.

Russian stocks themselves have plummeted: the ruble-denominated MOEX index has dropped 38% this year. RSX which launched nearly 15 years ago tracks an index of Russian companies weighted by market cap. It collapsed 79% this year and assets under management plummeted to $35 million. RSXJ launched in 2011 tracks a weighted index of small-cap Russian securities and depository receipts. It’s lost 66% this year and the fund’s assets have dropped to $400000 according to ETF.com data.

VanEck’s move comes a week after Franklin Templeton Investments said it was liquidating its Franklin FTSE Russia ETF (FLRU) which followed BlackRock Inc.’s August announcement of dissolving its iShares MSCI Russia ETF (ERUS).

Report author and CCPA senior economist David Macdonald said that the 100 CEOS who are mostly men made 243 times the average Canadian worker in 2021 again beating 2018’s record of 227 times.

Most of the money these CEOs made was not from their salary but from so-called variable compensation which includes bonuses stock options and shares. That ratio has been climbing over the years with 83% of CEOs’ total pay in 2021 made up of variable compensation compared with 69% in 2008 according to the report.

“The last two years really exemplify everything that’s wrong with CEO pay” said Macdonald calling it a “pay-for-luck scheme.”

Variable compensation is intended to be tied to company performance he said but the pandemic showed that’s not always the case.

When companies fall on hard economic times like during 2020 they often tweak compensation rules to ensure executive pay doesn’t suffer too much he said; and when companies do well like during high inflation executives rake it in.

“In 2020 you have half of the CEOs on the list receiving government support and/or changing their bonus formulas to exclude the negative impact of the pandemic on their pay” he said. “And then the following year is record inflation which drives record profits which drives record CEO compensation.”

“They’re cushioned from the bad but when things are good then the sky’s the limit.”

The CEO pay trends of 2021 are likely to have continued into 2022 as they were driven by historically high profits and historically high inflation said Macdonald which of course continued over the past year despite the Bank of Canada’s efforts to quell inflation with — again historic — interest rate hikes.

“It’s unlikely that we’ll go back to the level that we saw pre-pandemic it’s likely they’ll continue at much higher pay levels in 2022” he said.

“Inflation is bad for households. It’s bad for workers generally. But it’s been great for the corporate sector and it’s been great for CEO pay.”

The report offers four policy proposals for governments including the introduction of a wealth tax and the implementation of higher top marginal tax brackets.

There’s also a suggested limit on the corporate deductibility of compensation over $1 million which Macdonald said could yield almost $200 million in federal corporate income tax revenue; and a proposal to raise the capital gains inclusion rate to 100% which would mean taxing capital gains like regular employment income while currently only 50% of capital gains are considered income for tax purposes.

Previous reports had recommended getting rid of the so-called stock option deduction where people receiving stock options as compensation would only pay tax on 50% of the value of the stock options. In July 2021 a new law came into effect capping that deduction at $200000 worth of shares though Macdonald said it could take a few years to see the impact of this change.

Macdonald said he thinks critical services like long-term care or health care could be better funded with more tax revenue from the highest earners in the country.

The highest-paid CEOs “boys’ club” continued in 2021 noted Macdonald with more men named Mark on the top 100 list (four) than there were women (three).

The highest-paid CEO in 2021 was Nuvei chair and CEO Philip Fayer who made almost $141 million in 2021 despite having an annual salary under a million dollars. The number-two spot was held by GFL Environmental Inc. president and CEO Patrick Dovigi who made more than $43 million in 2021.

The list’s floor has been rising as average CEO pay gets higher said Macdonald; this year the lowest-paid CEO on the list was Cameco Corp.’s Tim Gitzel at $6.7 million."

(FCX): Here is What You Need to Know,"Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Shares of this mining company have returned -2.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -5.6% change. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry to which Freeport-McMoRan belongs has lost 6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Here at Zacks we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.36 per share for the current quarter representing a year-over-year change of -62.5%. Over the last 30 days the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.2%.

The consensus earnings estimate of $2.27 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -27.5%. This estimate has changed +2% over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $1.68 indicates a change of -26% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +1.8%.

With an impressive externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Freeport-McMoRan.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Revenue Growth Forecast

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

For Freeport-McMoRan the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.39 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -12.6%. For the current and next fiscal years $22.46 billion and $22.62 billion estimates indicate -1.7% and +0.7% changes respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Freeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of -17.8%. EPS of $0.26 for the same period compares with $0.89 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.2 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.75%. The EPS surprise was -23.53%.

Over the last four quarters the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

I just wish it had this one killer feature,"Garmin Instinct Crossover 4.5 / 5 Very good pros and cons Pros Long battery life

Excellent GPS performance

Ultracomfortable strap

Always present luminescent analog hands

Innovative hand/display synchronization

Powerful Garmin software and ecosystem Cons Loss of handy Instinct window

Expensive $499.99 at Garmin

Garmin released a plethora of GPS sports watches launched in 2022. The last one was the Garmin Instinct Crossover which combines the analog hybrid features seen in the Vivomove with the rugged goodness of the Garmin Instinct series. It seems to appeal to people more the longer they use it but the price may be a barrier to that trial time.

While the Garmin Enduro 2 is clearly my favorite GPS sports watch I've come to enjoy the rugged design and second small window on the Instinct series. The Garmin Instinct Crossover takes away that cool window and adds in always present analog hands with cool hand movement to optimize your view of the display.

The Instinct Crossover provides long battery life and rugged features with a classy iconic design. If you like wearing a watch primarily to always provide you with glanceable time and want a watch that tracks all of your health and activity data then the Instinct Crossover may be just what you are looking for. It also helps that Garmin incorporated a new GPS chipset with much more accurate performance than the Instinct 2 series.

Specifications Display 0.9 inch 176 x 176 pixels monochrome memory-in-pixel Materials Fiber reinforced polymer stainless steel and glass Durability 10 ATM Connectivity 802.11 b/g/n WiFi Bluetooth ANT+ GPS/GLONASS/Galileo Sensors Accelerometer Altimeter Compass Optical Heart Rate Thermometer Battery 25 hours GPS 28 days in smartwatch mode Dimensions 45 x 45 x 16.2 mm and 65 grams Colors Black Blue Granite

Hardware

When you first look at the Garmin Instinct Crossover you might think you are looking at a standard Casio or G-Shock watch with large analog hands and hour markers that glow in the dark called Super-LumiNova for a period of about an hour. You can also press the top left button to activate the typical Garmin Instinct backlight. Telling the time is my primary use of a watch so the Instinct Crossover meets my primary watch need.

The watch looks great and the hands are always visible. Garmin

The display on the Instinct Crossover is only 0.9 inches in diameter with a sunlight-visible transflective memory-in-pixel 176 x 176 pixels resolution panel. The small display provides the essentials and the glances actually look good even on such a small monochrome display. Garmin also has a solar version of this watch that offers more battery life than the standard model.

The display is not a touchscreen as that would not make much sense with the analog hands and rugged design. The typical five physical Garmin buttons and navigation are present so if you have used a Garmin watch before then you will be able to pick it up and get going right away.

The Garmin Instinct Crossover looks a bit more refined than the Instinct with stainless steel highlights integrated into the polymer fiber bezel and watch body. The back has the heart rate sensor and standard Garmin charging port off to one side. Garmin's Instinct watches ship with the softest and most malleable watch bands I have ever used so wearing the watch is extremely comfortable.

Garmin ecosystem

Whether it was due to external market pressures or proactive leadership at Garmin the company made major strides in actively supporting its products over the past couple of years. We recently saw the release of the November Garmin watch updates that brought a host of new features to existing watch models. The Garmin Instinct Crossover launches with a ton of improvements over the Instinct 2 series including recovery time HRV status and more. Running power is supported with a compatible Garmin accessory.

Note the differences between these two Instinct branded devices Matthew Miller/ZDNET

The nice thing about a watch like the Garmin Instinct Crossover is that it functions primarily as a watch and then captures your health and activity data passively as you work out and live. Open up the Garmin Connect smartphone application and then you will find all of your data in full color with extensive capability to create reports and analyze your data. This includes blood pressure data from the new Garmin Index BPM device.

Also: Garmin's new Index BPM is the blood pressure monitor that I've been waiting for

The buttons are easy to manipulate on the watch Matthew Miller/ZDNET

Performance

I typically wear a Garmin Instinct device when fly fishing hiking or enjoying outdoor activities where I might need a watch to survive a fall or other incident but for the past few weeks I've been wearing it for all of my workouts. These include hiking trail running running walking and indoor rowing. I also wore another watch and carried one so that I could compare the performance of the Instinct Crossover. It turns out that switching to a different GPS receiver results in improved GPS performance and now the Instinct Crossover can be a trusted GPS sports watch. For many more details on the performance of the watch check out Ray Maker's in-depth review.

Garmin brought several more sport modes to the Instinct 2 earlier this year and the Instinct Crossover currently supports nearly 60 modes and utilities. I cannot wait to further explore the functionality of the fish golf and pickleball sports modes in the near future.

Bottom line

It takes a few days to fully appreciate the Garmin Instinct Crossover and for me it took viewing the watch in low light conditions where the hands and hour marks were always crystal clear watching the hands dynamically switch whenever the content needed to be viewed and the complete lack of thought about battery life. I continue to fall back on watches that last for weeks and will never fully embrace a watch that only lasts for one to three days again.

I didn't think any other rugged watch could trump the usefulness of the small round display on the Garmin Instinct and Instinct 2 device but the slightly more elegant design (stainless steel highlights) and always present watch hands beat out the small second screen for my needs. I also like that apps like the Starbucks card found in the Connect IQ store work well on this watch.

My only hesitation with the Garmin Instinct Crossover is the starting price of $499.99. The solar model adds $50 and the tactical edition adds $100 to that starting price. I do have my eye on the tidal blue solar model and if Garmin had included the awesome flashlight then this likely would be an immediate purchase for me. A flashlight would be a perfect addition to the Instinct lineup given that this series is designed for rugged outdoor conditions where a flashlight is a key tool to have in hand.

Alternatives to consider

The Garmin Instinct Crossover grew on me over time and may be a nice rugged GPS sports watch for the right customer. Take a look at these other similarly priced options if the Instinct Crossover's and analog hands are not your cup of tea.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2dhbWVzL2dhcm1pbi1icmluZ3MtYXRhcmktaW50by1pdHMtY2FyLWNhYmluLW9mLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin brings Atari into its car cabin of the future,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/games/garmin-brings-atari-into-its-car-cabin-of-the-future/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2dhbWVzL2dhcm1pbi1icmluZ3MtYXRhcmktaW50by1pdHMtY2FyLWNhYmluLW9mLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZ2FybWluLWxpdmUtc3RyZWFtLWRhc2gtY2FtZXJhLWNlcy0yMDIz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CES 2023: Garmin's LTE dash camera is always on,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZ2FybWluLWxpdmUtc3RyZWFtLWRhc2gtY2FtZXJhLWNlcy0yMDIz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3B70370>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Quiet hiring is when an organization acquires new skills without actually hiring new full-time employees says Emily Rose McRae who has led Gartner's future of work research team since its 2019 inception focusing on HR practices. Sometimes it means hiring short-term contractors. Other times it means encouraging current employees to temporarily move into new roles within the organization McRae says. ""The reality for the next year is — whether or not we go into a recession — everyone's a little nervous"" she says. ""In a lot of cases organizations are not necessarily doing a hiring freeze or layoffs but maybe slowing down a little bit on their hiring."" But every employer still has financial goals to meet — often ambitious ones. ""The talent shortage that we talked about throughout 2022 hasn't gone away"" McRae says. ""So you're in a situation where it's harder to get head count and you have a desperate need for talent.""

Why quiet hiring is on the horizon

Hiring usually falls into one of three categories: backfilling old roles creating new ones to help the company grow or addressing an acute immediate need. Quiet hiring is all about that third category even if it doesn't technically involve any new hiring at all. The idea is to prioritize the most crucial business functions at a given time which could mean temporarily mixing up the roles of current employees. McRae refers to that as ""internal quiet hiring."" She cites a recent example: Australian airline Qantas which asked executives to address a labor shortage last year in part by rotating in as baggage handlers. ""The executives are doing it in part because it's the right thing to do to keep the company going but it's also just a rotation that makes sense for a lot of people"" McRae says noting that they also gained a deeper understanding of how their operations work. There's some inherent tension here: If you're temporarily reassigned to a different part of your company you might interpret that as being told that your regular job isn't particularly important. After all nobody's getting hired to backfill your old responsibilities. Bosses can help address that by clearly articulating why the specific project or business division is so crucial to the company's success. It'll help the employee feel valued and less likely to see the move as a sign that they need to start looking for jobs elsewhere. Alternatively companies with few movable employees can hire short-term contractors to help keep things afloat throughout the year. McRae calls that ""external quiet hiring."" ""We have to deploy our employees against the priorities that matter the most"" she says.

How to take advantage of quiet hiring",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkeGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2ludGVydmlldy9nYXJ0bmVyLXRhbGVudC1zaG9ydGFnZS10by1zcGlrZS1zYWxlcy1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWRpdmVyc2l0eS8yMDIzLzAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gartner: Talent Shortage to Spike Sales Leadership Diversity,"Gartner predicts half of business-to-business (B2B) sales leadership roles will be filled by candidates from historically underrepresented demographics within the next five years and that chief sales officers (CSOs) have identified talent recruitment as their top external challenge “with only three available candidates per open B2B sales job and roles staying open for an average of two months.”

Those findings were part of “The Gartner Predictions for 2023: Talent Shifts in B2B Sales” webinar which also found talent pool bias toward those already in the specific job function repels a large number of high-quality candidates from applying and perpetuates a perception “where a lack of diversity is the norm” within a B2B enterprise. This insight comes as major industry firms like Cisco have boosted their efforts to bring in and retain talent and the broader industry has begun pushing new hiring platform models and nearshoring efforts.

Christopher Gamble senior director analyst at Gartner explained that despite the ongoing talent crisis CSOs have historically neglected tapping into “high-potential candidates from underrepresented groups but the pressures from operating shorthanded require a renewed focus on improving and diversifying the talent pipeline.”

Gamble told SDxCentral in an interview that it is essential for organizations to look at pay disparity and bias and they must build “new annual budgets that allow for compensation adjustments by as much as 30% and auditing pay equity at least biannually.”

While he noted this will be a challenge given the current economic climate “the cost is recouped when open territories are staffed with higher-producing reps who affect both the top and bottom line. The wrong move here would be lowering headcount to keep budgets flat. Chief sales officers need to work with their CFO counterpart now as part of their strategic planning in 2023 and beyond to get ahead of this wave.”

Challenging the Recruiting-Quo

Another key statistic within the report found that sellers will consume 65% fewer hours of training in 2026 compared to 2022 further reflecting a coming adjustment for talent outside of the specific job function. Gartner believes that to open this recruitment process CSOs need to partner with HR teams to adjust the candidate profiles to give more focus to skills and behaviors rather than experience and making sure to bias-check job postings so that they “properly frame the position to avoid skewed recruiting toward the same talent pool and demographics.”

The firm stressed that because members from underrepresented groups may worry about the organization having an “unsupportive or even discriminatory environment” an enterprise needs to prioritize underrepresented talent at the same level as other KPIs; invest in mentoring and retaining diverse talent from within and outside the enterprise to help CSOs increase awareness of diversity equity and inclusion (DE&I) challenges and bias; and invest in collaborative and learning tools that can support the rapidly expanding hybrid work model.

“Sales leaders who are unwilling to challenge existing recruitment efforts stand to miss out on highly qualified candidates” the firm warned.

Gamble also predicts the next “high-probability flash point” within DE&I may center around pay transparency and equity.

“As States such as Colorado and Connecticut require pay transparency a logical evolution could include mandated pay-equity” he told SDxCentral. “If this occurs we will see a major career-pathing adjustment further accelerating the DEI wave.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2thdGFsb24tcmVjb2duaXplZC1pbi10aGUtMjAyMi1nYXJ0bmVyLW1hcmtldC1ndWlkZS1mb3ItYWktYXVnbWVudGVkLTIxOTIwMTQ40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Katalon Recognized in the 2022 Gartner® Market Guide for AI-Augmented Software Testing Tools,"Press Release •

The move – planned since late 2021 – leaves GE with two prime divisions: GE Aerospace and energy unit GE Vernova.

GE intends to spin off GE Vernova in early 2024 at which point GE Aerospace would become the storied industrial conglomerate’s last surviving entity.

The 3 January divestiture makes GE HealthCare Technologies a separate public company listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. As part of the deal GE retained ownership of 19.1% of GE HealthCare’s stock.

Lawrence Culp chief executive of GE and of GE Aerospace says GE remains on track to divest GE Vernova – a division consisting of energy power and digital holdings – in “early 2024”.

When that happens the company that is now GE will change its name to GE Aerospace which will be its last remaining division GE has said. GE Aerospace is based in Ohio.

Culp will remain CEO. John Slattery is GE Aerospace chief commercial officer. He had been CEO of the division prior to the planned reorganisation.

GE disclosed the restructuring plan in November 2021 following years of financial trouble. It has said the split will help strengthen each of the surviving three businesses with GE surviving as “an aviation-focused company shaping the future of flight”.

In mid-2022 Culp said GE’s aerospace business will emerge from the process having a “wider strategic aperture” adding that it might “be in some businesses that we are not in today”.

He has helped pioneer technologies like digital twins — digital models of real-world machines like jet engines and turbines that can be used to model and predict the outcomes of possible future situations — and “humble AI” a concept that aims to bring the human and the AI together. “The AI is good when I have a lot of data but when the weather pattern is changing so rapidly I need a human to help me understand it” Parris says. Owing to his accomplishments this year Parris was the recipient of a trio of major honors. In January he won a 2022 BIG Innovation Award from the Business Intelligence Group; in February he was elected to the prestigious National Academy of Engineers; and in November it was revealed that Parris will receive the 2023 Black Engineer of the Year Award.

The award came about four months after the Air Force picked five companies to develop prototypes of a next-generation fighter jet engine with General Electric being among them at the time.

GE’s iteration of the engine is the XA100. The company says it is engineered to switch between high-thrust and high-efficiency modes allowing it to adapt to just about any situation a military jet could encounter. The engine has been designed for use in the Lockheed Martin F-35A and F-35C.

GE’s engine is one of two in the program’s crucial testing phase with Pratt & Whitney’s XA101.

Basically the award represents a continuation of the adaptive engine transition program funding GE for 2023. Pratt & Whitney may get a similar award.

Work will be performed in Cincinnati and is expected to be completed Dec. 31 2024. A GE spokesman confirmed Tuesday that the adaptive engine program remains funded for the coming year but declined to comment beyond that.

The contract came from the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

GE Aerospace is a big employer in Southwestern Ohio. Pre-pandemic the company had about 1500 employees working in four Dayton-area facilities sites which saw a $1 billion total annual investment. About 9000 Ohioans work for the company in total.

Today GE HealthCare completed its spinoff from parent company GE and began trading separately on the Nasdaq Stock Market (ticker: GEHC). The company a leading manufacturer of advanced medical devices pharmaceutical diagnostics and other solutions critical to the future of medicine has an urgent mission to create a world where healthcare has no limits. To achieve it the company needs the freedom to invest and innovate and that said GE HealthCare President and CEO Peter Arduini is best accomplished by going it alone.

The separation completes a process that began in late 2021 and will eventually see the 130-year-old GE formed by Thomas Edison and Elihu Thomson in 1892 split into three separate companies focused on precision healthcare the future of flight and the energy transition.

“Today is an incredibly exciting day for GE HealthCare as we become an independent company and start a new chapter as a standalone global leader in precision care” said Arduini. “We are on the verge of true industry transformation as digital innovation reshapes how providers and patients experience our products and services with an increased need for more precise connected and compassionate care.”

The spinoff of GE HealthCare comes at a time of urgent change in the healthcare industry which is seeing rapid shifts in how care is consumed and delivered. Patients and providers are generating staggering amounts of data. The 4 million scanners and other medical devices that GE HealthCare has installed globally are one major source. But much of that data is not being utilized Arduini told investors at a company event in December. The future of medicine and the opportunity for GE HealthCare lies in connecting patient data throughout a provider’s digital ecosystem so that doctors can access it how and when they want and tailor diagnoses and treatments to the individual — what’s known as precision care.

“By harnessing data and leveraging artificial intelligence we can help our customers deliver precision care — an approach to healthcare that puts the patient at the center of their treatment” Arduini said during the presentation last month.

To get there though GE HealthCare needed to part ways with its parent of more than a century. To be sure GE has been the leading innovator in medical technology going back to Thomson’s invention of the X-ray machine based on tinkering with Edison’s lightbulb. In the years since GE has led the way in ultrasound and MRI scanning and built a digital services business around its evolving Edison platform which allows healthcare systems to link their devices and data and even use apps developed by third parties. And along with those innovations has come growth: Today GE HealthCare has 51000 employees spread across 160 countries with a focus on AI-enabled medical imaging and software that securely analyzes patient data to help clinicians speed up and improve care as well as contrast agents that help doctors peer inside the human body.

However to seize the opportunity that precision care represents GE HealthCare needed to be free to decide when for example to purchase a technology that complements its products and when to invest in its own research.

One recent example that highlights the kind of thinking the standalone company hopes to embody going forward is the acquisition last year of a company developing hypersensitive X-ray detectors using “Deep Silicon” which may be able to substantially boost the details that CT machines can see inside the human body. By combining the new technology with GE HealthCare’s CT business doctors may be able to inspect tumors and lesions in a way they haven’t before.

As more of the world gains access to the latest technology and demands the highest level of care GE HealthCare thinks its addressable market will expand from $84 billion to $102 billion by 2025. But that growth comes in the face of stubborn barriers to accessing medicine and troubling trends that suggest many healthcare workers are burned out by the COVID-19 pandemic and by the growing toll from a combination of tedious administrative tasks and trouble accessing patient data when and how they need it.

Yihao Zhang who leads GE HealthCare in China notes that China has more than 900000 hospitals in the primary care market but fewer than a fifth are equipped with a CT scanner and only a quarter have a mammography machine.

“There is a significant resource imbalance” says Zhang noting that training on how to use diagnostic equipment also lags. “I think our purpose really fits into this.”

Spinning off a company as large as GE HealthCare takes some work. GE Chairman and CEO and GE Aerospace CEO H. Lawrence Culp Jr. along with Arduini and the company’s senior leaders had a laundry list of goals ahead of the launch including recruiting a diverse and accomplished board of directors. The new company also had to choose a name logo and color and decide how to describe the company’s mission things that matter greatly when your product is helping a soon-to-be mom and her care team assess the health of a fetus or helping to diagnose a potential cancer. “Compassion Purple” is a fitting choice for the new company which is using this moment to more closely align to their work supporting patients and providers.

Above all Arduini said the new company’s identity reflects both its heritage as a part of GE that brought the world lifesaving inventions and as a technology company that makes its living through compassion. There are 9000 field service engineers at GE HealthCare who visit hospitals clinics and doctors’ offices to keep millions of devices running around the clock and 5000 software engineers building applications to make the delivery of care ever more seamless.

“GE HealthCare is dedicated to our purpose of creating a world where healthcare has no limits” said Arduini “and we look forward to delivering for providers patients and shareholders in the years ahead.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlcG9ydHMvZ2UtY29tcGxldGVzLXRoZS1zZXBhcmF0aW9uLW9mLWdlLWhlYWx0aGNhcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GE completes the separation of GE HealthCare | GE News,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ge.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/reports/ge-completes-the-separation-of-ge-healthcare (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2744E20>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlcG9ydHMvZ2UtY29tcGxldGVzLXRoZS1zZXBhcmF0aW9uLW9mLWdlLWhlYWx0aGNhcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1kZGlvbmxpbmUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3RoZS1zcGluLWlzLWNvbXBsZXRlLWdlLWhlYWx0aGNhcmUtaXMtYS1zdGFuZGFsb25lLWNvbXBhbnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Spin Is Complete! GE Healthcare Is a Standalone Company,"It’s finally complete. GE Healthcare is now a standalone company. The firm is now trading on Nasdaq after spinning off from General Electric its parent company.

The company is now trading on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol “GEHC.”

GE Healthcare’s spin-off is part of a plan to break GE into three separate companies. GE will combine its renewable energy power and digital businesses into a separate company in a second spin-off slated for 2024. The remaining GE business will focus on aviation.

GE Healthcare is being led by Peter Arduini. He stepped down from his role as CEO at Integra LifeSciences to assume the position of president and CEO at GE Healthcare.

“We are on the verge of true industry transformation as digital innovation reshapes the experience of patients and providers with an increased need for more precise connected and efficient care Arduini said in a release. “GE HealthCare colleagues worldwide are united in our purpose to create a world where healthcare has no limits and we look forward to delivering for providers patients and shareholders in the years ahead.”

GE HealthCare has some impressive stats at launch. The company has a presence in more than 160 countries and about 51000 employees worldwide serving more than one billion patients a year. GE Healthcare generates about $18 billion in revenue with an installed base including more than 4 million pieces of equipment across its four business segments – Imaging Ultrasound Patient Care Solutions and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics.

The company said it expects its addressable markets will expand from $84 billion in 2021 to $102 billion by 2025. That expansion provides significant opportunities for growth and execution of the Company’s precision care strategy to safely and securely integrate patient data from imaging lab pathology genomics and other sources.

Talks of GE Healthcare spinning off began nearly five years ago. The rationale behind the spin-off plans in 2018 was to allow GE to focus more on its industrial offerings. However those plans were scrapped in early 2019 when GE sold its pharmaceutical unit to Danaher for $21 billion.

The Spin is In

In early 2021 on an episode of the Let’s Talk Medtech podcast EY’s John Babitt said that the spin was in referring to the growing number of spinoffs in the medical device industry.

Outside of GE one of the biggest spinouts announced in 2021 was Johnson & Johnson. The New Brunswick NJ-based company announced it was splitting its consumer products business from its medical device and pharmaceutical businesses.

Other notable spinoffs include Zimmer Biomet’s ZimVie; 3M and its healthcare unit and Becton Dickinson’s Embecta which won Reader’s Choice for Company of the Year.

Most recently Medtronic announced plans to spin off its patient monitoring and respiratory interventions businesses into a new company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9nZS1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1iZWdpbnMtdHJhZGluZy1hcy1zcGluLW9mZi1oZXJhbGRzLXNoaWZ0LXRvLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1zdHJlYW1saW5pbmctMTk0NTI1MTY4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GE HealthCare begins trading as spin-off heralds shift to corporate streamlining,"A longstanding medical tech maker is now set to make its own moves.

GE HealthCare made its market debut on Wednesday under the ticker symbol GEHC finalizing a spin-off from General Electric (GE) which is shifting its focus exclusively to aviation.

“It’s enabled us to kind of simplify how we run the company” Peter Arduini CEO and president of GE HealthCare said in an interview with Yahoo Finance (video above). “And ultimately it’s about capital allocation over the long run.”

GE HealthCare stock rose more than 5% in the afternoon session to trade around $59 per share.

Industrial conglomerates spin off businesses

GE HealthCare is just the latest company to spin off in hopes of capitalizing on a growing market in the medical technology arena.

In September Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) announced it would cleave consumer products like Band-Aid and Tylenol into a separate company called Kenvue. Even companies already laser-focused on the medical tech industry have not been immune: In October Medtronic (MDT) announced it would spin off its patient monitoring and respiratory interventions businesses.

And if 2021 was defined by the record number of IPOs seen in a calendar year 2022 was defined by the divestments announced by industry titans.

Cereal maker Kellogg (K) announced it would split into three companies covering snack foods cereal and plant-based alternatives. Meanwhile freight expert XPO Logistics (XPO) completed a spin-out of its brokerage called RXO after shedding its contract logistics arm GXO in 2021.

For investors a more focused and independent company by reducing the need to consider wholly different industries when assessing a company’s potential.

GE HealthCare brings in roughly $18 billion in annual revenue and the company is valued at around $26 billion. In an indication of GE HealthCare’s post-spin-off size the company immediately replaced commercial real estate company Vornado in the S&P 500 index.

Arduini said the company intends to invest in research and development particularly around how to use medical data to uncover possible treatments and medical insights for health care providers dealing with patients.

“We generate a big portion of the data” Arduini said. “It’s much more than just making the best next device...I would argue if you take a look at the class of med tech companies out there we’re one of the folks that has the ability to take health care to the next level with turning data into insights and that’s what we intend to do.”

General Electric will continue to own around 19.9% of GE HealthCare the company said in a statement. As part of its streamlining plans the legacy GE company will eventually separate its renewable energy power and digital businesses into another spin-off called GE Vernova while the company's remaining assets will include GE’s flagship aircraft engine manufacturing.

The move – planned since late 2021 – leaves GE with two prime divisions: GE Aerospace and energy unit GE Vernova.

GE intends to spin off GE Vernova in early 2024 at which point GE Aerospace would become the storied industrial conglomerate’s last surviving entity.

The 3 January divestiture makes GE HealthCare Technologies a separate public company listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. As part of the deal GE retained ownership of 19.1% of GE HealthCare’s stock.

Lawrence Culp chief executive of GE and of GE Aerospace says GE remains on track to divest GE Vernova – a division consisting of energy power and digital holdings – in “early 2024”.

When that happens the company that is now GE will change its name to GE Aerospace which will be its last remaining division GE has said. GE Aerospace is based in Ohio.

Culp will remain CEO. John Slattery is GE Aerospace chief commercial officer. He had been CEO of the division prior to the planned reorganisation.

GE disclosed the restructuring plan in November 2021 following years of financial trouble. It has said the split will help strengthen each of the surviving three businesses with GE surviving as “an aviation-focused company shaping the future of flight”.

In mid-2022 Culp said GE’s aerospace business will emerge from the process having a “wider strategic aperture” adding that it might “be in some businesses that we are not in today”.

He noted GE Aerospace intends to expand in the aircraft systems industry but did not otherwise elaborate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvZ2VuZXJhbC1lbGVjdHJpYy1hcy13ZS1rbmV3LWl0LWlzLW5vLW1vcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,General Electric As We Knew It Is No More,"Just over 20 years ago there was no company more admired than General Electric a business that dates its origins to Thomas Edison. It was the largest company by market capitalization its executives were routinely recruited to run other companies and its CEO Jack Welch was enjoying a reputation as blunt-speaking business guru.

In the years since GE has been in steady decline at first slowly then irreversibly. The business world’s attention moved from manufacturing to the internet and the empire Welch constructed turned out to be erected on a foundation of sand. Its market cap is now $91 billion down from nearly $600 billion in 2001 and is now ranked just 143rd in the world.

Welch’s GE will effectively end today Jan. 4 when the company spins off GE Healthcare as a separate company. The final blow will come in 2024 when GE Vernova—a collection of its energy businesses— is spun off leaving GE Aerospace as the remaining company.

The breakup of General Electric may have been inevitable. There are few industrial conglomerates remaining in the U.S. as investors tend to prefer their companies confined within one sector where it’s easier to compare them to peers. But it was surely hastened by decades of poor management and short-term decision making starting with Welch’s embrace of GE’s financial arm as a driver of growth. Free of the regulatory requirements that burdened banks GE branched out from lending to the companies that bought its locomotives and power plants into insurance and consumer finance. By 2004 its financial units were generating $83 billion in annual revenue more than its energy healthcare and transportation businesses—combined.

It was a great time to be a GE shareholder until the music stopped which it did in 2008 during the financial crisis. Suddenly the bets on finance made by Welch and his successor Jeff Immelt looked precarious and the company began to take on water . Immelt who unloaded GE’s appliances business and ownership of NBC made matters worse by taking on debt to buy French power company Alstom for $10.6 billion. Few things went right and Immelt was replaced first by John Flannery who lasted less than two years then Larry Culp the architect of the breakup plan.

GE and its successor companies still makes lots of useful things. From jet engines MRI machines to wind turbines it still has useful things to sell. What it can no longer sell however is its image of America’s invincible corporation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9nZS1oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXN0YXJ0LXRyYWRpbmctaW52ZXN0b3JzLTEzMDUwMjkwMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With GE Healthcare About To Start Trading Investors Turn Cautious On Power Business Spin Off,"As General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) enters 2023 it will split off its healthcare unit completing a step in the breakup of the industrial giant.

It will face questions about shedding its power businesses for the rest of the year.

GE Healthcare Technologies Inc will start trading this week leaving the conglomerate with jet engines natural gas-powered turbines and wind turbine units.

The gas and wind turbines will be combined with other GE energy businesses into a new unit GE Vernova that will split off in early 2024.

The once profitable power-generation business produced losses and concerns about its future as the world moves toward greener energy sources.

The onshore wind-turbine business has struggled with cost inflation and supply-chain problems.

Scott Strazik CEO of GE Vernova has already reversed the cash flow of the power business which burned through about $2.7 billion in 2018.

It is now cash-flow positive. He is now restructuring the renewables business which is expected to post a loss of about $2 billion this year.

“Within gas power we’re really on the other side of the journey” Mr. Strazik said in an interview. For wind “I see a similar dynamic with gas where in the first year you ground yourself. In the second year you work towards a material improvement” writes Wall Street Journal.

Based on his forecasts for 2024 earnings the analyst estimates that GE Aerospace could have an enterprise value of $94 billion while GE HealthCare is at around $48 billion with GE Vernova fetching less than $13 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ob21lLzIwMjMwMTAzMDA1ODUyL2VuL0dFLUNvbXBsZXRlcy1TZXBhcmF0aW9uLW9mLUdFLUhlYWx0aENhcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GE Completes Separation of GE HealthCare,"BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GE (NYSE: GE) announced that it has completed the separation of its healthcare business launching GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (“GE HealthCare”) a global leader in Precision Care. Starting today January 4 2023 GE HealthCare will trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “GEHC”.

H. Lawrence Culp Jr. Chairman and CEO GE and CEO GE Aerospace said “ The successful spin-off of GE HealthCare marks a pivotal moment in our transformation into three independent companies focused on critical growing sectors. I am tremendously proud of the GE and GE HealthCare teams for their work to prepare this great business to stand on its own as an industry-leading investment grade company focused on Precision Care.”

Culp continued “ We’re on track and confident in our plans to unleash the potential of GE Aerospace and GE Vernova as separate companies in early 2024. These two global leaders are creating a smarter more efficient future of flight and driving decarbonization to address the energy transition. With lean and innovation at our core we could not be more excited about the future.”

Holders of GE common stock received one share of GE HealthCare common stock for every three shares of GE common stock held. The distribution was part of a tax-free spin-off resulting in tax efficiency for GE shareholders in the United States.

GE is retaining approximately 19.9 percent of the shares of GE HealthCare common stock. Culp will serve as non-executive chairman of GE HealthCare.

Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP acted as legal counsel. Evercore Morgan Stanley and PJT Partners were the lead financial advisors to GE on the transaction. GE also received legal advice from Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP and DLA Piper and financial advice from BofA Securities Citibank and Goldman Sachs.

GEN,Gen Digital,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NnZW5lcmFsYnJpZ2hhbS5vcmcvZW4vYWJvdXQvbmV3c3Jvb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYnJpZGdpbmctdGhlLWRpZ2l0YWwtZGl2aWRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bridging the Digital Divide,"A lot of people take access to technology — like a computer or smartphone — for granted. It’s assumed that people inherently know how to interact with technology interfaces like website logins apps and more. It’s an unfounded assumption however and with many healthcare supports moving to the digital world it’s vital to account for patients who either don’t have access to technology or don’t know how to use it. Technology-based programs supported by Mass General Brigham’s United Against Racism initiative are helping to bridge this digital divide.

The new initiatives aim to better identify disparities close existing gaps and prevent future disparities from taking root.

“We must be diligent about identifying and addressing inequities related to digital access. We’re trying to shape a future where everyone is supported by these advancements in care delivery” says Tom Sequist MD Chief Medical Officer Mass General Brigham.

Reducing health inequities through more robust patient data collection

As healthcare organizations grapple with dismantling health inequities clinicians first need a deep understanding of the outcomes and experiences of their patient populations. Demographic data such as ethnicity age and medical history are crucial in measuring and providing tailored equitable care for all.

Researchers including those from Mass General Brigham have consistently shown that there are clear healthcare disparities for patients based on race ethnicity and whether English is the primary language. But without those data we cannot measure inequities in care and health. Collecting data is critical to designing impactful equitable programs and services for our patients.

“We know that across our country people have unfair differences in health and healthcare based on race ethnicity language sexual orientation gender and ability” says Allison Bryant MD MPH Senior Medical Director for Health Equity at Mass General Brigham. “Making sure everyone gets the same excellent healthcare starts with knowing more about each person. Healthcare needs to be fair and open to all. Equity is our goal.”

Accurate data starts with the patient

To start to combat this problem Mass General Brigham launched the REaL Patient Data program along with the “We Ask Because We Care” campaign to collect more accurate and complete demographic data from its more than one million adult primary care patients. The goal is to ultimately provide fairer access to quality healthcare programs and services.

Before the program was implemented Mass General Brigham’s “REaL” data — patients’ race ethnicity and language — was only entered for about 80% of patients depending on the community surveyed. That meant there was no demographic data for about a fifth of our primary care patient population. The initial goal was to bring that rate down to less than 5% across the primary care population. As of December 2022 Mass General Brigham has surpassed its 5% goal in two of the three demographic areas: race (4%) and language (2%). Ethnicity is currently at 10%.

While collecting the data was a top priority for this project it was even more important to develop methods to obtain accurate data. Often healthcare organizations rely on clinicians to enter patient demographic data into patient charts perceiving that they are relieving that burden from the patient. However clinicians who enter this data can’t determine racial ethnic or gender identify by physical appearance alone. The best method and what the REaL program hopes to accomplish is having patients self-report.

We ask because we care

Since June of 2021 the Mass General Brigham Quality & Patient Experience and United Against Racism teams have conducted broad phased patient outreach campaigns via mailed demographic surveys and digital messages through Patient Gateway our patient portal. These messages encouraged patients to report or re-confirm their demographic information.

Patients were asked to share race ethnicity ethnic background and language (REaL data). They were also asked about sexual orientation gender identity sex assigned at birth and pronouns (called “SOGI” data). Sharing this data was encouraged but not required.

These secure data can only be accessed by patients’ clinicians clinical support staff and quality improvement staff. All information is part of patients’ medical records which is protected by law under HIPAA.

The data collected are essential for making decisions to improve care access including identification of languages and availability of interpreters to help patients; development of new online healthcare tools; and additional assistance for patients to help access food medicine accommodations and other needs.

The next wave of interventions includes staff training scripting for on-going data collection to make social determinants of health resources available online improving resources in expanded languages for non-English speaking patients and creating unique medical interventions — like a food delivery pilot — for more tailored support.

A helping hand to access digital tools

New healthcare technologies such as a portal connecting you through your phone to your entire care team can often sound like ideas pulled from a science fiction film. Accessing and understanding these technologies can be a huge hurdle for patients from marginalized communities. But more often than not all a patient needs is a helping hand to guide them through these new innovations.

To help combat inequities while rolling out new digital tools like our patient portal or telehealth visits Mass General Brigham has launched new initiatives to support patients with limited access to technology and digital care.

The Digital Access Program brings digital resources directly to patients in high-risk communities. The program focuses on a three-tiered approach — providing patients access to physical devices like tablet computers connecting patients with software technologies like web access and digital tools and offering digital literacy training. Mass General Brigham has acquired over 2000 cellular-enabled tablets to start a loaner program for patients in primary care practices.

Additionally Mass General Brigham has embedded Digital Access Coordinators in clinical practices to support digital literacy training for patients on-site. Coordinators help patients sign up for Patient Gateway distribute tablets and train patients to be able to use virtual visit platforms. Many of the digital access coordinators have ties to the communities they serve which offers them insight into the needs of their patients and a deeper connection to the goals of the project.

To date the coordinators have provided outreach to over 16000 patients for Patient Gateway enrollment. Patient Gateway is now available in the top languages most spoken by our patients — English Spanish Portuguese Haitian Creole Russian Traditional Chinese and Arabic. With the help of our Digital Access Coordinator program Patient Gateway is more accessible to our patients than ever before.

“This three-pronged approach is critical. If we were just offering tablets to patients it wouldn’t be enough. If you hand a tablet to a patient and they don’t know how to use it and the programs aren’t in their language that’s not breaking barriers. You have to offer the complete package” says Lee Park MD Chief Patient Experience Officer at Mass General Brigham. “It’s been really meaningful for the teams. Mass General Brigham is really making equity a focus and meeting patients where they are. Our aim is to break down the systemic barriers that some patients face to getting the same care as others.”

This is just a tiny sample of all the incredible work happening across the system to combat digital healthcare inequities. For a deeper dive into this strategy we recommend reading our interview with Dr. Lee Park Chief Patient Experience Officer at Mass General Brigham.

In our next installment we’ll be looking at how we’re working with our communities to mitigate social risk for needs like transportation and access to healthy food.

The Space Force was established in 2019 and throughout its three years of service thus far its leadership has made modernization an integral part of its DNA.

Lisa Costa  the Space Force’s chief technology and innovation officer has long championed digital transformation and innovation efforts within the service. However she says technological capability gaps and outdated systems are hindering the Space Force’s service members or “guardians” from executing their missions.

Lisa Costa is scheduled to deliver a keynote address during GovCon Wire’s virtual 2023 DoD: Digital Modernization Forum on Jan. 12! Register here .

“Guardians today use antiquated tools techniques and technologies that limit the Space Force’s ability to support full-spectrum multidomain operations” the Wash100 Award winner told FedTech in an interview.

The service’s latest digital transformation and innovation initiative SpaceVerse aims to change that narrative.

What is the SpaceVerse?

“SpaceVerse is Space Force’s version of the Metaverse and will leverage technology being developed in the commercial realm to provide Guardians with leap-ahead capability including resilient networks high throughput end devices and infrastructure allowing them to experience their domain through multiple senses” Costa explained.

Space Force guardians have a unique military service experience in that they are physically not in the domain in which they operate. Instead they experience the space domain “via a lot of text on a lot of different screens” said Costa in an interview with C4ISRNET.

What Costa envisions is both a simplification and an enhancement of the user experience. In essence the SpaceVerse will be a digital environment that combines digital tools physical assets and shared platforms to provide guardians with a more immersive collaborative experience.

The SpaceVerse is “meant to provide our Guardians with a digital engineering environment to support immersive training TTP and doctrine development force design operational testing acquisition and operations” Costa wrote in a LinkedIn post.

The Space Force plans to conduct pilot programs of the SpaceVerse in fiscal year 2023 and begin building the digital universe in fiscal year 2024 according to Michael Torres chief of digital infrastructure for the Space Force and SpaceVerse architect.

In 2022 the Space Force tapped Slingshot Aerospace to develop the service’s first digital twin of the space domain for training and wargaming purposes.

Iran’s Gen Z is leading the charge as the loudest voice of the protests not only in the streets but also in the cybersphere[2]. Generation Z (Gen Z) are individuals roughly born between 1997 and 2012 a generation that is considered often as “digital natives” due to the easier accessibility to digital technologies such as phones the internet and social media while growing up. In Iran the significance of Gen Z’s digital footprint as well as their courage on the streets is especially noticeable during the current revolution[3]. It ignited after the killing of Jhina (Mahsa) Amini a young 22-year-old Kurdish woman who died after being subject to violence through Iran’s morality police because she was not wearing her headscarf according to Iran’s strict Islamic Laws[4]. Her death sparked protests and revolts all over the country with mostly young people demanding a revolution and loudly chanting “Woman Life Freedom”. Over the past decade the Iranian Gen Z have deviated from the regime’s official portrayal.[5]

Since over 50% of the population is under the age of 30 and with over 80% of the population having access to the internet Iran isn’t just a young country but a digitally literate one as well[6]. It’s no surprise that its Gen Z are experts on social media platforms like Instagram Twitter and especially TikTok. Contrary to its portrayal by state media and some Western outlets as equally conservative and religious as its political elite Iranian Gen Zs succeeded in becoming a globalized and open-minded generation with great knowledge about the music culture and politics of states worldwide including the US[7]. On TikTok a social media app where one can record short videos many Iranian Gen Z’s upload videos of themselves singing along HipHop songs of famous US-American artists or imitating scenes of US-American sitcoms such as “Friends”. One tragic instance is that of Hadis Najafi a young 23-year-old woman who was shot in the first weeks of the protests. Hadis had a TikTok account where she would frequently upload videos of herself dancing to popular Iranian as well as Western music. Based on her online presence one could have guessed that she was a young student living freely in California or London. In the last video that she posted on TikTok she states while heading to the protest that in 10-20 years when Iran will be free she can say that she participated in the protests that enabled the revolution[8].

These videos that are left as so-called digital footprints within the cyberspace show how brave Iran’s young generation is. While the Iranian security forces use live ammunition imprisonment and torture as ways to intimidate protestors it appears to only encourage young people further to take to the streets[9]. The freedom of speech many Iranian Gen Zs experienced their whole life solely within cyberspace is turning into demands for freedom in real life. An interview with a young Iranian girl from Mashhad reveals that before the revolution many young people dreamed of leaving Iran to be able to have a better future[10]. This isn’t surprising since the unemployment rate amongst young people is at 40%. However the current revolution appears to have changed the mentality of young Iranians. Now many Gen Zs are convinced that the regime will change and that there is no point for leaving the country[11]. For instance a video on TikTok of two young 17-year-old Iranian social media influencers in early November 2022 shows the significance of the current revolution. In the video the two young boys say their goodbyes to their followers stating that they will protest on the streets from now on hoping to still be alive after the revolution and continue making videos. This hope for freedom has gotten stronger and has overcome the fear of the regime.

Indeed after the revolution in 1979 Iran’s first Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini had announced that the next generations born into the Islamic Republic will grow to follow the strict and conservative laws and regulations based in the Shia interpretation of Sharia-Law[12]. The Iranian regime enforced this by creating strict gender divisions starting from primary schools mandatory religion classes as well as the promotion of conservative gender roles[13]. However contrary to the hopes of Iran’s political and religious elite the country’ young generation did not grow up to be conservative followers of the Iranian regime instead creating spaces for themselves where they would meet in mixed-gender events such as underground concerts listening to forbidden Western music and discussing contemporary global issues. Even one of Iran’s clerics stated in a Friday prayer in 2021 that the plan of the Iranian regime to raise a new generation of faithful followers has failed[14].

A major factor for this lucky failure is Gen Z’s access to the internet[15]. Sharing their own voices and listening to others freely within a digital reality impacted young Iranians more than the Iranian regime could have anticipated. One of the current revolution’s youngest victims Sarina Esmailzadeh a young 16-year-old girl who was shot dead in the first month of the uprisings had her own YouTube channel. In one of her videos a few months prior to her death she stated that “All that we want is to be as free like young people in the US and in Europe we want to live in stability and with a prospect for a good future we want to be free”. Sarina’s words summarize the major difference between the revolution in 1979 and the current one. In contrast to the revolution in 1979 the young people on the streets now have pragmatic hopes and dreams for their future. Whereas in 1979 the revolution was carried by Communist Marxist Student and Islamist groups all having their own ideology Iran’s Gen Z appeases any type of ideology. Their hopes and demands for Iran’s future are simple: financial and economic stability gender equality freedom for all ethnic minorities and social welfare. During several occasions young Iranians have stated that they do not want to follow any ideology anymore since it has caused much division inside the country. All they demand is a freedom and just state for everyone[16].

As the revolution carries on the international community should first and foremost listen to the demands of Iran’s Gen Z since their role within the revolution cannot be overlooked anymore. The Gen Z might be able to realize their digital freedoms in real life. At this stage it is evident that Iran’s political and religious elite is not willing to listen to its young people demands therefore the burden is on the international community to show solidarity with the young and brave people of Iran who will continue chanting “Woman Life Freedom”.

The company announced its 13th-gen Raptor Lake mobile processors at CES 2023 including the flagship Core i9-13980HX which includes a massive 24 cores that could top the list of the best Intel processors.

That sounds insane considering even AMD’s desktop Ryzen 9 7950X only comes with 16 cores. But Intel’s cores aren’t all built equally. Like the previous generation 13th-gen mobile Raptor Lake processors include a combination of performance (P) cores and efficient (E) cores. The most powerful chips in the range come with 24 cores but they’re split across eight P-cores and 16 E-cores.

Although we don’t have the chips to test yet Intel is making big performance claims. Leaked benchmarks leading up to the launch showed the Core i9-13900HX beating out the Core i9-12900KS. And that’s a high-end desktop processor.

Intel is sticking with its H P and U-series branding for its processors noting 45-watt 28W and 15W processors respectively. The company is also sticking with the 55W HX-series range it introduced last year in laptops like the MSI GT77 Titan and Intel says to expect a lot more HX-equipped laptops this year.

Intel says we’ll see more than 60 HX designs throughout 2023 including laptops from HP Dell Razer Asus MSI Lenovo and Acer. There were about 10 HX designs in the previous generation. Along with the boosted number of machines comes a boosted number of processors with Intel introducing nine HX chips this year.

The performance improvements compared to the previous generation largely depend on what you’re doing. In some tasks like Unreal Engine and its MetaHuman feature Intel shows the Core i9-13950HX outperforming last-gen’s Core i9-12900HX by about 10%. But in Autodesk Inventor and ReCap that same chip shows a 29% improvement.

You’ll see the largest performance gains in apps that can scale with high thread counts which Intel showcased with Blender. This rendering application can take advantage of the extra cores in Intel’s Core i9-13950HX leading to upwards of a 79% improvement over the previous generation. And compared to Apple’s M1 Max in the MacBook Pro Intel says the Core i9-13950HX is twice as fast or more in many applications.

Gaming doesn’t see as large of a jump. Intel says its HX processors are up to 12% faster than the previous generation particularly in games like Horizon Zero Dawn and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy that can leverage higher core counts. Some titles like F1 22 and Forza Horizon 5 don’t see much of a boost at all.

If you’re not running intense CAD applications developing games or doing intensive work on your laptop you can get away with a lower-powered CPU. Intel is introducing 23 designs in its H- P- and U-series laptops for thinner and lighter notebooks.

These processors top out at six P-cores and eight E-cores and they’re mostly a refresh of the previous generation. Overall Intel says you can expect around a 10% improvement over the previous generation. However Intel says many designs that previously used P-series are moving to H-series which means some machines could see a larger jump in performance.

The bigger improvements come in connectivity. Intel’s 13th-gen processors support up to four Thunderbolt 4 connections including DisplayPort 2.1 as well as DDR5-5200 Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth LT audio. Intel is also focused on its “enhanced” Thread Director. Intel’s Dan Rogers tells us this upgraded version provides visibility into the type of task for the processor which helps allocate resources more efficiently.

Intel is bringing several other features to its 13th-gen Raptor Lake mobile range including XeSS supersampling and Arc Control software for controlling the integrated graphics. Some designs will come with Intel’s Movidius VPU as well. This is a dedicated AI accelerator but Intel says it will only be available in select designs for AI developers.

Generac SnapRS class action lawsuit overview:

Who: Dustin Moon filed a class action lawsuit against Generac Power Systems Inc.

Dustin Moon filed a class action lawsuit against Generac Power Systems Inc. Why: Moon claims Generac sells dangerous and defective solar panel PWRcell Systems containing faulty SnapRS (rapid shutdown) unit components.

Moon claims Generac sells dangerous and defective solar panel PWRcell Systems containing faulty SnapRS (rapid shutdown) unit components. Where: The class action lawsuit was filed in California federal court.

Generac Power Systems sells defective and dangerous solar panel PWRcell Systems containing faulty SnapRS (rapid shutdown) unit components that fail in their job to rapidly shut down power to individual solar panels a new class action lawsuit alleges.

Plaintiff Dustin Moore claims the SnapRS units in Generac’s PWRcell Systems are meant to protect against electric surges but instead are prone to malfunctioning by becoming overactive.

Moore argues the Generac SnapRS units after becoming overactive can begin to “overheat bubble burn and explode resulting in charring and home fires.”

“Generac’s SnapRS units are defective and dangerous to consumers and their homes” the Generac class action argues.

Moon wants to represent a nationwide class and California subclass of consumers who have purchased leased or otherwise acquired a Generac PWRcell System containing an allegedly defective SnapRS unit.

Generac has failed to disclose alleged defect to consumers says class action

In addition to allegedly failing to rapidly shut down power Moore claims the alleged defect leads to a “loss of energy production” by ultimately “shutting down entire panels for prolonged periods of time or complete shutdowns of their entire energy system.”

Moore also argues Generac failed to disclose to consumers that its SnapRS units are allegedly defective while neglecting to recall them provide refunds or offer consumers “adequate replacement components.”

“Despite that it knew or should have known of this Defect Generac failed to disclose this Defect to Plaintiff and other consumers” the Generac class action states.

Moore claims Generac is guilty of breach of express warranty and breach of implied warranty and is in violation of California’s Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act Unfair Competition Law and Consumer Legal Remedies Act.

The plaintiff is demanding a jury trial and requesting declaratory and injunctive relief along with an award of compensatory and punitive damages for himself and all class members.

In November Generac reannounced it was recalling more than 325000 of its portable generators after it said it received additional reports of finger injuries — including amputations — caused by an unlocked handle on the generator.

That took General Mills by surprise.

Pet food sales for the Golden Valley-based company stopped growing this fall as the inventory reduction added to the dog-pile of supply chain issues and manufacturing constraints Blue Buffalo was already experiencing.

The company even had to pull advertising and in-store promotional support for Blue Buffalo to avoid drawing attention to empty shelves.

Though General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening assured investors the segment would quickly rebound the disruption was hard to ignore — operating profits for pet food sank 34% compared to the year before.

""We don't think that this is a long-term trend"" Harmening explained to analysts on a conference call last month. ""Even though our second quarter was not what we wanted and not what you all expected the brand remains really good.""

The $2 billion business has been a steady source of growth and reliable profit generator for General Mills since Blue Buffalo was acquired in 2018 and Tyson's pet treats were added last year. And it was expected to continue growing on the back of increasing pet ownership and ""humanization"" trends in pet food.

But General Mills hadn't been able to produce enough pet food to fully meet that demand — and when it had supply chain issues meant it didn't always get on shelves.

Harmening said the ""retailer inventory reduction and the worst of our capacity and service challenges"" have passed.

General Mills is now working with third-party manufacturers to produce dry dog food and treats he said.

""To further improve service we recently added a new distribution center and expanded capacity at our existing warehouses"" Harmening said. ""With better on-shelf availability we'll be able to turn on national media support and in-store merchandising.""

As a result the company says pet food sales will be back to double-digit growth during the current fiscal quarter that ends in February. That would put quarterly sales for the segment over $600 million for just the second time.

""Consumer demand for pet food remains strong and we expect a rebound in sales next quarter"" Edward Jones analyst Brittany Quatrochi wrote in a research note last month.

Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard noted that ""questions persist around the pet food business"" but the new capacity is promising.

The caveat is that using third-party manufacturing tends to be less profitable so margins won't recover as quickly as sales especially with the continued cost inflation General Mills and other companies are experiencing.

""But the benefit is that we're getting back [on the shelf] and we're satisfying pet parents sooner"" Harmening said.

The CEO told the Star Tribune in December that ""we've already started to see the benefits of that capacity.""

""Our volumes have been increasing and dollar sales along with that"" he said. ""We've seen that improvement even without new product innovation and advertising support.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybXkubWlsL2FydGljbGUvMjYzMDc2L2hhd2FpaV9jb21taXNzYXJpZXNfYW5ub3VuY2Vfc2FsZXNfZmx5ZXJfcHJvbW90aW9uc19mb3JfamFuXzJfMTXSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcm15Lm1pbC9hcnRpY2xlLWFtcC8yNjMwNzYvaGF3YWlpX2NvbW1pc3Nhcmllc19hbm5vdW5jZV9zYWxlc19mbHllcl9wcm9tb3Rpb25zX2Zvcl9qYW5fMl8xNQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hawaii Commissaries announce sales flyer promotions for Jan. 2-15,"(Photo Credit: Rush Stephanie A Ms. CIV USA) VIEW ORIGINAL

‘General Hospital’ spoilers reveal that Heather Webber is the hook killer

Since Ava Jerome’s (Maura West) attack at the Quartermaine picnic the infamous hook killer has terrorized Port Charles. The murderer has added Brando Corbin (Johnny Wactor) Diane Miller (Carolyn Hennesy) and Rory Cabrera (Michael Blake Kruse) to their list of victims. The killer showed no signs of slowing down in the New Year.

Josslyn is in the fight for her life. Can she escape the Hook before they claim their next victim?

An intense new #GH starts RIGHT NOW on ABC! @RealEdenMccoy pic.twitter.com/nDwrXcYdiR — General Hospital (@GeneralHospital) January 3 2023

In the Jan. 3 2023 episode Joss Jacks (Eden McCoy) become the hook killer’s next target. However Britt Westbourne (Kelly Thiebaud) came to her rescue. As the killer and Britt tangled Dex Heller (Evan Hofer) fired a gun scaring off the perpetrator.

Later the hook killer was alone on the pier and took off their mask to reveal she was Heather Webber (Alley Mills).

Fans react to the hook killer revelation

The hook killer’s identity was one of the biggest mysteries from the soap opera. Fan theories began to form on who could be the killer. Everyone from Esme Prince (Avery Kristen Pohl) to A.D.A. Jennifer Arden (Jennifer Field) was a suspect. But it was Heather all along.

Although Heather is locked up at D’Archam suspicions arise after she contracts an illness she didn’t get from the asylum. Heather is sneaky so her leaving the hospital and returning wouldn’t be out of the question. While Heather as the hook killer was supposed to be a big reveal not everyone was happy about it.

On a Reddit thread General Hospital fans voiced their opinion on the hook killer revelation. “I knew it was Heather as soon as she reappeared!” wrote one viewer.

“Heather????? Lazy. Just lazy” declared one user.

“Okay guys now I’m convinced it’s not just Heather. These writers are incompetent but they can’t be this useless” another commenter replied.

“I think heather is just a copycat and the real Hook has yet to be shown at least I hope lol” wrote another fan.

The storyline is far from over

Heather came close to being busted thanks to Dex. Although she escaped Heather has a cut on her wrist which will raise suspicions. With Britt’s report and the hook the police will have enough evidence to arrest Heather. However their case is far from closed.

WATCH: Heather plays a game of cat and mouse with the brothers Scorpio. ? #GH pic.twitter.com/1BRLS61UlU — General Hospital (@GeneralHospital) December 27 2022

Speculation is that Heather may not be the hook killer. She could be covering for her daughter Esme who is the real killer. Most victims were connected to Esme’s rival Trina Robinson (Tabyana Ali). So it’s understandable how Esme could be suspected of being the killer.

Heather wants to protect her daughter and may have attacked the victims to throw the investigation off Esme. Or the evil mother and daughter duo could secretly have teamed up to terrorize Port Charles. Whether Heather Esme or both of them are the killer remains to be seen. But this storyline is far from over and there will be more twists."

One year after losing the title it held for nearly a century as the top car seller in America General Motors is back on top.

GM (GM) reported Wednesday US sales of 2.3 million vehicles. Strong fourth quarter sales up 41% from a year ago allowed it to end the year with sales up nearly 3% from the 2.2 million US vehicles it sold in 2021 when it suffered a 13% decline.

Meanwhile Toyota (TM) which had captured the top sales spot in 2021 had its full-year sales fall nearly 10% to 2.1 million despite posting a 13% increase in fourth quarter sales.

In each of the last two years industry-wide auto sales were limited by a shortage of parts primarily computer chips needed to build the cars and trucks consumers wanted. Total US new vehicle sales are expected to be down to just less than 14 million vehicles when the final sales results are reported across the industry later this week.

That would be the lowest sales total since the country was just climbing out of the Great Recession more than a decade go. Sales bottomed out at 10.5 million in 2009 the year GM and Chrysler declared bankruptcy and received federal bailouts and had only climbed back to 12.7 million by 2011 the last year the industry sales fell below 14 million.

Sales had been 17 million in 2019 the year before the pandemic upended both the economy and supply chains.

Most forecasts say the supply chain problems are getting better and that should allow automakers to increase production in 2023. They point to the better sales that took place in the fourth quarter than earlier in the year as a proof of that even with higher car prices and rising interest rates making it more expensive for buyers than in the past.

That in turn has led them to forecast a modest increase in sales this year to just north of 14 million vehicles once again.

But many experts caution that their forecast of increased sales depend on the US economy not falling into recession and instead simply experiencing slower growth. And uncertainty about what will happen to the economy is making the outlook for car sales far more uncertain than in years previous they say.

“I’ve been forecasting the car market for decades now. This next year is the most challenging” said Charlie Chesbrough chief economist for Cox Automotive. “Normally we an idea which way it is headed. But this year it could be up or down.”

There are a number of factors supporting new car sales in the coming year even if the economy stumbles. One is the fact that car rental companies have not be able to buy the supply of new cars they need in the last two years as automakers limited the supply of cars available for lower priced fleet sales selling all or virtually all the cars they had to consumers instead.

“Rental companies have been running at half of the purchases that they’re accustomed to” said Ivan Drury director of insights at Edmunds.

And Drury said if automakers start to see weakness in consumer demand they can bring back incentives including lower rate financing that they haven’t had to offer in recent years when there was more demand than supply.

“The incentives recently have been virtually nothing” he said.

So far demand is still strong as there is pent-up demand from potential buyers who have delayed purchases because they couldn’t find the vehicle they wanted. But both Drury and Chesbrough say the higher average prices and higher interest rates are already driving buyers out of the market.

A turn in the economy especially if historically low unemployment rates start to rise could quickly result in lower new car sales.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvMDQvZ2VuZXJhbC1tb3RvcnMtZ20tc2FsZXMtcTQtMjAyMi5odG1s0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjMvMDEvMDQvZ2VuZXJhbC1tb3RvcnMtZ20tc2FsZXMtcTQtMjAyMi5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM reclaims title as America's top automaker after a 2.5% jump in sales last year,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvMDQvZ2VuZXJhbC1tb3RvcnMtZ20tc2FsZXMtcTQtMjAyMi5odG1s0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjMvMDEvMDQvZ2VuZXJhbC1tb3RvcnMtZ20tc2FsZXMtcTQtMjAyMi5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E4CA82B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

GM said today (Jan. 4) it sold about 2.27 million vehicles last year up 2.5 percent from the previous year. Toyota which also reported delivery numbers today sold just over 2.1 million vehicles in 2022 representing a 9.6 percent decline from 2021.

GM shares ticked up 2.5 percent today while Toyota shares fell 1 percent.

GM was the top-selling automaker annually in the U.S. from 1931 until Toyota claimed the spot in 2021 according to data compiled by Cox Automotive a consulting firm. But the Japanese auto giant was badly impacted by a persistent chip shortage and surging material costs which forced it to cut last year’s production target as late as November.

Similar factors affected other major automakers especially in the first half of 2022 keeping cars and trucks short in supply and prices elevated. Korea’s Hyundai Motor saw its U.S. sales volume drop 2 percent to about 724000 in 2022 today’s data show.

Overall automobile sales in the U.S. last year are expected have fallen 8 percent from 2021 and 20 percent from the peak in 2016 to about 13.9 million units according to Cox Automotive. The exact figure will be known when more carmakers release 2022 delivery numbers.

Globally Toyota is still the largest carmaker by sales volume followed by Volkswagen Group and Hyundai. GM ranks fourth. By market cap though none of them compares to Tesla which is worth $350 billion even after a 70 percent drop in stock price last year. Toyota is currently valued at $220 billion and GM at about $50 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZWRnYXJzdGVuLzIwMjMvMDEvMDQvZ2VuZXJhbC1tb3RvcnMtcmVjbGFpbXMtdXMtc2FsZXMtdGl0bGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM Sold The Most Vehicles In The U.S. Last Year Edging Toyota,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2023/01/04/general-motors-reclaims-us-sales-title/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZWRnYXJzdGVuLzIwMjMvMDEvMDQvZ2VuZXJhbC1tb3RvcnMtcmVjbGFpbXMtdXMtc2FsZXMtdGl0bGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

In a new 60-second commercial launched just before Christmas and sponsored by HIV and AIDS drug maker Gilead we see American actor Tony Award winner and HIV patient André De Shields sitting directly in front of the camera saying simply: “HIV is not crime.”

But the ad highlights that in fact in many U.S. states the disease is still being criminalized. “In 30 states people are being imprisoned due to their HIV status” De Shields says. This includes outdated laws mainly enacted in the 1980s when HIV first took hold that determine certain acts people with HIV make illegal.

Advocacy group the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation (ETAF) which ran the ad with sponsorship from Gilead has long demanded these laws be removed.

ETAF says a man living with HIV could if found guilty and given a maximum sentence serve 35 years for spitting at a police officer in Texas or a woman in Georgia could again serve a maximum eight years if her partner says she never disclosed her HIV status even without evidence of transmission.

On its website which is linked at the end of the ad ETAF says “these aren’t hypothetical stories—they’re real cases and they represent thousands of unjust prison sentences across the country.”

As a second narrator explains in the ad: “These laws don’t keep us safe … instead they create an environment of fear blame and stigmatization.”

Outside of the issue of injustice there is another central issue for Gilead namely that this stigma is stopping HIV-positive patients from seeking out testing and treatment something that hits Gilead’s sales growth potential.

“Encouraging those unaware of their [HIV] status to avoid testing is robbing people with HIV of their dignity and for people to access treatment” the second narrator adds.

The ad also focuses in on medication making HIV “no longer a death sentence” a quiet but unbranded nod to Gilead’s own arsenal of drugs against the disease.

The commercial also talks about the fact that HIV patients “can thrive without the risk of passing it [HIV] onto others” again a nod to new preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs several of which Gilead markets.

Gilead markets 12 drugs for HIV/AIDS including treatment Biktarvy and PrEP drugs Descovy and Truvada with its HIV franchise as a whole making $4.53 billion in 2021 up 7% year over year.

The California pharma has a long history in advocating for patients with the disease and has run many campaigns for the HIV and AIDS communities over the years.

Last April it launched its latest program ""Zeroing In: Ending the HIV Epidemic"" which saw Gilead gift $24 million in grants to 116 organizations in 41 countries to tackle the epidemic on the ground.

But it’s also been under attack for what some groups have seen as price gouging on medicines that patients need to stay alive and healthy. Last October the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) a longtime critic of the company and a nonprofit organization providing meds and care to HIV/AIDS patients accused Gilead “of refusing to offer the 340B discount price for HIV drugs to providers who use contract pharmacies.”

Gilead denied the accusation but the AHF ran a “Greediad” campaign against the pharma hosting in late October last year a weeklong twice-daily series of protests targeting Gilead's drug pricing and policies. The protesters repurposed Gilead’s logo as “Greediad” and ran a series of Gilead/Greediad ads in several Bay Area print and online publications.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbWVkY2l0eW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvZ2lsZWFkLXNjaWVuY2VzLWtpY2tzLW9mZi0yMDIzLXdpdGgtbmV3LWF1dG9pbW11bmUtZGlzZWFzZS1hbGxpYW5jZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gilead Sciences Kicks Off 2023 With New Autoimmune Disease Alliance,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='medcitynews.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2023/01/gilead-sciences-kicks-off-2023-with-new-autoimmune-disease-alliance/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3627F10>, 'Connection to medcitynews.com timed out.

Gilead will develop immunotherapy products through a $658.5m agreement with EVOQ Therapeutics using EVOQ’s NanoDisc technology.

EVOQ Therapeutics Inc has agreed to license its NanoDisc technology for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and lupus to Gilead Sciences Inc enabling EVOQ to potentially receive up $658.5 million. The companies will collaborate to advance preclinical development and Gilead will be responsible for clinical development and commercialisation.

“Despite key advances over the past two decades there remains significant unmet need for people living with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases” stated Dr Flavius Martin Executive Vice President Research at Gilead. “We are excited to collaborate with EVOQ [in our aim to address] the needs of people living with these conditions.”

EVOQ’s NanoDisc technology for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus

EVOQ’s technology is designed to enable lymph-targeted delivery of disease-specific antigens that have been optimised to deliver antigens to restore immune tolerance. The technology has the potential to change the paradigm for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

According to EVOQ it works mainly by activating dendritic cells found in large quantities in the human lymphatic system. Dendritic cells prime different types of effector T cells to coordinate an immune response either towards immune tolerance or towards immune activation.

Under the terms of the agreement the sum EVOQ could potentially gain will come from upfront option exercise and milestone payments across all programmes as well as tiered royalties on product sales.

Gilead will have the option to exclusively license rights to EVOQ’s NanoDisc technology to pursue product candidates for RA and lupus indications."

Their growth comes at the expense of credit cards and other traditional payments according to a study by Accenture.

The consulting firm estimates that such changes in consumer payments preferences will put up to $31.4 billion of revenue at risk for U.S. banks in coming years (2023 through 2026). To avoid these snowballing revenue losses banks must begin to explore newer payment channels in earnest or come up with competitive moves to counter the growing consumer trend.

The Accenture report titled “Payments Get Personal” warns card-issuing banks against timidity as that will mean surrendering more volume to fintechs and big tech.

“Banks that rethink their strategies and capitalize on consumers’ trust in their stability and security could expand revenues and market share” the report states.

One major insight from the research is that both the payments business and consumer behavior are moving beyond the much-dissected effects of the pandemic. Key drivers of the changes include people’s desire to pay lower interest enjoy greater convenience and control and satisfy simple curiosity about new ways of paying for things.

Among U.S. credit card users about 22% are thinking about paying for their in-person shopping in other ways based on the Accenture survey. They favor switching to payment forms that don’t run up interest including debit cards buy now pay later financing and even cash the survey found.

New Payment Methods Growing Fast:

20% of global consumers use at least one next-generation payment method for ecommerce and 9% do so for in-person transactions. Accenture expects the latter to double by 2025.

“For banks credit cards are clearly a high-value proposition and most organizations make a significant amount of money through their cards” says Sulabh Agarwal global payments lead at Accenture in an interview with The Financial Brand. “When card volumes go away into other payment types that’s when that value starts to get challenged.”

The interview with Agarwal explored the implications of increasing use of digital wallets in the U.S. and the potentially mitigating role partnerships could play in U.S. financial institutions’ response to nonbank payments competition.

Use of Digital Wallets Growing in U.S.

Credit and debit cards still dominate in payments but next-generation methods are making meaningful progress.

Accenture asked survey participants which payment methods they used at least five times monthly. Debit cards were cited by 63% of Americans followed by credit cards at 53%.

Nearly half (46%) of U.S. consumers use at least one digital wallet such as Apple Pay Google Pay and PayPal. Digital wallets may include both bank and nonbank payment streams.

Accenture’s research is based on a survey of more than 16000 consumers in 13 countries so the U.S. segment is just a subset.

In a telling statistic the study found that globally about a third of credit card users are considering shifting some in-person spending to alternatives: 21% cited debit cards 12% buy now pay later and 4% prepaid cards. The dominant reason is avoidance of interest charges cited by 54% of participants.

In addition 17% said they rely on cash purchases for that same reason: to avoid interest.

Accenture sees buy now pay later as a strong opportunity for banks to expand their product set and to bring stability to a type of financing that has chiefly been unregulated in the U.S. Some banks have ventured into BNPL among them Citizens Bank with its Citizens Pay product line that is tailored to individual retailers. (BNPL being substantially unregulated is going to change as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau continues to work towards oversight of BNPL firms.)

Digital Wallet Growth Largely Bypassing Banks

Digital wallets enable consumers to make payments without carrying cash or cards. The wallets are accessed via an app on the consumer’s phone or other mobile device.

The underlying payment method is often though not always a card. So operationally they have one foot in the world of traditional payments and one in the world of mobile payments.

Because of this some bankers have not viewed digital wallets as worrisome.

In fact during JPMorgan Chase‘s 2022 investor day Marianne Lake its co-CEO of consumer and community banking shrugged off the notion of competition from digital wallets and buy now pay later being a threat. The reason: The new channels rely on the existing card system so card issuers still book the volume. “As they grow we grow” said Lake.

But Accenture’s Agarwal contends that the gradual erosion of banks’ payments dominance will become increasingly costly. He advises banks to act quickly to protect their competitive advantage before it’s too late as cards appear to be losing favor with many consumers as the main payment method within their digital wallets.

Digital wallets can be of the general use type such as PayPal Apple Pay and Google Pay and those can be used at many places. Alternatively there are digital wallets created for use at a particular major retailer or hospitality brand. (One example is the Starbucks app which allows payments through the user’s method of choice whether that is stored cash value a credit card that’s been entered into the app or the user’s Starbucks Card. The app also tracks rewards.)

Beyond payments general purpose digital wallets can also hold travel and admission tickets boarding passes and other secure documents. In this category of digital wallets PayPal is the most popular by far.

Accenture’s report notes that PayPal ranks as the top digital wallet in nine of the 13 countries studied. The leading markets are Germany where a whopping 60% of consumers use PayPal at least five times a month followed by 51% in Mexico 50% in Italy and 46% in the U.K.

PayPal’s digital wallet also leads in the U.S. but has far less penetration. Only 35% of U.S. consumers use it. Apple Pay is next at 12% and Venmo at 11%.

Can Banks Gain Ground on Fintechs and Big Tech in Digital Wallet Race?

U.S. banks have worked with retailers to launch digital wallets and payment apps but big tech dominates the digital wallet field. Can that change or have U.S. banks already lost the digital wallet race?

Agarwal argues that banks still have an opportunity to be competitive in this space. He points out that digital wallets have evolved differently in various parts of the world. In some ways their rise often has been intertwined with the development of super apps.

Take China where WeChat Pay is used by 82% of consumers and Alipay by 79%. There PayPal is used by only 6% of consumers according to Accenture’s study. Both WeChat Pay and Alipay enable users to link bank and payment accounts to do many things including paying their bills and purchasing goods and services. Similar dominance is seen elsewhere in Asia according to Agarwal.

Conditions differ in the U.S. and elsewhere in the western world says Agarwal.

“There’s no domination here by one two or three super apps” he says. “In fact we don’t really have a concept of ‘super apps’ that has emerged properly.” (While companies like Revolut are building out a super app approach some question whether consumers in America really want a super app.)

Agarwal suggests that to the degree that multiple super apps become enabled in the West this may provide an opening for bank-based general purpose digital wallets. Accenture’s report suggests that consumer trust in banks could help them pull ahead in super apps.

“You can see a scenario where the wallet will become the primary funder of the payments within those particular apps” says Agarwal.

“So I don’t think the door is completely shut. There is still space” he says. “However it will have to be a thoughtful approach to the payment traffic part of things.”

Digital wallets could also represent an opportunity to build out payment services and yet tie them all together. PayPal promotes its app with this slogan: “The power of PayPal — all in one place.” That “power” includes multiple ways to pay stretching to BNPL and crypto at checkout.

Is Partnering the Way for Banks to Catch Up in Digital Wallets?

If that opportunity develops for banks what could it look like? Agarwal expects to see banking organizations try to push their way into digital wallets both as single institutions as well as through consortia or partnerships. Zelle the industry’s answer to Venmo and other P2P services could be an entrée into a broader digital wallet push though being owned by a group of large banks it has historically avoided competing with its owners and the many smaller players that participate in the service.

Agarwal says related developments in other Western markets are worth watching as things evolve.

One example he cites is in Ireland where four major banks are developing Synch. The plan is to build a shared mobile payment app that can handle every type of consumer payment — in-person retail ecommerce friends and family and more. The intent is for payments to be instant.

In Scandinavia the merger of two mobile payments companies received final regulatory approval in late 2022. MobilePay owned by Danske Bank but open to all institutions in Denmark and Finland is being combined with Vipps owned by a group of Norwegian banks. (A third company left the proposed merger after anti-competitive concerns were raised by the European Commission.) The post-merger goal is to establish a regional mobile payments company Vipps MobilePay — “one Nordic mobile wallet.”

Where Cooperation Didn't Work Out:

Strong interest in building a collaborative approach to mobile payments is not a guarantee of success however. Consider the U.K.'s Paym which is shutting down.

Paym is a collaborative effort launched in 2104 in the U.K. More than a dozen U.K. banks and building societies took part but now the partners plan to close it down by early March 2023.

Paym was designed to be a common payments app among all of the participating financial institutions. It required little more than inputting a phone number to make a payment.

“It was supposed to become a ubiquitous payments app for the U.K.” says Agarwal. But over time transaction volume fell and the decision was made to close it. He explains that one issue was that the partners could also pursue their own digital payment efforts creating a promotional tug of war.

“Over time the takeup of Paym was fairly limited and the banks could never justify the overall cost of running their own apps with their own marketing and operational efforts versus the costs of Paym” says Agarwal.

Understand What You and Your Partners Bring to the Deal

Looking at the idea of a digital wallet partnership more broadly Agarwal says it is essential that would-be participants understand their own interests. He says a player that excels at foreign exchange for example might be loath to not own a potentially lucrative piece of the cooperative effort.

Other partnerships have involved fewer players and different structures. Agarwal points out that parts of the complement of services being built as part of the Apple Card involve Goldman Sachs as a banking partner while other facets of the card are entirely Apple’s.

So there are interesting lessons in terms of how to do and how not to do partnerships according to Agarwal.

“A lot of thinking needs to be done around what experience you want to enable and what role you want to play within that” he says “and how you can influence those partnerships.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vaXAtcXVhcnRlcmx5LmNvbS9lbi9hbG1pZ2h0eS1kb2xsYXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Almighty Dollar?,"The US dollar has ruled the international monetary system since the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944. No other currency has been able to challenge the dollar notwithstanding the ups and downs of the US economy both in terms of growth but also inflation.

Nevertheless despite the dollar’s overall dominance things are changing. This is particularly true for the waning share of the US dollar in the central bank holdings of foreign exchange reserves. More specifically over the last two decades the US dollar has lost over 12 percentage points of market share from 71 percent in 1999 to 59 percent in 2022. One might have expected the euro to benefit from this loss since it is the currency of an economic area of a size close to that of the United States and with a fully open capital account. Another potential winner could have been the yuan given China’s rapid growth over the last 20 years and its sheer size. It is now the second largest economy in the world in US dollar terms and the first in terms of purchasing power but with a still non-fully convertible currency.

Starting with the euro while it did increase its market share in the first half of the 2000s it lost what it had gained as a consequence of the euro crisis and has only started to recover recently and very slowly. The yuan has been boosted by its acceptance in the Special Drawing Rights—an international reserve asset also known as the SDRs—since late 2015 with a 10 percent share. Since then its share in central banks’ foreign exchange reserves has increased steadily but from a very low base. As of now the yuan has a one fourth share of emerging markets’ currencies about half that of the Japanese yen and the British pound.

Notwithstanding the relative reduction in the share of dollar in the denomination of foreign reserves the US currency remains dominant in all the other relevant roles of an international currency such as international debt international loans foreign exchange turnover and more generally global payments as measured by SWIFT transactions. It is in the last aspect the share of global payments where the euro has reached a share that is similar to that of the dollar but there have been many ups and downs in the last few years and the recent trend since mid-2021 has again been a reduction of euro-denominated cross-border transactions in favor of those in dollars.

A Stagnant Euro

Based on the sheer size of the eurozone the question is why the euro has not managed to gain market share as a reserve currency. One of the key reasons is the lack of deep enough financial markets at least when compared to the US. In fact credit and equity markets are still national and rather small compared to the US as the eurozone continues to be dominated by bank lending. Furthermore bank lending has remained at the national level and pan-European banks have not yet emerged as much as one would have expected after monetary union in 1998.

A probably even more crucial drawback is the much smaller pool of safe assets especially since the eurozone crisis of 2010-12 when many member states’ sovereign ratings where downgraded. In fact as of today the pool of euro-denominated safe assets is only 20 percent of the eurozone GDP which contrasts very negatively with the pool of risk-free assets in US dollars.

Thirdly the lack of a single fiscal policy for the euro area also implies that there is no single ultimate backstop for the sovereign debt issued in the eurozone. On that note the establishment of the Next Generation Fund can be considered a positive step in this direction both in terms of the amount of safe assets in euros but also as an embryo of a single fiscal policy.

Finally and very importantly the European Union is not a hard power given its dependence on the US for its security. In a world of great power competition with a much smaller role left for multilateralism and a rules-based order the EU will find it hard to hold on to its economic power which does not bode well for the future of the euro as an international currency.

What to Expect from the Yuan?

Moving to the yuan one might wonder why the currency of the second largest economy in the world which is expected to be the largest in a few years has not been able to achieve a more relevant role as an international currency. There are several reasons for this. The most important one is the lack of convertibility. In fact capital controls are still pervasive in China especially for outflows and increasingly less so for inflows. Secondly the liquidity of the financial markets is still rather limited although it is improving. This is also true for the amount of safe assets China’s sovereign bonds. All in all the international use of the yuan remains rather limited in the context of the size of the Chinese economy ranking fifth globally not only after the dollar and the euro but also the pound and the yen.

Still the Chinese currency is bound to benefit from a world of great power competition and the weaponization of the dollar by the US monetary and economic authorities as a response to a number of external shocks. Iran is a clear case in point but more recently China has also been subjected to US sanctions on a number of political issues including human rights violations in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.

Finally Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led to a much larger deployment of sanctions including the exclusion of several Russian institutions from SWIFT and the freezing of Russia’s external assets denominated in US dollars as well as in other G7 currencies. Interestingly the Russian central bank had already been preparing for such an eventuality since Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014 by massively switching reserves to the yuan and gold compared to international standards. The switch to the yuan rather than the euro or other currencies from developed economies was to be expected as the US has brought along other developed areas of the world especially the European Union on sanctions. This was already the case with the sanctions on Russia related to Crimea and even more so after the new G7 sanctions were imposed on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

The fact that sanctions also applied to other G7 currencies means that any shift of foreign exchange reserves to avoid potential sanctions would need to be into non-G7 currencies which is clearly giving a boost to the demand for the yuan especially for forex reserves. This is all the more so since China has been vocal in declining to participate in sanctions against Russia considering them unilateral. Looking at the volume of yuan transactions (based on SWIFT data) there did seem to be a noticeable pick up in such transactions after the war started but it has since come down possibly because of the increasing uncertainties over the Chinese economy in the light of its strict zero-COVID policies. In the same vein offshore yuan deposits in Hong Kong peaked at the start of the war but they rapidly came down to their level prior to the invasion of Ukraine although there has since been a moderate upward trend.

What to Expect Next?

Looking forward it seems clear that the dollar will not be able to hold on to its overwhelming dominance forever as the relative size of its economy shrinks in favor of other currencies from faster growing emerging economies. The question though is whether it will be the euro and/or the yuan that take on the baton. In the case of the euro there is hardly any doubt that it will not be able to take over the dollar’s market share since the size of its economy is bound to shrink even relative to the dollar. This is also true for the yen and possibly the pound as the United Kingdom’s potential growth after Brexit is bound to be lower.

Instead the yuan is likely to continue to gain market share as it is currently stubbornly low in relation to the size of the Chinese economy. However for the process to accelerate—it remains very slow—the yuan would need to become a convertible currency. Such a scenario remains unlikely even if China continues to open to portfolio inflows but much less has been done on outflows. Such asymmetric financial opening is bound to make it hard for the yuan to reach a market share that would be in line with China’s economic size. In addition the Chinese economy is expected to decelerate structurally and not to continue to converge with the US economy by 2030.

Instead other currencies from emerging economies such as the Indian rupee the Indonesian rupiah and the Brazilian real are bound to move up in the rankings of currencies being used for international transactions. In other words it is to be expected that the dollar’s increasingly less central role as the global reserve currency will be taken partially by the yuan but not fully due to its lack of convertibility while other currencies from large emerging economies are expected to take part of the market share lost by the dollar.

In other words it is very likely that we will move from an international monetary system dominated by the dominant reserve currency the US dollar to a more multilateral one where more currencies can serve the purpose of being used internationally. The timeframe for such change remains long due to the stickiness of international financial markets but could be accelerated by the introduction of digital currencies especially the yuan as well as the evolution of the US economy relative to the rest of the emerging world. Within this context the structural deceleration of the Chinese economy if anything should further slow down the demise of the dollar as the key reserve currency unless the US economy does even worse.

After more than a decade of relatively calm markets volatility is back with a vengeance in the FX markets. As the Federal Reserve and then other central banks began raising interest rates this year currencies began to fluctuate wildly. That’s good news for professional traders but not for corporate executives looking to hit their numbers. The average hit to earnings from currency fluctuations for North American companies in the second quarter was $0.10 per share according to Kyriba. The treasury management advisor suggests that companies should aim to keep the FX impact on earnings at a penny or less per share.

“The volatility this year has been extraordinary” says Andy Gage senior vice-president at Kyriba. “It’s been bigger than the 2008-2009 period and it’s had the biggest impact [on corporate financials] that I’ve ever seen.”

Kyriba tracks the FX exposures of 1200 publicly traded multinational companies in North America and Europe with at least 15% of their revenue coming from overseas. In the second quarter those companies experienced a record impact of $49.1 billion on their reported earnings. Of that gross impact $11.8 billion were favorable tailwinds—almost entirely experienced by European companies—and $37.3 were negative headwinds.

With the surge in the US dollar since the Federal Reserve Board began raising interest rates early this year the value of foreign earnings has plummeted for US reporting companies. They experienced $34.25 billion of the losses in the Kyriba survey and just $220000 of the gains from currency movements. The European companies saw $11.6 billion in gains and just $3.02 billion of the losses. “We will likely see similar results for the third quarter” says Gage. “The dollar only started to come off its high point recently.”

The Mighty Dollar

The overwhelming trend in the FX market this year has been the strength of the dollar against virtually every other currency. From the beginning of March when the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates through early October the US dollar rose 15% against the Euro 25% against the British pound and a staggering 30% against the Japanese yen. With the US dollar involved in nearly 90% of foreign exchange transactions it explains the high volatility this year.

“US companies who have overseas supply chains and sell domestically have probably done alright” said Alain Kamagi managing partner of UNTL Capital an investment firm focused on foreign exchange. “A strong dollar is great when you’re sourcing supply overseas but it’s bad if you’re exporting.”

Big software companies have been notable casualties. Microsoft took a hit of $595 million to revenues in the June quarter from currency exposure and Salesforce expects a negative impact of $600 million on revenues for 2022.

Kamagi thinks that most multinational companies don’t manage their FX risks very well and were not prepared for the explosion in volatility this year. “For the last 10 to 12 years we’ve had low unemployment low inflation and near zero interest rates. There was little need for hedging” he said. “Now it’s a necessity.”





In Search of a Cheaper Hedge

Unfortunately the cost of hedging has now shot through the roof. With the rise in interest rates and volatility hedging has become far more expensive than at the start of the year. For companies that suffered from the run-up in the dollar paying up more to hedge against further losses may seem like throwing good money after bad. “Since the Fed began raising interest rates hedging costs for companies have increased for companies by two three even four times over” said Kyriba’s Gage. “How to mitigate those costs is a difficult conversation we’re now having with CFOs and treasurers.”

The dollar has already started to fall rapidly after the Federal Reserve signaled a pivot in its rate-hiking cycle. After rising to a high of 114 in October the dollar currency index (DXY) dropped back to around 105 as of mid-December—still well above the 96 of December 2021. European and Asian companies with significant business in the US market may feel some pain. Gage says that if finance executives are not looking to hedge their FX risks going forward they are speculating on currencies.

“Hedging is a cost of doing business internationally. Finance executives with a mandate to manage currency risks want the impact to be as flat as possible” said Gage. “You want financial results to be predictable.”

There are ways to mitigate hedging costs and it begins with self-examination. Gage advises companies to look at how currencies flow through their business to reduce exposures organically. Many can net their trading exposures and reduce the number and cost of hedging transactions they use.

There are other ways to lower costs particularly in volatile times. For example some currencies that move in correlation with another can be used to hedge exposures in the other currency if the first currency is a more liquid lower-cost market to conduct transactions. The objective is not to hedge exposure 100% but to set targets for mitigating potential volatility in a cost-effective way. “If you’re 100% hedged you may never make money” suggested Kamagi. “Hedging is like insurance. You can buy it for everything in life but then you’ll spend all your money on premiums.”

The most pressing need for most companies is to fully digitize their treasury management systems. That will give them the data needed to manage FX exposures and determine the tax consequences and financial reporting requirements of different strategies rapidly and effectively. “It’s not the horror show that many people think it is” said Gage. “You need a lot of detailed information but a lot of these problems are manageable if businesses digitize their treasury function.”

There is no shortage of financial institutions and advisors to help companies get there. They can help companies process payments in scores of currencies and produce detailed data on currency exposures tax impacts and compliance requirements. They have robust platforms and sophisticated tools like algorithmic trading to enable more effective and less expensive hedging.

FX Market Still Growing

The foreign exchange market remains the largest most liquid financial market in the world and it doesn’t look like crypto currency is going to supplant it anytime soon. The daily turnover of spot and derivative foreign exchange transactions hit a record $7.5 trillion in April according to the triennial survey of FX markets by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). That’s up from $6.6CHK trillion from the last BIS survey in 2019.

Most of the increase was due to greater volumes traded between primary dealers in the interbank market as they look to hedge their own massive exposures to global currencies in a more volatile environment. The share of trading volume by non-financial corporate customers fell from 7% to 6% in the last three years. The two authors of the survey surmise that a contraction in overall international investment that began early this year could be to blame.

War disease sanctions geopolitical turmoil and deteriorating trade relations are all challenging global companies and straining global supply chains. The FX market however remains a crucial tool for companies to finance their international trade and hedge their currency risks.

GLOBAL WINNERS

BEST GLOBAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE BANK

BBVA

As many saw the extraordinary challenges faced by the global economy in 2022 as a moment to play it safe BBVA the winner of the Best Global Foreign Exchange Bank award again for 2023 saw a unique growth opportunity. In the face of currency challenges that ranged from a 40-year-high US dollar to the war in Ukraine the Spanish giant dug deep into its market expertise and strategic global positioning to provide its customers with best-in-class foreign exchange (FX) services. And the strategy paid off. According to the Bank for International Settlements the FX market saw several daily traded volume records during the year leading to solid profitability from those banks that displayed the ability and vision to seize the opportunity in a crisis.

According to the bank’s latest data BBVA traded an outstanding global volume of roughly $1.3 trillion year-to-date as of November 22 2022; up from $1.2 trillion during the same period a year earlier. This helped the bank achieve a 26.7% year-on-year (YoY) increase in operating income between January and September 2022. But none of those achievements would have been possible without its staff and a full selection of FX products and services including Swift GO FX Net Cash and BBVA eMarkets which were key for clients of all sizes from all geographies.

“Our investments in technology have qualified us to tackle years with uniquely volatile FX environments such as 2020 2021 and 2022. By applying those solutions to our business we have been able to continue providing top client service across the whole value chain” says Luis Martins head of global macro at BBVA.

BEST FX BANK FOR CORPORATES

Societe Generale

Against extreme volatility levels faced by corporates worldwide in 2022 Societe Generale (SG) excelled by designing bespoke risk management solutions for developed emerging and frontier markets. Through a healthy mixture of technology and market expertise the French bank enabled its customers to safely hedge risks in more than 60 currencies by securing much-needed liquidity margins amid challenging macroeconomic conditions.

SG’s leadership in FX algorithmic execution through its trademark TWAP+ NIGHTJAR and FALCON strategies was vital in providing customers with a strategic edge over the competition.

Another vital factor for corporate success in 2022 was SG’s sales team which managed to develop several strategic partnerships with its FX clients. The strategy is part of a broader companywide effort to support its corporate department. This led the bank to report significant YoY growth in the division’s operating income according to its latest earnings statement.

Last year SG also focused on broadening global coverage and capabilities. While the FX spotlight shone on the shrinking dollar-to-euro differential the bank grew its market share in Africa and Latin America by bringing top-in-class solutions for the region’s corporates. However that doesn’t mean that the bank overlooked its European home market. On the contrary SG was key to several prominent FX transactions in dollars euros Swiss francs Czech korunas and Hungarian forints. All those efforts helped the bank post record traded volumes in many locations and for its total operation.

BEST MARKET MAKER IN VOLATILE TIMES

JP Morgan

Market makers earn their keep in volatile environments; last year has been the most volatile since the 2008 financial crisis. JP Morgan the largest participant in global FX markets with a nearly 11% share of total volume is crucial to smoothly functioning liquid currency markets.

From a customer’s perspective the best market maker is theoretically one that bids the most to buy a currency while offering to sell that currency at the lowest price. In other words the best market maker has the tightest bid/offer spread. In times of volatility those spreads necessarily widen to make up for the greater risks that the market maker is taking.

What makes JP Morgan so crucial to the currency markets is its size. With its enormous capital it can continuously quote buy and sell prices for currencies even in the most volatile environments. It also has the most extensive liquidity pool of client banks corporations and investment funds in the market giving it the best chance of executing client orders of all sizes internally at reasonable prices.

BEST LIQUIDITY PROVIDER

Santander

Corporations worldwide will agree that trusting their FX provider’s capacity to provide liquidity in a time of need is one of the most vital characteristics they look for in a bank. However with the global FX market posting several daily volume records during a highly volatile year for developed and emerging market currencies that mission has been more challenging than ever.

In 2022 success in the FX market required a sound balance between global positioning effective risk management and solid liquidity reserves in many different currencies—all the main qualities possessed by Global Finance’s Best Liquidity Bank Santander.

The Spanish-based giant recorded phenomenal growth in markets as diverse as the UK Brazil Spain and Uruguay all on the back of a global strategy designed to facilitate currency integration securing its reserves throughout the year’s ups and downs. “Our Global Markets business is a strategic pillar for Santander and the group. This appointment will help us leverage our global capabilities and accelerate growth” says José Linares global head of Santander Corporate and Investment Bank (Santander CIB).

Another secret behind Santander’s market leadership is its flagship Santander CIB FX solutions a risk management app that aids clients in their financing and investment needs. It complements the bank’s day-to-day trading platform.

BEST FX PROVIDER FOR EMERGING MARKETS CURRENCIES

Crown Agents Bank

One wouldn’t expect a 190-year-old bank to be one of the world’s leading technology and innovation providers in the FX market. But that is precisely the strategy that Global Finance’s Best FX Bank for Emerging Markets Currencies Crown Agents Bank has been deploying under the leadership of CEO Bhairav Trivedi.

The bank has solidified its position as a leading FX wholesale bank for emerging markets through its market-leading digital platform for real-time trading. It has executable prices in more than 100 currencies across over 550 currency pairs. Crown Agents Bank took the emerging markets award by providing an accessible yet full suite of FX payments trade finance and money market services to Supra National Express central banks financial institutions governments NGOs and select commercial enterprises. According to the bank’s latest financial statement growth in emerging markets has been significantly higher than in G10 markets since 2019.

As part of its innovation-focused strategy the UK-based giant has also resorted to critical partnerships in tech scaling the bank’s FX capabilities with a focus on the fast-moving emerging market. “We were injected with fintech hormones and started to focus on the core payments infrastructure across several emerging and frontier markets” explains CEO Trivedi. As emerging markets move toward a more digital payment structure Trivedi expects Crown Agents to deepen its leadership over the coming years.

BEST FX PROVIDER FOR FRONTIER MARKETS CURRENCIES

Citi

The most global of the big four US banks remains committed to helping companies do business in the small but fast-growing economies of the world. In 2021 Citi announced it would exit consumer banking in 13 global markets including designated frontier markets like Vietnam and Bahrain. However Citi continues to provide a wide range of services and support to wealthy clients institutional investors and companies looking to start or grow a business in emerging and frontier markets.

In the Asia-Pacific region Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions maintains more than 300 regional treasury centers and supports businesses in more than 145 currencies. Overall Citi employs 60000 people in the region which accounts for a quarter of the bank’s profits. It has a presence in 55 markets in the Europe Middle East and Africa region does business in

another 52 and supports payments in 68 different currencies. It provides direct custody and clearing in 34 markets and has access to 5000 correspondent networks in Africa alone—an essential resource in many small less developed markets. Citi also has a presence in 20 markets in Latin America and its largest business in North America.

As a technology innovator Citi also helps businesses operate in smaller markets. In 2021 it partnered with treasury management provider Kyriba to create a payment system for consumer goods company THG to enable it to make payments through digital wallets rather than through banking infrastructure. All the company now needs to make a payment in one of 20 different currencies in almost 200 markets is an email address … very convenient for a company doing business in 169 markets many of which have limited banking infrastructure.

BEST ESG-LINKED BANK

BNP Paribas

As the risk-off environment of 2022 prompted investors to indiscriminately lower bond purchases worldwide the formerly thriving environmental social and governance (ESG) investment market witnessed its first setback of a decade with well over $125 billion in ESG fund downgrades—and the perspective of many more on the horizon.

But amid this sea of red the Paris-headquartered BNP Paribas held to its decades-long belief in sustainable finance and secured impressive numbers for the year deepening its market leadership in ESG-linked debt. According to its latest report the bank plans to issue 350 billion euros (about $372 billion) of sustainable bonds and loans between 2022 and 2025.

None of those numbers would have been possible without the cooperation of the bank’s FX division. As the euro faced unseen instability due to the growing interest rate spread between the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve and the energy crisis due to the Ukrainian war investors were prompted to avoid long-term debt in the European currency. This in turn translated into a particular headwind to the global ESG market as the old continent remains the center of the ESG business.

That’s where BNP Paribas’ strong global presence and market knowledge played a pivotal role. With top-tier hedging services and an FX division that has always worked collaboratively with its ESG team corporates worldwide were able to counter many of those risks. Furthermore the bank’s patterned multiproduct FX trading Cortex FX and ALiX a digital trading assistant also helped division integration leading to a less risky ESG-linked FX environment

BEST FX COMMODITY TRADING BANK

Rabobank

In 2022 commodity producers worldwide needed FX market expertise as they had only a few times before. As food and energy prices soared at the fastest pace in a decade—before subsiding into year-end—and European currencies lost significant ground against the dollar securing healthy margins grew increasingly challenging.

Amid such a complex scenario Global Finance’s Best FX Commodity Trading Bank of 2023 Rabobank dug deep into its solid FX product line and key market positioning to provide the industry’s corporates with best-in-class services.

Its leading global positioning supports them in the agricultural market; the Dutch bank combined state-of-the-art FX trading and hedging technology with market analysis designed to give its customers a significant edge over the competition. Moreover Rabobank’s award-winning research team helped its customers anticipate many important trends in commodities and FX markets. That’s perhaps why the bank’s latest earnings report noted FX as a key factor in its 2022 net profitability growth. With a 10% YoY increase in its Food and Agriculture portfolio Rabobank secured phenomenal success against the year’s macroeconomic environment.

Another essential secret behind the bank’s success is its relentless pursuit of innovation which has become the focus of the bank’s operation under the leadership of Alexander Zwart its head of digital transformation. “Agility brings transparency transparency increases control and being in control enables you to advance and innovate faster” explains Zwart. “Increased transparency allows the organization to make better decisions.”

BEST TRADE FINANCE FX

Bank of America

Pandemics wars rising prices and interest rates and economic growth slowing around the world. None of these are good for trade or trade finance.

Although global trade recovered rapidly last year from the sharp Covid-19-induced falloff of 2020 today the outlook is deteriorating. The World Trade Organization (WTO) recently lowered its estimate of growth in global merchandise trade volume to just 1% in 2023 from an earlier forecast of 3.4%.

Global banks like Bank of America (BofA) will be a big factor in how significant the slowdown ends up becoming. Trade finance products play a crucial role in reducing companies’ risks when engaging in foreign trade—particularly in times of volatility. The risks of nonpayment late payment nonreceipt of goods and fluctuating currencies as well as in-transit risks are always a concern for both importers and exporters.

Whether working capital loans simple lines of credit letters of credit spelling out terms for transactions to be executed bank guarantees or receivables factoring to raise needed cash trade finance tools facilitate transactions and keep global trade humming the WTO estimates that between 80% and 90% of world trade depends on trade finance solutions to get done.

With a presence in over 30 countries BofA offers a comprehensive suite of trade finance options in all regions. It has a corps of industry-focused specialists that tailor product offerings to businesses.

UBS

As Europe regained the spotlight in the 2022 global FX market on the back of a shrinking euro-to-dollar differential and the war in Ukraine UBS used its 160-year experience and strong global positioning to help clients excel amid extraordinary volatility. Not only did the Swiss-based bank maintain its solid position as the top FX bank in Europe but it also managed to transform this year’s headwinds into effective growth. UBS stepped up its game to reach a nearly 10% share of the global FX market—its largest on record according to Euromoney. As European corporates struggled to maintain currency security amid a volatile year on the continent the bank’s trademark FX algorithmic strategies provided a significant edge for its clients.

Shayanna Jenkins-Hernandez attended the murder trial of Aaron Hernandez in Boston in 2017 with her daughter Avielle. Avielle is now 10 years old. Keith Bedford

The fight started in September when Shayanna Jenkins-Hernandez said she couldn’t afford the $10697 bill for her daughter’s dance lessons.

So the former fiancée of disgraced New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez asked a court-appointed trustee to pay the bill from a trust fund that had been set up for their daughter Avielle after Hernandez committed suicide while in prison for murder in 2017.

But the trustee attorney David Schwartz said no. By his calculations Jenkins-Hernandez already was receiving a separate source of funds outside the trust — $150000 a year or more from Hernandez’s NFL pension and Social Security that was supposed to pay for the 10-year-old’s daily expenses. He couldn’t imagine why she needed more.

Then Schwartz reviewed how Jenkins-Hernandez had been spending the money: $36858 on clothing including maternity wear; $39347 on home goods; $25577 shopping online; $11792 in “self care” including gym fees and visits to hair and nail salons.

“There is reason to question whether the expenditures were for Avielle’s benefit” said attorney Robert O’Regan who is representing Schwartz in the court dispute. “To be fair this little girl should have a decent life with what her father left for her. No one would complain if there were reasonable expenses. We’re talking about over the top or otherwise unrelated expenses to Avielle.”

Now Schwartz and Jenkins-Hernandez are locked in a battle over who controls the money that remained after the death of Hernandez who hanged himself in prison after being convicted of murdering Odin Lloyd the boyfriend of Jenkins-Hernandez’s sister. Just a few days before his death Hernandez had been acquitted of a separate double murder in the South End.

When Schwartz declined to pay Avielle’s dancing bill Jenkins-Hernandez promptly asked a Bristol County probate judge to remove him as trustee arguing he was potentially forcing the child to give up her favorite extracurricular activity. Jenkins-Hernandez who gave birth to a second daughter by another man in 2018 insists she hasn’t improperly spent money and the money from the trust fund should be available when she needs it.

“Since Aaron’s death my sole focus has been on raising and providing as stable a life for my children as possible” wrote Jenkins-Hernandez in an e-mail to the Globe. “All monies I have spent have been with this singular focus in mind and this will continue to be my focus going forward.”

Her lawyer Stephen Withers called the controversy “much ado about nothing. What Shayanna has done is focus on her children … Any allegation or insinuation that she’s spending money inappropriately or for any other purpose is absolutely false.”

But Schwartz said Jenkins-Hernandez appears to have broken the rules and he has asked that she be removed as Avielle’s conservator a court-appointment that allowed her to set up the trust fund Schwartz now administers. If she loses that role a new conservator would receive Hernandez’s pension and Social Security checks and decide how the money should be spent.

The downfall of Aaron Hernandez was one of the most shocking in American sports history as the Patriots’ star tight end was revealed to be a brutal killer exposing an ugly underside of the NFL. The Boston Globe Spotlight Team found that Hernandez had long been prone to wild mood swings and sudden violence — after death his brain showed signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE which can be caused by repeated blows to the head — but the warning signs were overlooked as long as he was catching touchdown passes.

Jenkins-Hernandez who started dating Hernandez when both were in high school in New Britain Conn. testified as a prosecution witness during his murder trial but has insisted her fiancé was innocent. She told jurors that the day after the killing of Lloyd she removed a box from the couple’s 7100-square-foot North Attleborough home at Hernandez’s direction and discarded it. Authorities believed the box contained the murder weapon which was never found.

After his death Jenkins-Hernandez took her fiancé’s name and unsuccessfully sued the NFL over his diagnosis of CTE.

Nothing could bring back the high-flying NFL lifestyle she once knew — at one point according to court documents her daughter Avielle was receiving public assistance. And because Jenkins-Hernandez and Hernandez were never married and he died without a will any assets would go to Avielle his sole heir not to her. Jenkins-Hernandez does not have a job either according to her attorney.

Even so the settlement of Hernandez’s estate including the sale of their North Attleborough mansion brought Jenkins-Hernandez some financial stability. The trust administered by Schwartz paid for her current Rhode Island home and all related expenses as well as Avielle’s school tuition. Separately Jenkins-Hernandez directly receives Hernandez’s pension and Social Security payments although Schwartz said those funds too are supposed to be spent exclusively for the benefit of her daughter.

As the conservator for her daughter Jenkins-Hernandez was supposed to file annual disclosures for the last several years as to how she was spending the money but Schwartz said she only recently began submitting them.

Schwartz was shocked by what he saw on the expenditure forms: tens of thousands of dollars in what he called “questionable” expenses such as $4800 in charges at Harrods Department Store that seemed to benefit her more than her daughter. She made $29650 in ATM withdrawals and paid $13778 in bank charges — mostly overdraft fees.

“There is every reason to question whether and how (Jenkins-Hernandez) is applying the significant resources that should be available to pay for Avielle’s daily needs including dance lessons especially since all of her basic housing security and educational expenses are paid from the trust” wrote O’Regan a partner in the law firm Burns & Levinson in a filing submitted on Schwartz’s behalf.

Schwartz was particularly concerned that Jenkins-Hernandez reported spending $39655 on education — including $3720 for Bay Path University a private university in Western Massachusetts.

“Avielle is not in college” wrote O’Regan and her school bills are already paid for from the trust.

Jenkins-Hernandez also spent $12830 on something called “Ask My Accountant.” Neither Jenkins-Hernandez nor her lawyer would explain what that is or discuss any other specific expenditures.

“I filed the accountings on her behalf and feel comfortable they were appropriate” Withers said. “Questions can be easily answered. Everything she has done has been wholly appropriate and I look forward to this matter being beneficially resolved and this distraction put behind her. “

“Our focus is making sure Avielle has the best life she can and that’s what Shayanna is focused on” he said.

O’Regan does not question Jenkins-Hernandez’s devotion to Avielle but wonders if she felt entitled to Hernandez’s money.

“We are dealing with human behavior here” O’Regan told the Globe. “If you’re someone like Shayanna — someone in this situation with Aaron who was an NFL superstar for a championship football team who dies and leaves a child you might think you get to spend this money any way you want. Nobody told her she can’t or she’s not listening.”

The motions from both sides are pending and Schwartz has requested the case be transferred to a special court that deals with complex disputes like this.

A hearing on Jenkins-Hernandez’s motion to force Schwartz to pay for the dance lessons was supposed to be heard earlier this month but was canceled. According to Withers Jenkins-Hernandez was able to make other arrangements to pay for Avielle’s dance lessons.

Going forward O’Regan argues Jenkins-Hernandez should no longer be entrusted with funds for her daughter who is eligible to receive the trust funds when she turns 25. Currently the fund contains around $700000.

“I believe that (Jenkins-Hernandez) has been co-mingling the child’s funds with her own” wrote O’Regan in a court filing. ”I believe that Ms. Jenkins-Hernandez’s ongoing conflict her almost five-year-long record of excessive expenditures continuous violation of this court’s decree … and her failure to file an inventory and up to date accounts all indicate that despite what might be her best intentions Ms. Jenkins-Hernandez is not effectively performing her duties as conservator.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vaWZzdHVkaWVzLm9yZy9ibG9nL3JlbGlnaW91cy1yZXNvbHV0aW9ucy1pcy1qdXN0LWdvaW5nLXRvLWNodXJjaC1lbm91Z2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Religious Resolutions: Is Just Going to Church Enough?,"Women and men across the globe who live the Home Worshiper lifestyle are significantly more likely to report having a highly satisfying and stable marriage than less religious or nonreligious individuals.

Many recent studies show that religion has a profoundly positive impact on people’s lives around the globe. In particular these studies compare highly religious individuals with their less religious or nonreligious peers and find a consistent and significant beneficial association between religiosity and a variety of measures of individual and family well-being.

However it is possible that many current studies are underestimating the full benefits available from religious participation because they do not distinguish between individuals who are receiving a “full dose” of religion and those receiving lower dosage levels. Most notably it is standard practice in many research studies to distinguish religiosity levels by the frequency with which the respondents attend religious services—with those who never attend services being identified as “secular” or “nonreligious” those who attend occasionally being identified as “nominal” or “less-religious” and those who attend regularly as “active” or “highly religious.” Often weekly or more attendance at religious services is used as an identifier for high religiosity but some studies are starting to identify highly religious individuals as those who simply attend religious services at least once per month.

But is this how highly religious individuals would identify themselves? In addition to regular attendance at religious services all world religions encourage their followers to bring religious observance into their daily lives through home-centered religious practices and personal forms of worship. Most notably nearly all faith traditions teach the importance of communing with the Divine through engaging in personal prayer and contemplation reading scriptures or holy writ discussing religious teachings in one’s home and gathering one’s family together for shared family prayers worship and devotion.

When home-centered religious practices are taken into account it appears that current practices of measuring religiosity are at risk of underestimating the full effects of religion on followers. This is because these studies do not distinguish those who engage in home-centered religious practices in addition to regular church attendance from those who attend church regularly but do not actively engage in these practices at home. Indeed current methods that rely solely on church attendance to distinguish “religious dosage” may be adequate in identifying nonreligious and nominally religious individuals but they do not satisfactorily distinguish the truly highly religious in most faith communities.

Could it be that home-centered religious patterns help contribute to benefits for individuals and couples above and beyond attendance at religious services alone? We recently released a new report to examine this question.

Our new report A Not-So-Good Faith Estimate: Why Many Studies Underestimate the Full Benefits of Religion drew from the 2018 Global Faith and Families Survey (GFFS2018) which sampled adults between the ages of 18 and 50 over a two-week period.1 The survey included over 16000 individuals from 11 countries including Argentina Australia Canada Chile Colombia France Ireland Mexico Peru the United Kingdom and the United States.

In our study we explored how regular engagement in home-centered religious practices influences individual well-being and relationship outcomes beyond church attendance alone. In particular we examined the effects of “religious dosage” across four groups:

Seculars – Non-religious individuals who never attend church and report that they never engage in personal worship practices (31% of the U.S. sample and 31% of the international sample).

– Non-religious individuals who never attend church and report that they never engage in personal worship practices (31% of the U.S. sample and 31% of the international sample). Nominals – Individuals who report some amount of either personal or public religious participation but do not regularly attend religious services (43% of the U.S. sample and 49% of the international sample).

– Individuals who report some amount of either personal or public religious participation but do not regularly attend religious services (43% of the U.S. sample and 49% of the international sample). Attenders – Individuals who attend church weekly and engage in some home worship patterns but do not do so regularly (15% of the U.S. sample and 13% of the international sample).

– Individuals who attend church weekly and engage in some home worship patterns but do not do so regularly (15% of the U.S. sample and 13% of the international sample). Home Worshippers – Individuals who attend church at least weekly but also pray daily and engage in the home worship practices of praying together as a family reading scriptures and having religious conversations in the home at least two to three times a week (11% of the U.S. sample and 8% of the international sample).

Religious Dosage Matters

On several measures of individual well-being and relationship quality we found that religious dosage matters. The full benefits of religion are experienced by those who actively engage in home-centered religious practices in addition to regularly attending religious services. For example individuals who engage in home-centered religious practices are significantly more likely to report high levels of life meaning and happiness in their lives. Specifically “Home Worshipers” are nearly twice as likely as their less-religious peers and more than four times more likely than Seculars to report a frequent sense of meaning and purpose in their lives.

We also found an increase in reported life happiness with each dosage category of religious involvement. Home Worshipers are significantly more likely to report high levels of happiness than are Attenders Nominals or Seculars. In the U.S. we found a similar pattern with Home Worshiper men and women reporting the highest levels of life happiness. However in contrast to the international sample the U.S. pattern is more notable for women than for men. In terms of magnitude Home Worshiper women in the U.S. are about twice as likely as Attender women and four times as likely as Secular women to report a high level of life happiness.

Our study also found that women and men across the globe who live the Home Worshiper lifestyle are significantly more likely to report having a highly satisfying and stable marriage relationship than less religious or nonreligious individuals. In the U.S. Home Worshiper women and men also have the greatest likelihood of reporting that they are in a high-quality marriage relationship. Specifically U.S. men in Home Worshiper relationships are roughly twice as likely to report that they are in a high-quality marriage than their Secular peers whereas Home Worshiper women are three times more likely than their secular peers and two times more likely than their Attender peers to report a high quality marriage.

Moreover individuals who engage in regular patterns of home worship also report significantly higher emotional closeness and sexual satisfaction in their marriages than individuals who only attend church regularly or don’t attend church at all. In a previous report we found that couples who regularly engage in home religious practices also report significantly higher levels of shared decision making between partners fewer money problems and more frequent patterns of loving behavior such as forgiveness commitment and kindness.

Many Studies Underestimate the Benefits of Religion

Our study also provides clear evidence of the deficiencies in the often-used practice by many public studies of measuring religiosity solely by levels of church attendance. In fact combining individuals and families who engage in home-centered religious practices with those who only attend church not only conceals these differences but also leads to the erroneous conclusion that the potential benefits of religion are smaller than they actually are.

Our findings suggest that measuring religiosity with only church attendance underestimates the benefits of religion by approximately 25% on average and can be as high as nearly 50% on certain outcomes. This means that highly religious individuals who engage in home-centered religious practices frequently score 25% higher and in some cases as much as 50% higher than is often reported for “highly religious” individuals in many public research studies.

We also found that highly religious women in the U.S. are the sample most underestimated by measuring religiosity with only church attendance levels—with home-worshiping women scoring 40% higher on average on measures of personal well-being and relationship quality than standard measures of religiosity would typically show.

Religion it appears is one way for people to find meaning and connection. Therefore it is not surprising that the extent to which one engages in religious practices is predictive of the extent to which one gains the anticipated benefits of religion. Separating those who engage fully in their faith from those who only engage partially makes this conclusion clear. Future research on the influences of religion should consider the drawbacks of measuring religiosity solely using religious attendance or affiliation as the results will likely underestimate the richer benefits of home-based religious practices.

Before he caught the ball cancer caught him.Last May Cory Youmans was just trying to climb the ladder at a Dallas financial services company — one day talking business outlooks the next to an oncologist.“When you’re 35 and your doctor says you have cancer it absolutely changes your life” Youmans said. “It changed everything even the way I look at time.”Doctors diagnosed his cancer early and his prognosis is good for a full and lasting recovery. The alteration of his perspective might be even better.See the world. No dillydallying. Embrace different cultures. And when a friend offers you tickets to a baseball game always say “Yes!”Who knows? Maybe you’ll wind up catching a historic home run ball.That lucky fella who made the life-changing catch of Aaron Judge’s No. 62 at Arlington’s Globe Life Field? Sure enough the cancer survivor.Little did Youmans realize that dealing with melanoma would be less unnerving than becoming a millionaire.On the night of Oct. 4 Youmans was in Arlington to see not be seen.Like all sports fans – the Texas Rangers are his team and Highland Park-bred Los Angeles Dodgers’ pitcher Clayton Kershaw his favorite player – last fall he was captivated by Judge’s pursuit of the American League single-season home-run record. The mark of 61 was set by New York Yankees’ icon Roger Maris in 1961 making the chase and the New York’s media coverage of it intense.A couple days before the Yankees arrived in Arlington for a season-ending four-game series against the Rangers Youmans’ friend invited him to game No. 161. Judge had tied Maris’ record on Sept. 28 in Toronto but then stalled.“I was there to see Aaron Judge” said Youmans who sat in left field next to his friend in Section 31 Row 1 Seat 12. “I was naïve to what might happen to someone if they caught the ball.”He had never snagged a ball at a Major League Baseball game. Just in case he brought his glove.Leading off in the first inning Judge smacked the third pitch he saw: an 88-mph slider from otherwise anonymous Rangers pitcher Jesus Tinoco. Perfectly tracking a baseball hit 391 feet traveling at 100 mph Youmans moved slightly to his left and made an outstretched clean catch.“Right in the pocket” he said. “It was like slow-motion. Surreal.”Before his life could permanently change first his scenery temporarily shifted.As he received congratulatory high-fives from elated and envious strangers in the stands a member of Globe Life Field’s security team quickly escorted Youmans to a private room. On the way a TV reporter asked what he was going to do with the ball.Said Youmans “That’s a good question. I haven’t thought about it.”He remembers the 2 or 3 minutes immediately after the catch as “pure joy … the best thing about sports.” But in an instant his baseball euphoria deteriorated into their big business.“Had I known then what I know now I would’ve reacted differently” he said. “But at the time ignorance was bliss.”In the holding room Yankees executive director of security Eddie Fastook arrived and offered Youmans the chance to meet Judge and exchange the ball for memorabilia photographs and tickets. He politely declined. An authenticator then checked the ball for special markings affixed by MLB. With the ball verified Youmans hopped in a golf cart and met Rangers owner Ray Davis before two security guards took him to his car along a covert route.Pressure was accelerating on social media.During his drive home Youmans received a text from his wife asking if he was near their apartment in Dallas. Someone had already shared their address on the internet. The couple grabbed their dog and moved to a friend’s house for several days.Worse veteranbaseball writer Bob Nightengale haphazardly sent out misinformation to his almost 400000 followers on Twitter. Posted Nightengale:""The man who caught the historic Aaron Judge baseball Corey Youmans doesn't exactly need the money. He is a vice president at Fisher Investments which manages $197 billion worldwide.""The erroneous presumptive misleading tweet – which misspelled Cory’s name and misidentified his job title – received 13000 likes 1300 retweets and one telling initial comment:""Why is it the ones who don't need it....wind up with it?""Youmans who had moved in with his grandparents in California at age 13 and eventually paid his own way as he became the family’s first college graduate has never been on the prowl for a get-rich-quick scheme.He isn’t some romantic baseball hero who voluntarily relinquished the ball out of his love of the game. Nor is he the rich-get-richer greedy villain fittingly hoodwinked out of half his potential windfall an image that's being pushed by the media and amplified across uninformed social networks.Instead he’s a pragmatist who meticulously researched the ramifications of how he handled one of baseball’s most important artifacts. Youmans’ decision to decline sketchy offers – everything from Ferraris via direct message to suitcases full of cash – and instead to net $1.5 million through an auction gave critics a punchline. But it gave him peace of mind.“No matter what I did not everyone would agree that it was the right strategy” Youmans said this week. “If I gave it back I was stupid and if I sold it I was greedy. I’m a private person that essentially won the lottery live on national TV. So to say the least it’s been an interesting experience. But I’m at peace with the process.”Initially he secured the ball in a bank vault in Dallas and did a deep dive into precedents.He began weighing a supposed $2 million “sight unseen” bounty that smelled more like a publicity stunt than a real offer. He gauged estimates that the ball’s ultimate price could top the previous record – $3.05 million – for the No. 70 home-run ball hit by the St. Louis Cardinals’ Mark McGwire in 1998 (because of his steroid-tarnished legacy and the fact that his record was broken by Barry Bonds in 2001 McGwire’s ball has plummeted in value to around $300000 according to collectibles marketplace Goldin Auctions). He even dug into the outcomes of people who had won the lottery.“There is no playbook” Youmans said. “I spent a tremendous amount of time researching what people in the past have done. I thought it would also make sense to keep an open mind and see what all of the options were. We thought we would try to identify the best private offer and the best auction house. The offers are more challenging to sort through than people realize.”Six weeks after his catch Youmans was finally ready to throw the ball back … to the highest bidder. He hired New Jersey-based Goldin to auction the ball.“We’ve already had an offer for $3 million” Youmans’ attorney Dave Baron announced at the time.This sparked criticism about the “greedy” guy in Texas who turned his back on $3 million. As he accepted his AL Most Valuable Player award in November even Judge spoke about Youmans’ strategy.“That’s a lot of money” he said. “But I guess he’s got a better plan or thinks he can get some more. Hopefully he’s making the right decision for him and his family.”The bidding started at $1 million on Nov. 29 and increased five times climaxing at $1.5 million less than an hour before the auction closed Dec. 17.While fans and critics immediately began jeering at Youmans for “losing” $1.5 million by not taking the $3 million offer he walked away satisfied with his proceeds.Youmans admits he could have potentially squeezed more money out of the ball. In addition to the $3 million offer there were also bizarre offers for exotic cars via Instagram direct messages and by email through third-party intermediaries such as law firms and art dealers purporting to represent clients.. Let the seller beware.“There was a lot of excitement but it’s hard to tell who is legitimate and how serious they are” Youmans said. “You think you have an offer and then people ghost you. You can’t determine what their motives are. The lack of transparency was a major factor for me.”His logic: Comfort over cash.If the $3 million offer was on the up-and-up why didn't the person who offered it submit a bid at auction? The ball was ultimately purchased by a sports collector identified only as “Joe” from Wisconsin.“It was a legitimate offer but without a lot of transparency” Youmans explained of the $3 million. “I was just uncomfortable selling the ball behind closed doors. So we went with the safe open fair route at auction. How the ball was sold was more important than what it sold for.”In April the Rangers will debut a new pitching ace in Jacob deGrom and will play on ESPN’sfor the first time at Globe Life Field. There will be hope. There will be fanfare. There will be Youmans merely a footnote to homer history.His plans for the money? Some will be spent for his family’s first home and some for repaying – in the form of a classic car garage and workshop – his grandfather who put off retirement to see him through high school.He moves forward gladly keeping the fortune but having had his fill of the fame.“I don’t expect to go on and do something else that gets me on” he said. “This was enough for me.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAxLzAzL29waW5pb24vYXNzaXN0ZWQtc3VpY2lkZXMtc2xpcHBlcnktc2xvcGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Assisted suicide’s slippery slope,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bostonglobe.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2023/01/03/opinion/assisted-suicides-slippery-slope/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2BF7700>, 'Connection to www.bostonglobe.com timed out.

As the rank and file filtered into the mega-bank’s posh Manhattan headquarters at 200 West St. those who went to grab their usual cup of joe in the so-called “Sky Lobby” on the 11th floor were confronted with “a sign and a woman yelling at us that it was no longer complimentary” one caffeine-addicted employee griped.

“We had to go to the checkout counter before we could leave. I paid $2.99 this morning for a sh–ty cup of Seattle’s Best” the frustrated financier fumed. “Nothing says ‘Happy New Year’ like ‘You’re already on the verge of losing your jobs — but let’s just make sure you lose your free coffee too.’”

Goldmanites were on edge on the first work day of 2023 after chief executive David Solomon revealed plans to lay off another round of workers during “the first half of January.” Last month Semafor reported Goldman will lay off 4000 “low performing” staff — roughly 8% of its workforce — although insiders noted it may ultimately be a smaller number.

Another staffer took the coffee clampdown in stride noting that “All the floors have coffee machines … just the drip isn’t free anymore” — the latter being the serve-yourself stuff that’s dispensed from the spigots in the Sky Lobby. The staffer also admitted however that the coffee machines inside the offices are frequently broken.

“’Kick a man while they are down’ seems to be Goldman’s 2023 mantra” the first source added. “People aren’t jovial from the holiday rest … now they’re pissed about the loss of coffee too.”

A Goldman rep pointed to the coffee machines Goldman provides. “There is free coffee available to all employees on every floor — from drip coffee to espresso drinks” spokesperson Abbey Collins told The Post.

But employees claim the machines are frequently out of commission and the ones that do work make coffee that “sucks.”

After Labor Day Goldman removed the last vestige of pandemic perks: the complimentary “grab and go” coffee station at the entrance of 200 West St. — stocked with coldbrew as well as stashes of French vanilla creamer almond milk soy milk and half-and-half — that appeared during the pandemic to encourage attendance.

It’s not just coffee that has been yanked. In April Goldman announced that employees were once again on the hook for the cost of breakfast and lunch. Goldman hiked its meal allowance for dinner to $30 from $25 after The Post reported staff were griping that they couldn’t even buy a Chipotle dinner with the stingy stipend.

Also in April Solomon ended free daily car rides to and from the office which the bank had begun offering at the start of the COVID outbreak The Post was first to report. It now limits the benefit to employees who work well into the evening sources said.

Ultimately the brass determined it didn’t need sweeteners to get people back to the office sources told The Post. Instead management believed the threat of getting fired should more than enough incentive the sources said.

“There are a variety of factors impacting the business landscape including tightening monetary conditions that are slowing down economic activity” Solomon said in a voice memo sent to employees last week. “We need to proceed with caution and manage our resources wisely.”

The year-end memo came as profits at major banks slump and the top brass at those firms look to downsize their workforce amid a slowing economy. In September Goldman chopped roughly 1% to 5% of underperformers.

While every bank on Wall Street is faced with troubling economic conditions Goldman appears to be in a particularly precarious position. Earlier this week The Post reported some Goldman partners believe Solomon isn’t up to the task of running the prestigious firm. Goldman is dwarfed in size by banks like Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan and insiders feel Solomon hasn’t done enough to compete with the rivals insiders told The Post’s Charlie Gasparino.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

To come up with his picks he examined the best- and worst performers in the S&P 500 from last year and chose five potential 2023 winners from each list.

""One of the easiest traps to fall into is simply sticking with winners. And it works for a long time — right until it doesn't"" he said.

Here are the best-performers from 2022 that Cramer believes could continue to see gains this year:

Halliburton

Cramer predicted that the stock has a multiyear rally ahead of it.

Constellation Energy

The company will likely be a big beneficiary of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act he said adding that he believes Constellation Energy is the best operator of nuclear plants.

Enphase Energy

Calling it the ""renewable golden boy"" Cramer said the solar energy technology company is a profitable solid business.

McKesson

Stocks of drug distributors such as McKesson tend to work well during an economic slowdown he said.

Northrop Grumman

The company's stock could be the best defense contractor to own as the war between Russia and Ukraine continues according to Cramer.

Here are the worst performers from 2022 that he believes could mount a comeback this year:

Netflix

""I believe Netflix has turned itself around because they were so confident on that last conference call. You know for almost two years their conference calls were funereal even when Squid Game took the world by storm"" he said adding ""And lots of growth-oriented money managers want to find improving franchises and that fits Netflix to a tee.""

Stanley Black & Decker

Investors interested in the stock should start a small position here and gradually buy more on the way down he recommended.

VF Corp

Cramer said that while VF Corp stock had a ""horrendous performance"" last year he's betting that new interim CEO Benno Dorer will help the company return value to shareholders in 2023.

Meta Platforms

Cramer said that while the stock has been a ""disaster"" he believes that the metaverse will either take off or fizzle out this year. The former scenario would be good news for the company while the latter would mean the company could divert its metaverse budget to other segments such as Reels and WhatsApp he said.

Advanced Micro Devices

He said that while AMD stock has been battered by waning demand in personal computers this year he's still a believer of CEO Lisa Su and the company's underlying business.

On December 16 2022 Justice Nareshwar Harnanan pronounced his ruling on the Judicial Review case filed in the High Court by Vanda Radzik Danuta Radzik and Raphael Singh vs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Environmental Assessment Bureau (EAB) and Schlumberger Guyana Inc. (SGI). Justice Harnanan quashed the decision by the EPA to award an environmental authorisation to SGI on the grounds that it was ultra vires and in breach of the EPA’s statutory duty as set out in the Environmental Act section 11 (2) Cap 20:05. Additionally the judge ruled that the EPA’s decision to waive the requirements of an EIA was in breach of the EPA’s statutory duty to give reasons for waiving an EIA for the construction and operations of a radioactive source storage and calibration facility. An injunction was issued and directed to SGI restraining it its servants And/or agents from continuing the operations unless and/or until in receipt of a lawfully issued environmental permit as set out in the Environmental Protection Act Cap 20:05.

We welcome this landmark ruling and example of the Court upholding the Rule of Law in Guyana.

Prior to our filing for a Judicial Review in the High Court 51 community residents elected neighbourhood officials and Guyanese stakeholders supported the original Letter of Appeal addressed and delivered to the EAB and EPA in May 2021. This Letter cited the same breaches of the Environmental Protection Act referenced above. The EAB and EPA summarily rejected this appeal.

On August 29th 2022 54 citizens of Guyana signed an Open Letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) & the Environmental Assessment Board (EAB) which was delivered by email with a hand delivered hard copy. The open letter was also published in Stabroek News with all names attached.

The letter registered dismay that a 1-million US dollar grant from the World Bank to the EPA to strengthen its monitoring and enforcement capacity was not fully utilised by the EPA. The grant was aimed at establishing a corps of personnel including 34 highly specialized and experienced petroleum geological and environmental engineers. But because the monies were not fully utilized it failed to achieve the intended outcome and the EPA remains lacking in these essential skills and capacities.

The letter noted the many failings of the EPA which has a duty under the EPA Act “to provide protection manage the natural environment assess impacts of development activities by conducting promoting and coordinating research on pollution and prevention; formulating standards guidelines and codes of practice including for the release of contaminants into the environment; monitoring and coordinating natural resources and how they are being impacted advising key stakeholder on the content and applicability of environmental control instruments and providing general information to the public on the state of the environment.”

It called on the EPA to implement eleven actions. The EPA was given a 30-day period to respond to this letter. To date no response has been forthcoming from the EPA or the EAB to these recommendations. This column focuses on three of these demands:

• Ensure that environmental permits granted are fixed for a period of no more than 3 years; and that renewals are dependent on a comprehensive transparent consultative process. The track record of companies awarded permits must comply with international best practice standards and norms and with the EPA’s own law and regulations.

• Ensure that all reports on type quantity frequency containment and classification of wastes and destinations to and from waste management facilities are complied with and made available to those communities directly affected workers and the Guyanese public.

• Publicize without delay all the companies that have environmental permits to receive handle store treat oil and gas wastes or operate mud plants and their waste management plans to ensure compliance with international best practices. Where these are deficient or absent we call for a stop notice / cease order until compliance is met subject to inspection by suitably qualified experts.

In light of the aforementioned recommendations we (and the Guyanese public) would like to know the status of ‘EPA-EMD2012HWRRF1R1 RECORDING AND REPORTING FORM OF HAZARDOUS WASTES (for New and Existing Operations)’. General instructions of this form state that it must be completed by the holder of an Environmental Authorization no later than forty-five days after the end of the operating year and should be prepared on activities relating to the previous calendar year along with any additional information requested and submitted to the EPA:

Specific Instructions for ‘Completing Form 3 Block B includes providing a description of the operation process identifying all hazardous materials/chemicals used within the operation process and the number of years the project has been operational’.

For Block C ‘providing information on hazardous materials/chemicals used in the life cycle of the project the type of hazardous material/chemicals used its hazardous physical and chemical characteristics and the quantity and type of storage used e.g. containers bags etc’.

For Block D ‘providing information on all types of hazardous wastes generated hazardous characteristics quantity of hazardous wastes generated physical characteristics chemical characteristics type of storage..’

For Block E ‘reporting of all spills information on the date of incident type and amount of waste spilled measures taken to mitigate incident treatment standards for waste data for off- site shipment of waste transporter and receiver details and location of off-site waste facility treatment standards for waste spilled (EPA recording and reporting form for hazardous waste for new and existing operations pages 57-60 in EEPGL’s Comprehensive Waste Management Report Oct 2021).

The Liza 1 oil field as far as we know started oil production in December 2019 and the Liza 2 oil field in February 2022. Estimated summaries of hazard waste generation & management methods given for the years 2020-2022 for Liza 1 and 2 show a combined estimated total of 15310 metric tonnes (33752772 lbs.) with an estimated 85% of these hazardous oil & gas wastes to be transported to onshore waste management facilities (this information can be found on pg. 59 table 2-6 Liza 1 EIA and pg. 2-51 table 2.12-8 Liza 2 EIA).

The EPA should have complied with its own obligations and submitted the required forms referred to above including that of companies such as Tiger Rental Services Sustainable Environmental Solutions (SES) Schlumberger Guyana Inc Saipem and Halliburton etc. Where are these reports and why have the findings of these reports not been made public as lawfully required?

The EPA has waived EIAs for most if not all of these waste management companies as no EIAs can be found on the EPA website. Neither are environmental permits for these same waste management companies available on the EPA website. This is in violation of the EPA Act Part 111- Establishment and Functions of Agency section 4 (3) e which calls for the EPA to “maintain and make available to members of the public during normal working hours a register of all…environmental authorisations granted and other information in accordance with section 36”.

As the frenzied pace and expansion of the oil and gas industry continues amounts of hazardous wastes generated will also significantly increase in volume. This in turn increases the risk to health safety and well-being of Guyanese workers communities and the environment. Needless to say meaningful community consultations and information sharing to directly affected communities are generally non-existent. Likewise there is an absence of independent monitoring and reporting on these facilities storing and transporting hazardous waste and toxic substances including radioactive sources located within longstanding residential communities or in very close proximity to same.

The Government’s recent recognition that the number of collisions by vessels with the Demerara Harbour Bridge and the substantial increase in river traffic from the oil and gas industry also increases the risk of spills of and contamination by hazardous waste and other toxic substances.

These risks constitute a clear and present danger and necessitate modern and robust regulatory frameworks with necessary capacities for full implementation. We urge this to be made a priority.

We note the increasingly horrifying impact of environmental cultural and social degradation and pollution on Indigenous communities from gold and manganese mining and the long-lasting and current impacts on the health and well-being of Guyanese in bauxite communities.

Guyana’s EPA Act specifically states the following:

(b) to promote the participation of members of the public in the process of integrating environmental concerns in planning for development on a sustainable basis;

(d) to establish monitor and enforce environmental regulations;

(e) to prevent or control environmental pollution;

(f) to co-ordinate an integrated coastal zone management programme;

(3) (a) Any person who may be affected by a project exempted under subsection (2) (a) may lodge an appeal with the Environmental Assessment Board established under section 18 within sixty days of the date of publication of the Agency’s decision and the Environmental Assessment Board shall within a reasonable time publish a decision confirming or setting aside the Agency’s decision.

The EPA’s trend of silence and apparent refusal to engage with citizens on a regular basis in meaningful consultations and continuous disclosure of information and public reporting is a violation of its mandate.

It is time for us Guyanese to take a stand against our communities serving as sacrifice zones for fossil fuels and extractive industries unscrupulous companies and state authorities that fail to act in accordance with the rule of law."

“An opportunity came up that I found very exciting” Vargas said.

Neither Vargas nor Rep. Dan Fox D-Stamford who is expecting a judicial nomination will take the oath of office Wednesday the first day of the 2023 session and the new two-year term.

State law prohibits a lawmaker from taking a position in another branch of government once they have begun a new term.

The departures of Vargas and Fox will leave the Democrats who won 98 seats in November with a 96-53 majority to begin the session. Their vacancies will be filled in special elections. Both seats are in safe Democratic districts.

Vargas who turns 74 on Wednesday is a former Hartford teacher union leader and Democratic chair in Hartford. He was elected to the first of his five terms in the House in 2012.

HARTFORD CT — A well-known and popular seafood restaurant in Hartford announced Tuesday morning it will soon be shutting down for good.

When that will happen however is not known though the owners said in a statement posted on Facebook that after nearly three decades ""we will be serving our last guests at the Chowder Pot of Hartford location in the coming months."" Located at 165 Brainerd Road Hartford the Chowder Pot of Hartford's been there since 1994 according to the owners and that site has a long history in the local dining scene as it first opened as a steakhouse in 1965.

Currently it is known as a prime New England seafood lobster and prime rib spot a destination eatery that is a regular birthday anniversary or holiday dining location. But the owners said it is time to close the facility and sell it to a developer at that location.

Restaurant officials cited the building's age and costs associated with maintaining the building as one key reason for the impending closure. ""After almost 60 years and millions of customers the location is showing its age"" wrote the Chowder Pot.

""Due to the age size and constant amount of work need to maintain this big old building combined with a new business wanting to make this property their home we have decided the right decision is to sell at this time."" Owners said Chowder Pot soups can still be bought in local markets and they are mulling the organization's next steps.

The Chowder Pot said it will update the announcement when an actual closing date is finalized. ""We hope to see you again at least one more time in the coming months"" wrote the Chowder Pot.

You can check out what the new and improved Clue looks like below and you can find the official description below as well.

""When six carefully chosen guests arrive at Boden 'Boddy' Black's mansion after receiving a mysterious invitation none are certain what to expect. But when their host turns up dead after revealing a sinister blackmail scheme at dinner the pressure is on to solve the mystery. This CLUE murder mystery game is beautifully reimagined with a dazzling cast luxurious setting and fresh storyline. Players can choose to play as Miss Scarlett Colonel Mustard Mayor Green Chef White Solicitor Peacock or Professor Plum and race against other players to crack the case by gathering evidence and narrowing down choices.

""For years the inspired mysteries of CLUE have excited fans across the globe through countless game night interrogations cult classic entertainment offerings and iconic pop culture fandom moments and today we have a game that more accurately reflects the diversity of its players"" said Adam Biehl SVP & General Manager Hasbro Gaming.

The new board sits at 20 by 20 inches and features an impressive depiction of the Tudor Mansion and the entire box is designed to recreate Boddy Black's desk featuring evidence he's acquired to blackmail others. The attention to detail also extends to the new murder weapon pieces which are now metal and intricately detailed with a gorgeous golden finish. The pawns are now fully sculpted character movers too so the Clue experience has been upgraded across the board.

Plus this is just the first in a line of big things coming to Clue and Hasbro is teasing the experience and stories will expand further through new games and virtual experiences so we'll just have to wait and see what comes next.

Jackie DeSouza-Van Blaricum began on Tuesday as president of HCA Healthcare Far West Division with oversight of eight hospitals and multiple health care facilities throughout Las Vegas and California.

Headquartered in the Las Vegas Valley the division encompasses the Sunrise Health System including Sunrise Sunrise Children’s Southern Hills and MountainView hospitals.

Van Blaricum 48 has been with HCA Healthcare for more than 20 years nearly half that time as a hospital CEO. Most recently she led Riverside Community Hospital in Riverside California for about four years. Before that she led Research Medical Center in Kansas City Missouri for five years.

“My big aspiration is bringing world-class care close to home” Van Blaricum said in an interview Tuesday. “I think everybody deserves that opportunity to have world-class care in their backyard. … And I also want to work with our leaders to create the best places for people to work.”

Key to both goals is recruitment and retention of nurses and doctors in the face of ongoing nationwide staffing shortages.

“Having strong cultures allows us to continue to retain our colleagues and to recruit additional top talent to our organizations” she said.

Van Blaricum the first Latina to lead the division said she is a “big believer in our diversity and inclusion initiatives making sure people have a voice doing a lot of learning and listening and then rolling out various different strategies and tactics that come from our colleagues and our physicians who are at the bedside.”

The Far West Division works with nursing colleges to create a “pipeline for nurse interns so that ultimately they can become residents and then permanent parts of our team” she said.

It also has residency programs for training doctors with the hope of retaining them.

“We see that as both a challenge and an opportunity” she said.

National Group President Tim McManus said in a news release “Jackie is an engaging healthcare leader who is well-respected by patients colleagues and physicians. We’re all excited about the fresh perspective grounded by her hard work and operational excellence that she brings to the Far West Division.”

The Far West Division has a network of eight hospitals one pediatric hospital four freestanding emergency room locations 17 CareNow Urgent Care locations 11 ambulatory surgery centers 11 outpatient practices and 29 graduate medical education and fellowship programs.

In total HCA Healthcare has a network of 182 hospitals and more than 2300 sites of care in 20 states and the United Kingdom.

Van Blaricum said she firmly believes in HCA Healthcare’s mission.

“Above all else we’re committed to the care and improvement of human life” she said. “And for me those aren’t just words on paper. But that’s really important that we translate our values into actions to deliver on that mission.”

She said she saw this in practice last week in the compassion and respect that the Riverside hospital showed to the family and fellow officers of a deputy sheriff who died after being shot during a traffic stop. And she saw it as Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center prepared for a possible influx of patients on New Year’s Eve which turned out to be a calm night in Las Vegas.

The daughter of a pulmonary critical care physician father and a conservationist mother Van Blaricum grew up in northern Virginia outside of Washington D.C. She received a bachelor’s degree from James Madison University in Virginia and a master’s degree in health care administration and management from Virginia Commonwealth University. She began with HCA as an administrative resident.

She sees an opportunity to demonstrate that anything’s possible “through hard work a lot of grit and tenacity and being very mission-driven and that’s ultimately what my parents taught me and I’m proud of that fact” she said. “I very much believe in our supporting and growing others in our organization for them to achieve their goals.”

Van Blaricum’s husband and two teenage daughters plan to join her in Las Vegas after the end of the school year in Riverside.

“We’re excited about this new adventure” she said.

New Orleans-based Tulane Medical Center; Covington La.-based Lakeview Regional Medical Center; and Metairie La.-based Tulane Lakeside Hospital are now part of LCMC Health bringing the nonprofit system's hospitals to a total of nine.

The transactions are part of a new partnership between LCMC Health and Tulane University both based in New Orleans. LCMC Health plans to make a $220 million investment into the three newly acquired hospitals for new equipment facilities and provider recruitment and integrate facilities over the next two years including the shift of services at Tulane Medical Center to nearby East Jefferson General Hospital in Metairie La. and University Medical Center New Orleans.

The deal's finalization comes despite pushback from nurses represented by National Nurses United who petitioned for Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry to block the deal. They argued the transaction could leave patient beds in New Orleans at risk in a city ""with a healthcare duopoly held by LCMC Health and [New Orleans-based] Ochsner Health System which would likely result in an increase in healthcare costs to the community.""

I had always heard of Hadassah of course. A lot of members of our Greater Boston Jewish community are deeply connected to Hadassah are members of the leadership team locally nationally and internationally of Hadassah. I had seen the Chagall windows on various Israel missions. But living many hours a day at Hadassah as a daughter of a patient has given me a glimpse of the Jewish people and of the Jewish state that I had never seen before. As we enter the secular new year here are four learnings from Hadassah that can inspire us to aspire higher.

All Jews Are Interconnected—Kol Yisrael Arevim Zeh Bazeh

My father was at Hadassah all eight days and all eight nights of Hanukkah. Candle-lighting in the community room of the oncology floor was something you have to see to believe. Members of a very traditional Hasidic sect Toldos Aharon who have lived in Jerusalem for many generations gathered with Chabad emissaries secular Israelis my father and whoever happened to be on the floor to bless to light to sing together. One Hasidic gentleman kindly helped my father light. Outside of the hospital it is hard to imagine Toldos Aharon Chabad secular Jews and a Conservative Rabbi praying working and celebrating together. The hospital reminds us of the mortality and vulnerability we all share. Perhaps that is why in the hospital the hard edges that keep us apart soften so that we can see each other’s shared humanity. But why do we have to wait for the existential wake-up call that is a hospital?

What can we do in 2023 to see and value fellow Jews we usually do not see and value?

All Human Beings Are Created B’tzelem Elohim—in God’s Image

Hadassah not only brings out the best in Jews who see and value one another. It also brings out the best in human beings from an array of backgrounds who would never interact outside of the hospital but who do so beautifully in the hospital. Doctors nurses patients the cleaning crew the food and beverages crew come from so many corners of Israeli society: Jewish and Arab secular and modern Orthodox and Haredi men and women and every day they see respond and work with one another intuitively. One doctor who wears a kippah always asks my father for a d’var Torah. A second doctor is secular. The PT guy is an Arab Israeli. The nursing care was helpful and compassionate whether the nurses were Arab Israeli or Jewish Israeli. Why do we have to wait for a hospital stay to see and value one another’s humanity in the presence of our difference?

What can we do in 2023 to connect with other human beings whom we have not in the past had anything to do with?

Kindness (Chesed) Really Matters. The Little Things Are the Big Things

A cavalcade of grace lit up my father’s otherwise long and gray days. Folks would come by with sufganiyot (Israeli jelly donuts) chocolate gelt freshly squeezed fruit juices freshly made blintzes and freshly baked cheesecake. All just to do a favor for a sick man. Sadly my father did not have much appetite during his hospital stay. So it was usually Wes and me who ate all this food. But the gesture of kindness landed profoundly. Why do we have to wait for a hospital stay to do that little act that feels big to the person who receives it?

What little deed can we do in 2023 to make somebody’s day?

Shabbat Is Just So Beautiful

Anyone who has ever been to Jerusalem knows the feeling of tranquility that settles in on Friday afternoon. Stores close. Traffic slows. Honking disappears replaced by quiet on the streets. You can feel the holiness of Shabbat coming in. It is palpable. The same is true of Hadassah. Friday is a slow day. Shabbat is a very slow day. The hustle and bustle the non-stop energy give way to peace and calm. All the stores that cater to all the patients and their families are closed. The holiness of the day felt inimitably powerful in the hardness of a hospital. A little more tranquility a little more peace and calm in the presence of life’s hard realities feels helpful.

What can we do to add more Shabbat to our lives?

After nine long days my Dad went home today. I hope the lessons of Hadassah will stay with me for a good long time.",,,,,,,,,,,,

12 SHARES

Posted: 4 January 2023 | Grace Galler |

US confectionery company Hershey’s has been sued due to the alleged presence of “harmful” levels of metals in its chocolate.

US confectionery giant Hershey’s has been sued following claims that the company is selling products containing “harmful” levels of metal.

The lawsuit was instigated by Christopher Lazazzaro who claimed that The Hershey Company was “failing to disclose the quantities of lead and cadmium” in three different types of its chocolate bars. These include Hershey’s Special Dark Mildly Sweet Chocolate and two Lily’s bars: Lily’s Extra Dark Chocolate 70 percent Cocoa and Lily’s Extreme Dark Chocolate bars (both owned by The Hershey’s Company).

Filed on 28 December 2022 in a federal court in New York the lawsuit has the objective of “seek[ing] to remedy the deceptive and misleading business practices of The Hershey Company”.

The rising popularity of Hershey’s

According to Statista the US is the leading world market for confectionery of any kind however the US cocoa and chocolate market alone is estimated to be worth $9.67 billion dollars.

Looking specifically at Hershey’s chocolate Michael Buck The Hershey Company President and Chief Executive Officer explained that 2022 was a fruitful year for the company stating that “third quarter results came in and exceeded our expectations”.

The Hershey Company has reported that its consolidated net sales in 2022 were $2728.2 million which was a reported increase of 15.6 percent from the previous year.

Health concerns over metals

Although there are studies to suggest that dark chocolate specifically is rich in antioxidants that can improve heart health and other conditions a recent study by Consumer Reports has claimed that some dark chocolate bars contain cadmium and lead which it says can be linked to health problems in children and adults.

The Consumer Reports study linked 23 chocolate bars from various brands to high levels of these metals. It also claimed that eating just an ounce a day (of one of these 23 bars) would put an adult over a level that public health authorities and Consumer Reports’s experts state “may be harmful for at least one of those heavy metals”. Additionally the report states that five of the 23 bars had “high” levels of both cadmium and lead suggesting that eating them could cause multiple health concerns.

The lawsuit was filed in New York on 28 December by Christopher Lazazzaro who claims he would not have bought Hershey’s Special Dark Mildly Sweet Chocolate Lily’s Extra Dark Chocolate 70% Cocoa or Lily’s Extreme Dark Chocolate 85% Cocoa had the company disclosed its metals content.

The suit came two weeks after Consumer Reports published the results of its scientific testing on 28 dark chocolate bars for lead and cadmium.

The article reported that 23 bars including from Dove Godiva Lindt and Trader Joe’s contained potentially harmful levels of lead and cadmium. Hershey’s Special Dark bar and Lily’s 70% bar were reportedly high in lead and Lily’s 85% bar was high in lead and cadmium exceeding California standards for the maximum allowable dose level (MADL) for both metals.

Lazazzaro said that consumers would be turned off by such levels because they pose a “serious health risk”. He also claims that Hershey’s advertising and marketing are “false deceptive and misleading” because they do not disclose information about these potentially harmful metals.

The lawsuit seeks $5 million of damages including at least $500 per transaction under the New York law.

In reporting year-end results Petronas said its 2022 exploration campaign had discovered 10 new hydrocarbon prospects: eight off the coast of Sarawak and one each off the coasts of Sabah and Peninsular Malaysia.

Out of awards made in Malaysia’s 2022 licensing round 16 wells were completed with two more in progress at year end. That was double the activity in 2021 Petronas Senior Vice President of Malaysia Petroleum Management (MPM) Mohamed Firouz Asnan noted in a press release.

“Most of the discoveries can be quickly monetized at a lower cost given their proximity to the extensive network of existing infrastructure” Firouz Asnan commented in a news release. Petronas said it expects production-sharing contracts (PSC) to be signed in February followed by the launch of a 2023 bid round on further exploration targets.

Petronas Senior General Manager of Resource Exploration MPM Azmir Zamri said that Malaysia’s 2023 campaign anticipates that up to 30 more exploration wells could be drilled potentially exceeding 2022 results.

The company’s own exploration and production subsidiary Petronas Carigali made the largest oil discovery in 2022 at the Nahara-1 well in Block SK306 within Sarawak’s Balingian province.

Other discoveries were announced in Sarawak’s Central Luconia Western Luconia and Baram provinces which are among Malaysia’s most prolific basins and home to many gas fields.

Among the finds:



Shell’s discoveries at the Inai-1 and Temu-1 wells in the MLNG Block in Central Luconia.

Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Energy struck more gas inBlock SK320 at the Cengkih-1 well.

In the emerging province of Western Luconia ConocoPhillips drilled three exploration wells in Block WL4-00 and discovered gas at the Gagau-1 well while the Salam-3 and Benum-2 wells confirmed the extension of oil and gas accumulations in adjacent fault blocks.

In the matured Baram province Thailand’s PTTEP made another gas discovery in Block SK410B through the Paprika-1 well where the giant Lang Lebah field was also discovered in 2019.

In ultradeepwater Sabah TotalEnergies made an oil and gas discovery at the Tepat-2 well in Block N within the emerging Sabah Trough province further proving the extent of the earlier oil and gas discovery of Tepat-1 in 2018.

Off the coast of Peninsular Malaysia Hess found a new gas reservoir at the Bergading Deep-4 well in Block PM302 within the North Malay Basin.

Commenting on its discovery at Cengkih-1 Mubadala noted in a separate press release that preliminary analysis showed a significant gas column of more than 110 m within the pinnacle carbonate reef reservoir.

The Cengkih-1 exploration well is located near the Pegaga field which is within the SK320 Block and recently began to produce commercial quantities of gas. The Pegaga field recorded the discovery of 1 Tcf of additional gas in place following the post-drill results which confirmed a larger and better-quality reservoir according to Mubadala.

Mubadala Energy operates Block SK320 with a 55% participating interest in the PSC. Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd and Sarawak Shell Berhad hold the remaining 45%. Mubadala Energy has made six gas discoveries since entering Malaysia in 2010 and represents a 75% success ratio the company reported.

Malaysia’s quest to grow its resource base supports its ambitions as a global LNG producer. It was the fifth-largest global exporter of LNG in 2021 and its national oil and gas company Petronas ranked 4th among companies in LNG storage capacity as of July 2022 bested only by QatarEnergy Cheniere Energy and Shell which occupy first through third place respectively according to Statistica.

Malaysia was Japan’s second-biggest LNG supplier 2021 providing about 10 million tons according to Japanese trade data quoted by Reuters. Malaysia delivered 50 cargoes to Japan from October through December that year.

Boasting a capacity of 25.7 mtpa the Malaysia LNG project is one of the largest LNG facilities in a single location in the world according to Mitsubishi which is a partner in the project which supplies not only Japan but also South Korea Taiwan and China.

Meanwhile Petronas subsidiary Petronas Petróleo Brasil Ltda. (PPBL) and its partners won the Agua Marinha exploration block during the first cycle of Brazil’s open acreage under a production-sharing regime bid in Rio de Janeiro in December.

PPBL will hold a 20% participating interest in the block located in the Campos Basin with Brazil’s Petrobras (30%) as the operator TotalEnergies (30%) and QatarEnergy (20%).

PPBL recently announced the first oil discovery at the 4-BRSA-1386D-RJS well in the pre-salt Sépia oil field in the Santos Basin. It has a 21% participating interest in the field the company said in a news release.

PPBL also holds participating interests in the Tartaruga Verde (BM-C-36 Concession) and Module III of the Espadarte (Espadarte Concession) deepwater fields as well as three deepwater exploration blocks C-M-541 C-M-661 and C-M-715 in the Campos Basin.

Starting immediately Equinix will begin to define a multi-year global roadmap for thermal operations within its data centers aimed at achieving significantly more efficient cooling and decreased carbon impacts all while continuing to deliver the premium operating environment Equinix is known for.

Over time this initiative is expected to enable thousands of Equinix customers to reduce the Scope 3 carbon emissions associated with their data center operations as supply chain sustainability becomes an increasingly important part of the overall environmental initiatives of today’s businesses.

IT equipment within data centers including routers servers and storage arrays emit high levels of heat that requires data centers to be fitted with robust cooling systems to remove that heat. “Most datacenters operate within restrictive temperature and humidity bands resulting in environments that are unnecessarily cooler than required” says Rob Brothers Program Vice President Datacenter Services IDC. “Equinix will work with enterprises to change the way we think about operating temperatures within datacenter environments and how the industry can ensure optimal service levels for mission-critical digital infrastructure while improving data center efficiencies. With this initiative Equinix will play a key role in driving change in the industry and help shape the overall sustainability story we all need to participate in.”

“As a long-time partner we are pleased to see that Equinix is driving efficient data center operations through smart sustainable operating practices” says Sue Preston vice president and general manager Advisory and Professional Services Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). “Optimizing data center temperatures results in more efficient operations benefitting businesses and the planet. Through the HPE GreenLake alliance both HPE and Equinix offer a comprehensive cloud-smart and sustainable customer solution.”

As a part of this new efficiency initiative Equinix expects to operate its facilities closer to 27°C (80°F) aligning operating limits across its global data center portfolio with the globally accepted boundaries of the A1A standards from the American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). When combined with existing Equinix initiatives such as optimizing the use of outside air temperatures to cool its data centers this new initiative will contribute to the overall sustainability of its data centers through efficiency improvements measured through Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE). PUE represents the total amount of power being used by a data center divided by the power used to run the IT equipment within the data center providing an industry standard for data center energy efficiency.

“Our cooling systems account for approximately 25% of our total energy usage globally” says Raouf Abdel Executive Vice President Global Operations for Equinix. “With this new initiative we can intelligently adjust the thermostat in our data centers in the same way that consumers do in their homes. Once rolled out across our current global data center footprint we anticipate energy efficiency improvements of as much as 10% in various locations.”

“Data centers are critical to our daily lives housing the equipment and interconnecting the businesses that fuel our digital lives – from online shopping to sending emails to streaming movies and video calls” says Jon Lin Executive Vice President and General Manager Data Center Services for Equinix. “As more than 10000 businesses globally rely on Equinix’s digital infrastructure it plays a critical role in their supply chains. This initiative once deployed has the potential to significantly benefit these businesses as they seek to reduce the Scope 3 carbon emissions in their supply chain to meet their overall climate targets. It marks an important step in our comprehensive sustainability program and our climate-neutral commitment.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vcHJlc3MuaHAuY29tL3VzL2VuL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzLzIwMjMvaHBhdGNlcy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP at CES 2023: Leading in Hybrid and Gaming Experiences,"©Copyright 2023 HP Development Company L.P.

While perhaps best known for its enthusiast workstation and gaming motherboard and graphics products Gigabyte is no stranger to the server and datacenter arena. Alongside consumer-focused boards Gigabyte also operates as an original design manufacturer developing components like motherboards for OEMs and producing white box systems for cloud and hyperscale customers.

Among Gigabyte’s more notable customers is Yandex – also known as the Google of Russia. However Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine may have thrown a wrench in that deal.

According to Gigabyte spinning off Giga Computing won’t have a material impact on day-to-day operations. The new company will be owned in its entirety by Gigabyte after all and they about say as much. The good news for existing customers is this means there shouldn’t be any disruptions to service and or procurement. Gigabyte claims the newly formed subsidiary will continue to maintain and support all existing enterprise products and solutions.

Instead it appears Gigabyte’s decision to form Giga Computing may have been an effort to separate its concerns and allow the parent company to focus its energy on consumer electronics like GPUs laptops desktops and other PC components. Based on their finances this makes a lot of sense. The company’s motherboard and graphics business accounted for roughly three-quarters of their annual revenues in 2021.

The move mirrors that of other prominent OEMs whose logos span the consumer and enterprise spaces. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s 2015 split from HP which makes PCs and printers springs to mind. However whereas HPE was already a leading OEM at the time Gigabyte is not. With that said it is obvious the company sees Giga Computing as means to changing that.

In its most recent annual earnings report Gigabyte emphasized a desire to move beyond its ODM business and deeper into the channel end market. In a June financial filing Gigabyte took its first step towards going just that revealing its plans to spin off its Netcom business as Giga Computing Technology Co. with the express goal of improving “the competitiveness and operating performance” of its server and networking business unit.

But the company has a long way to go. Despite the fact Giga Computing is valued at approximately NT$833600000 or about $27 million adjusting for exchange rates. The wholly owned Gigabyte subsidiary didn’t make the list of top server OEMs or ODMs in IDC’s latest server market report. In an email to The Next Platform IDC says Gigabyte’s share of the ODM-Direct market is less than 1 percent.

In 2021 Gigabyte reported revenues of approximately $4 billion however only a fraction of that was from server sales. Gigabyte classifies its Netcom business under approximately $1 billion of “other” revenues which in addition to servers includes its laptop and peripheral business. However some estimates put Gigabyte’s server biz in the neighborhood of 25 percent of revenues – or just shy of $800 million a year.

Based on IDCs figures that would make Giga Computing less than half the size of Inventec’s server business ($2.1 billion) and about a third the size of Supermicro’s server businesses ($2.5 billion).

While Giga Computing may not be the biggest player in the server space it is also not the smallest and the company has been keen to push next-gen computing platforming. Last year Gigabyte announced a flurry of high-performance compute AI and communications platforms running on everything from your standard X86 fare from AMD and Intel to more exotic systems using Nvidia A100 and AMD’s MI250 GPU accelerators as well as Arm-based systems using Ampere’s Altra and Altra Max CPUs.

The company has also embraced next-gen cooling tech including direct liquid cooled GPU servers and both single- and two-phase immersion cooling tanks. The latter tech submerges server chassis in a vat of non-conductive fluids – typically a synthetic oil from Exxon or Castrol or specialized refrigerants from the likes of 3M.

The company is clearly determined to carve out a niche as demand for systems grows more diverse and specialized."

A view of the beach from my hotel room at Hilton's Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort. Emily Hochberg/Insider

Before I arrived in Honolulu I didn't realize that the city's prominent beach Waikiki Beach is only two miles long and actually comprised of seven different beaches including Kahanamoku/Hilton Hawaiian Village Fort DeRussy Gray's Beach and several others such as Royal Hawaiian Beach which is the main area known as Waikiki Beach.

Given that the hotel has Waikiki Beach in the name I was surprised that it did not front the same stretch of sand bearing that name.

While technically part of the area that makes up Waikiki Beach the Hilton directly faces Kahanamoku Beach and Fort DeRussy Beach which is about a 20-minute walk away from the main section of Waikiki Beach in front of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

For me this turned out to be an unexpected boon. I thought the area in front of the Hilton was calm and cove-like with gentle waves and while I did notice people filling in on the sand throughout the day it never felt overcrowded.

Later on in my trip I stayed at the Royal Hawaiian on Waikiki Beach proper and did not have the same experience. There I found the waves to be larger and the beach more densely packed with people at all times. The Hilton's location by contrast felt like a secret I stumbled onto seemingly by accident.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvdHJhdmVsLWlzLXJlYm91bmRpbmctY2FuLXRoZXNlLTItaG90ZWwtc3RvY2tzLW91dHBlcmZvcm3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travel is Rebounding.

Hotels stocks including the two giants in the space Marriott International Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) have already rebounded significantly with their revenues and profits surging over the past year. Nevertheless their shares may not be worth holding into 2023 as they already appear quite overpriced.

From the Ditch to Record Profits

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit it adversely impacted travel of course. One of the outcomes among others was a severe decline in demand for hotel rooms as people canceled their business and holiday travel plans. Hotels saw a substantial drop in occupancy rates revenues and profits with many even forced to temporarily close their doors. Shares of Marriott International and Hilton Worldwide Holdings which are by far the two largest companies in the field slumped at the time.

However hotel companies are currently experiencing a tremendous improvement in their performance. For context in its most recent Q3-2022 earnings report Hilton recorded revenues of $2.37 billion up 35.4% year-over-year. Increased demand for lodging led to system-wide comparable RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) growing 29.9% on a currency-neutral basis. Margins expanded as the company scaled causing adjusted EBITDA to jump by an even more impressive rate of 41% to $732 million.

Marriott also recorded an equally impressive surge in Q3 revenues in its case by 34.7% to $5.31 billion. Revenue growth was driven by system-wide constant dollar RevPAR growth of 36.3% worldwide and similar to Hilton a margin expansion pushed adjusted EBITDA to $985 million up 44.2% compared to last year.

Due to cost-cutting measures the two companies took during the pandemic combined with such a fierce spike in revenues Marriott and Hilton are set to achieve record profits this year. Analysts expect Hilton to report earnings per share of $4.53 for the year up 118% compared to Fiscal 2021 while Marriott is expected to achieve earnings per share of $6.53 up 105% compared to last year. Who would have thought a couple of years ago when hotels were totally lifeless that they would so soon return to report record earnings.

What to Consider When Valuing MAR and HLT

When it comes to valuing Hilton and Marriott we have to consider the value of their brands. If you are not familiar with the two companies you may assume that it’s a good idea to value them through their book value. After all they are hotel chains and they own real estate – thus book value sounds like the appropriate metric.

However the truth is that both Marriott and Hilton own only a fraction of the actual real estate assets. Instead both companies leverage their brands to collect licensing and management fees operating an asset-light business model. For instance out of 8162 Marriott properties the company owns only 64! Meanwhile 6029 and 1959 of its properties are franchised and managed respectively.

Therefore despite the real-estate nature of their operations it’s not necessarily the right move to value these companies via their book value. This also explains why both companies appear to be so insanely profitable with massive EBITDA margins based on the numbers shared earlier. It’s because they receive frictionless high-margin royalties.

In this case the traditional P/E ratio will do just fine. Based on Marriott’s and Hilton’s expected earnings per share for 2022 as mentioned earlier the two companies essentially trade at P/E ratios of around 28x and 23x respectively. The higher premium on Marriott is due to investors expecting faster bottom-line growth in the coming years. In fact both companies are expected to grow earnings per share quite aggressively (above mid-teens percentages) which somewhat justifies these multiples.

Nevertheless I find these multiples pricy in a rising-rates environment especially considering a recession in 2023 is not unlikely which could significantly slow down travel reversing analysts’ expectations in terms of future earnings growth.

Is MAR Stock a Buy According to Analysts?

Turning to Wall Street Marriott International has a Hold consensus rating based on two Buys eight Holds and one Sell assigned in the past three months. At $171.75 the average Marriott International price target implies 16.5% upside potential.

Is HLT Stock a Buy According to Analysts?

As far as Hilton Worldwide Holdings goes the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on four Buys and six Holds assigned in the past three months. At $146.56 the average Hilton Worldwide Holding price target implies 17.5% upside potential.

Takeaway – Decent Lodging Picks but Risks Remain

Both Marriott and Hilton appear to be decent picks in the lodging industry but their investment cases are not without risks. While their financials have rebounded quickly so have their shares. At their current prices the market is essentially pricing that the industry will have a tremendous 2023 and 2024 which is quite uncertain given the tough macro environment.

Additionally there’s also the factor of gradually changing preferences for accommodations to consider. In recent years there has been a trend towards alternative styles of accommodations including unique vacation rentals (e.g. Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB)) and boutique hotels. These alternatives could continue capturing a bigger market share as travelers increasingly value privacy more space and unique experiences over traditional hotels. Consequently traditional lodging could face increased pressure in the coming years which could also negatively affect the performance of Marriott and Hilton.

Throughout the trees’ typical lifespan of eight to 12 years it absorbs carbon dioxide emits fresh oxygen stabilizes soil protects water supplies and provides refuge for wildlife.

After a Christmas tree is cut down one to three seedlings are planted in its place. When people purchase them they also support local economies. That environmental stewardship continues when trees are recycled.

Recycled trees have multiple uses. Some are turned into mulch used for community playgrounds parks and homes. Others are added to lakes and used as habitats for fish and underwater life. Additionally recycling eliminates the costly process of adding additional debris to landfills.

The week of January 5 is the most popular time to drop off Christmas trees at a recycling site. Check with your local Home Depot store to see if it’s recycling Christmas trees. If not check out Earth 911 to find a program nearby.

All of his picks are listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

""These companies tend to make things or do stuff at a profit while returning capital to shareholders all with reasonably priced stocks — exactly the rubric for what worked once the [Federal Reserve] declared war on inflation"" Cramer said.

Here is his list:

Chevron

Cramer said he believes the company will have a great year as long as crude prices stay above $60.

Honeywell

He said he's bullish on the stock because it has several divisions that could be spun off to make Honeywell more focused on more profitable businesses.

Procter & Gamble

The company is the best of the bunch when it comes to recession-proof stocks according to Cramer.

Travelers Companies

He said the company is one of his favorite insurance plays.

Johnson & Johnson

The company has one of the best and fastest-growing pharma businesses according to Cramer.

Disney

He said that he's bullish on the stock since CEO Bob Iger returned to the helm.

American Express

He said that American Express is a ""tremendous bounce-back stock"" that also sells at a reasonable price.

Cisco

Cramer said that the company has proved it can perform well going forward and it's only a matter of time before Wall Street catches on.

Salesforce

The peaking U.S. dollar will likely help Salesforce's balance sheet he said adding that he also likes the company's ""gigantic cash flow excellent cash in the till and more than 20% growth.""

Goldman Sachs

Cramer predicted that the company will likely perform better this year than last year even though IPOs mergers and acquisitions are unlikely to make a comeback in 2023 as the economic environment remains turbulent.

In the New Administrative Capital that is taking shape in the desert lamp-posts double up as WiFi hotspots key cards grant access to buildings and more than 6000 surveillance cameras keep watch over the first of its 6.5 million residents.

A single mobile app allows the city’s inhabitants to make utility payments access public services and register complaints with the authorities.

Some people think such features will make everyday life easier and safer but digital rights experts say the potential for surveillance is a threat to basic rights amid a broader crackdown on dissent and free speech during Sisi’s 10-year rule.

“Planting surveillance cameras across the city gives authorities an unparalleled ability to police public spaces and crack down on citizens who wish to protest or exercise their right to peaceful assembly” said Marwa Fatafta a Policy Manager at digital rights group Access Now.

OPINION: Decline of the Tigris spells doom for Iraq fishermen

“This is quite dangerous in a country where civic space has been under massive attack” she added.

A spokesman for the government did not respond to a request for comment about such concerns.

Similar smart city projects from Abu Dhabi to Tunisia set out to integrate advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence sensors facial recognition and machine learning to fight crime increase efficiency and improve governance.

But they rely on the mass collection and processing of personal data typically without the knowledge or consent of users leading to greater surveillance rights groups say.

The risk is higher in places with authoritarian governments Fatafta said.

“The Egyptian government is selling its New Administrative Capital as a smart city where people can have a better life quality – but in reality they are building a surveillance city” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Suspicious People

The New Administrative Capital is one of about a dozen new smart cities projects in Egypt and is spread across 700 sq km (270 sq miles). Housing ministries financial institutions and foreign embassies its surveillance system is developed by US company Honeywell.

A command and control centre for the camera network can run “sophisticated video analytics to monitor crowds and traffic congestion detect incidents of theft observe suspicious people or objects and trigger automated alarms in emergency situations” Honeywell said in a statement in 2019.

Government officials can access live feeds of the camera network from the centre it said without specifying which ones.

OPINION: Egypt farmers fear rising social tensions over scarce water

Honeywell will use “advanced Internet of Things (IoT) software and hardware solutions for a holistic city view that provides unified public safety services coordinating security response units city police and medical dispatch” it said at the time. It has not issued updates on the project since.

Honeywell’s North Africa president Khaled Hashem and Khaled Abbas – Chairman of the Administrative Capital for Urban Development – did not respond to requests for comments.

Honeywell sells mass surveillance systems worldwide but providing the technology to the Egyptian government is “impossible to defend morally” said Tony Roberts a digital rights expert and research fellow at London’s Institute of Development Studies citing the country’s human rights record.

“Egyptian citizens have the right to privacy and to freedom of opinion and association. However the state jails and tortures journalists and political opposition figures using surveillance information against them” he said.

Officials have said the surveillance technology is aimed at detecting crime and enhancing safety and that data will be protected by Egyptian law and international standards.

Surveillance Violations

There has been a rapid expansion of surveillance technologies across Africa in recent years with systems supplied by companies based in the United States China and Europe research has shown.

In Kenya and South Africa where the media and courts are relatively free civil society has been able to hold governments accountable and secure some reforms to surveillance practices according to the African Digital Rights Network.

In Kenya for example the high court in 2020 ordered the government to introduce stronger regulations for a new digital identity scheme and said it could not be used to collect citizens’ DNA and geo-location data.

But in Egypt and Sudan where the media and courts are largely controlled by the government surveillance practices go unchecked said Roberts who has authored two recent reports on the use of surveillance tools in African nations.

Egypt has faced repeated questions about human rights under Sisi a former military leader and participants at last year’s UN climate summit in Egypt complained that they were being spied on by the official mobile app.

“We found that governments are routinely violating privacy rights by committing mass surveillance on their citizens – and that they do so with impunity” Roberts said.

“Even when they are caught there have been no prosecutions or anyone losing their jobs over surveillance violations.”

Not something new

At the New Administrative Capital located about 45 km (28 miles) east of Cairo officials and residents have begun moving in – even as many Cairo residents say they cannot afford to live in the new city.

For Ahmed Ibrahim a software engineer who bought an apartment in a high-rise block in the new city the surveillance system is not worrisome – it is just another high-tech feature.

“What’s wrong with having cameras across the city to monitor violations and eliminate crime?” he said.

“I trust the government. The systems will make life much easier for us as residents.”

But for other residents the surveillance system is worrisome.

“Such systems are in effect in many places around the world. But when it comes to countries with repression problems like Egypt it becomes worrying” said Heba Ahmed 33 who plans to move to the new city with her family soon.

“Nobody would want to be monitored and have their private life exposed” she said.

By Bryan Corliss

Jan. 4 2023 © Leeham News: Some aerospace suppliers say the industry is dealing with a shortage of production workers as well as engineers. Airbus Boeing and other manufacturers including engine companies complain they can’t get to desired production rates because of in part a labor shortage.

It’s part of a broader phenomenon across all manufacturing with one industry group saying there’s an immediate need for 2.1 million factory workers right now.

In some circumstances this has meant raising wages. In Wichita the “Aerospace Capital of the World” there’s a bidding war going on for skilled aerospace mechanics. In Puget Sound Boeing had to go back to the bargaining table with the Machinists Union in 2019 to negotiate $4-an-hour pay increases for entry-level workers. In Charleston (SC) Boeing reportedly struggles with a higher-than-normal attrition rate as workers leave for higher-paying jobs.



It seems inevitable that the lack of experienced workers will make it harder for companies to deliver parts and finished goods on time and the absolute need to raise pay will cut into margins. Both these factors could very well be a drag on profits even as airlines clamor for new aircraft that will increase manufacturers’ revenues.

Summary:

Analysts warn of 'labor headwinds'

Spirit faced with 'dynamic' labor environment

Boeing: 100 new mechanics a week?

New-hire pay about the same as retail

High turnover causes supply chain problems

‘HPE is going to get bunch of cash - yet to be defined how much that is – the question is what are they going to do with that cash?’ says Future Tech CEO Bob Venero. ‘Will it be to acquire another company or double down on their cloud services business?’

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Tuesday said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it intends to sell its 49 percent stake in its H3C Chinese enterprise IT joint venture.

H3C is the exclusive provider of HPE servers storage and associated IT technical services in China.

HPE owns a 49 percent share in the company while Chinese company Unisplendour Corp. owns a 51 percent share.

id unit-1659132512259 type Sponsored post

The H3C sale could provide a financial windfall for HPE that could be used for acquisitions or other activities.

[Related: HPE Says ‘There Are No Discussions With Nutanix’]

Financial advisory firm UBS in a research note estimated the value of HPE’s 49 percent equity stake at $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion on a pre-tax basis or $2.50-$2.70 per HPE share after-tax.

“While we expect some debt repayment and share buybacks given the recent press reports that HPE was interested in acquiring Nutanix we believe HPE could use a large percentage of the proceeds to pursue a strategic transaction” UBS said in the research note. UBS said given the steps required to close the deal it does not expect HPE to receive 100 percent of the proceeds until late in fiscal year 2023 which ends Oct. 31.

The joint venture was formed in 2015 and at the time was valued at $4.5 billion (net of cash and debt).

The HPE H3C shares will be sold at a price per share of 15 times the profit of H3C as measured for the period ending April 30 2022 divided by the total number of H3C share outstanding at the time.

Under the terms of the joint venture HPE is expected to announce a purchase price within 30 days.

HPE shares were trading up four cents to $16 at mid-day.

The HPE H3C joint venture has allowed HPE to successfully compete in the fast-growing China-based enterprise IT market.

HPE has said H3C equity interest rose three percent in fiscal year 2022 to $265 million.

HPE Chief Financial Officer Tarek Robbiati told analysts in a December earnings call that H3C has contributed a “substantial amount” to earnings per share and free cash flow in fiscal year 2022.

“We will balance the strategic and financial benefits of a continuous involvement in China with rising risks including geopolitical risk” said Robbiati in the call. “We will keep you up to date as we arrive at a longer-term solution for this asset.”

Bob Venero CEO of Future Tech Fort Lauderdale Fla.-based Palo Alto Networks partner No. 95 on the CRN 2022 Solution Provider 500 praised HPE’s decision to sell its 49 percent stake in the joint venture in the wake of geopolitical issues.

“I think its a good thing that they divest this business on the heels of everything that has happened in China from a geopolitical perspective” said Venero. “HPE is going to get bunch of cash - yet to be defined how much that is – the question is what are they going to do with that cash? Will it be to acquire another company or double down on their cloud services business? It is going to be interesting to see how much cash they get and what they do with the cash.”

The original joint venture was set up by then-Hewlett Packard CEO Meg Whitman in 2015 with Tsinghua Holdings subsidiary Unisplendour Corp. purchasing a 51 percent stake in H3C at a $2.3 billion price tag.

The HPE decision to sell its 49 percent stake comes just two weeks after Foxconn the world‘s largest contract electronics maker based in Taiwan said its subsidiary in China has agreed to sell its entire equity stake in Chinese chip conglomerate Tsinghua Unigroup.

Taiwan‘s government in turn said it would fine Foxconn for an unauthorised investment in the Chinese chip maker.

In 2015 H3C had 8000 employees and $3.1 billion in annual revenue made up of a complete portfolio of enterprise IT solutions including networking servers storage and services.

HPE said it intends to consider the most appropriate use of such proceeds in line with its “practice of pursuing a balanced returns-based approach for capital allocation decisions.”

Among the range of allocation activities for the cash include – but are not limited to- “organic and strategic investments return of capital to shareholders repayment and/or redemption of outstanding debt and general corporate purposes.”

HPE said it expects the sale of its stake in the joint venture to take place in 2023 unless “extended pursuant to terms of the Share Purchase Agreement or required regulatory approvals.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEvNC8yMzUzMDMwMS9ocC12b3lhZ2VyLWZyZWUtNjAtcGx1cy1lbnRlcnByaXNlLWVhcmJ1ZHMtdG91Y2hzY3JlZW4tY2FzZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP's “enterprise” earbuds (yes really) have a touchscreen on the case,"HP has joined the list of companies making wireless earbuds and then sticking a screen on the charging case with its announcement of the Voyager Free 60 Plus. Oddly the company’s marketing the earbuds directly toward enterprise users rather than gadget heads but we’ll get back to that in a bit. Let’s talk about that screen first.

It’s actually optional — the regular Voyager Free 60s come with a plain old charging case which HP says will add 10 hours of talk time. The case for the Plus model however has an OLED touchscreen that lets you control music playback volume and settings see your battery status and accept or reject calls.

The touchscreen lets you accept or deny incoming calls as well as control playback and volume. Image: HP

You should also be able to use the screen to switch between two connected devices — the buds support multipoint pairing and can remember up to eight connections. (You can still pair the non-plus models to up to two devices at once but controlling that connection won’t be as easy.) Other features include adaptive active noise cancellation with a transparency mode “WindSmart technology” for making calls clearer when you’re outside AptX support and earbud-based gesture controls for things like volume or track control. They also have an IP54 rating certifying them as splash and dust resistant.

HP says you can expect around eight hours of listening time with ANC on before you have to put the buds back into the case to refill their batteries. Both cases can charge via USB-C or Qi wireless and helpfully include a USB Bluetooth dongle in case your laptop doesn’t have the standard built in.

There’s a few included accessories with both models but you’ll have to go for the plus to get the 3.5mm to USB-C cable. Image: HP

The plus version however also come with a USB to 3.5mm cable which HP says is “ideal for in-flight entertainment systems.” It won’t let you use the earbuds as a semi-wired headset — the company says the cable is “listening only” — but it could come in handy in other situations like when you’re plugging into a treadmill. Some of LG’s earbuds have come with a similar feature and it’s nice to see headphone makers taking into account that not every airline or gym has adopted Bluetooth.

Putting a screen on the case of your wireless earbuds is unusual but not unprecedented. In August 2022 JBL announced a set of earbuds whose case included a 1.45-inch touchscreen for controlling music playback and calls as well as checking notifications. And at this year’s CES JBL said that the Tour Pro 2s would be coming to the US for $249.95.

That’s about how much a pair of second-gen AirPods Pros will cost you unless you manage to get them on sale. But HP’s pricing for the Voyager Free 60s neatly brings us around to the fact that the company’s marketing these as an “enterprise” product. According to the company’s press release they’ll start at $299 when they go on sale in March and there’s no word yet on how much extra you’ll have to pay for the version with a screen. (You know the entire reason these buds will be interesting to most people.)

What makes them an “enterprise grade audio device” as HP’s data sheet puts it? Well one thing is the branding — they’re technically called the Poly Voyager Free 60s. The Poly brand which HP acquired in 2022 is largely associated with conference phones meeting room hardware and the like. Practically that means that you’ll use the Poly Lens app to change your earbuds’ settings and that “IT teams can manage and receive insights” from the device via Poly software. (I am desperately curious about what kind of data it can pass on to your boss.)

The earbuds are also certified to work with several business services like Zoom Google Meet and Voice and Microsoft Teams though the latter certification is limited to the separate Microsoft Teams certified edition of the Voyager Free 60. (Of course if you’re brave enough to use a noncertified headset with Teams the normal ones should be totally fine.)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9ocC1lbnZ5LWluc3BpcmUtNzIwMGU3MjIwZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP ENVY Inspire 7200e/7220e Review: Pros & Cons Features Ratings Pricing and more,"Want to inspire envy in the office? This budget business AOI won’t do that but it does have all the features you need for working at home including an excellent touchscreen. It prints a great photo too but the auto duplex mode is slow there’s very little ink in the box and cartridges are expensive.

Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.

The HP ENVY Inspire 7200e (known as the 7220e in the UK) is a three-in-one inkjet printer aimed at the home office — an increasingly important market for most printer brands.

As such it is well specified with auto duplex Bluetooth and self-healing Wi-Fi built in. There’s also a high-resolution document scanner color touchscreen and two separate paper trays.

It can even duplex print 4x6-inch photo paper. It also looks better than it should for just US$199 (£140 or AU$296).

That’s because HP still adheres to the old razor-and-blade philosophy whereby the printer price is kept low while the real money is made on the ink. But with a six-month free HP+ subscription thrown in is that such a problem? Let’s find out.

HP ENVY Inspire 7200e/7220e: Design and build

The HP ENVY Inspire 7200e/7220e looks smart in its two-tone off-white livery (other finishes are available) but it is rather large for an A4 inkjet. That means more plastic and when HP says 45% of it is recycled it’s admitting that most of it isn’t.

Specifications Type: 3-in-1 color A4 inkjet printer Functions: Print scan and copy Connectivity: Wi-Fi Wi-Fi Direct Bluetooth USB Data storage slots: None Print speed: 15 ppm (mono) Paper capacity: 125 sheets Print quality: 4800 x 1200 dpi Scan quality: 1200 x 1200 dpi Apple AirPrint: yes Consumables included: 2x standard cartridges (120 mono 125 color) Dimensions/Weight: 460 x 383 x 191 mm (WxDxH)/6.9kg

And let’s not forget that this is a cartridge inkjet which wastes way more plastic than a refillable inkjet. What’s more this printer combines the three colored inks in one tri-color cartridge so you have to replace it as soon as any one of them runs out. Sure cartridges can be recycled but a very small proportion are.

We've tested hundreds of the best printers and this one does feel well made for such an inexpensive item. The US Letter or A4-sized scanner bed is protected by a lid that looks large enough to reveal an A3 scanner. The whole unit hinges open in order to install the two very small ink cartridges in a surprisingly large empty cavity. The main paper tray is a two-tiered affair capable of holding 125 sheets of plain A4 paper below and 15 sheets of photo paper in the secondary tray. That’s a disappointing capacity for a printer with such a large footprint but at least you are able to load two different kinds of paper at the same time.

The 2.7-inch tilting touchscreen interface is surprisingly high quality. When it is folded flat and all the other flaps are squared away the design is crisp and minimal except for the paper tray which always projects forward like a jutting chin. At the rear there’s only one port for a USB cable and no Ethernet cable but we would still call this a well-connected device because it has both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth built in.

HP ENVY Inspire 7200e/7220e: Features and specifications

The HP ENVY Inspire 7200e/7220e includes all the key features you would expect from a home or home office printer and a few more besides. Being a three-in-one you can print scan and copy on any size of paper up to A4 but there’s no fax facility. As mentioned there’s no Ethernet port either but with a dual-band Wi-Fi antenna and Bluetooth built in connectivity is not a problem. There’s no USB Host port for walk up printing from a thumb drive but there is a port for connecting a USB data cable to your PC (cable not included).

It can print on both sides of the page automatically (auto duplex). That’s with A4 and A5-size paper and  surprisingly 6x4-inch photo paper. HP printers usually come with a decent touchscreen and this color display is particularly responsive. The maximum print speed is given as an impressive 22ppm (pages per minute) but be aware that this is for single monochrome pages in draft mode. 15ppm is the regular top speed but in all of our tests this printer was a little slower. If you need speed the Epson EcoTank ET-3850 is faster especially when duplexing.

(Image credit: Future)

The main paper drawer can hold up to 125 sheets which is disappointing given the printer’s bulk. A second tray within the drawer is able to hold up to 15 sheets of photo paper of varying sizes but not A4. If you want to print on glossy A4 photo paper you’ll need to load this in the main tray. It’s not as convenient as having two full size paper drawers but it’s a lot better than just one especially as there is no rear multipurpose input. You’ll find some sample photo paper in the box and it includes a few sheets of double-sided 4x6-inch paper and some trendy square 5x5-inch photo paper.

One feature that’s pushed hard is HP+ which entitles the owner of this printer to six free months Instant Ink subscription. Sign up and you’ll benefit from enhanced functionality and receive discounted inkjet cartridges in the post before you run out. HP will even recycle your empties.

(Image credit: Future)

So long as you keep your printer online it will inform HP how many pages you’ve printed and when to dispatch more ink. When you join up you have to guess roughly how many pages you’re going to print per month and choose the appropriate price tier. You can pay as little as $1 per month for ten pages per month or more if you’re a heavy user. The 303 inkjet cartridges for this model are expensive and the savings are up to 70 percent with Instant Ink.

However there are catches. You can carry over pages that you’ve paid for and not printed but only for three months. After that you lose them. And you’re effectively fined for printing more than your allotted number. It also requires that your printer remains online otherwise you’ll receive messages warning that your printer will stop functioning. Yes HP can disable it remotely. This happened to me when I tried to end my subscription which was a drawn out process that wasted ink and money. If you don’t print regularly or in any great quantity or you prefer to shop around for your own ink deals do not sign up to Instant Ink.

HP ENVY Inspire 7200e/7220e: Setup and operation

As with any of the best all-in-one printers out there we found setup a cinch but somewhat annoying too. Simply load your paper and the two supplied cartridges then follow the printer’s on-screen prompts to get onto your Wi-Fi network. Alternatively use the QR code shown on the display to download the HP Smart companion app onto your smartphone and use that to configure your new printer. Thanks to inbuilt Bluetooth your phone should find the printer right away.

What’s annoying is HP’s insistence at every stage that you take out an Instant Ink subscription. We must have declined seven or eight times before it completed the setup procedure. Only then can you run a head alignment test by printing a test page. And guess what. The page includes an advert for Instant Ink.

HP ENVY Inspire 7200e/7220e: Performance

The HP ENVY Inspire 7200e/7220e prints smoothly and quietly (especially in Quiet Mode) but it is not fast. HP gives the top speed as 20 pages per minute which would make it one of the faster inkjet printers in its class. But that’s for single black and white pages in draft mode. Standard print quality is 15ppm but if you want to print on both sides of the page we found that it slows right down to around 7ppm making it one of the slowest.

We have no complaints about the print quality. Plain monochrome text pages look satisfyingly crisp and dark without ever over inking. The black ink is pigment based so it dries more quickly than the dye-based color inks and is less prone to smudging and fading. Printing text in very small point sizes is not a problem for this printer.

(Image credit: Future)

Full color printouts look especially vibrant thanks to HP’s vivid dye-based inks and like any of the best photo printers they look great of all on glossy photo paper. For an office printer albeit a home office printer that’s quite unusual. With the dedicated photo paper tray and a few sample sheets of photo paper included in the box HP has made photo printing a key feature for this model. When you switch to photo paper with a matt finish however the image takes a big hit in overall quality. This formulation of ink bonds better with a high gloss finish.

The HP ENVY Inspire 7200e/7220e also makes decent digital copies. There’s no ADF (automatic document feed) and no dual scan mode but we found there was very little loss of detail. The scan and print resolution of 1200 x 1200dpi is pretty respectable. However there was some variation in the color of each photocopy. BTW if you do need an ADF then the step-up HP ENVY Inspire 7900e is the model for you.

By the end of the test the ink levels had dropped low enough to think about ordering new cartridges which highlights the major limitation of this printer. Firstly the two bundled ‘starter’ cartridges contain hardly any ink — just enough for 120 black and white pages and 125 color. Secondly the cartridges are expensive. Standard black and tri-color carts cost around £17 and £21 respectively and their yield is just 200 and 165 pages. Higher yield cartridges are available and they will bring the page cost down to around 6p for black and white pages and 10p for color but that’s not great.

If you pay for an Instant Ink subscription the cartridges are larger and the yield is even higher than the XL cartridges so the per page cost is lower again. However it’s still way more expensive than a refillable ink tank printer. It’s the same old catch. Cheap printer; expensive ink.

HP ENVY Inspire 7200e/7220e: Final verdict

The HP ENVY Inspire 7200e/7220e is a budget printer and while it's not the best small business printer it still has all the right features to work well in a home office environment where its duties are light and varied. It can auto duplex make decent digital copies and print both documents and photos to a high standard. It’s very well connected with Bluetooth and self-healing Wi-Fi built in and the tilting color touchscreen makes it a pleasure to operate.

However it prints slowly especially in auto duplex mode and despite the relatively large footprint there’s not much room on board for paper. If you print a lot the 125-sheet main paper tray is frustratingly small and the second paper tray can only take 15 sheets of photo-sized paper.

Our main concern however is the high running cost. That's always a concern even with the best inkjet printers it's the nature of the model. But there’s so little ink in the supplied starter cartridges that you’ll need to buy more almost straight away and the cartridges are expensive. Sure enrolling with Instant Ink brings the print cost down but not as low as a refillable ink tank printer and I wouldn’t advise subscribing to HP’s service unless you’re sure you’re going to print regularly."

This is a big deal for all but its largest clients as IBM has spent the last two years moving much of its focus to indirect sales channels. IBM now has dedicated sellers for just 400 direct clients down from 5000 two years earlier CEO Arvind Krishna said in October 2022.

The new program Partner Plus covers IBM’s hybrid cloud and AI activities. (The company’s Red Hat division maintains its own partner ecosystem.) One thing that sets Partner Plus apart from its predecessor PartnerWorld is that partners will have to demonstrate certain levels of expertise to progress through the three tiers still named Silver Gold and Platinum.

Here’s a summary of these big-times changes to the Cloud Wars Top 10 now in its seventh year of analyzing and stacking the world’s largest and most influential cloud providers:

Cloud Wars Top 10 company Previous Rank New Rank Salesforce 4 6 Oracle 5 4 SAP 6 5 ServiceNow 7 10 IBM 10 7

The moves reflect superb transformations within 45-year-old Oracle 50-year-old SAP and 112-year-old IBM as each of those companies had to:

revise its products and technologies to meet the cloud-centric needs of customers

overhaul its go-to-market programs to align with that new mindset among customers

reorganize its sales support and marketing teams to reflect that new reality

develop innovative new approaches to solve the modern digital challenges customers are facing

strengthen and expand its global partners ecosystem; and

do all this while battling — and in many cases beating — ravenous and extremely capable competitors

Since every action has an equal and opposite reaction the ascendancy of Oracle SAP and IBM was counterbalanced by the falling fortunes in the Cloud Wars Top 10 by Salesforce and ServiceNow.

The reasons behind the downward moves for those two companies are radically different.

Salesforce Falls from #4 to #6

For Salesforce it was a series of shocking revelations that came out in its fiscal Q3 earnings call on Nov. 30.

While the company’s growth rate had not dropped below 20% for many years it tumbled to 14% for the quarter that ended Oct. 31 Co-CEO Bret Taylor’s decision to announce his imminent departure just 12 months after taking that high-profile job suggests significant problems within the company on strategic direction product strategy competitive challenges and more Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield’s decision to announce his desire to leave right on the heels of Taylor’s announcement raises questions about the company’s fastest-growing business unit; and Benioff’s recent comments about the lower productivity of remote workers run directly counter to comments he’s made over the past two-and-a-half years about how the pandemic changed “everything” particularly the antiquated notion of people traveling to headquarters offices to do their jobs

ServiceNow Falls from #7 to #10

Being part sentimental squish I’ll admit I can be charmed by a heartfelt rallying cry. And CEO Bill McDermott’s vision for ServiceNow to be the “defining software company of the 21st century” has a lot of feel-good charm to it.

But while I’m not sure exactly where “charm” falls on the priority lists of the business executives among ServiceNow’s customers and prospects I suspect it’s somewhere south of #50 or perhaps even #75. So while I applaud McDermott’s overall performance in reshaping and repositioning ServiceNow and in driving very solid levels of growth in his three years as CEO the company is gliding toward no-man’s land because it’s trying to create a new and standalone category in a market with limited appetite for such singularity.

Is it an applications company? No not really although it does create some applications and helps customers create their own.

So then is it a platform company? Well yes but a very different type of platform company – all the other platform vendors have some big assets in place that can be leveraged by their platforms:

That’s what Microsoft does in a variety of ways but particularly with Power Platform

Google Cloud does it with its fast-growing database business

Oracle does it in many ways but particularly Oracle Database and the fast-growing Autonomous Database

SAP has its high-growth Business Technology Platform

IBM’s Red Hat is becoming extremely popular in hybrid cloud platforms which is a vast opportunity

Workday Extend enables customers and partners to build on its HCM and Financials apps

And Snowflake has begun using its Data Cloud as a terrific platform for customers and partners to build upon

So — it’s become unclear to me how and why “the platform of platforms” will drive huge change and transformation for customers at a time when they have so many excellent alternatives from cloud providers they already work with in very vital ways.

The New Cloud Wars Top 10

Microsoft Amazon Google Cloud Oracle (was #5) SAP (was #6) Salesforce (was #4) IBM (was #10) Workday Snowflake ServiceNow (was #7)

Oracle: 3 Reasons It Jumped to #4

The past two quarters its cloud-revenue growth rate has been 45% and 43% Its passionate and wide-ranging commitment to automate the entire healthcare industries in ways no other tech vendor is even approaching Its fearless and successful assault on “The 3 Hyperscalers” for cloud infrastructure that has turned that into a four-way contest

SAP: 3 Reasons It Jumped to #5

Its cloud-revenue growth rate for the past two quarters has been 34% and 38% Its S/4HANA Cloud growth rate has been between 80% and 100% with no signs of moderating Its RISE go-to-market program is pushing the entire Cloud Wars Top 10 to re-imagine how those companies work with customers undergoing profound business transformation

IBM: 3 Reasons It Jumped to #7

Its cloud business will do well over $20 billion in calendar 2022 and its growth rate has been tracking nicely upwards over the past few quarters. Can it hit 20% in 2023? IBM is fusing artificial intelligence (AI) with cloud as broadly and effectively as any company in the Cloud Wars Top 10 In the past 33 months CEO Arvind Krishna has done a superb job of remaking IBM into an externally focused business whose component pieces are no longer battling each other but are instead coming together to drive new levels of innovation and opportunity for their customers

Final Thoughts

Congratulations to Oracle SAP and IBM for defying the doomsayers and much more importantly dazzling their customers!

And to Salesforce and ServiceNow: The challenge for 2023 is whether you can keep up with the wildly reinvigorated “old timers” that have just vaulted past you!

We performed tibial diaphyseal osteotomy and stabilized the fracture using an intramedullary nail this is an established model of secondary fracture healing that proceeds through the endochondral ossification process.123 As we and others have reported for this model232425 at the end of the inflammatory phase and the early repair phase i.e. at Day 7 (d7) postfracture the fracture gap was filled with and surrounded by a fibrocartilaginous (soft) callus (Fig. S1). The soft callus increased in size as the repair phase advanced to d10 (Fig. S1).23 As healing further proceeded to d14 the densely packed chondrocytes that filled the soft callus progressed into a hypertrophic state (Figs. 1a and S2a b) and secreted the hypertrophy markers type 10 collagen (Col X) (Fig. 1b) and matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) (Fig. 1c). Additionally a subset of soft-callus chondrocytes became terminally hypertrophic as shown by the secretion of type I collagen (Col I) (Figs. 1d and S2c d) which is an essential protein for soft-callus mineralization. At the 3 timepoints (i.e. d7 to d14) the callus areas distal to the fracture gap were filled with newly formed bone that was interwoven with bone marrow (Figs. S1 and S2b c f). As expected immune cells were enriched in the bone marrow that populated the woven-bone regions while fewer immune cells were observed in the soft-callus area (Fig. S2e g). As healing further progressed from d14 to d21 endochondral ossification mediated the replacement of the cartilaginous callus with newly formed woven bone which was accompanied by the re-establishment of bone marrow elements including immune cell populations (Figs. 1e f and S3a–f). The quantitative measurement of gene expression using reverse transcriptase combined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‒qPCR) corroborated our histological analysis and demonstrated very low expression of chondrocyte and hypertrophic chondrocyte markers at d21 (Fig. 1g); these results indicated the nearly complete resorption of the cartilaginous callus.

To gain insight into the biological processes involved in the calcification and resorption of the cartilaginous callus as well as the formation of woven bone we performed RNA-seq using total RNA that was isolated from callus tissues on d14 and d21. We identified 9 330 differentially expressed genes (P adj < 0.05; DESeq226) at d21 relative to d14 (Figs. 1h and S4 and Table S1). As expected the expression of genes involved in cartilage development and ossification was downregulated at d21 compared to d14 (Gene Ontology (GO) analysis;2728 Figs. 1i and S5 and S6a b and Tables S2 and S3). On the other hand d21 showed the upregulation of genes in several pathways that are involved in immune cell responses (Figs. 1i and S5 and S6a b and Tables S2 and S3) which was consistent with the re-establishment of the bone marrow population and the replacement of the dense fibrocartilaginous callus which has relatively low immune cell infiltration with the marrow-infiltrated woven bone (Figs. S2 and S3). RT‒qPCR analysis of the relative expression of the immune cell marker CD45 between Days 7 and 21 demonstrated the lowest CD45 expression levels on Days 10 and 14 (Fig. S6c) which are the 2 timepoints that are distant from the initial immune response and are characterized by the largest soft callus areas. On the other hand the expression level of CD45 was highest on d21 among the 4 analyzed timepoints and it was increased by ∼7 fold on d21 relative to d14 (Fig. S6c) which was consistent with the RNA-seq data (Table S1) and GO analysis (Figs. 1i and S5 and S6a b and Tables S2 and S3). Importantly GO analysis also showed that cell division DNA replication and chromosome segregation were among the most upregulated pathways on d21 relative to d14 (Figs. 1i and S5 and S6a b and Tables S2 and S3). Accordingly as endochondral ossification proceeds rapidly proliferating cells including immune cells populate the callus to replace cells with lower proliferation capacities. These observations are important to our studies as rapidly proliferating cells are reported to exhibit global 3′ UTR shortening810 (see below).

The transcriptome of the healing callus exhibits widespread utilization of alternative PAs

When the last exon of a gene contains multiple PAs (Fig. 2a) utilization of the distal PA (dPA) during mRNA maturation results in the incorporation of the alternative UTR (aUTR) sequences generating an APA isoform with a longer 3′ UTR (long APA isoform or “lAPA”) (Fig. 2a). On the other hand utilization of the proximal PA (pPA) removes the aUTR region and limits the size of the 3′ UTR to the constitutive UTR (cUTR) generating a short APA isoform (sAPA) (Fig. 2a). To study the extent of APA in the healing callus we first performed transcriptomic analysis of the APA isoforms in the callus on d14 using the DaPars-based InPAS algorithm.1718 Quantification of the relative expression of APA isoforms is based on calculating the Percent of Distal Utilization Index (PDUI) (Fig. 2a) which indicates the fraction of each analyzed transcript that is expressed as a lAPA isoform (Fig. 2a). The results indicated that ∼14% of the analyzed genes exclusively utilized the dPA (PDUI = 1; Group 1 in Fig. 2b; Table S4) while ∼2% exclusively utilized the pPA (PDUI = 0 Group 7 in Fig. 2b; Table S4). Importantly ∼84% of the analyzed genes utilized both the dPA and pPA to variable extents (Groups 2-6 in Fig. 2b; Table S4). Hereafter this group will be called APA genes/events. The same analysis was performed using APAlyzer which utilizes a different approach to quantify APA isoform expression and this analysis yielded comparable data as APA events were identified in ∼78% of the genes which showed ∼81% overlap with the APA events identified by InPAS (Fig. 2c and Table S5). Importantly in ∼50% of the APA genes the minor APA isoform constituted ≥20% of the total gene reads (Fig. 2b). GO analysis29 of the APA genes indicated significant enrichment in a wide range of biological pathways that play essential roles in fracture healing (Figs. 2d and S7 and Table S6). In fact a large number of transcripts that are known to play roles in ossification angiogenesis osteoblast differentiation endochondral ossification and extracellular matrix deposition generated a PDUI of 40%–50% suggesting substantial utilization of both the pPA and dPA (Table S7). These genes included the bone matrix components collagen type I alpha 1 (Col1a1) and alpha 2 (Col1a2); the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa); the osteoclast marker tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 5 (Acp5; also known as TRAP); and the bone/cartilage development inducer bone morphogenic protein 5 (Bmp5) (Table S7). These results indicate that thousands of genes are expressed as multiple APA isoforms in the callus and suggest critical roles of APA in bone regeneration.

Fig. 2 APA is commonly found in transcripts that are expressed in the callus on day 14 postfracture. a Schematic of the short APA (sAPA) and long APA (lAPA) isoforms of the same gene. Utilization of the proximal polyadenylation site (pPA) confines the size of the 3′ UTR to the constitutive UTR (cUTR) generating the sAPA isoform. On the other hand utilization of the distal PA (dPA) results in the inclusion of the alternative UTR (aUTR) of the 3′ UTR generating the lAPA isoform.

Utilization of the pPA generates shortened 3′ UTRs in the Col1a1 and Col1a2 transcripts

Type I Collagen which is the main component of the organic bone matrix is a heterotrimer comprising two α1 chains (encoded by Col1a1) and one α2 chain (encoded by Col1a2).30 According to our RNA-seq data analyses Col1a1 and Col1a2 are the most abundant transcripts in the d14 callus and both are expressed as 2 main APA isoforms (Fig. 3a and Tables S4 S5 S7). To confirm these results we mapped the 3′ end of both the Col1a1 and Col1a2 mRNAs by performing rapid amplification of cDNA 3′ ends (3′ RACE) (Fig. S8a b) using RNA purified from d14 calli. Indeed we identified two APA isoforms of the Col1a1 and Col1a2 mRNAs (Fig. 3a–c) and mapped their 3′ ends to CPSs that were consistent with the bioinformatics predictions (Fig. S9a b). Interestingly we identified the same Col1a1 and Col1a2 APA isoforms when we performed 3′ RACE on RNA that was isolated from undifferentiated or differentiated murine MC-3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells (Fig. 3d–f).

Fig. 3 Long and short APA isoforms of the Col1a1 and Col1a2 mRNAs are expressed in the fracture callus as well as osteogenic and chondrogenic cell lines. a Schematic of the lAPA and sAPA isoforms of Col1a1 (left) and Col1a2 (right). The determined size of the 3′ UTR of each isoform is shown. b Representative gel image of Col1a1 3′ RACE-PCR products showing the 2 APA isoforms. 3′ RACE was performed using RNA purified from d14 calli (3′ RACE procedure is shown in Fig. S8a b). The 3′ end of each APA isoform was mapped by excising and sequencing the corresponding PCR band (Fig. S9a). c As in b except 3′ RACE-PCR was performed on Col1a2 mRNA. Sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the lAPA and sAPA isoforms that were identified by InPAS (Fig. S9b). d e As in b and c respectively except that RNA was purified from the indicated cell lines. ATDC5 cells were differentiated under conditions that promoted hypertrophic differentiation and mineralization (Fig. S10). f RT‒qPCR analysis of the expression of the osteoblast and mineralization marker bone gamma carboxyglutamate protein (Bglap) in undifferentiated and differentiated MC3T3 cells.

Abundant levels of type I collagen are also secreted by mineralizing chondrocytes (Fig. 1d).1323 To investigate whether the expression of Col1a1 and Col1a2 APA isoforms is specific to bone cells or whether these isoforms are also expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes we differentiated ATDC5 chondrogenic cells under conditions that induced chondrocyte hypertrophy and mineralization (Figs. 3g h and S10a b). We detected the same APA isoforms in hypertrophic ATDC5 cells (Fig. 3d e). Notably we sequenced the 3′ RACE-PCR products of Col1a1 and Col1a2 in all these experiments and confirmed that the 3′ end of each of the lAPA and sAPA isoforms is conserved among the studied cell lines and calli (Fig. S9a b). Accordingly APA-mediated 3′ UTR shortening in different mineralized tissues and cell lines removes ∼80% and 60% of the 3′ UTRs of the Col1a1 and Col1a2 mRNAs respectively.

3′ UTR shortening reverses the inhibition of Col1a1 and Col1a2 expression

To investigate the biological significance of the APA-mediated shortening of the Col1a1 and Col1a2 3′ UTRs we performed mechanistic studies using MC-3T3 cells which express APA isoforms of Col1a1 and Col1a2 that are identical to those expressed in the callus (Fig. 3b–e). We constructed a reporter containing the 3′ UTR of the Col1a1 lAPA isoform (lAPA 3′ UTR) which represents the full-length 3′ UTR downstream of the firefly luciferase (FLuc) coding region (FLuc-lAPA 3′ UTR; Fig. 4a). As expected when introduced into MC3T3 cells this reporter expressed 2 APA isoforms of FLuc mRNA (Fig. 4b). The 3′ end of each of the 2 isoforms was identical to that of endogenous Col1a1 (Fig. S9a). Similarly a reporter containing the lAPA 3′ UTR of Col1a2 mRNA expressed 2 APA isoforms of FLuc mRNA that were identical to those of endogenous Col1a2 (Figs. 4c and S9b). Accordingly the FLuc-lAPA 3′ UTR reporters recapitulated the alternative cleavage and polyadenylation of the corresponding endogenous transcripts. We next examined the 3′ UTRs of both Col1a1 and Col1a2 mRNAs to define putative PAs that might modulate proximal cleavage and polyadenylation. In each transcript we identified an A-rich simple sequence repeat (SSR) that contained overlapping canonical (AAUAAA) PAs that were located <50 nt upstream of the proximal CPS (Fig. S9a b). Deletion of the SSR (FLuc-ΔpPA 3′ UTR reporter; Fig. 4a) almost completely abolished the 3′ UTR shortening of both the Col1a1 and Col1a2 reporters resulting in the expression of each reporter as a single APA isoform with a full-length 3′ UTR (Fig. 4b c). These results indicate that SSR-embedded pPAs are the main drivers of 3′ UTR shortening in both the Col1a1 and Col1a2 genes.

Fig. 4 Shortening of the 3′ UTR promotes the expression of Col1a1 and Col1a2. a Schematic of FLuc reporters that contain either the 3′ UTR of the lAPA isoform (i.e. full-length 3′ UTR) of Col1a1 or Col1a2 (FLuc-lAPA 3′ UTR) or the deletion mutant in which the SSR was deleted (FLuc-ΔpPA 3′ UTR; X denotes the position of the deleted SSR). CDS: coding region. b 3′ RACE-PCR of FLuc mRNA was performed on RNA that was isolated from MC-3T3 cells transfected with Col1a1 3′ UTR reporters shown in a. PCR was performed using an FLuc-specific forward primer. The results indicate that deletion of the SSR in the FLuc-ΔpPA 3′ UTR reporter abrogated 3′ UTR shortening resulting in the expression of FLuc mRNA as a single long APA isoform. c As in b except Col1a2 3′ UTR reporters were used. d Schematic of FLuc reporters that contain different isoforms or regions of the Col1a1 or Col1a2 3′ UTR. e Bar graph of the results of the dual luciferase assays that were performed on MC3T3 cells transfected with FLuc-Col1a1 3′ UTR reporters shown in d. FLuc activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase (RLuc) activity and the FLuc/RLuc ratio in cells transfected with the “empty” FLuc (FLuc-) reporter was defined as 100. f As in e except that FLuc-Col1a2 3′ UTR reporters were used. n = 4–5 independent transfections each measured in triplicate. g Bar graph of the results of the pulse-chase experiments used to measure RNA decay. MC3T3 cells were incubated with 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) which is an analog of uridine for 2 h to label the nascent RNA during the “pulse step”. Cells were then either collected to determine the total level of EU-labeled mRNA (EU mRNA) or grown for 24 h in EU-free medium during the “chase step”. At each timepoint EU RNA was purified (see Materials and methods) and the level of each of the specified EU mRNA was determined using RT‒qPCR. Primers that bind to the aUTR were used to specifically quantify the expression of the lAPA isoform of Col1a1 or Col1a2 (Table S14). The level of EU mRNA measured after the pulse step was defined as 100% and the graph shows the % remaining after the 24-h chase step. The results demonstrate faster loss of the Col1a1 and Col1a2 lAPA isoforms compared to the total mRNA. β-actin mRNA was used as a positive control for EU mRNA decay and consistent with its reported half-life (∼6.6 h)50 <10% remained after the 24-h chase.

To investigate how 3′ UTR shortening impacts gene expression we constructed an additional FLuc reporter containing the sAPA 3′ UTR of Col1a1 or Col1a2 (FLuc-sAPA 3′ UTR; Fig. 4d). We compared the reporter activities of the FLuc-ΔpPA 3′ UTR and FLuc-sAPA 3′ UTR constructs and the results indicated strong inhibition of FLuc activity (>70%) by the lAPA 3′ UTR of either Col1a1 or Col1a2 (Fig. 4e f) while the repression that was caused by the sAPA 3′ UTR of Col1a1 and Col1a2 was very moderate (∼25%) (Fig. 4e) and not significant (Fig. 4f) respectively. These results demonstrate that the aUTR region which is removed during 3′ UTR shortening exerts a potent inhibitory effect on the expression of Col1a1 and Col1a2. Consistent with this observation a reporter that contains the aUTR region of Col1a1 or Col1a2 (FLuc-aUTR; Fig. 4d) repressed Fluc activity to the same extent as the full-length 3′ UTR (Fig. 4e f). To corroborate the reporter results and investigate the impact of 3′ UTR shortening on endogenous transcripts we performed pulse-chase experiments and assessed the stability of endogenous Col1a1 and Col1a2 APA isoforms. The results indicated substantially faster degradation of the lAPA isoforms than the sAPA isoforms (Fig. 4g). Thus 3′ UTR shortening enhances Col1a1 and Col1a2 expression via at least in part the stabilization of the transcripts.

Shortening of the 3′ UTR enhances Col1a1 and Col1a2 expression by removing miR-29a-3p binding sites

To define the inhibitory elements that are embedded within the aUTR of Col1a1 mRNA we searched for putative miRNA response elements (MREs) among other factors. Among the top scoring miRNAs with conserved MREs in Col1a1 mRNA four were identified by both TargetScan31 and miRDB;32 these four miRNAs included three members of the miR-29 family and miR-6980-5p (Fig. 5a and Tables S8 and S9). In fact the miR-29 family members have been reported to inhibit the expression of Col1a1 with variable efficiency in different tissues.33343536. miRNA sequencing (miR-seq) of small RNAs that were isolated from d14 calli identified miR-29a-3p as one of the 15 most highly expressed miRNAs generating ∼20 000 counts per million (CPM) (Table S10). The expression level of miR-29a-3p was ∼8-fold and 34-fold higher than that of miR-29c-3p and miR-29b-3p respectively (Table S10). On the other hand miR-6980-5p was expressed at very low levels generating <10 CPM (Table S10). Thus we focused our subsequent studies on miR-29a-3p. In situ hybridization confirmed the high expression of miR-29a-3p in woven bone osteoblasts and lining cells (Fig. 5b). Interestingly miR-29a-3p has three MREs in the 3′ UTR of Col1a1 mRNA all of which are in the aUTR (Figs. 5c and S11a and Tables S8 and S9). miR-29a-3p also has a single MRE in the aUTR of Col1a2 mRNA (Figs. 5d and S11b and Tables S8 and S9) suggesting that miR-29a-3p suppresses the expression of both Col1a1 and Col1a2 via MREs embedded in the aUTR. To further test this hypothesis we used the same FLuc reporters that we constructed to express different isoforms and to contain different regions of the Col1a1 or Col1a2 3′ UTR (Fig. 5e f). A miR-29a-3p mimic effectively repressed the reporters that contained the ΔpPA 3′ UTR or aUTR of either Col1a1 or Col1a2 by ≥50% (Fig. 5e f). In contrast the miR-29a-3p mimic had no effect on the sAPA reporters (Fig. 5e f). Mutating the single MRE in the Col1a2 aUTR (FLuc-ΔMRE) abolished the inhibitory effect of miR-29a-3p (Fig. 5f). These data confirm that miR-29a-3p effectively inhibits the expression of Col1a1 and Col1a2 by binding to the aUTR. To corroborate the FLuc reporter data we examined the effect of the miR-29a-3p mimic on endogenous transcripts. The mimic downregulated the total level of endogenous Col1a1 mRNA by ∼30% but exerted substantially stronger inhibitory effects on the lAPA isoform decreasing its expression by ∼75% (Fig. 5g). Comparable results were obtained with endogenous Col1a2 mRNA (Fig. 5h). Consistent with this although a miR-29a-3p inhibitor did not significantly change the total level of endogenous Col1a1 or Col1a2 mRNA it increased the expression level of the lAPA isoforms of Col1a1 and Col1a2 by ∼1.8- and 2.3-fold respectively (Fig. S12a b). Taken together these results highlight the role of 3′ UTR shortening in reversing the inhibition of Col1a1 and Col1a2 expression in biological contexts where miR-29a-3p and possibly other members of the miR-29 family are highly expressed.

Endochondral ossification is accompanied by prevalent 3′ UTR shortening

Our RNA-seq data indicate that the progression of endochondral ossification is associated with increased cell proliferation (Figs. 1i and S5 and S6 and Tables S2 and S3). As rapidly proliferating cells exhibit widespread 3′ UTR shortening810 we hypothesized that 3′ UTR shortening is prevalent during endochondral ossification. To investigate this we used the InPAS to quantify changes in the ratios of APA isoform expression on d21 compared to d14 (InPAS calculates changes as log 2 fold-change in PDUI values; Fig. 6a and Table S4) and we corroborated the results using the APAlyzer (calculates changes as relative expression difference (RED) values; Fig. 6a and Table S5). Positive PDUI log 2 FC or RED values indicate higher ratios of lAPA isoform expression (i.e. lengthening events) while negative values indicate shortening events. Both InPAS and APAlyzer identified a global trend of 3′ UTR shortening on d21 relative to d14 (Fig. 6b). When we limited the InPAS analysis to transcripts that exhibited significant changes in 3′ UTR length (P adj < 0.05 and >20% change in the expression ratio of the 2 APA isoform) the results demonstrated that the number of significant shortening events was ∼24-fold higher than the number of significant lengthening events (Fig. 6c); these results provided further evidence of substantial 3′ UTR shortening. APAlyzer confirmed these results (Fig. S13a b) and corroborated ∼95% of the significant shortening events that were identified by InPAS (Fig. 6d). We also identified APA events that occur in introns (intronic polyadenylation; IPAs) but we did not observe any trend of IPA activation or suppression on d21 relative to d14 (Fig. S13c d and Table S11). Importantly GO analysis37 of the genes that exhibited significant 3′ UTR shortening demonstrated enrichment in pathways associated with cell cycle and proliferation cellular immune response cellular growth assembly organization cell-to-cell signaling and transcriptional regulation (Tables S12 and S13).

PDUI Log 2 FC and RED values were calculated by InPAS and APAlyzer respectively as indicated. b Average and median PDUI log 2 FC (left) and RED (right) values were calculated by InPAS and APAlyzer respectively for all the analyzed genes (Tables S4 and S5). The negative average and median values indicate a global trend of 3′ UTR shortening on d21 relative to d14. c A scatter plot showing changes in 3′ UTR length on d21 compared to d14. Each dot represents a gene and significantly lengthened or shortened 3′ UTRs are shown in red and blue respectively. Significance was defined as a P adj < 0.05 and >20% change in the expression ratio of the 2 APA isoforms. d Correlation between InPAS-generated PDUI log 2 FC and APAlyzer-generated RED values for genes that exhibited significant 3′ UTR shortening on d21 relative to d14 (shown in blue in “c”). e (Top): Genes that exhibited significant 3′ UTR shortening were categorized into 5 similarly sized bins based on their 3′ UTR length.

To investigate whether the length of the 3′ UTR correlates with the extent/frequency of pPA utilization we classified transcripts that underwent significant 3′ UTR shortening into 5 categories based on the lengths of their 3′ UTRs (Fig. 6e top) or aUTRs (Fig. 6f top) and we calculated the average PDUI log 2 FC for each category. We found that genes displayed a greater degree of pPA utilization (i.e. higher frequency of 3′ UTR shortening) as the length of the 3′ UTR (Fig. 6e bottom) or aUTR (Fig. 6f bottom) increased.

Transcripts that undergo 3′ UTR shortening are expressed at higher levels

The 3′ UTR plays crucial roles in regulating the steady-state level of a transcript. We investigated the global impact of d14-to-d21 3′ UTR shortening on gene expression and found that genes whose expression was upregulated on d21 relative to d14 displayed a greater degree of 3′ UTR shortening than genes that showed no change in expression (Figs. 7a and S14a). In a striking contrast downregulated genes showed the opposite trend and exhibited 3′ UTR lengthening (Figs. 7a and S14a). Consistent with this global trend when we limited our analysis to genes that underwent significant 3′ UTR shortening (P adj < 0.05 and >20% change in the APA isoform expression ratio; Tables S4 and S5) we found their expression to be significantly higher than that of all other genes (Figs. 7b and S14b). These results highlight the impact of 3′ UTR shortening on enhancing gene expression during endochondral ossification.

Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 2 (Irak2) a serine/threonine kinase that associates with the interleukin-1 receptor upon activation is one of the genes that was identified by InPAS and APAlyzer to undergo significant 3′ UTR shortening during endochondral ossification (Fig. 7c and Tables S4 and S5). Shortening of the Irak2 3′UTR was accompanied by a significant increase in gene expression as demonstrated by RNA-seq data (Table S1) and RT‒qPCR analysis (Fig. 7d) and this result was consistent with the global trend. 3′ RACE experiments confirmed the expression of 2 main APA isoforms of Irak2 in the callus (Fig. 7e) mapped the 3′ end of each isoform (Fig. S14c) and confirmed the shortening of the Irak2 3′ UTR on d21 relative to d14 (Fig. 7e). We then investigated whether the ratio of Irak2 APA isoform expression varies among cell types given that the callus is made up of heterogeneous cell populations that vary between d14 and d21 (Fig. 1). The enrichment of bone marrow and immune cells is greater on d21 than d14 (Figs. 1i and S5 and S6 and Tables S2 and S3) so to determine whether any APA isoform of Irak2 is specifically upregulated in bone marrow cells we compared the APA isoforms that were expressed in the total bone marrow (flushed from the callus on d21) to those that were expressed in osteogenic and chondrogenic cell lines. We found that while the lAPA isoform is the major isoform that is expressed in differentiated MC3T3 and ATDC5 cells the sAPA isoform is the major isoform that is expressed in total bone marrow cells which exhibited barely detectable expression of the lAPA isoform (Fig. 7f g). To further identify the APA isoforms expressed in different bone marrow cell populations we fractionated the bone marrow using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) into immune (CD45+) and nonimmune (CD45−) cells; we found that the sAPA isoform is the major isoform in both populations (Fig. 7g). Then to investigate Irak2 APA isoform expression in bone marrow myeloid cells we isolated primary monocytes from the bone marrow and differentiated them into macrophages in vitro. We found that monocytes almost exclusively expressed the sAPA isoform (Fig. 7h) while in vitro differentiation into macrophages resulted in mild 3′ UTR lengthening (Fig. 7h i). Activation of mature macrophages using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) did not change the ratio of APA isoform expression (Fig. 7h J). Accordingly bone marrow cells which populate the woven bone area and the re-established intramedullary cavity on d21 are a major source of the Irak2 sAPA isoform; these results explain at least in part the observed d14-to-d21 shortening of the Irak2 3′ UTR.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXByZWNpc2lvbm1lZGljaW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLWFuZC1mZWF0dXJlcy9kaWdnaW5nLWRlZXAtdG8tcmVsZWFzZS10aGUtcG93ZXItb2YtdGhlLXByb3Rlb21lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digging Deep to Release the Power of the Proteome,"Data drives many modern advances in understanding and treating cancer. In particular proteogenomics—the combination of data from the genomes and proteomes—promises ways to better understand the pathways that underlie cancer and how to treat them.1 “Integrated proteogenomics has shown unequivocally that proteomics adds value over a genome-only approach to understanding tumor biology” says Amanda Paulovich MD PhD professor and Aven Foundation endowed chair at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle.

More than the sequences of DNA and RNA are required to explore cancer more deeply. “Genomic sequences and copy-number analyses as well as RNASeq data are not reliable indicators of protein expression levels and protein activities or post-translational modifications” Paulovich explains. “Many post-transcriptional processes impact the proteome.”

As Paulovich notes an article by Henry Rodriquez PhD—founding director of the office of cancer clinical proteomics research at the U.S. National Cancer Institute—and his colleagues depicts the transition in precision oncology from a genome-centric approach to the use of proteogenomics.2

The activity of proteins as well as their post-translational modifications really come into play in therapies. “Since most modern therapies target proteins not nucleic acids it is imperative that we be able to monitor proteins directly rather than make unreliable inferences from nucleic-acid profiles” Paulovich says. “Fortunately tremendous advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomics both untargeted and targeted over the past decade have enabled analytically robust analysis of the human proteome in some cases in clinical settings.”3

Advances in technology also make it easier to study more cancer patients when needed. “The ability to conduct large-scale studies both in terms of sample throughput and target content is enabling researchers to describe phenotypes or signatures of a particular disease state in a much greater level of detail than was previously possible and in much larger populations or cohorts for greater statistical power” says Fiona Kaper PhD vice president advanced science assay research at Illumina in San Diego. “This is due to: the availability of large sample collections such as population-scale biobanks; new technologies such as the ones offered by Olink and SomaLogic that combine high target plexity proteomics with high-throughput readouts such as next-generation sequencing or microarrays; and the favorable economics of available technologies to fund studies at scale.” As Kaper adds “Computer power and analytical tools and methods that can handle very large data sets and integrate different ’omic data types into interpretable results are key.”

Overcoming poor outcomes

Most maybe all scientists who apply proteogenomics to cancer research agree that new technology is crucial to digging deeper into this disease. “Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has gotten better so we now work with smaller amounts of materials” says Janne Lehtiö PhD professor of medical proteomics at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. “The clinical application of proteogenomics is facing a major leap forward because of the technology developments.”

Using a form of high-resolution liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) Lehtiö and his colleagues analyzed the proteomes of people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).4 Then the scientists combined proteomic data with existing genomic transcriptomic and drug-perturbation data on these patients. From this work Lehtiö says that they “found a new chronic leukemia subtype with a poor prognosis” for patients and the researchers validated that subtype with an additional cohort. The new CLL subtype emerged from proteomic data. “If you just looked at genomics you wouldn’t be able to determine this subtype” Lehtiö says.

Beyond finding new molecular signatures of cancer Lehtiö says you can use a “smaller cohort for interesting results by moving to proteogenomics since by layering the data you can get sample-specific genotype-phenotype analysis.” So existing proteogenomic tools allow scientists to work with both smaller and larger cohorts.

This approach will work with a wide range of cancers. As another example Lehtiö and his colleagues applied proteogenomics to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).5 This work revealed six proteome subtypes with interesting connections to oncogenic drivers outcomes as well as aberrant proteins so called cancer neoantigens that can be used for development of cancer vaccines. “We determined the tumor mutation burden on the DNA level but also used proteomics data to study more complex aberrant proteins caused by genomic aberrations the tumor harbor” Lehtiö explains. “To develop rational targeted-therapy combinations and connect immunotherapies to these we need proteogenomics as biomarker analysis to understand both targetable cancer-driving pathways as well as immune-evasion mechanisms at once.”

Predicting treatment responses in ovarian cancer

Many recent research projects explore ways to predict the impact of cancer treatments. As one example Paulovich and her colleagues studied resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in women with high grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs).67

Using LC-MS/MS to quantify proteins and machine-learning algorithms to analyze the data Paulovich says that they “identified an ensemble prediction model of chemo-refractoriness based on 64 proteins and it detects a subset of chemotherapy refractory tumors with very high specificity and is validated in two independent patient cohorts.” In addition the scientists identified five novel subtypes of HGSOC based on protein-pathway expression which might suggest “different mechanisms of refractoriness and implicate potential subtype-specific treatment approaches including immune therapies or metabolic inhibitors” Paulovich says.

The scientists also took other approaches to supporting the idea that protein-pathway expression in the five subtypes might predict therapeutic vulnerabilities. For example the team studied patient-derived xenografts from patients who presented with chemo-refractory HGSOC. The researchers found that the effect of platinum-based chemotherapy could be improved with pharmacological inhibition or CRISPR knock out of a gene connected to fatty-acid oxidation.

The results from these studies show just some of the power of applying proteogenomics in oncology. “Despite over three decades of research on platinum responses in cancer no predictive biomarker has been translated into clinical use” Paulovich says. “Predictors of refractory disease could spare these patients the unnecessary toxicity of a platinum-based regimen and providea means to triage these patients in clinical trials to identify effective therapies for refractory disease.”

Analyzing the information

As scientists collect increasing amounts of information with proteogenomics the analysis opportunities expand. “Although genomics in general is very interesting we’re moving into integrating multiple ’omic data types” says Margaret Donovan PhD product marketing manager of bioinformatics at California-based Seer. “Recent advances in proteomics have opened the door to deep and high-resolution large-scale studies.” Integrating genomics with high-resolution proteomic information is “expanding our understanding of the molecular consequences of genetics” she explains. “It’s helping us understand ‘what is’ not just ‘what could be’.”

For example learning more about one form of ’omics can inform others. “We’re using genomics to better understand proteomics” Donovan says. “Genetic variants can change the amino-acid sequence of a protein and that actually creates slight changes in the proteome.” Then scientists can use computational tools to predict those protein variants or proteoforms and then look for them in proteomic data.

Donovan and her colleagues analyzed proteoforms in patients with NSCLC.8 By performing whole-exome sequencing on samples from these patients and analyzing the data with Seer’s Proteograph Product Suite the scientists found several proteoforms associated with the presence and progression of NSCLC. These proteoforms were only identified by the integration of genomics with proteomics. As Donovan says “High-resolution peptide-level proteogenomics is helping us discover biomarkers we never would have been able to find before and is changing our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of disease.”

For instance this work revealed variants of the BMP protein. “In a cohort of healthy and cancer individuals we see a long form of BMP that’s associated with a healthy state and a short form that’s associated with the cancer state” Donovan says. “When you dig into it the short form that’s associated with cancer is missing the domain that’s involved with collagen which is potentially protective against cancer.”

By digging so deeply into the proteome new biomarkers could be discovered. Some technology developers see the great value in this work as well as the limitations. “For a deeper understanding of protein activity structure and function disease mechanism and protein interactions it will be important to characterize post-translational modifications and detect the different proteoforms present in a sample” says Kaper. She notes that existing technologies suffer from specific shortcomings such as low plexity and the ability to only analyze a small number of well characterized post-translational modifications as well as low-throughput and high cost.

Accelerating data collections

As Paulovich and others noted advances in MS have driven many discoveries in proteogenomics and even more improvements in technology are underway. As one example Olink in Uppsala Sweden developed its Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) technology which is an immunoassay that marks specific proteins that can then be detected and quantified with real-time PCR or NGS.

“Our most recent and pivotal advance is the number of proteins we assay which currently reaches around 3000 proteins” says Cindy Lawley PhD director population health at Olink. “We continue to innovate to maximize our coverage of the proteome and provide as broad a view of the proteome as possible in any given sample—plasma serum cerebral spinal fluid and so on—without compromising on specificity.” She added that Olink created an open-access online platform Olink Insight to address the complex challenges of proteomic data analysis. “This simplifies the user data journey” she explains. As an example she points out that this platform can be used to “translate biological pathways to a list of candidate protein biomarkers which enables improved experiment planning and setup post-run data analysis and analytical tools.”

Olink’s technology is already being applied in many ways. As one example Lawley says that it “is enabling projects like the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project where 13 pharma partners have come together to drive proteomics on around 60000 UK Biobank samples.”

Other companies also strive to expand datasets that can help scientists understand and treat cancer and other diseases. In many ways that objective depends on enabling the readout of non-DNA based modalities such as proteomes on high-throughput analytical platforms such as NGS. As an example Kaper says “Illumina’s NGS technology roadmap has continually increased the data quality and output per sequencing run driving down the cost per data point while at the same time increasing the speed of data generation.” Consequently she says “NGS therefore provides the fastest highest throughput most flexible and most economical readout technology for different multi-omic modalities including genomes methylomes transcriptomes and proteomes.”

Making the most of data analysis however often depends on collections of technology platforms. For instance “combining Illumina’s NGS readout with large target–content panels such as SomaLogic’s SomaScan platform or Olink’s Explore platform will enable researchers to analyze thousands of protein targets in hundreds of samples simultaneously” Kaper notes. As a result scientists can explore protein abundance in more depth and at scale. Kaper says that such a capability “will drive wider adoption and incorporation of proteomics in multi-omic studies deriving ever increasing value and understanding from each sample.”

Improving precision

The increase in proteogenomic-driven knowledge about cancer’s development should enhance treatment options—especially creating more therapies for specific patients. “Proteogenomics is increasing our understanding of cancer biology but the ultimate goal is to use that knowledge to improve cancer outcomes especially through personalized/precision oncology” Paulovich says. “For personalized/precision oncology to succeed we need predictive biomarkers to match patients with efficacious therapies.” Single genes or proteins are not enough to understand the complexity of drug responses. Instead collections of information must be applied to cancer. As Paulovich says: “An unanswered question is: Can multi-analyte proteogenomic predictive biomarker signatures be translated into clinical labs and change clinical practice to improve outcomes while reducing healthcare costs?”

Making the most of proteomics though depends on expertise in various fields. “One of the challenges of proteogenomics in general is that you need a team of people—an expert in proteomics an expert in genomics and an expert in statistics—to really be able to figure out how these puzzle pieces fit together” Donovan explains. In some cases a software solution could help. For example an expert in proteomics could use software to bring in genomics when analyzing data.

Such software also helps deal with the volumes of data produced in proteogenomics. Just as an example a genomics study on a large cohort—say 10000 people—could produce a table of 10000 rows (patients) and 20000 columns (genes) which makes 200 million data cells. Add the estimated more than one million proteoforms and that creates what Donovan describes as “a very high dimensional problem.” Plus that problem is destined to expand. “There are other ‘omic’ data types beyond genomics and proteomics” she says. “Epigenomics tells us about the regulation of the genome and then post-translational modifications of proteins tells us more about a protein’s function.” As Donovan adds: “There can be a lot of growth from putting together all these different molecular phenotypes because that’s systems biology.”

Tomorrow’s cancer studies will explore even more broadly based versions of ’omics but that must await advances in technology. As Kaper says “there are currently no technologies available that can convert additional modalities such as metabolomics into a format that is compatible with a DNA-based readout such as NGS.” As a result she says “these modalities therefore cannot—yet—benefit from a high-throughput technology that can interrogate many samples and analytes in parallel limiting their inclusion into large-scale multi-omic studies.”

The speed of development in proteogenomic tools and techniques as well as the ongoing advances in other areas of ’omics promise to soon make it possible to explore cancer in even more ways. With that capability scientists will learn much more about the molecular biology of cancer and find ways to treat it in more precise and personalized ways.

FIRST-LINE TREATMENT: The company is also conducting a phase 3 trial for its blood cancer drug and said that it has received positive opinions from a review body

By Chen Cheng-hui / Staff reporter





PharmaEssentia Corp (藥華醫藥) yesterday said that it has applied for marketing approval for its ropeginterferon alfa-2b drug with the China National Medical Products Administration.

The company seeks approval to use the treatment for a rare type of blood cancer polycythemia vera it said in a regulatory filing.

The interferon drug sold in the US under the name Besremi is the only approved first-line treatment for polycythemia vera with its sole competitor being the US-based Incyte Corp’s Jakafi which has been approved as second-line treatment.

Pharmaceutical tablets and capsules are pictured on Sept. 18 2013. Photo: Reuters

The drug has gained approval to be used in the treatment of adult polycythemia vera patients in Taiwan Switzerland Israel South Korea the US and the EU.

The company in October said that it was targeting China and Japan as the drug’s next markets.

PharmaEssentia did not specify the estimated date of completion for the marketing application saying in the filing that it is subject to the Chinese agency’s procedures for case acceptance.

There are about 400000 polycythemia vera patients in China the company added.

Polycythemia vera is a chronic progressive myeloproliferative neoplasm and it is primarily characterized by a high count of red blood cells PharmaEssentia said.

The blood disorder could result in cardiovascular complications such as thrombosis and embolism and often develops into secondary myelofibrosis or leukemia it said.

Besremi is PharmaEssentia’s most significant product helping boost its revenue 383.44 percent year-on-year to NT$2.63 billion (US$85.65 million) in the first 11 months of last year company data showed.

The company reported a net loss of NT$1.22 billion in the first three quarters of last year due to higher marketing management and research and development costs.

That translated into losses per share of NT$4.37 company data showed.

Analysts said the new drug would lead to robust sales growth and operating leverage in the long term.

The company is also conducting a phase 3 clinical trial for the drug to treat essential thrombocythemia a rare disorder in which the bone marrow produces too many platelets.

PharmaEssentia yesterday in a separate filing said that it has received positive opinions from the Data and Safety Monitoring Board for the trial.

The board comprises independent experts who review clinical study data for new drugs.

It confirmed the safety of the trial and recommended that the firm continue conducting it according to protocols PharmaEssentia said.

Essential thrombocythemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by an overproduction of platelets in the blood resulting from a genetic mutation.

The number of people with essential thrombocythemia is similar to those with polycythemia vera the company said.

PharmaEssentia has registered 90 percent enrollment for the trial and plans to complete it as soon as possible it added.

The company’s shares rose 62.8 percent last year closing at NT$477 on Friday in Taipei trading.

Only a few laptop CPUs promise significant speed gains

That's because the Core i9-13980HX i9-13950HX i9-13900HX and i7-13850HX -- the premium CPUs intended for gaming and CPU-intensive graphics (like rendering) -- have double the efficient cores (E cores) to hit a total of up to 24 cores and support faster DDR5 memory than 12th-gen offerings. The rest just have tweaks and optimizations which allow for a gentle bump in clock speeds and battery life. For Chromebooks the Core i3 N series updates to the latest hybrid P core/E core architecture which means you may experience notable performance improvements in higher end Chromebooks as well.

You'll be able to overclock with any of the HX processors which you were previously only able to do with the HK versions. All SKUs shown support CPU GPU and memory overclocking. Intel's Iris Xe integrated graphics will also be able to take advantage of a new Endurance Gaming setting intended to extend battery life while gaming. It does this by kicking in Intel's XeSS upscaling and capping the frame rate at 30fps for all your desperation gaming needs.

The company highlighted laptops from the usual suspects -- Acer Dell HP Lenovo MSI Asus and Razer -- as partners for 13th-gen HX series laptops.

You'll likely see a quick jump to 13th-gen based offerings

The new laptop CPUs and supporting chipsets can generally drop right into the existing motherboards and have the same power and cooling requirements. It's always a faster manufacturing switchover when companies don't need to significantly redesign the hardware.

Desktops toddle on

Intel launched its flagship 13th-gen desktop CPUs in September leaving the mainstream low power (for all-in-ones and other compact desktops) and inexpensive chips for CES as it usually does. They're not terribly interesting since they too tend to be variations on last year's theme. One bright spot is that Intel's bringing Bluetooth LE audio to desktops via motherboards which use its Killer Wireless modules.

Evo expands beyond Intel graphics

Intel's Evo program is its marketing imprimatur for laptops which meet specific criteria that highlights all the wunnerful things you can get when you put Intel inside. These types of programs -- AMD Advantage is another -- usually require that the laptops incorporate all the latest and greatest hardware the sponsoring company makes. So it's notable that Intel now allows laptops with third-party discrete graphics (in other words Nvidia and AMD) to qualify in addition to its own Arc graphics. Also with noting: Of the laptops launching at CES I don't remember any incorporating Intel Arc discrete graphics that I heard about prior to the show.

Previously announced features will begin to roll out

The 13th-gen Core chips support the current 40Gbps Thunderbolt 4 data transfer technology as did the 12th-gen processors but with some improvements on the laptop processors that aren't on the desktop equivalents. First they support DisplayPort 2.1 video for running dual 4K monitors at 60 frames per second and second their USB speeds are doubled to 20Gbps. (The latest version of that technology USB 4 will reach 80Gbps and 120Gbps in some conditions when it arrives as soon as this year.)

Other features include Intel's Unison which lets iPhone or Android devices send and receive texts view and transfer photos videos and files and more with your PC or laptop. We'll also see the Engineered for Evo compatibility program expanding to Bluetooth mice keyboards and Wi-Fi access points and Intel's addition of Bluetooth LE Audio (for better less battery sucking headphone operation) to its Killer Wireless modules. Some laptops will also start to incorporate Intel's Movidius vision processing unit which Windows can use for improving videoconferencing experiences.

The flagship Core i9-13980HX is built for upcoming gaming laptops and there are also the regular H- P- and U-series chips for a variety of more mainstream laptops.

Intel’s Core i9-13980HX is the star of the show with a 5.6GHz turbo frequency and 24 cores. It’s the first time a laptop CPU has supported a 24-core configuration and Intel claims it’s the “world’s fastest mobile processor.”

Intel has repurposed the same die it uses for its desktop 13th Gen processors for its HX CPU series with eight performance cores and 16 efficiency cores on the flagship Core i9-13980HX. That’s the same number of performance cores on the previous Core i9-12950HX but double the number of efficiency cores. It’s all packaged into a 55-watt chip that’s designed to be paired with the latest discrete mobile GPUs for high-performance workloads and gaming.

Intel claims the end result is up to 11 percent faster single-thread performance and up to 49 percent faster multitasking performance over the same 12th Gen chips. Gaming performance is said to be up to 12 percent faster but we’ll need to test the chips fully to see how the performance improvements impact battery life.

There’s also support for both DDR4 (up to 3200MHz) and DDR5 (up to 5600MHz) with up to 128GB of RAM supported. Intel’s latest 13th Gen mobile HX chips also include support for Wi-Fi 6E Bluetooth 5.2 and Thunderbolt 4. Acer Dell HP Lenovo MSI Asus and Razer have all committed to bringing 13th Gen HX laptops to market and there will be more than 60 in total.

Intel also has regular 13th Gen H-series processors for 2023 with a base power of 45 watts. There’s up to a 400MHz higher boost clock over the 12th Gen versions and up to 14 cores in total.

Intel’s 13th Gen U-series lineup. Image: Intel

Over on the less extreme performance side of laptops Intel is launching 13th Gen versions of its 28W P-series for thin and light laptops and the 15W U-series for ultralight laptops foldables and beyond. The P-series tops out at up to 14 cores (six performance / eight efficiency) with a max turbo of 5.2GHz and support for both DDR4 and DDR5. The top U-series chip (i7-1365U) has 10 cores in total (two performance / eight efficiency) and a max turbo frequency of 5.2GHz.

These P- and U-series chips are what we’ll see in a variety of laptops announced in the coming days at the Consumer Electronics Show. Intel isn’t promising any major performance advances for its P- and U-series but together with the regular H-series chips we’ll see them in more than 300 designs coming in 2023 from Acer Asus Dell HP Lenovo MSI Razer Asus Samsung and others.

Intel seems to have scaled down its 13th-Gen P-series lineup which only features four SKUs with up to 14 cores and 20 threads. The Core i7-1370P leads the pack with up to 5.2 GHz clock speeds. The CPU family supports a 28W base and 64W MTP power. All chips are Intel vPRO eligible. The U-series is where the actual action is happening. These chips are targeted at laptop designs that focus on thin & light operations and don't feature any discrete GPUs. The lineup features support for up to LPDDR5-6400 memory and TDPs range between 15W base to 55W MTP.

Alder Lake-N Mobility/Desktop CPUs

Intel is also offering its Alder Lake-N SKUs for both laptops and desktops. These entry-level designs are meant to be replacements for the Celeron and Pentium series. The Core i3 N-series chips come with 8 cores and 8 threads with all E-Cores to boot support for LPDDR5/DDR5/DDR4-3200 memory and 15-7W MTP power while the Processor N200/N100 feature 4 cores 4 threads and 6W MTP.

Below Bob shares 5 key insights from his new book Shut Up and Keep Talking: Lessons on Life and Investing from the Floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Listen to the audio version—read by Bob himself—in the Next Big Idea App.

1. Get rich slow is better than get rich quick.

Forget about picking a hot stock and then cashing out. That’s called market timing and it usually doesn’t work because you have to pick the right time to buy and the right time to sell. Almost nobody gets that right. Instead most professional advisors suggest investing in broad index funds that track the overall stock market like the S&P 500 and to resist the urge to sell when markets are down. You’re not trying to beat the market; you’re trying to stay with the market because over the long-term the market tends to go up.

That’s what Warren Buffett advises most investors to do. In 1997 he made a bet with a hedge fund manager that over a ten-year period commencing January 1 2008 and ending December 31 2017 the S&P 500 would outperform a portfolio of several hedge funds that picked stocks. Buffett easily won: the group of hedge funds had an average return of only 36 percent net of fees over that ten-year period while the S&P index fund had a return of 125 percent.

“You’re not trying to beat the market; you’re trying to stay with the market because over the long-term the market tends to go up.”

In the last twenty years the rise of low-cost Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have made it easy to invest in the broad market at a very low cost and low cost is the key to long-term investing success because when you have to pay high fees it eats into long-term profits. Have a long-term plan to diversify your assets among stocks bonds and the home you own.

2. Stocks are the best long-term investment but they don’t go up every year.

It’s a remarkable fact: since 1926 the overall stock market has been up three out of four years. The average increase in the stock market has been about 10 percent a year including dividends. Over a very long period of time research indicates that stocks are a better return than just about any other investment.

Stocks tend to go up because we live in a capitalist society. The U.S. has a particular brand of capitalism called market capitalism where private individuals and corporations control most of the means of production. Market capitalism is an efficient allocator of capital—its primary concern is producing a profit—and it passes those profits on to shareholders. Other countries also have capitalist economies but many—like many countries in Europe—have large parts of the economy controlled by the state. State-controlled enterprises are typically less profitable.

3. You may be able to take more risk than you realize.

I often hear people say I can’t afford to have 75 percent of my retirement fund in stocks I won’t be able to sleep at night. But even if you have 75 percent of your retirement fund in stocks it doesn’t mean you have 75 percent of your assets in stocks. Think of your assets in three broad buckets: a retirement fund such as a 401(k) the home you own and Social Security.

“Stocks tend to go up because we live in a capitalist society.”

Let’s say you have $250000 in your retirement fund your home is paid off and worth $250000 and you collect $20000 a year in Social Security which is about the average per year. Over 25 years a $20000 a year Social Security check will be worth over $500000. And remember Social Security is an annuity that adjusts for inflation. So $250000 in a retirement portfolio $250000 in your house and a half-million in Social Security receipts over 25 years and you have a million-dollar portfolio but only 25 percent of it is in a retirement fund with 75 percent stocks.

You don’t have 75 percent of your wealth in stocks you only have about 18 percent in stocks. With that knowledge you may feel more comfortable with a higher allocation to stocks.

4. Everyone is bad at predicting the future and there’s a reason for that.

Amateur stock pickers are terrible at picking stocks but professional stock pickers have a terrible record of picking stocks too. Economists have a terrible record of predicting the economy. Even the Federal Reserve with the best economists in the world don’t have a good record of forecasting the U.S. economy. Why is everyone so bad at predicting the future?

There are two main problems. First predictions riddled with bias limit the quality of those predictions. There are emotional biases from feelings like overconfidence after being right the last few times. There are cognitive errors that come from faulty reasoning because people often jump to conclusions based on limited information. They don’t question the quality of the information or what information might be missing. There is also confirmation bias in which people select information that supports their own point of view while ignoring information that contradicts it. These biases and dozens of others make it difficult to predict accurately.

“Economists have a terrible record of predicting the economy.”

The other problem is a lack of complete information because unpredictable events occur that affect outcomes. Think about trying to predict the price of a stock one year from now. Every company has millions of variables which can affect the outcome. Some factors may be predictable but many are not. The economy may face new shocks such as inflation a rise in interest rates a war that disrupts critical supplies or a cyberattack. The company may face a new competitor. It may be bought out or engage in an unforeseen merger. The visionary CEO may fall ill and suddenly retire.

5. Professional stock pickers aren’t bad at picking stocks because they’re stupid they’re bad because the competition is tough.

When fees are taken into account 90 percent of fund managers underperform their benchmarks after ten years. It’s not because they’re dumb—just the opposite. Decades ago most trading was done by individuals with each other. Information was tougher to come by. Some were better informed than others.

But today most trading is done by professionals like mutual funds and pension funds. All of these people have access to roughly the same information at the same time. They don’t have any informational or time advantages which makes it very difficult for any one professional to outperform. Those that do usually don’t outperform consistently. Very few will ever put together a string of outperforming years.

Note: Retail prices are in nominal terms and are not adjusted for inflation.

In the final trading day of 2022 the spot price of Brent crude oil a global benchmark priced in Northwest Europe closed at $85 per barrel (b) $7 higher than the price on January 3 2022 ($78/b). The Brent price rose significantly in the first half of 2022 but generally declined in the second half of the year. The spot price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) a benchmark price for U.S. crude oil followed a similar pattern finishing the 2022 trading year $4/b higher than on January 3. The Brent crude oil spot price averaged $100/b in 2022 and the WTI spot price averaged $95/b.

In the first half of 2022 geopolitical tension with Russia culminating with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24 contributed to crude oil price increases. On March 8 2022 the combination of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with low global crude oil inventories lifted the 2022 crude oil price to the highest inflation-adjusted price since 2014.

The WTI price followed a similar path as the Brent crude oil price in 2022 averaging $5/b less than the Brent crude oil price compared with $3/b less in 2021. The Brent-WTI crude oil spread (the difference between the two prices) increased in 2022 relative to 2021 because European countries needed to replace crude oil supplies they were importing from Russia with crude oil from another source. European markets were also affected by a strong U.S. dollar that made imported crude oil more expensive.

Crude oil prices increased in the first half of the year because of supply concerns. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine came during eight consecutive quarters (from the third quarter of 2020 to the second quarter of 2022) of global crude oil inventory decreases. The lower inventory was the result of withdrawals from storage to meet the demand that resulted from rising economic activity after pandemic-related restrictions eased.

From June 8 through the remainder of 2022 crude oil prices generally decreased as concerns about a possible economic recession reduced demand. High petroleum prices were one cause of persistent broad-based inflation in 2022 that affected consumer budgets and gasoline demand. High crude oil prices led to lower U.S. gasoline demand as gasoline prices rose. Meanwhile severe COVID-19 containment measures in China contributed to lower global petroleum demand. On December 8 the price of Brent crude oil reached the lowest 2022 price at $75/b.

Crude oil supply also increased in the second half of the year from U.S. and international Strategic Petroleum Reserve release programs which increased the global supply of crude oil.

Trading in the online used car dealer’s warrants – ticker symbol CZOO WS – were ‘suspended immediately’ the NYSE announced at the close of business yesterday in the States.

Trading in the company’s Class A ordinary shares – ticker symbol CZOO – will continue on the NYSE.

The company’s share price was up 13 per cent yesterday to 18 cents. However shares have fallen 96.5 per cent in the last 12 months.

Cazoo currently has a market cap of just £110m. It was valued at £6.5bn when founder Alex Chesterman launched it on the Stock Exchange in August 2021.

Warrants give the holder the right to purchase stock at a set price and at a specific date in the future.

They are issued directly by the company and when a holder exercises a stock warrant the shares are not received from another investor but directly from the firm.

NYSE said in a statement on Business Wire that the warrants were ‘no longer suitable for listing based on abnormally low price levels’.

The statement said: ‘The New York Stock Exchange announced today that the staff of NYSE Regulation has determined to commence proceedings to delist the warrants of Cazoo Group Ltd each whole warrant exercisable for one Class A ordinary share — ticker symbol CZOO WS — from the NYSE.

‘Trading in the company’s warrants will be suspended immediately.

‘Trading in the company’s Class A ordinary shares — ticker symbol CZOO — will continue on the NYSE.’

Cazoo can appeal the decision.

Mike Jones automotive industry analyst and compiler of the Car Dealer Top 100 list said this ‘doesn’t look good’.

‘When Cazoo listed they issued a large number of warrants as part of that process and these could be traded like the shares’ Jones said.

‘They effectively said the warrant holders could buy the shares at say $11 but they are currently trading at 18 cents so they wouldn’t be exercised.

‘Cazoo has been told they need to improve their share price or they will fall out of the NYSE completely. That’s the bigger issue.

‘This doesn’t really change things for Cazoo – they still need to start generating a profit before their cash pile runs out.’

David Kendrick partner at UHY Hacker Young said he thinks the issue could be more to do with any new warrants issued.

‘There have been a number of new senior management changes and perhaps new warrants issued were at discounted prices which has concerned the NYSE’ he said.

‘Whatever the reason this doesn’t look good. Is it the beginning of the end for Cazoo?

‘Confidence in the business will certainly be knocked. The announcement implies that the NYSE is worried about the business.’

A stock market expert told Car Dealer that there could also be a ‘technical anti dilution issue’ with the share price being so low.

A spokesperson for Cazoo told Car Dealer: ‘The recent New York Stock Exchange announcement relates only to the delisting of warrants of Cazoo Group Ltd under the ticker symbol of CZOO WS.

‘The warrants are being delisted due to the low price and volume trading levels. The listing status of our warrants does not impact the company’s Class A ordinary shares under the ticker symbol CZOO in any way which will continue to trade on the NYSE as normal.’

Other extreme weather events such as droughts and fires as well as sea level changes seem just as if not more relevant.12 One way to think about these effects is to consider how extreme weather events will shape “growth episodes.” Economic performance in the medium to long term is episodic in nature for all but the richest countries that remain at the technology frontier.13 Virtually all countries have experienced periods of rapid economic growth and periods of dismal growth. Comparative performance is explained by the superior ability of some countries to sustain growth; poor countries have a greater propensity to reverse.14 In other words shocks and how they are managed play a large part in explaining comparative economic performance.

If climate change augurs a world of more frequent and intense shocks sustained episodes of fast economic growth—so-called growth miracles—will become harder to pull off. The result will be fewer poor countries succeeding in converging on rich country income levels compared to a world without climate change. This comes at a time when convergence has become more commonplace since the start of the twenty-first century.15

Dimmer prospects for economic convergence are exacerbated by the weak institutions that characterize today’s poorest countries. Institutional weakness is associated with deeper growth decelerations which implies that poor countries face a harder road to recovery after any given shock.16

One countervailing factor that could raise the economic fortunes of poor countries is the longer-term possibility of ubiquitous and abundant energy on the assumption that the marginal cost of renewable electric power continues to fall. This would drive down the cost of business in poor economies not to mention materially improving the lives of their people. Such an outcome hinges on investments in renewable infrastructure and access to renewable technology by developing countries.

Every country today faces the challenge of undertaking a green transition: the switch to a zero-carbon economy with its far-reaching consequences and demands on land planning infrastructure investment technology jobs and social justice. The attendant disruption will play out over the next decades in addition to the disruptive effects of a changing climate.

For a minority of countries whose economies are organized around fossil fuel extraction a more fundamental overhaul beckons. There are twenty-one economies for whom coal petroleum and natural gas account for a majority of merchandise exports; in six of these countries fossil fuels represent more than 90 percent of those exports (see figure 2).17 Even in a world where some nonrenewable energy generation continues the economic models of these countries will require reinvention. This will emerge as a central project for economic development in the years ahead.

Here the economics of transition which describes the metamorphosis of dozens of economies from a centrally planned to a market-based system in the late twentieth century offers both a partial analogy and playbook.

Central to that analogy is the anticipation of a drastic drop in income. For countries from the former Soviet Union economic contractions ranged from 10 to 50 percent in the initial years of transition marking a period of painful adjustment with social political and psychological dimensions.18 Reductions in output of a similar order of magnitude can be expected for the twenty-one fossil fuel–export economies though spread over a longer time horizon.

Fossil fuel exporters can also be expected to undertake some of the same reforms required of transition economies. This includes redefining the role of the state in the economy from serving as a source of growth and rent capture via state-owned enterprises to an enabling role that embraces greater liberalization including through the removal of price controls and subsidies connected to the energy sector. Among the fossil fuel-exporting economies an average of 3 percent of annual income is devoted to pretax subsidies for fuel compared to under 1 percent in all other countries; in Libya that share is an astonishing 17.5 percent.19 Taken together with the anticipated drop in income these reforms signify the need to recalibrate the social floor to an affordable level and redefine the social contract.

Such reforms are hardly straightforward. Indeed the process of economic transition proved to be a humbling experience for the economic profession.20 The prevailing wisdom that faster policy adjustment was better has been challenged by the relative success of more gradual reforms in East Asia in contrast to the Big Bang approach advocated and adopted in Eastern Europe. The slow recovery from transition in many countries has prompted analysts to place greater emphasis on the importance of forging institutions to support economic development—though the absence of a practical set of policies to support institution-building is telling. The impending transition for fossil fuel exporters is likely to entail a similarly daunting and poorly signposted course.

As fossil fuel exporters reduce their reliance on nonrenewable natural resources to spur their economies and generate export revenue a new generation of countries are poised to take their place: those endowed with significant natural wealth in the precious minerals and metals that are central to renewable energy production transmission and storage.21 How should we assess their prospects in the green transition?

Extractive industries present irresistible opportunities for generating income as well as inescapable tests of governance. The stakes are heightened when the natural resource in question is easily transported and truly scarce and so is capable of yielding large economic rents as has been the case for oil. Such resources can translate into vast geoeconomic power or leave countries stricken by the resource curse.

On the surface this would appear to characterize many of the metals and minerals involved in renewable energy as the green transition intensifies. The production of several such metals and minerals is more geographically concentrated than fossil fuels and in many cases proven reserves are insufficient to meet forecast demands under a net zero global economy.22

On closer inspection however a different picture emerges. There are multiple technological pathways open to the generation and storage of renewable energy which should allow some substitution between one natural resource and another. In the case of rare earth metals at least geographical concentration does not reflect genuine scarcity but rather the limited commercial interest in extraction and processing. In addition minerals and metals are recyclable unlike fossil fuels. On this basis natural resource wealth in precious minerals and metals is unlikely to play a determining role in the future fortunes of developing economies—or exert the same economic power that oil wealth does today.23

From Deprivation to Insecurity

The past three decades represent an era of historic development progress. That progress is commonly illustrated by the changing share of the world population living in extreme poverty which has emerged as a universal measure and proxy of global economic development. This indicator stood at 38 percent in 1990 and has since fallen to a mere 8 percent.24

The above sections suggest that climate change will act as a brake on economic development—but that does not mean that the pattern of global poverty reduction is destined to end.

While climate change may reduce economic output in poor countries this effect is measured against the counterfactual of a world without climate change; other factors could outweigh the impact of climate change so that the net effect remains one of ongoing economic progress. Moreover we may be arriving at a structural juncture that challenges this inference.

Climate change augurs a fundamental evolution in what is understood as the core challenge of economic development. Historically that challenge was one of deprivation. Households communities or governments lacked the resources they required to meet people’s basic needs and enable them to thrive. Today the challenge is increasingly one of insecurity. In an era where shocks whether localized or global in scope have become more frequent and intense households communities and governments lack the means to protect themselves and the resources they’ve accumulated.

We see some evidence of this changeover in divergent—and seemingly incongruous—trends as climate change takes effect. Over the last decade the share of people in the world living in extreme poverty has continued to fall albeit at a slower rate than in the prior two decades. Meanwhile the shares of people facing severe food insecurity—that is having run out of food or been forced to go without meals for a day or more—and requiring life-saving humanitarian support have both been trending up. Since 2018 the share of people facing severe food insecurity has exceeded the share living under the global poverty line (see figure 3).

Deprivation and insecurity are of course linked. A significant share of the world’s extreme poverty is understood to be a transient phenomenon; in Africa transient poverty is 50 percent more common than chronic poverty.25 In 2010 97 million people—equivalent to 1.4 percent of the world’s population—were estimated to have been thrown into extreme poverty by out-of-pocket health spending alone.26 Indeed the number of people that will remain in extreme poverty in 2030 is forecast to be 32 to 132 million higher as a result of climate change.27

However the impact of climate change on poverty may turn out to be one of its less salient features—and quantifying this impact shouldn’t be necessary to validate the importance of climate change in understanding economic development. Rather the emergence of climate change should force a reassessment of what indicators we rely on to capture development progress and what policies are prioritized to promote it.

Consequences for International Security

The preceding sections describe how climate change will alter the pursuit of economic development in poor countries. These changes have ramifications far beyond both poor countries themselves and the field of global development. Below are seven hypotheses describing possible implications for international security. These are intended to provoke discussion rather than to be conclusive but they point both to the breadth of these effects and their relevance to the international security community.

A growing sense of grievance among the world’s poor countries pitting the winners and losers of climate change against each other. This could include the re-emergence of the Non-Aligned Movement and Group of 77 as prominent factions in the multilateral system.

This could include the re-emergence of the Non-Aligned Movement and Group of 77 as prominent factions in the multilateral system. Increased salience of failed states that are deemed incapable of development as a result of climate change and thus impervious to foreign investment. Failed states act as an overlapping source of global instability with climate change.

Failed states act as an overlapping source of global instability with climate change. Spheres of global risk defined more prominently by geography. Strategies for managing risk will have to respond accordingly with greater emphasis put on weather patterns and linkages drawn across national borders.

Strategies for managing risk will have to respond accordingly with greater emphasis put on weather patterns and linkages drawn across national borders. Instability in economies whose exports are dominated by fossil fuels. The green transition in these countries should be expected to generate economic political and social upheaval with effects potentially reverberating beyond national borders.

Power derived less from control of natural resources and potentially more from control of transmission routes for renewable energy and intellectual property of green technology. Norms regarding the use of green intellectual property are not set in stone and will determine whether such power is manifested or not.

Norms regarding the use of green intellectual property are not set in stone and will determine whether such power is manifested or not. More regular deployment of national and international security forces to assist communities affecting by crises. The normalization of post-disaster reconstruction alongside humanitarian relief operations will place greater demands on security forces and make their work more visible to civilians.

The normalization of post-disaster reconstruction alongside humanitarian relief operations will place greater demands on security forces and make their work more visible to civilians. Increasing application of methods and tools (such as scenario planning and risk management) drawn from the security field into economic planning and global development. This has the promise of bringing greater alignment between the two policy communities.

10 Specifically Burke and co-authors (ibid.) find that economic productivity peaks when the average annual temperature is 13°C—approximately that of New York. Increases in average temperature below this threshold are associated with modest productivity improvements whereas increased temperatures for countries initially above 13°C imply a decline in productivity with that decline occurring at a faster rate the more temperatures exceed the threshold.

We conducted a literature search of peer-reviewed publications after the year 2000 from the Web of Science. For management strategies developed before 2000 we only included those that are still adopted at present. This allowed us to focus on investigating the feasibility of the implementation of the measures that have been applied in recent decades. The keywords used in the search included “N or non-point source pollution” “mitigation or abatement” and “cropland or farmland”. This paper focuses on the on-farm management practices but excludes the upstream ways of decreasing N pollution such as diet changes or decreasing waste beyond the farm such as manure management in feedlots. Studies were included if they met all of the following criteria: (1) the sample means of the N loss from targeted pathways yield or NUE were reported for both the control and the treatment groups; (2) details on the experimental location design and conditions were given to enable cross-checking of duplicate publications; and (3) only field experiments were included.

We included in our analyses a total of 1521 field observations. We identified and summarized 11 groups of measures as explained in Supplementary Information 1.1. The treatment groups (and categories) and the control of various management practices were: (1) EEFs (urease inhibitors nitrification inhibitors double inhibitors (urease and nitrification inhibitors) and coated or controlled-release fertilizers) were compared with their counterparts without inhibitors or coatings (control); (2) organic amendments (biochar manure and crop residues) were compared with normal fertilization (control); (3) incorporation of legumes into a rotation was compared with non-legume rotation (control) over the full period of the rotation; (4) wetlands or ponds with a buffer zone were compared with those without a buffer zone on the same study field (control); (5) for optimizing the N fertilizer rate the highest fertilizer application rate used in the experiment was considered as the control whereas the other rates were converted to the percentage reduction (<25% 25–49% 50–74% and ≥75%) relative to the control; (6) for fertilizer type urea was treated as the control and the non-urea treatments were categorized into ammonium-based or nitrate-based fertilizers manure and compost; (7) for fertilizer time the splitting frequency of fertilizer application was compared with a single application (control); (8) for fertilizer place deep placement of fertilizers was compared with surface broadcast or topdressing (control) with studies focusing on urea and manure; (9) crop varieties with a high NUE were compared with those with low NUE (control); (10) no-tillage was compared with conventional tillage (control); and (11) drip irrigation or optimal irrigation was compared with normal irrigation (control). All data were extracted from text or tables directly or figures using WebPlotDigitizer 4.2. The full set of publications and outcomes for each is detailed in the Supplementary Information meta-analysis documentation.

Meta-analysis of mitigation measures

The natural log of the response ratio (\(r={\bar{x}}_{{\rm{t}}}/{\bar{x}}_{{\rm{c}}}\) in which \({\bar{x}}_{{\rm{t}}}\) and \({\bar{x}}_{{\rm{c}}}\) are the means of the treatment and control groups respectively) was used as a metric for the analysis of treatment effects on N r loss from various pathways (NH 3  NO x and N 2 O emission N runoff to surface water and N leaching to groundwater) yield and NUE. The results were reported as the percentage change under treatment effects ((r − 1) × 100). Negative percentage changes indicate a decrease in the variables owing to the management practices whereas positive changes indicate an increase. We followed a commonly adopted randomization resampling procedure31 and generated mean effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals by bootstrapping (4999 iterations)32 using the software MetaWin 2.1 (ref. 33). In previous meta-analyses the effect sizes reported were weighted by the inverse of the pooled variance34 replication35 or unweighted36. The studies in our database did not always include published variances or replications so the unweighted approach36 was adopted in our analysis. The effects of management practices on N r losses yield and NUE were considered substantial if the confidence intervals did not overlap with zero31.

The variations of effects may be due to the changes in local natural conditions such as soil and climate. These local conditions not only affect the effects of mitigation measures but also the local N cycle. However given the relatively consistent effect of measures on the N cycle among countries (Supplementary Figs. 4–14 and 17 and Supplementary Table 6) which is indicated by the notable effect of the response ratio of the main N loss pathways and mitigation measures in Fig. 1 we did not categorize the effect sizes based on countries. We thus linked the results of the meta-analysis and national budget modelling through modifying the N cycling parameters in the N budget models using the mitigation potential of each measure in the meta-analysis. Although the average mitigation potential of each measure in percentage change is considered the same in each country the final mitigation potential is different because the N inputs differ and the implementation of measures varies between nations owing to the heterogeneity of the most appropriate set of practices at a local scale. For the variation in the effectiveness of measures among crop species may we expect that the largest impact should come from non-legumes relative to legumes which fix N from the atmosphere. We therefore separated legumes from other crops in the meta-analysis in Fig. 1. In regions with several cropping indexes such as wheat–maize rotation it is hard to identify the mitigation effect for each crop type because of the interactions. Thus we did not consider the effect of other crop species on cropland N use and loss. More details can be found in the following sections.

Tier classification of mitigation measures

We developed a tiered classification scheme to group similar measures and better facilitate analysis which is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 2. The classification criteria mainly focus on four aspects: mitigation efficacy technical threshold acceptance by farmers and the implementation cost. Each measure is thus assigned to one of three tiers as outlined in Supplementary Table 1 based on expert judgement. The three tiers are defined as follows.

Tier 1 measures

Measures with low technical thresholds high mitigation efficacy low implementation cost and high acceptance by farmers. This includes the use of EEFs soil amendments and greater legume inclusion in cropland. The use of buffer strips is also classified in Tier 1. Although this measure does not require sophisticated technology and is applicable to both more and less developed countries it occupies marginal croplands and may threaten food security reducing its applicability in countries with land scarcity (see Supplementary Table 1). The use of EEFs is a typical Tier 1 measure. Governments can subsidize EEFs to make them the same or lower price compared with traditional fertilizers and farmers would prefer to use these new EEFs given that they can earn more with the same or lower input37. Regulation upscaling and appropriate competition across the industry also hold the potential to reduce EEF prices substantially. A similar tier can also be applied to the use of amendment and legume rotation. Tier 1 can be applied in all global regions regardless of the farm size or farmers’ knowledge level (Supplementary Table 1).

Tier 2 measures

Measures with medium technical thresholds medium implementation costs and medium acceptance by farmers which need policy support to promote the application. Measures included here are limited to the use of the right rate right type right placement and right time of fertilizer application namely the 4R nutrient stewardship. Compared with Tier 1 measures it is harder for farmers to adopt measures from other tiers (Fig. 4a). Implementation of the 4R measures requires extra inputs from farms such as knowledge exchange labour and machinery10. Knowledge requires long-term training which is more attractive to large-scale farmers than smallholders given the scale effect of fixed inputs including knowledge machinery and other fixed assets. Larger farm sizes tend to have lower fixed input per cropland area38. Instead of investing time and financial resources in improved agricultural practices it may often be more attractive for smallholders to invest in off-farm activities in which they can realize a higher return39.

Tier 3 measures

Measures with higher technical threshold higher implantation cost and lower acceptance by farmers owing to trade-offs with other targets (food security land use urbanization land use) which require strong policy intervention and social support to promote their implementation. Measures include increasing adoption of new cultivars with higher yield potential improved irrigation and no tillage. This tier-based classification may be contrasted with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) categories 1–3 defined by Bittman et al.40 which focus on the robustness of the evidence base for justifying the recommendation of each measure. For example no tillage is a conservation tillage measure that reduces the compaction of the soil and reduces the water loss by runoff and prevents soil erosion. Although no tillage suggests merely the absence of tillage several components need to be applied to a conservation agriculture system to guarantee equal or higher yields and better environmental performance than conventional tillage systems. A certain level of experience is needed to establish no-till crops properly and poor crop establishment can arise from both biophysical factors as well as a lack of knowledge by researchers on appropriate equipment soil conditions seeding techniques etc.

Cropland N budget

The CHANS11 MAgPIE12 and IMAGE13 models were used to estimate the global cropland N budget. Details for each of these models can be found in Supplementary Information 1.2. The cropland N budget by country/region in 2015 was established to identify the current cropland N input output and NUE. N inputs (N inputi ) to cropland include five elements which are N fertilizer input (N feri ) manure N input (N mani ) biological N fixation (N fixi ) atmospheric N deposition (N depi ) and irrigation (N irri ). N outputs from cropland are divided into four elements which are crop harvest (N harvesti ) N gas emission (N gasi  including NH 3  N 2 O NO x and N 2 ) N leaching (N leachi ) and N runoff (N runoffi ). On the basis of the integrated model results of CHANS11 MAgPIE12 and IMAGE13 we identified the share of different forms of N loss in different countries/regions. Then the regional N r emission fractions referring to all N losses including leaching and runoff were embedded into the CHANS model to perform further mitigation assessment under various scenarios with this model (see Supplementary Fig. 2).

Cropland NUE is defined here as the ratio of harvested crop N to total cropland N input. A target harvest N (N target harvesti ) and NUE (NUE targeti ) was derived which was assumed to represent a reasonable index of the implementation of current best technologies and management practices. Determination of the regional-specific target NUE i for 2050 was based on Zhang et al.1441 and studies that considered the yield potential and environmental boundary4243. These two key indicators allow us to calculate the overuse of anthropogenic N input (ΔN inputi ) to the cropland in view of the target harvest N (target NUE) for different countries and regions i following equations (1)–(5).

$${N}_{{\rm{input}}i}={N}_{{\rm{fer}}i}+{N}_{{\rm{man}}i}+{N}_{{\rm{fix}}i}+{N}_{{\rm{dep}}i}+{N}_{{\rm{irr}}i}$$ (1)

$${N}_{{\rm{output}}i}={N}_{{\rm{harvest}}i}+{N}_{{\rm{gas}}i}+{N}_{{\rm{leach}}i}+{N}_{{\rm{runoff}}i}$$ (2)

$${{\rm{NUE}}}_{i}={N}_{{\rm{harvest}}i}/{N}_{{\rm{input}}i}$$ (3)

$${N}_{{\rm{target}}{\rm{input}}i}={{N}_{{\rm{target}}{\rm{harvest}}i}/{\rm{NUE}}}_{{\rm{target}}i}$$ (4)

$$\Delta {N}_{{\rm{input}}i}={N}_{{\rm{input}}i}-{N}_{{\rm{target}}{\rm{input}}i}$$ (5)

The reduction potential of N fertilizer use

The estimation of global and regional fertilizer reduction potential was based on the difference between the current and optimal fertilizer use combined with the best cropland N management practices.

$$\Delta {N}_{{\rm{fer}}ik}=\Delta {N}_{{\rm{input}}ik}+\Delta {N}_{{\rm{man}}ik}-\Delta {N}_{{\rm{dep}}ik}$$ (6)

in which k means the most appropriate set of combinations of several options; we assumed the N fixik and N irrik to change little. Enhanced manure recycling to cropland (ΔN manik ) which contributes to the reduction in chemical fertilizer input (ΔN ferik ) has been included in the estimation of future cropland budgets. The baseline manure N input to cropland was derived from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)44. The different future estimations were made by adjusting the manure recycling ratio to a value that respects both the regional-specific cropland maximum carrying capacity and the manure production potential. The change of N deposition (ΔN depik ) to cropland was assumed to be proportional to the reduction of N r emission. N fer cannot be negative and any ΔN fer > N fer was set to zero.

Cropland N r mitigation potential

To incorporate the results of the global meta-analysis the results were first integrated into the three N budget models (CHANS MAgPIE and IMAGE) using parameterizations (for NUE yield and emissions). Implementation of these identified measures could change the share of different N use and losses. The calculation of the N r mitigation potential was based on the mitigation efficiency of selected mitigation options for different countries obtained from the meta-analysis and the cropland N mass balance integrated with the N budget models. The percentage change in N losses by the impact of measures is assumed to be equal at the global level but because the N flux differs among countries the absolute change in N losses varies accordingly. Regional application of the integrated N budget model then allowed the outcomes to be assessed in relation to the national-level budgeting. Regional cropland N mitigation boundaries during the scenario analysis were respected. The detailed process of integration can be found in Supplementary Information 1.3.

The reduction of cropland N loss (ΔE ijk ) in the form of NH 3  NO x  N 2 O N leaching and N runoff in country/region i was calculated as:

$$\Delta {E}_{ijk}={A}_{ijk}\times [{{\rm{E}}{\rm{F}}}_{ij}\times {\eta }_{ijk}\times {X}_{ijk}]$$ (7)

in which j represents the form of N loss (NH 3  NO x  N 2 O emissions N leaching and/or N runoff) from cropland; A ijk is the cropland activity data (fertilizer use cropping area or production); EF ij is the corresponding uncontrolled emission factor for which uncontrolled refers to the baseline model; η ijk is the specific abatement efficacy; X ijk is the implementation rate of the abatement technique or options k and the baseline is zero that is no implementation of abatement measures.

Moreover the target NUE and yield in each country were used to constrain the overall mitigation potential when combining different measures because we did not need to apply all of these measures to achieve the target NUE. For measures that do not interact the mitigation potentials were added (cumulative impacts). For measures that interact we adopted the results from experiments that combined those measures to estimate their combined mitigation potential (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Cost–benefit analysis

On the basis of the changes of N r fluxes of national croplands N input and outputs under certain abatement measures the national N budgets data are used for the cost and benefit calculation. The mitigation costs for N pollution from global croplands in this study are defined as a direct expenditure (the sum of investment costs and operation costs) for the implementation of the 11 measures to reduce N loss from global croplands. Here we mainly refer to the database and methodology of the cost assessment from the online Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model45 to calculate the global and regional abatement costs. Country-specific agricultural conditions and farming practices have been considered in the GAINS model including local labour costs energy prices farm sizes costs of by-products and so on. All costs are in constant 2017 USD in this study. A detailed description of the GAINS model and cost calculation can be found in Klimont and Winiwarter45. The annual implementation cost (IC ik ) in country/region i and N term k is calculated as:

$${{\rm{I}}{\rm{C}}}_{ik}=\Delta {E}_{ik}\times {{\rm{U}}{\rm{C}}}_{ik}$$ (8)

in which UC ik represents the integrated unit abatement cost of the most appropriate set of mitigation options to reduce cropland N loss in country/region i which is derived from the online GAINS model database and adjusted according to country-specific farming practices; ΔE ik is the change in N emission in different forms such as NH 3 and N 2 O which are derived from the integrated modelling analysis in equation (7).

The societal benefits (SOC benefitik ) of mitigating N pollution from global croplands in this study is defined as the sum of avoided damage costs of premature mortality by air pollution (HH benefitik ) ecosystem health (EH benefitik ) yield benefit (YD benefitik ) and GHG mitigation benefit (GHG benefitik ) as shown in equation (9):

$${{\rm{SOC}}}_{{\rm{benefit}}ik}={{\rm{EH}}}_{{\rm{benefit}}ik}+{{\rm{HH}}}_{{\rm{benefit}}ik}+{{\rm{YD}}}_{{\rm{benefit}}ik}+{{\rm{GHG}}}_{{\rm{benefit}}ik}$$ (9)

Several USA and EU studies have examined the damage cost of N r effect on ecosystems4647484950515253. At present we do not have costs and benefits data available for other nations of the world. For this reason we assume that the unit N r damage costs (Supplementary Data 1 in the Excel file) to the ecosystems in the EU and the USA are also applicable to other countries after correction for differences in the willingness to pay (WTP) for ecosystem services to assess the benefits and trade-offs associated with N-related management actions for different areas as shown in equation (10):

$${{\rm{E}}{\rm{H}}}_{{\rm{b}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{f}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{t}}ik}=\sum _{j}\Delta {E}_{ijk}\times {{\rm{\partial }}}_{{\rm{U}}{\rm{S}}j}\times \frac{{{\rm{W}}{\rm{T}}{\rm{P}}}_{i}}{{{\rm{W}}{\rm{T}}{\rm{P}}}_{{\rm{U}}{\rm{S}}}}\times \frac{{{\rm{P}}{\rm{G}}{\rm{D}}{\rm{P}}}_{i}}{{{\rm{P}}{\rm{G}}{\rm{D}}{\rm{P}}}_{{\rm{U}}{\rm{S}}}}$$ (10)

in which ∂ US is the estimated unit ecosystem damage cost of N r emission in the USA in the 2000s4951; WTP i and WTP US are the values of the WTP for ecosystem service in country i and the USA respectively; PGDP i and PGDP US stand for the per capita gross domestic product (in constant 2017 USD) of country i and the USA respectively. The welfare implications of transforming damages are based on WTP; the data source of WTP can be found in Supplementary Data 2 in the Excel file.

The health benefit (HH benefitik ) refers to the benefit of prevented mortality derived from PM 2.5 mitigation caused by cropland N r abatement15. We derived the national-specific unit health damage costs of N r emission from the methodology of Gu et al.15 which connected the economic cost of mortality per unit of N r emission with the population density gross domestic product per capita urbanization and N-share. The calculation of health benefits from cropland N management is shown in equation (11):

$${{\rm{H}}{\rm{H}}}_{{\rm{b}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{f}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{t}}ik}=\sum _{j}\Delta {E}_{ijk}\times {{\rm{H}}{\rm{C}}{\rm{o}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{t}}}_{ij}$$ (11)

in which ΔE ij is the estimated reduction in cropland N r emissions and HCost ij represents the unit health damage cost of N r emissions (values can be found in Supplementary Data 2 in the Excel file).

The yield benefit (YD benefitik ) refers to the extra economic benefits from increased crop yield as shown in equation (12):

$${{\rm{Y}}{\rm{D}}}_{{\rm{b}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{f}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{t}}ik}=\Delta {H

u }_{ik}\times {{\rm{Y}}{\rm{P}}}_{ik}$$ (12)

in which ΔHν ik is the change in total harvest N from cropland and YP ik is the integrated crop price in USD per kg N calculated on the basis of the FAOSTAT database. The national specific value can be found in Supplementary Data 2 in the Excel file.

For monetary evaluation of the climate impact we used the regional-weighted N r damage cost to multiply with the reduction of N r emission as shown in equation (13):

$${{\rm{G}}{\rm{H}}{\rm{G}}}_{{\rm{b}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{f}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{t}}ik}=\sum _{j}\Delta {E}_{ijk}\times {{\rm{C}}{\rm{C}}{\rm{o}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{t}}}_{ij}$$ (13)

in which CCost ij represents the unit abatement cost to the climate in USD per kg N (values can be found in Supplementary Data 2 in the Excel file). We account for the effects in which N 2 O contributes to global warming whereas NO x and NH 3 emissions have a cooling effect on the global climate54.

Future scenario setting under the tiered approach

The business-as-usual scenario is a baseline scenario and is assumed to maintain current farming practices with no further improvement of cropland N management. Another three scenarios were assigned with three different packages of measures (Extended Data Table 1). The classification criteria of tiered measures mainly focuses on four aspects: mitigation efficacy technical threshold acceptance by farmers and implementation cost.

Incentivizing the implementation is complicated which is also the reason why many measures developed in the past decades are still not being implemented in many regions/countries. An example is the use of soil testing to rationalize N fertilizer rates and soil management. After confirming the mitigation effects local socioeconomic and natural conditions generally determine whether these measures should and can be implemented. For example EEFs should be acceptable for Chinese smallholders if the government subsidizes these fertilizers to have the same or even lower price compared with conventional fertilizers. However the 4R nutrient stewardship would not be easily applied for smallholders in China and elsewhere given the required knowledge transfer and machinery for the implementation. Therefore we assume that different measures could be applied in different countries based on their socioeconomic and natural conditions which are the key criteria of our tiered approach.

Generally different tiers are suitable for different regions and countries. We used targeted NUE as the final criterion to assess whether we need to implement more measures to achieve the goal. The implementation ratio of different measures in different countries is estimated on the basis of their socioeconomic and natural conditions. For instance some countries reported that they have a low implementation rate of EEFs owing to insufficient financial support. Then we would judge whether the NCS could support such an implementation for the targeted NUE. In African countries the lack of access to N fertilizers has caused soil N depletion and yield reduction. Thus other than mitigation measures we recommend more fertilizer use in these countries. This would slightly increase the N loss within the allowable N-carrying capacity in the planetary boundary.

For each measure we estimate different adoption rates and mitigation efficiencies by country on the basis of their croplands’ N budgets crop yield farm size and management practices as summarized in Supplementary Table 5. Human population (population density) and economic level (per capita gross domestic product) are two key determinants of future food demand and required N r harvest from cropland which are assumed to be consistent under all tiered scenarios. It is assumed that the adoption of measures will change the cropland N input NUE crop yield and cropping area to maintain the required N r harvest for human consumption. Details on data sources prediction methods and parameters can be found in Supplementary Information 1.

Amazon further solidified its spot as third-largest digital-ad platform in the US last year

For the first time in nearly a decade the two largest players in online advertising are no longer raking in the majority of US digital-ad dollars a decline that industry insiders expect to continue in years to come.

Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. accounted for a combined 48.4% of U.S. digital-ad spending in 2022 according to estimates from research firm Insider Intelligence Inc. Their combined U.S. market share hadn’t been under 50% since 2014 said Insider Intelligence which expects that number to drop to 44.9% this year.

The ad businesses of Google and Meta are still growing but Insider’s data suggest the pace is slower than the rest of the U.S. digital-advertising market. Insider forecasting analyst Zachary Goldner said the erosion of their combined market share was the result of brands having access to more advertising formats.

“All marketers want more options"" Mr. Goldner said.

Google and Meta each faced headwinds in 2022 as people spent less time online than in the early days of the pandemic; marketers concerned about a possible economic downturn reined in ad spending; Amazon.com Inc. and ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok continued their emergence as a force in digital advertising; and more streaming services started to embrace advertising.

Meta and other social-media companies including Snap Inc. also suffered from Apple Inc.’s 2021 decision to require apps on its devices to ask users if they wanted to be tracked. The majority of iPhone users opted not to be hitting the heart of Meta’s business: its ability to target ads at users with precision and prove to marketers that the ads generate sales.

Google wasn’t as affected by Apple’s move because its flagship search-ad business relies on customer intent—users’ search terms immediately reveal what they are interested in—rather than data collected from app and web tracking. Its U.S. digital-advertising market share slightly rose to 28.8% in 2022 Insider Intelligence said but is expected to fall to 26.5% this year.

Google didn’t respond to a request for comment. On the company’s most recent earnings call in October executives talked about how search-based advertising tends to do well during challenging economic times.

Meta had no comment. In its most recent earnings call Meta said the tracking restriction continued to affect its ad business but noted the effect had diminished.

Apple’s tracking restriction had an impact for emerging e-commerce companies which are important to Meta’s ad business. Supergut Chief Executive Marc Washington said the maker of gut-health products used to spend about 80% of its ad budget on Meta’s Facebook and Instagram platforms with the rest going to Google. In early 2022 he noticed that the cost of bringing in new customers through advertising on Meta’s platforms was twice as high as it was before Apple’s privacy changes. Supergut shifted about half of what it spent on Meta to TikTok a short-form video platform popular with younger audiences.

Mr. Washington said Meta remained Supergut’s most efficient advertising platform but said there are early indications of “TikTok ads performing as well and in some cases better than some of our Meta campaigns.""

TikTok’s command of the U.S. digital-ad market more than doubled in 2022 Insider Intelligence said thanks to its nearly 100 million U.S. monthly active users the virality of the platform and its hold over Gen Z millennials and influencers. Still its overall share remains small accounting for 2% of U.S. digital-ad spending according to Insider Intelligence which expects that number to grow to 2.5% this year.

The gains came as TikTok has received increased scrutiny from Washington D.C. over national-security concerns U.S. officials say the Chinese-owned app poses—accusations that TikTok has disputed. The company also faces competition from Google’s YouTube and Meta’s Instagram which have launched offerings that mimic its short-form video-recommendation format.

One already large digital-advertising player that gained market share in the U.S. last year was Amazon whose ad business is powered by its ability to target users by their purchase and browsing history. The e-commerce giant accounted for 11.7% of U.S. digital-ad spending last year and is poised to grow to 12.4% in 2023 Insider said.

“Our advertising is at the point where consumers are ready to spend"" Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on the company’s October conference call.

Sam Bloom chief executive of digital-ad agency Camelot Strategic Marketing and Media said some of its clients that had withheld selling on Amazon started doing so last year using Amazon ads to promote their products on the platform.

Other retailers have followed in Amazon’s footsteps by building digital-ad businesses based on their consumer data known as retail media networks. Combined Walmart Inc. eBay Inc. Etsy Inc. and Instacart took in about 1.4% of digital-ad dollars spent in the U.S. last year according to Insider.

Edwin Fu chief executive of Placements.io Inc. a tech company that works with digital- publishers and online retailers on billing systems for their ad inventory described the rise of retail media networks as a “massive race to do what Amazon did.""

Streaming services also are commanding a larger slice of the digital-advertising pie. Mr. Bloom said many of its clients are shifting their spending away from traditional television and toward video platforms in an effort to reach younger viewers.

Insider said Roku Inc. Walt Disney Co.’s Hulu Paramount Global‘s Pluto TV and Paramount+ Fox Corp.’s Tubi and Comcast Corp.’s Peacock accounted for about 3.6% of U.S. digital-ad spending last year. The trend is expected to accelerate now that the streaming industry’s two-largest players Netflix Inc. and Disney+ have launched ad-supported versions.

Vincent Létang executive vice president of global market research at Magna a media- investment firm that is part of Interpublic Group of Cos.‘ Mediabrands called Netflix and Disney’s entry into the market “a game-changing moment"" for ad-supported streaming. “They bring a potentially huge number of viewers"" he said and a wealth of premium video content.

Given the emergence of new digital-advertising alternatives Google and Meta’s declining market share is hardly surprising said digital ad consultant Ratko Vidakovic. The surprise was actually their 2021 performance an aberration that he said was caused by the pandemic.

U.S. digital-ad spending grew by a whopping 41% in 2021 according to media and data giant GroupM part of WPP PLC. That growth number dipped to 10.7% last year and is expected to slip to 9.2% this year. GroupM expects overall ad spending in the U.S.—excluding political advertising—to grow by 5.5% this year.

Despite the expectations of slowing growth digital-advertising platforms will take in an ever-larger share of ad dollars this year GroupM said: Nearly two-thirds of total U.S. ad spending is expected to go to digital advertising in 2023 compared with less than half in 2019 the last year before the pandemic.

As the calendar turns to 2023 Intuit’s leading technologists share the trends they’ll be watching closely. Ranging from the generative AI phenomenon the rise in data protection regulations and implications of Web3 for the fintech landscape to how “thinking like criminals” will pay off for companies looking to stave off bad actors Intuit leaders weigh in on what the future holds.

The takeaway? Opportunities to catalyze innovation abound for tech companies.

Heading into the new year Intuit’s technology experts share their points of view on the innovations set to take off in 2023 and beyond.

Generative AI is rapidly becoming more powerful and more prominent popularized by chatbots and apps such as ChatGPT and Lensa but it still needs to develop and mature before it can safely be used in industries where the accuracy of statements are critical such as finance or medicine. Within the next several years generative AI will likely play a pivotal role in helping create personalized conversational systems to provide financial or medical advice and guidance directly to customers. In the ideal scenario generative AI could provide human experts financial insights in areas such as cash flow and money movement.

Ashok Srivastava SVP & Chief Data Officer

The rise in data protection regulations will catalyze tech innovation to solve privacy challenges.

Companies are being challenged to unlock the full potential of the data they possess in a safe responsible and compliant way spurring opportunities for privacy-enhancing technology (PET) innovation. New methods of employing cryptography on data sets and masking or transforming information to include less personally identifiable data will enable more collaboration analysis and protective data sharing. Altogether accelerating adoption of a privacy-by-design approach to product development. We’ll see a rise in investment in this technology to harness the power of information for consumers in a safer more trustworthy way.

Elise Houlik Chief Privacy Officer

Fintech market set to fundamentally change driven by Web3 and tech acquisitions.

The fintech market will see massive fundamental changes from a variety of factors including the advent of Web3 and from huge technology acquisitions that most believe will open up the Internet. Web3 will provide more control for users—digital ownership and a distributed Internet based on standards—that will fundamentally affect fintech by speeding decentralization. We’re going to see fewer building blocks in fintech and these building blocks will be critical for companies and for those using embedded finance. We’ll see superhighways that become the consumer-trusted data and information connection between companies.

Alex Balazs SVP & Chief Architect

Thinking security-first will pay off for companies.

In a hyper-personalized world where companies are balancing the pressures of hyper-personalization and privacy within the context of regionally evolving regulations and customer expectations there’s a fundamental shift in product development with guardrails built in by design from the very beginning. Thinking like criminals think is becoming a common practice. Predicting how bad actors are going to behave becomes an integral part of product and business strategy.

Companies that think about product security and risk up front—from day zero—and not treat it as an afterthought or when they’ve been hacked or attacked will succeed. They’ll make the product experience better—great for customers and bad for criminals—and also design it in a way that’s delightful and responsible.

Atticus Tysen SVP & Chief Information Security Officer

We’re seeing AI and powerful data capabilities redefine the security models and capabilities for companies. Security practitioners and the industry as a whole will have much better tools and much faster information at their disposal and they should be able to isolate security risks with much greater precision. They’ll also be using more marketing-like techniques to understand anomalous behavior and bad actions. In due time we may very well see parties using AI to infiltrate systems attempt to take over software assets through ransomware and take advantage of the cryptocurrency markets.

The “Come to TurboTax” effort includes both a Netflix ad and a Super Bowl spot the brand’s 10th year at the big game.

‍

“After decades of leadership in the online tax preparation category TurboTax has become synonymous with DIY Taxes (or DIY Tax Software)” said Cathleen Ryan SVP of Marketing at Intuit TurboTax in response to emailed questions. “With this year’s campaign we’re changing that narrative by letting customers know they can come to TurboTax and NOT do their taxes. We believe that TurboTax has the best assisted tax experience in the market – people can sit down from the comfort and privacy of their homes and in one meeting have their taxes prepared signed filed and then get back to doing what they love – Not Taxes.”

The “Come to TurboTax” campaign includes seven spots that play up the ease of using TurboTax’s software to file taxes. So easy in fact that you don’t even have to do your taxes. The integrated campaign created in partnership with Wieden+Kennedy will run across broadcast digital audio and will also include digital partnerships with Roku Twitch Spotify and BuzzFeed as well as the Netflix ad and Super Bowl spot.

“The campaign is speaking directly to those taxpayers that typically have their taxes prepared for them each year” added Ryan “For over 20 years TurboTax has been helping millions of Americans easily prepare their own taxes. We have high brand recognition and have established TurboTax as the DIY tax leader but consumers don’t often think of TurboTax when it comes to assisted tax prep. With this campaign we are targeting the 88M assisted tax filers and showing them that with TurboTax Live they can meet with a Tax Expert who can prepare their taxes for them.”

This is the third year in a row that that company’s brand campaign highlights TurboTax Live offerings.

“TurboTax has always been focused on helping people easily and accurately get the refund they deserve” adds Ryan. “With this campaign we’re highlighting the sense of relief people feel when their taxes are done and off their mind so they can get back to what they love – Not Taxes.”"

One way to reduce this damage is by limiting the size and number of incisions they must make to get into the patient’s body.

This is the idea behind minimally invasive robotic surgery — the idea that surgeons can achieve similar results but with smaller and fewer incisions.

And now with single incision robotic surgery that vision is advancing even further. First used clinically four years ago this innovative approach has the potential to further reduce scarring as well as enable new approaches to existing procedures.

“It’s allowing us to do surgeries differently than we do with [multi-port surgery]” says Dr. Michael Stifelman director of robotic surgery at Hackensack University Medical Center (HUMC) in New Jersey. “What every patient wants is to get back to their life. Single-port robotics is allowing us to get them to that point more quickly.”

Watch our video on single-incision surgery:

What is single-incision surgery?

Over the years robotic surgery systems have mostly had multiple arms. Single-incision surgery is done via a system with just one arm. The single arm houses several instruments which emerge from the arm once it enters the body cavity — this allows the surgeon to use multiple tools at once through a single small entry point.

One of the leaders in single-incision technology is Intuitive which for more than 25 years has been the pioneer in minimally invasive robotic surgical care. Among the robotic surgical systems Intuitive makes is the da Vinci SP (the SP stands for “single-port”). This system includes only one arm rather than the four arms featured on the company’s flagship da Vinci multi-port system.

So far surgeons globally have used single-incision surgery to operate on a wide range of tissue types including prostate bladder kidney gallbladder and appendix. It has also been used for bariatric procedures.

By contrast other surgical approaches typically require more or larger incisions. In open surgery the surgeon cuts through a larger swath of skin and tissue to gain a broader view of the necessary organs. Even other minimally invasive procedures typically involve between three and five incisions.

Dr. Stifelman one of the first surgeons to begin using single-incision surgery in the U.S. says that reducing the number and size of incisions has been his focus since he was just starting out in the field.

“When I was training pretty much all the surgeries we did were through big incisions” he says. “Even if you had to deal with a small area of the body you still had to make a pretty big incision to get there… I realized there’s got to be a better way.”

What makes it a game changer?

Dr. Stifelman says that many of his patients appreciate the reduced scarring from single-incision procedures. “We can do very complex reconstructive procedures through just a small incision in [the patient’s] belly button where it’s completely hidden” he says.

“What every patient wants is to get back to their life.” Dr. Michael Stifelman

For some patients the benefits can be more significant. Patients with heavy internal scarring from previous procedures for example might not be good candidates for open surgery or multi-port robotic surgery because it’s too risky. For these patients a single-incision approach may allow them to have the procedure they need.

Such complex cases can bring great satisfaction says Dr. Stifelman’s HUMC colleague surgeon Mutahar Ahmed. “When you see one patient [two years after surgery] and he’s able to urinate normally and this patient says ‘Doc thanks for giving me my life back’ that’s the key” he says. “That’s the energy [you need] to get through the next tough case.”

Intuitive is equally excited about the potential of single-incision surgery. “We’re providing surgeons with another tool in their toolbox” says Iman Jeddi who oversees the company’s SP operation. “We’re at the beginning of this journey and there is a lot of possibility that the future holds for us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2tlbm9zaGFuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL21pbGVzdG9uZS1pbi1yb2JvdGljLXN1cmdlcnktYWNoaWV2ZWQtbG9jYWxseS9hcnRpY2xlX2YwMGJiNWVhLTg3YzQtMTFlZC04N2NiLTEzMmNmNWMxYzVhZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Milestone in robotic surgery achieved locally,"Early on the morning of Dec. 23 2022 Dr. Majed Jandali performed his 3000th surgical procedure using robotic technology and the surgical equipment of the da Vinci robot.

The procedure was the removal of a patient’s gallbladder and gallstones known as a cholecystectomy.

“The procedure was difficult but I was able to do it safely and efficiently in about 15 minutes without any complications” Dr. Jandali reported following the surgery.

Dr. Jandali is a Froedtert South general surgeon who has been performing surgical procedures with the assistance of da Vinci robots since 2015.

Earlier this autumn he had reached the benchmark of 2700 surgical procedures with the robots.

Most of Dr. Jandali’s surgeries are to the abdominal cavity for hernia repair colon cancer or polyps rectal cancer and gall bladder surgeries. “I also perform many bariatric surgeries to reduce the size of a patient’s stomach promoting weight loss” he said.

Although the robotic platform has not changed much in the past few years use of the technology has increased as surgeons have mastered it says Dr. Jandali.

Today “all minimally invasive general surgery at Froedtert South is done utilizing the robotic platform” Dr. Jandali said. “The staff is well trained and we can use it 24/7 including weekends nights and holidays.”

Dr. Jandali’s success with surgical robotic technology has convinced him the surgical robot is an integral tool of the surgical trade. “I consistently see the tremendous benefits of robotic assisted surgery for my patients” he said.

The advantages of the technology include the ability of a surgeon to address more complex medical procedures and for patients to experience reduced pain following surgery he notes.

Dr. Jandali’s achievement of his 3000th robotically assisted surgery was marked with a cake presented by Alex Wantoch a representative of Intuitive the manufacturer of the da Vinci robot used in these procedures.

According to Wantoch there are fewer than 50 surgeons nationwide that have performed this number of robotic surgeries.

“Dr. Jandali performs more cases in one month than most surgeons achieve in five or six months” Wantoch said.

To achieve these numbers within this timeframe means that Dr. Jandali’s caseload is much higher than many other surgeons noted a Froedtert South administrator.

“Reaching the 3000th robotic procedure makes me very happy that I was able to introduce and implement the state-of-the-art surgical care for my patients and our community” he said.

Froedtert South has been committed to robotic assisted surgery for over a decade. It is one of just five surgical centers in Wisconsin with three or more surgical robots. The robotic assisted surgical center is also one of 30 nationwide that brings general surgeons from across the country to observe Froedtert South surgeons perform robotic assisted surgeries.

“I am among the 25 busiest robotic assisted general surgeons in the country using the state of-the-art da Vinci Xi surgical robots” notes Dr. Jandali. “The commitment of administration and operating room staff as well as my belief in using technology as a way of improving surgical outcomes is the reason for the high volume I do at Froedtert South.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMy8wMS8wMy8yNTgyMDgxLzAvZW4vZ2xvYmFsLW1pbmltYWxseS1pbnZhc2l2ZS10aG9yYWNpYy1zdXJnZXJ5LW1hcmtldC10by1yZWFjaC00LTQtYmlsbGlvbi1ieS0yMDI3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global Minimally Invasive Thoracic Surgery Market to Reach $4.4 Billion by 2027,"New York Jan. 03 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report ""Global Minimally Invasive Thoracic Surgery Industry"" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06032236/?utm_source=GNW

Case in point: single-port robotic surgery a relatively new type of approach where a robotic system controlled by a human surgeon executes the procedure by making only one incision into the patient.

Although still relatively uncommon single-port surgery has been gaining momentum in recent years. The benefits are noticeable. Compared to traditional surgery single-port surgery might leave patients with shorter recovery times less scarring and overall better outcomes.

The technique is also transforming how surgeons think about and execute surgery itself. “It’s allowing us to do surgeries differently than we do with [multi-port surgery]” said Michael Stifelman M.D. director of robotic surgery at Hackensack University Medical Center. “What every patient wants is to get back to their life. Single-port robotics is allowing us to get them to that point more quickly.”

The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) tracks the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index which includes all constituents in the S&P 500 but gives them equal weights at each quarterly rebalance. The portfolio overlap as measured by the percentage of index weights held in common between the S&P 500 and equal weighting is 52% as of September 30 according to S&P Dow Jones Indexes.

The S&P 500 declined -18.1% in 2022 compared to RSP’s decline of -11.6% each on a total return basis. While equal weight consistently outperformed last year the gap between RSP and the S&P 500 widened substantially during the fourth quarter.

Equal weight’s methodology of selling relative winners and buying relative losers adds factor tilts to a portfolio. As of the end of the third quarter the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index tilts towards small size (47.8%) value (33.4%) and dividend (15.6%) compared to the S&P 500. It also has a tilt away from quality (-23.7%) low volatility (-6.0%) high beta (-4.5%) and momentum (-3.1%) according to S&P Dow Jones Indexes.

The Invesco ESG S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSPE) offers the same methodology as RSP but implements a screen for ESG criteria. RSPE declined -12.2% in 2022 maintaining a lead over the S&P 500 throughout last year.

Holdings in RSP that have been screened out of RSPE include FedEx Corp. (FDX) Duke Realty Corp. (DRE) Boeing Co. (BA) Incyte Corp. (INCY) Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST) Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings (LH) Zoetis Inc. (ZTS) Arthur J Gallagher & Co. (AJG) and FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS) among others.

RSP and RSPE each charge a 20 basis point expense ratio.

Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine in February sent shockwaves through global markets as western governments were quick to implement financial sanctions keen to make Russia an economic pariah.

In crypto land the terra crash last May and the dramatic collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX in November created one of the harshest ‘crypto winter’ for investors in digital currencies and the broader ecosystem.

The crash has even led several crypto issuers – including Bitpanda and ETC Group – to pull their ETPs from the market on low demand.

However equities were down across the board as rising interest rates hit tech stocks particularly hard with some thematic ETFs falling dramatically.

While bonds offered little respite in 2022 a historic month for UK gilts following former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s ‘mini budget’ was enough to make sure the asset class was one of the worst performing over the last 12 months.

Russian assets trapped

Investors in Russia-focused ETFs were likely the biggest losers this year with the products essentially losing their entire value overnight. Following the rapid closure of the Russian markets ETF issuers were left scrambling to understand what impact it would have on their products.

The fast-moving situation was sparked when the Moscow Exchange shut just a few days after the invasion leaving the world’s largest index provider MSCI to label the market “uninvestable”.

ETF issuers swiftly suspended creation and redemption orders on Russian ETFs closing primary markets. Exchanges globally then halted trading of Russia ETFs until further notice shutting off the secondary market.

According to Bloomberg Intelligence standalone Russia ETFs saw almost all of their $4bn assets under management (AUM) wiped off between the end of January and mid-March as asset managers wrote down the value of their assets.

Can any ETF assets escape from Russia?

In the months ensuing asset managers decided to terminate their Russia ETFs with BlackRock Invesco and DWS all delisting their products.

As it stands the Lyxor PEA Russia MSCI Russia IMI Select GDR UCITS ETF (PRUS) Lyxor MSCI Russia UCITS ETF (RUS) and HSBC MSCI Russia Capped UCITS ETF (HRUD) are Europe’s remaining Russia ETFs.

The ‘crypto winter’ freeze

The crypto winter turned into an ice blast in the second half of 2022 after the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange FTX went bankrupt leaving the industry in a tailspin.

However the industry had already faced a tumultuous six months following the collapse of terra which led several ETP issuers to shutter their ETPs having lost almost 100% of their value.

Meanwhile ETPs tracking bitcoin have also underperformed significantly with the cryptocurrency down over 64% last year.

Crypto equity products were the worst-performing ETFs over the last 12 months a sign the pain was felt across broader digital assets and the technology that backs them.

The VanEck Crypto and Blockchain Innovators UCITS ETF (DABG) returned -86.6% over the period while the ETC Group Digital Assets & Blockchain Equity UCITS ETF (KOIP) returned -77.3%. Elsewhere the Invesco CoinShares Global Blockchain UCITS ETF (BCHS) faired a little better but still fell 52.4%.

There are signs things could get worse for the industry. The second-largest crypto exchange Binance is now under the spotlight after it temporarily halted withdrawals of the stablecoin USDC last December.

Thematics feel the pain

ETFs investing in tech-driven megatrends such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence posted high double-digit negative returns as the tech sector faced headwinds including inflation rising interest rates and an economic slowdown.

The tech-driven Nasdaq 100 hit harder than most by these headwinds is down 33.8% over 2022 versus 19.9% for the S&P 500.

The worst-performing ETF in this category was the HANetf's Global Online Retail UCITS ETF (PBUY) which returned -72.2%.

This was followed by the WisdomTree Cloud Computing UCITS ETF (KLWD) and the Global X Fintech UCITS ETF (FING) which returned -54.3% and -53.5% respectively.

Other themes that performed poorly were cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. The WisdomTree Cybersecurity UCITS ETF (CYSE) was down 44.2% for the year followed by the L&G Artificial Intelligence UCITS ETF (AIAG) which returned -41.2%.

Meanwhile the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence UCITS ETF (BOTZ) and the WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence UCITS ETF (INTL) fell 43.5% and 43.1% respectively.

The UK gilt meltdown

The UK gilt market was sent into meltdown at the end of September after Chancellor Kwarteng unleashed extravagant spending plans and unfunded tax cuts that sent 30-year gilt yields to a two-decade high.

Responding to the yield volatility gilt ETFs experienced double-digit losses in September confounding a poor year for UK government bonds.

A historic month for UK gilt ETFs

Leading the way was the longer-dated SPDR Bloomberg 15+ Year Gilt UCITS ETF (GLTL) which returned -46.9% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile the iShares £ Index-Linked Gilts UCITS ETF (INXG) returned -41.8% followed by -41% for the Lyxor Core FTSE Actuaries UK Gilts Inflation-Linked UCITS ETF (GILI).

The ETFs experienced somewhat of a comeback in Q4 following the demise of the Liz Truss government and the end of the ‘growth at all costs’ policy with INXG and GILI 13.5% and 12.8% up since the end of September.

Once Struck Out Babe Ruth In Iron Mountain,"There are some things in baseball that are timeless much like the fabled ""called shot"" that legend has said Babe Ruth made before blasting a homerun. That story has had many different tales of what went down but one thing that can't be denied is the fact that ""The Babe"" was one of the all-time greatest sluggers in the game. When people think of baseball he's one of the most thought of names in the game so when a pitcher was able to strike him out it must have felt amazing.

Looking back now it could be considered a BIG deal and that's just what one pitcher accomplished and it took place in the Upper Peninsula.

There is a photograph of George Herman ""Babe"" Ruth who is dressed in his New York Yankees jersey posing with Nello ""Fungo"" Tedeschi at an exhibition game that was played in Iron Mountain on October 28 1926. Tedeschi one of the pitchers for the opposing local Iron Mountain team who was also a Michigan pitcher succeeded in striking Ruth out.

Iron Mountain News detailed the game which was held shortly after the Yanks lost to the Cardinals in the World Series. Babe would join one of the two local all-star groups for an exhibition game:

The Cardinals defeated the Yankees four games to three in the best-of-seven series which took place from Oct. 2 to 10 1926 at Yankee Stadium and Sportsman’s Park. This was the first World Series appearance as well as the first National League pennant win for the Cardinals. The Yankees were playing in their fourth World Series in six years after winning their first American League pennant in 1921 and their first world championship in 1923.

The publication labeled the game as “the greatest baseball attraction ever to be staged in the upper peninsula” and would later see The Babe crush a 3-run homer but ultimately led to Ruth driving flyballs to the outfield for 15 minutes for the excitement of the crowd. The score was never recorded but it must have been one of the most memorable moments for the U.P.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5ubXUuZWR1L2FsdW1udXMtZmlyc3QteWVhci1lbGVtZW50YXJ5LXByaW5jaXBhbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alumnus in First Year as Elementary Principal | Northern Today,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.nmu.edu', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /alumnus-first-year-elementary-principal (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E5343D60>, 'Connection to news.nmu.edu timed out.

(WLUC) - As the New Year has begun so have new terms for elected legislators. Former Representative Beau LaFave of Iron Mountain was term-limited and was unable to seek re-election.

LaFave has found a new role in Lansing. He has served in the 108th Michigan State House District for the last six years. Because of term limits the Republican could not seek re-election in November. However he won’t go far.

“Representative [Greg] Markkanen has asked me--and I have accepted--to join him in Lansing in crafting legislation and working on policies related to the workings of Upper Michigan and how we can make things better in the Upper Peninsula” LaFave said. “I could not have picked a better boss to work for.”

LaFave was term-limited in the house but Proposal 2 on November’s ballot changed the term limits for state representatives. Since it passed he is no longer term-limited in the house.

“Now we have changed it” LaFave said. “We brought it down from 14 to 12 years but it can be served in either chamber.”

LaFave said he currently has no intention of running for re-election in Iron Mountain because his home address is now part of the 110th District.

When reflecting on his six years in office he said he was proud to bring the U.P. voice to Lansing on important issues like lowering Michigan’s car insurance rates.

“I am incredibly proud of that work” LaFave said. “We are still the highest in the country but we lowered them significantly.”

The Kingsford graduate said he looks forward to working with Representative Markkanen and is grateful for the support over the last six years.

A change in ownership transformed humble Trimble Hot Springs into world-class Durango Hot Springs Resort & Spa.

With an Olympic-size pool and two hot soaking tubs century-old Trimble Hot Springs had long offered greater appeal for local families than traveling glitterati. But when that swimming pool fell into a state of disrepair in the winter of 2018-’19 a trio of investors offered to revive not just the pool but the entire property. “Our vision is to be a wellness facility that can compete on the national and global scene” says Bryan Yearout one of the purchasing partners. After executing a complete overhaul of the facilities located eight miles north of Durango the ownership team opened Durango Hot Springs Resort & Spa in August 2020 with a swimming pool four hot pools and a promise that more was to come. Now Yearout and company’s grand vision is nearing completion. Boasting 40 soaking tubs (an adult soak is $39) plus a swimming pool reflexology path and rain tower—all complemented by a day spa clubhouse and an outdoor stage and amphitheater—Durango Hot Springs has broadened its appeal.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays in the warmer months bands from the local music scene take to the stage. The tunes can be heard from each of the soaking options most of which are adult-only and nestled among the hills or set amid gardens that make Durango Hot Springs look like a botanic park.

Further separating this steamy destination from others in the Centennial State and around the world its source water contains very little sulfur has 34 different minerals and is enhanced by two technologies that are so far unique to Durango Hot Springs. One treatment infuses the spring water with nano-size oxygen bubbles that are tiny enough to be absorbed by the skin’s pores. (Oxygen rebuilds muscle and could even enhance your mood with some advocates claiming it reduces stress and promotes sleep.) The other treatment changes the molecular structure of the water’s minerals causing them to bind together so they remain in solution and feel soft rather than sticky on soakers’ skin.

Durango Hot Springs didn’t stop at fancy water though. The wellness theme continues at the newly built spa where a meditation garden offers bodywork clients an outdoor relaxation area in addition to an indoor lounge. Guests can opt to purchase the Trimble Day Club pass a $150 option that provides access to a separate facility with a sun deck as well as private changing rooms and the opportunity to claim one of eight cedar soaking tubs. “We appeal to the whole spectrum of hot springs lovers” Yearout says. “People who want solitude people who like a social scene and parents with kids. We have a way to please all of those guests.”

Bigger and Better—But Still Perfectly Weird

Desert Reef’s recent improvements didn’t alter its personality.

“Development” can be a dirty word among hot springers who often prefer a light touch when nature’s plumbing gets upgraded. The makeover at 37-year-old clothing-optional Desert Reef near Florence follows this philosophy. The just-completed renovation refurbished the existing 36-by-50-foot pool added four new pools to the main area and created five smaller ones which can be privately rented. Visitors can now sleep on-site in one of five vintage Airstream campers or five tiny homes the latter of which are outfitted with private pools. Says co-owner Chris McLaughlin “We’re letting more people in but we’re staying small because nobody enjoys a crowded pool—or at least we don’t.”

Fortunately crowding has never been an issue at this tucked-away attention-shy resort where a weekday soak runs $25. Not only has Desert Reef limited the number of swimmers at any given time since its early days but the refuge has also kept itself so secret that many residents of Florence don’t even know about it.

Despite the recent improvements and the addition of overnight accommodations Desert Reef has held tight to its eccentricities. Although the facility is working on a liquor license for now it’s BYOB. Cell phones are forbidden in the pool area. Males (solo or in groups) aren’t admitted unless accompanied by their partners or women. Youths under 18 years old can only enter if they book a private hot spring rental. To preserve a tranquil vibe guests can’t drive to their units so visitors tote their luggage in carts. But if you dig the idea of keeping quirky places weird you’ll love this clandestine getaway—not despite its idiosyncrasies but because of them.

The Naked Truth

Skinny-dipping in a San Luis Valley hot spring taught me the beauty of being au naturel in nature.

I was looking for a place to camp on the way home from a wedding in Santa Fe New Mexico. There was to be a total supermoon eclipse that September night and my husband and I are just woo-woo enough to be into such things. So when I found Valley View Hot Springs a campground with six natural soaking holes and three human-made pools tucked along the Sangre de Cristo Mountains my toes tingled in my Birkenstocks. Then I read the fine print: Owned by the nonprofit Orient Land Trust Valley View’s 2200 acres are entirely clothing-optional.

Were we hippie enough for that? I was a little apprehensive but I booked a site and figured we’d find out. After arriving we pitched our tent and explored our options hiking from one pond to another. The people we encountered walking around were clothed something of a necessity given the late fall chill. Most of the folks soaking were not. But we soon realized it was like being in a yoga class: No matter how self-conscious you feel no one’s paying attention to you. Especially in a place where the stunning landscape gives you something to ogle instead.

As dusk fell we found a little soaker occupied by just one other couple. We made small talk while we shyly disrobed and slipped in. The giant moon rose over a peak to the east and slowly turned red-brown as it passed through the Earth’s shadow. Watching I felt truly one with the surrounding terrain—nothing separating my skin from the warm mineral waters the gravelly bottom and the bats swooping inches from my face to snap up insects from the cool night air. I decided it wasn’t weird at all to be sans swimsuit but instead the most natural thing in the world. —Jessica LaRusso

Improving Upon Perfection

The already über-luxe cabins at Dunton Hot Springs get a face-lift.

It’s a rare occurrence that someone leaves Dunton Hot Springs feeling like the property fell short. But that’s precisely why this all-inclusive luxury resort near Telluride is refreshing all lodging interiors and remodeling some of its 1880s-era cabins: There was nothing wrong with the existing window treatments towels and furnishings but here “nice” simply isn’t good enough. Since 2001 when this former mining village got upcycled into high-end lodging dining and soaking facilities the destination has devoted itself to delivering spectacular service and aesthetics. So in fall 2022 Dunton began redecorating the guest accommodations and one of them—New House—was remodeled to make it accessible to guests using wheelchairs. “Everything should feel new” says Dunton Hot Springs spokesperson Christina Rossi.

With that in mind Dunton also added a “new” cabin to its portfolio this year for a total of 14. A 19th-century building called Chuck’s that had been used for staff housing is now a four-bedroom guesthouse catering to families and groups. The basement bunkrooms are perfect for tykes and teens. On the main and upper levels you’ll find two bedrooms one with a queen bed and one with a king. And the location is prime: One of only two Dunton accommodations to sit right on the banks of the babbling West Dolores River Chuck’s includes a deck that overlooks the water.

Dunton’s saloon and dance hall are also slated for an expansion to be completed by late 2023. Yet embracing the new has never prevented this property from appreciating what’s old—including the cabins’ hand-hewn logs and Butch Cassidy’s signature carved into the antique wooden bar. The kitchen’s creations have earned Dunton admission into the Relais & Châteaux network of epicure-pleasing properties (and Bon Appétit has ranked this getaway among America’s top five foodie destinations) but it isn’t the house-made granola or the iron-skillet lamb loin that makes Dunton Hot Springs revered among jet-setters: It’s that the nearly 200-acre property includes steaming hot springs that bubble up beneath staggering views of the jagged San Juan Mountains.

Most guests take the waters—soaking is included with your stay—at the bathhouse which has floor-to-rafter windows that provide views of 14256-foot Mt. Wilson. Two more plein-air pools (at the 107-degree source of the springs and beside the bathhouse where the water is closer to 103 degrees) promote sky-watching. And two cabins feature private soaking spots: Well House includes an indoor spring that’s available year-round while Dunton Store has an 85-degree outdoor soaker that’s open in summer. So while the cabins’ sunflower showerheads feel great and the museum-quality art gratifies the eye what guests truly cherish is the Earth’s watery embrace.

Mining for Heat

Have all of Colorado’s hot springs already been discovered? Far from it says Steve Beckley who developed Glenwood Springs’ Iron Mountain Hot Springs and is planning to launch a new hot spring destination in Utah. We asked him what it takes to discover new sources of steamy satisfaction.

5280: How do you know where to look for new hot springs?

Steve Beckley: I worked in geology for many years. After graduating from Colorado School of Mines with a degree in petroleum engineering I went into the oil and gas industry and eventually moved to Glenwood Springs to build Glenwood Caverns. So I have that background but I also did a lot of research into geothermal studies of Colorado.

Can anyone do that research?

Yes. The Colorado Geological Survey published a bulletin called “An Appraisal of Colorado’s Geothermal Resources.” It was intended to explore the potential for energy production and identified bright spots where people might be able to make steam and turn a turbine. But you can also look at those bright spots to see which ones are relatively accessible and which ones might supply a usable flow of water.

And there’s untapped potential?

Sure because most of the recent geothermal exploration hasn’t been for wellness like it was in the 1800s when a lot of America’s hot springs were developed as healing centers. Since then Western medicine has dominated our approach to health but over the past decade I’ve seen a greater interest in the wellness potential of mineral springs and I believe there will be a lot more hot springs developed in the future.

Kids-Free Zone

A Glenwood Springs–based hot springs resort isn’t kicking out the kiddos—it’s just making more room for the grown-ups.

Iron Mountain Hot Springs opened in 2015 with 16 little soaking ponds a jetted spa and a freshwater family pool that made for a more intimate experience than that at its sprawling neighbor the Glenwood Hot Springs Pool. When the cozy concept proved to be even more popular than anticipated Iron Mountain’s ownership increased the property’s soaking capacity for adults—without changing its commitment to the kiddie crowd.

To be fully completed by summer 2023 the 21-and-older-only expansion will boast 10 additional small dippers plus a 55-degree cold plunge feature and a pair of two-tiered freshwater ponds connected by a waterfall. “We reproduced the most popular features from the original layout” says general manager Aaron McCallister. Guests loved the two riverside pools and the ones with rounded foot-massaging stones embedded in the bottoms—so all of the new pools have reflexology floors and sit beside the Colorado. Plus the area’s new Sand Bar cafe will serve several frozen cocktails which guests can sip while soaking or on the heated patio.

Iron Mountain is also growing its experience program which re-creates the mineral makeup of famous hot springs around the world: The sulfur- and silica-rich potion found at Iceland’s Blue Lagoon the therapeutic mineral blend from Kinosaki Japan and the skin-nourishing springs of Amman Jordan are among the 10 rotating recipes that let bathers sample something different. Not that Iron Springs’ wells which are high in relaxation-inducing sulfate and iron and include 12 other minerals aren’t perfectly restorative.

A timed reservation system ensures the complex never feels overrun—with adults or children who are still welcome in the original footprint. (Kids under five are limited to the Family Pool.) Still weekends buzz with bathing and imbibing because the existing cafe was already popular for the quality of its food and beverage offerings: Thin-crust pizzas use a cauliflower dough that’s adored by both sides of the gluten-free fence and batch-made cocktails only add to the relaxation quotient. Winter specials include cider spiked with Stoneyard Distillery’s Cinnamon Fire. That plus the 108-degree water can thaw the deepest chill.

Overloved

Rampant abuse prompted “No Trespassing” signs at Rico Hot Springs where owners devised a friendly way to minimize unruly swimmers.

Dave Bulson who has lived near Telluride for three decades recalls the glory days of the state’s undeveloped hot springs. “I remember Colorado before the internet” he says “when you could only hear about hot springs by word-of-mouth.”

Things are different now of course. But Bulson still likes taking the waters so much that in October 2020 he and his wife Michelle Haynes purchased land beside the Dolores River where molybdenum prospectors had punctured a warm artesian spring which now breaches the earth in several spots along the waterway. Known as Rico Hot Springs the couple’s milky mineral-laden spring emerges at 109 degrees and collects in a travertine-lined pool four feet deep and 10 feet around before flowing through a wooden flume that feeds a 106-degree secondary pond.

Tucked beneath an embankment flanking CO 145 Rico Hot Springs was easy to reach—for those in the know. For a long time that consisted of the 250 Rico residents who cherished their local secret. But as social media spread the word litter proliferated. Then as the pandemic wore on more visitors arrived and created conflict. “People took up residency there” says Bulson who had been happy to allow responsible locals to use his springs. But when squatters and human feces proliferated sanitation became a concern. Multiple incidents of assault and drug use prompted calls to police but with the nearest law enforcement station located 90 minutes away regulation was scarce.

“The last thing in the world we wanted to do was to put up a big fence” Bulson says. But in 2021 the couple installed a gate and “No Trespassing” signs. They also drew up a legal waiver that locals could sign and submit to visit the spring at will. Although he’s received a few complaints about the closure he says most people understand the change was warranted. “They may not like it but they understand” he says. Compliance is “pretty good” he adds because locals are educating outsiders about the change in policy.

“In our own imperfect way we’ve preserved what we feel is an important aspect of hot springs in Colorado” Bulson says. Developed soaking spots abound he says “but it’s different when you walk through the mud and the willows to find a hot spring and those places are disappearing.”

The Holdouts

Undeveloped soaking spots in Colorado remain at South Canyon Hot Springs located four miles west of Glenwood Springs beside South Canyon Creek Road and at Penny Hot Springs south of Carbondale near mile marker 55 on CO 133. If you’re willing to hike try Piedra River Hot Springs west of Pagosa Springs. Starting from the Sheep Creek trailhead it’s a 1.4-mile hike downhill to the rock-lined riverside pools. All of these sites are experiencing increased visitation and misuse à la Rico. If you go bring respect for the landscape and future visitors along with you.

A New Romance

Mt. Princeton Hot Springs adds steamy accommodations perfect for couples who want an escape.

Like a well-loved summer camp Mt. Princeton Hot Springs has a comfortable timeworn feel. Given that the resort dates back to 1897 that’s not a huge surprise. Now though glittering new on-site lodging options have boosted the getaway’s style points and created romantic cocoons for couples looking for some sizzling alone time. In spring 2022 10 suites with leather couches marble bathrooms and balconies overlooking Chalk Creek came online; then this winter another creekside building (comprising 10 suites) joined the fold. Upper-level units feature vaulted ceilings gas fireplaces and kitchenettes with stainless steel appliances while ground-level accommodations have microwaves and minifridges.

The so-called Creekside Suites sit near the property’s growing network of recreational trails which becomes all the more compelling when you learn that each night’s lodging fee includes two days of complimentary mountain bike fat bike snowshoe or cross-country ski rentals. Hot springs also sit just beyond your door. (A weekday adult soak is $35.) The Creekside Hot Springs in Chalk Creek are completely undeveloped so soakers can stack or remove stones to adjust the temperature (the hottest flows measure a scorching 120 degrees) in the sandy-bottomed one-foot-deep pools.

A five-minute walk from the Creekside Suites leads to the resort’s main concentration of spring-fed pools including a lap pool soaking pool and water slide as well as an infinity pool framed by 14275-foot Mt. Antero. You can even claim some of those pools for yourself: Since 2019 guests have been able to rent one of several soaking spots for private use typically after the springs close to the public. (Times vary and rates start at $125 for 90 minutes.) Choose from the cascading spa pools the infinity pool (which can be paired with a reservation for the 400-foot water slide) or the Creekside springs. Between that exclusivity and the cozy new couples’ nests Mt. Princeton is now a roosting spot for lovebirds.

Schneider began transferring some business to UP last year in anticipation of the full move on Jan. 1.

“Schneider’s intermodal operations on Union Pacific transitioned seamlessly as the companies collaborated closely over the last year to align operations technology sales and customer teams in preparation for the service change” Schneider said in a news release. “There was no disruption to Schneider’s customers during the transition. The move is also a pivotal step in the carrier’s plans to double its intermodal size by 2030 and continue to reduce its carbon footprint.”

Schneider says it can offer service to more places thanks to UP’s partnership with CSX Transportation in the East.

“We believe the move in the West means we can offer our customers a distinct differentiator in the market” Jim Filter Schneider group president of transportation and logistics said in a statement. “The combination of more coast-to-coast connections and being the first fully asset-based carrier with company drivers company-owned containers and company-owned chassis to operate on the railroad will result in more consistent service and less time in transit. We see huge benefits with Union Pacific to successfully deliver a positive service experience for our customers and drivers.”

Schneider and Union Pacific say they are working to improve driver efficiency at terminals further reducing delays in transit. The railroad’s additional lane options and consistent rail departure frequency provides customers with more options better reliability and ultimately greater control over the supply chain.

“This is the beginning of a partnership built on a shared commitment to provide more sustainable intermodal services and reduce our carbon footprints” Kenny Rocker UP’s executive vice president of marketing and sales said in a statement. “We look forward to future growth as we leverage Union Pacific’s extensive network and Schneider’s innovative logistics offerings to provide unparalleled customer service.”

With a fleet of 28000 domestic containers Schneider is the third-largest truckload intermodal operator. J.B. Hunt’s fleet tops 113000 containers while Hub Group rosters 45000 boxes.

Intermodal analyst Larry Gross says Schneider’s move to UP is a major shift for domestic intermodal.

“The shift was announced long ago so there has been plenty of time to prepare. But the volume influx to the UP network will be significant so the sector will be watching closely to see if service levels are successfully maintained and congestion is avoided” Gross says. “With this change the three biggest intermodal truckload asset-based players each have carved out a unique national network: JB Hunt (BNSF + NS); Hub Group (UP + NS); Schneider (UP + CSX).”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXlhZ2UuY29tL2ludGVybW9kYWwvc2NobmVpZGVyLWZ1bGx5LXRyYW5zaXRpb25zLXdlc3Rlcm4tcmFpbC1vcHMtdG8tdXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Schneider Fully Transitions Western Rail Ops to UP,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXlhZ2UuY29tL2ludGVybW9kYWwvc2NobmVpZGVyLWZ1bGx5LXRyYW5zaXRpb25zLXdlc3Rlcm4tcmFpbC1vcHMtdG8tdXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3066920>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The former Alabama ball-carrier has nine games with more rushing yards and six games with more receiving yards this season.

Jacobs’ longest run against the NFL’s No. 1 defense gained 9 yards and on a fourth-and-1 snap at the San Francisco 2-yard line in the second quarter the 49ers stacked up Jacobs for no gain.

But Jacobs’ performance made an impression on San Francisco defensive end Nick Bosa a three-time Pro Bowler the NFL’s 2022 sacks leader and a leading candidate for the league’s Defensive Player of the Year Award.

“Best running back I’ve played against in my career no doubt about it” Bosa said. “That dude’s a beast.”

Jacobs will enter the final weekend of the regular season with a 160-yard lead in the race for the NFL’s 2022 rushing crown.

Jacobs leads the NFL with 323 rushing attempts and 1608 rushing yards. He also has run for 12 touchdowns. Cleveland Browns running back Nick Chubb holds the second spot with 1448 yards and 12 touchdowns on 290 carries.

Jacobs could become the third Crimson Tide alumnus to win the NFL rushing title.

Shaun Alexander led the league with 1880 yards and 27 touchdowns on 370 carries for the Seattle Seahawks in 2005 and the Tennessee Titans’ Derrick Henry earned rushing crowns with 1540 yards and 16 touchdowns on 303 carries in 2019 and 2027 yards and 17 touchdowns on 378 carries in 2020.

Jacobs’ current total ranks as the fourth-most rushing yards in one NFL season by a former Alabama player. In 2004 Alexander ran for 1696 yards and 16 touchdowns on 353 carries but he came up 1 yard short of the rushing total of the New York Jets’ Curtis Martin that season.

“The only thing on my mind really is spending this last week with these guys” Jacobs said. “The locker room’s going to look a lot different next year and you don’t know who’s coming back and who’s done with football and whatnot so I’m just trying to enjoy this time.”

The Raiders already made one major change. Instead of nine-year starter Derek Carr at quarterback against San Francisco Las Vegas gave former Auburn standout Jarrett Stidham his first NFL start.

Stidham responded with one of the best first starts statistically for a quarterback in NFL history. He completed 23-of-34 passes for 365 yards with three touchdowns and two interceptions and ran for 34 yards on seven carries.

“He was calm and collected in the huddle” Jacobs said. “He was talking to the guys. You couldn’t tell he was a backup for real. He balled. He did his thing. …

“I kind of seen flashes in preseason of what he was capable of. But obviously that’s one of the best defenses if not the best defense in the league so for him to go out there and do what he did I feel like that’s speaking to his campaign as the guy.”

While Stidham did not surprise Jacobs he did Bosa who said the 49ers might have underestimated the new QB.

“He was poised” Bosa said. “He took hits. I hit him a good amount of times. We all did and he completed the ball on most of them. He’s a tough player and smart.”

Bosa’s final hit on Stidham got the desired result. Stidham’s last pass of the game came up well short San Francisco safety Tashaun Gipson returned his interception 56 yards to the Las Vegas 7-yard line to set up the overtime-ending field goal.

‘Man I was happy to see the ball fluttering in the air” Bosa said.

Stidham will make his second start against the Kansas City Chiefs at 3:30 p.m. CST Saturday at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. ABC ESPN and ESPN Deportes will televise the game.

With a 6-10 record including nine losses by seven or fewer points the Raiders’ season will end on Saturday while the Chiefs are 13-3 and headed to the AFC playoffs.

Elizabeth Jacobs is the director of regulatory affairs and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies.

Civil-rights icon Barbara Jordan — chairwoman of the Clinton administration’s Commission on Immigration Reform — said in 1994 “Employment continues to be the principal magnet attracting illegal aliens to this country. As long as U.S. businesses benefit from the hiring of unauthorized workers control of unlawful immigration will be impossible.”1

Analysis of data provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) shows that E-Verify is one of the strongest tools employers have to ensure they are hiring only workers who are authorized to work in the United States consistent with federal immigration and labor laws. It may also be one of the strongest tools lawmakers and government officials have to protect U.S. workers from unlawful competition and wage suppression resulting from large-scale illegal immigration.

Background on Work Authorization Verification Requirements

The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) at section 274A(a)(1) makes it “unlawful for a person or other entity … to hire or to recruit or refer for a fee for employment in the United States an alien knowing the alien is an unauthorized alien”. 8 U. S. C. §1324a(a)(1)(A). IRCA defines an “unauthorized alien” as an alien who is not “lawfully admitted for permanent residence” or not otherwise authorized by the attorney general or secretary of Homeland Security to be employed in the United States.

Section 274A(a)(1)(B) requires employers to verify the employment authorization of any individual they hire to work in the United States primarily by completing a Form I-9 and examining documents establishing both employment authorization and the identity of the individual. The implementing regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(1)(ii)(A) require that every employer “[p]hysically examine” and then attest that the documents appear to be genuine and relate to the person presenting them. If the individual submits a document that does not reasonably appear to be genuine or to relate to him or her the employer must reject that document and may then request that the individual present other acceptable documents to satisfy the requirements of Form I-9.

Individuals must also attest under penalty of perjury on the Form I-9 that they are citizens or nationals of the United States aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence or aliens authorized under the INA or by DHS to be hired recruited or referred for employment.2 Employers are required to retain the completed Form I-9 and make it available for inspection by DHS or the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”) for up to three years after the date of the individual’s hiring or one year after the date the individual’s employment is terminated whichever is later.3

The problem with the paper Form I-9 process is however that few employers are trained to verify the authenticity of government-issued identification or work authorization documents and must generally accept documents as valid when presented to them by recent hires. After the initial inspection an incredibly few completed Form I-9’s are ever revisited for audit compliance. This means that the Form I-9 verification process is vulnerable to fraud and abuse by both unauthorized workers and unscrupulous employers intending to exploit unauthorized labor.

The E-Verify system originally known as the “Basic Pilot Program” is an internet-based system created by Congress and administered by DHS that addresses this issue by providing employers with an easy quick and simple way to verify the work authorization of new hires.4 The process requires employers to enter information provided by applicants on Form I-9.5 Regardless of whether an employer participates in E-Verify federal law already requires all employees to complete Form I-9 within three days of beginning employment and employers are required to retain a copy of this document.6 This information is entered into the E-Verify system through DHS’s free online portal. The program then validates applicant details by comparing them against millions of federal and state government identification Social Security and immigration records. The system typically provides a result within five seconds.7 The result will either say “employment authorized” or “DHS/SSA Tentative Nonconfimation” (TNC).

If a new employee receives a TNC the individual can contest the result with the Social Security Administration (SSA) or contact DHS within eight federal working days.8 Employers who use the system properly are generally protected from civil and criminal penalties regarding the hiring of an unauthorized worker who has been screened through E-Verify.9

Data Shows E-Verify Is Accurate and Doesn’t Impose a Significant Burden on Most Employers or Employees

E-Verify has a strong track record for accuracy. Data reported by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) reveals a 99.87 percent accuracy rate for the program.10 Of the 42.5 million cases E-Verify processed in FY 2021 98.48 percent of employees run through E-Verify were automatically confirmed as authorized to work either instantly or within 24 hours requiring no further employee or employer action. E-Verify properly determined 1.39 percent of employees to not be authorized to work in the United States.11 Of the 1.39 percent determined by the system to not be authorized to work USCIS reported just 1.08 percent of cases as “unresolved” either because the employer closed the case as “self-terminated” or because the case was awaiting further action by either the employer or employee at the end of FY 2021.

Concerns That E-Verify Will Erroneously Report Authorized Workers as Unauthorized Are Largely Unfounded. USCIS reported that in FY 2021 E-Verify flagged only 1.52 percent of cases with a TNC.12 Of the 1.52 percent of cases not initially confirmed as work authorized just 0.13 percent of these cases were determined to be inaccurately flagged and were later confirmed as work authorized after contesting the mismatch and resubmitting documentation to support their claim.13 A brief period of uncertainty for a very small percentage of cases that are initially flagged as TNC is for many businesses a relatively small price to pay to ensure that they are complying with federal law and not subjecting the business to serious civil and criminal liability.

Additionally E-Verify imposes negligible burdens on participating employers and the cost of running a new employee through the program is miniscule.14 The primary costs E-Verify imposes upon businesses are associated with the inputting of an employee’s Form I-9 information into the web-based system which typically takes minutes to complete.15 Extra personnel should not be required to conduct this function because as explained above federal law already requires employers to conduct identity and work authorization verification regardless of participation in the program.16

Given the negligible administrative costs associated with E-Verify use and the benefits associated with participation it is difficult to imagine an employer objecting to a mandate unless an employer purposefully violates or intends to violate Section 274A of the INA or to otherwise discriminate against applicants on the basis of their citizenship or immigration status in violation of Section 274B of the INA.

E-Verify Participation Benefits Small and Large Businesses Alike

Importantly E-Verify participation provides employers with a rebuttable presumption that the employer hasn’t employed an unauthorized worker in violation of Section 274A of the INA.17 (In the context of criminal and civil law a rebuttable presumption is an assumption of fact accepted by the court unless explicitly disproven.) When compared to the civil and criminal penalties an employer may face as a result of engaging in the knowing employment of unauthorized workers document fraud tax fraud Social Security fraud conspiracy or other immigration- and labor-related offenses as well as operational costs businesses may incur by the sudden loss of needed employees E-Verify provides participating employers with incomparable protection by allowing the government to verify that their workforce is authorized. There is no risk of legal consequences for using E-Verify properly.

E-Verify Continues to Be One of the Federal Government’s Highest User-Rated Programs

According to the 2020 American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) E-Verify received a user satisfaction score of 87 out of 10018 significantly surpassing the national average ACSI score of just 74 which includes both public and private sector programs.19 ACSI reports 2 percent of new enrollees and just 1.5 percent of existing E-Verify users contacted Technical Assistance in the past six months.20 Additionally the ACSI indicated that E-Verify received a score of 90 out of 100 for users’ likelihood to recommend 93 out of 100 for user confidence in accuracy and 95 out of 100 for continued user participation.21

Who Is Required to Use E-Verify?

Currently federal law only requires the federal government its contractors and subcontractors to use E-Verify to confirm that their employees are authorized to work in the United States.22 As of July 2022 at least 20 states and numerous localities require all or some employers in their jurisdictions to use E-Verify proving the feasibility of mass-implementation.23 Just a handful of states require both public and private employers to use E-Verify and almost all state laws that require E-Verify use include carve outs that allow some employers to avoid electronic verification of their hires’ work authorization statuses.

States Have the Legal Authority to Mandate E-Verify Participation

In 2011 the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed states’ authority to implement properly drafted E-Verify mandates. In Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America v. Whiting the Court upheld Arizona legislation that requires all employers (public and private) to use the program.24 In Whiting the Court determined that the Legal Arizona Workers Act was valid and not preempted by federal law because its language mirrored federal requirements.25 States however may not impose their own civil or criminal sanctions “other than through licensing and similar laws” upon those who employ or recruit or refer for a fee for employment unauthorized aliens.26

What About Employers Who Enroll in E-Verify but Do Not Verify Everyone They Hire?

Critics of mandatory E-Verify laws often argue that mandates are ineffective at ensuring employers actually use the program to verify unauthorized workers when they are in fact knowingly hiring unauthorized workers despite using the program to verify others. This type of large-scale improper (and usually criminal) E-Verify use is significantly easier for law enforcement to uncover than unlawful Form I-9 practices.

Employers who misuse E-Verify to hire unauthorized workers are subject to significant civil and criminal penalties27 including but not limited to:

Civil penalties for knowingly hiring unauthorized workers; 28

Criminal penalties for making materially false fictitious or fraudulent statements or representation or false documents known to contain any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statements to the federal government; 29

Criminal penalties for knowingly possessing identification documents with the intent to defraud the United States; 30

Criminal penalties for using obtaining accepting or receiving any document prescribed by statute for the regulation for employment in the United States knowing it to be forged counterfeit altered falsely made or procured by fraud or unlawfully obtained; 31

Criminal penalties related to Social Security fraud; 32

Criminal penalties related to tax fraud; 33 and

and Criminal penalties for conspiracy offenses.34

Rather this criticism underscores the need for an expansion of worksite enforcement efforts by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and rescission of policies such as the October 12 2021 policy memorandum “Worksite Enforcement: The Strategy to Protect the American Labor Market the Conditions of the American Worksite and the Dignity of the Individual”35 and the October 27 2021 policy memorandum “Guidelines for Enforcement Actions in or Near Protected Areas”36 that impede DHS’s ability to enforce immigration and labor laws.

Additionally DHS should expand its collaboration with SSA and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to prioritize enforcement audits on employers who are most likely to be knowingly employing unauthorized workers. While DHS already possesses information about those aliens who are authorized to work in the United States both the SSA and IRS possess information highlighting individuals who are likely to have committed identity theft in order to obtain a job unlawfully in the United States.

For example the SSA has a long-held practice of sending “no-match” letters to employers that indicate possible instances of employment-related identity theft.37 A no-match letter is a “written notice issued by the SSA to an employer usually in response to an employee wage report advising that the name or SSN reported by the employer for one or more employees does not ‘match’ a name or SSN combination reflected in SSA’s records.”38 Additionally the Treasury Department’s Inspector General for Tax Administration reported in 2020 that IRS is aware of hundreds of thousands of instances of employment-related identity fraud where an individual is using or has used another person’s SSN for the purpose of obtaining employment.39

Widespread E-Verify use combined with adequate worksite enforcement are two of the most effective tools DHS has to execute its mission (as determined by Congress) improve labor conditions in the United States and address the root causes of illegal immigration into the United States.

DHS Should Allow Employers to Accept Only Identification Documents that DHS Can Authenticate

E-Verify can be even more resilient to identity fraud to protect against cases in which unauthorized employees “borrow” documents that belong to authorized workers. DHS should reform the verification process by allowing employers to accept licenses and identification cards only from states that provide DHS access to data sources that will allow them to validate the authenticity of the document. Making such a policy change will encourage more states to join the Records and Information from DMVs for E-Verify (RIDE) program or otherwise provide DHS access to their driver’s license and identification card data sources for verification purposes. RIDE helps to reduce document and employment eligibility verification fraud in E-Verify.40 Expanding participation would ensure that DHS is able to increase photo-matching and weed out penalize and discourage document fraud and identity theft through E-Verify use.

Second the federal government could modernize the work authorization verification process by implementing a reform known as “G-Verify” (for “government verification”). G-Verify was originally proposed by William Chip a senior counselor to the secretary of Homeland Security in the Trump administration and a member of the Center for Immigration Studies board of directors as a means to simplify employer’s on-boarding obligations while simultaneously strengthening the integrity of the work authorization verification process. A G-Verify rule was drafted but not published in the Federal Register.

Congress or the executive branch could enact G-Verify by imposing a single online filing requirement through legislation or regulatory changes respectively to replace employers’ Form W-2 Form I-9 and E-Verify obligations. By simply requiring employers to submit the same information already required for these forms to the government electronically G-Verify would relieve employers of the need to store the paper copies of the forms for future audits and like E-Verify would provide employers with nearly instant confirmation that a new hire may lawfully be employed in the United States. G-Verify reforms could also deter identity theft and make unlawful employment schemes easier for DHS to uncover.

Why Do E-Verify Mandates Matter Now?

Since March 2020 since the Covid pandemic DHS has permitted many employers to defer the physical examination of identity and work authorization documents by inspecting such documents remotely (e.g. over video or email) within three days of the employee’s first day of employment.41 Remote document examination increases these vulnerabilities by increasing the likelihood that an employee will present fraudulent documents to support their claim of work authorization. Equally troubling the remote verification flexibilities will give corrupt employers additional cover to knowingly hire unauthorized workers in violation of statute.

DHS initially applied this guidance only to employers and workplaces that were operating remotely but has permitted remote document verification for any recent hire who worked exclusively in a remote setting due to Covid-19-related precautions until they undertook non-remote employment on a regular consistent or predictable basis regardless of whether the workplace was operating entirely remotely.42 DHS extended these leniencies repeatedly through FY 2022. The most recent announcement expired October 31 2022.43

On August 18 2022 DHS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (“NPRM”) titled “Optional Alternatives to the Physical Document Examination Associated with Employment Eligibility Verification (Form I-9)” to provide the secretary of Homeland Security regulatory authority to impose alternate work authorization verification procedures.44 The department cites the “rapid shift to telework and remote work” in response to the Covid-19 pandemic as the primary incentive for proposing the rule stating that the department recognizes that many employers have maintained these flexibilities with their staff “by choice rather than necessity”.45 As a result DHS reported that it is exploring “making permanent some of the COVID-19 pandemic-related flexibilities” to examine employees’ identity and employment authorization documents for the Form I-9 as well as other alternatives.46

Eradicating unauthorized employment is also essential to enforcing both immigration and labor laws as a whole. For this reason the Jordan commission concluded “that both employer sanctions and enhanced labor standards enforcement are essential components of a strategy to reduce the job magnet.”47 Additionally by reducing incentives to enter or remain in the United States illegally effective worksite enforcement likewise allows ICE to focus its resources on its stated enforcement priorities: criminal aliens and aliens who pose threats to border or national security.48

As many American workers understand too well employers who hire unauthorized workers often violate other employment and labor laws including those related to antidiscrimination health and safety. DHS itself acknowledged in its October 12 memorandum that “These employers engage in illegal acts ranging from the payment of substandard wages to imposing unsafe working conditions and facilitating human trafficking and child exploitation. Their culpability compels the intense focus of our enforcement resources.”49 Equally important unchecked unauthorized employment causes substantial economic hardship to U.S. workers who may face unfair labor competition wage suppression and reduced working conditions as a result of contending against an illegal and unregulated labor market.

Conclusion

By requiring employers to use E-Verify to confirm the work authorization of their new hires employers with limited resources are able to quickly and easily confirm that the documents provided by a new employee have been issued to them have not been altered and match government data systems. Since using the E-Verify system is free the personnel costs associated with data-entry are the only burden it imposes on businesses.

E-Verify is the best means available to verify employment authorization of newly hired employees because it virtually eliminates Social Security mismatches improves wage and tax reporting accuracy and helps employers maintain a legal workforce thereby protecting U.S. workers from unfair employment competition.50 Mandating E-Verify use and resuming widespread worksite enforcement operations will strengthen the integrity of the work verification process and eliminate a primary pull-factor for illegal immigration into the United States.

Here is the full transcript of the interview lightly edited for clarity:

Q: I’ll start with something simple. What is your administration’s top accomplishment that you are most proud of in the past year? And what area do you think you could improve the most on?

A: Yeah so first of all thank you for taking time. We have the largest bond deal in the history of the city of Chicago $1.25 billion bond deal. We’re gonna build homes and create real economic development for people. It’s unprecedented investment. That’s what I promised I would do when I became mayor and we’ve done that.

A quarter of a billion dollars to address the unhoused crisis in this city; $100 million for violence prevention. We’re going to open up two mental health clinics this year. This is the result of course from two administrations ago shutting down mental health clinics. We abolished the subminimum wage in the city of Chicago. Black and brown women 100000 workers are going to get a raise. We have the most substantive paid time off in any major city in this country 1.3 million workers have additional days that they will be able to take off as a result of our work.

We hired 20% more young people for summer jobs. We added an additional $76 million on top of that. So we’re in a position to hire 28000 young people for summer jobs. First time in the history of Chicago where you have a community safety deputy mayor. It’s a big deal particularly when it comes to how we address community safety in this city.

So between the bond deal unprecedented quarter of a billion dollars for the unhoused $100 million for violence prevention of course abolishing subminimum wage of course creating paid time off for workers opening up mental health clinics the most diverse administration in the history of Chicago and we’ve done that within the first year of our administration. So I’m very proud that we’ve been able to accomplish everything that I promised that I would do when I ran for office. We’ve accomplished those.

Q: What do you see as the area that most needs improvement within your administration?

A: Well I mean look we’ve had 40 years of gross neglect and disinvestment within the city of Chicago right? And we’re talking about real severe disinvestment. I’m not sure if either one of you were here during the time in which schools were closed. It’s a very profound lasting impact that it has had on the people of Chicago. And when mental health clinics are shuttered that creates a lot of frustration that leaves a gaping hole right? And so part of my responsibility of course is to address the age-old systems of failure and to build a better stronger safer Chicago and that is something that I’m committed to doing. That’s what the people of Chicago elected me to do.

Q: If you could go back to May 15 2023 knowing what you know now about how the migrant crisis would unfold what would you do differently?

A: Well again thank you for acknowledging the fact that I inherited this crisis. When I was sworn in there were people who were sleeping on floors in police districts. They were sleeping on floors in airports right? You had no structure no order at the border and the governor of Texas was committed to creating chaos.

What we have done though as a result of that there are no more people sleeping on floors in police districts. We’ve cleared out the airports. We’ve saved the taxpayers over $200 million through our work of renegotiating contracts that I inherited.

Having reflected over the last year I wish that Congress would actually do its part and pass substantive immigration reform policies and alleviate this responsibility that has been placed on the backs of municipal government which it is not designed to do. And so that is an area that in retrospect had those types of investments been made — whether it’s the city of Chicago or Denver or New York or anywhere else in this country that Gov. Abbott has attacked and targeted — we could be in a much more — we could be in a better position as a country if the federal government would have acted.

Q: As a candidate you once said “Too often the politics of Chicago it forces communities to fight over one pie. My philosophy is: Let’s just make more pies.” As a mayor you have consistently said that Chicago was out of money for migrants while other governments as you just alluded to aren’t helping enough. Was your outlook back then perhaps too optimistic?

A: Again the $1.25 billion bond deal this is again the largest investment that we have experienced as a city. That’s 20 times the amount of dollars that we have made for the migrant mission within the latest investment. What it displays is that you actually can do both and I mean it’s a clear example of doing both. As far as my general optimism about the city of Chicago here’s the most important thing to remember: I came into office with a clear agenda to invest in people — a $1.25 billion bond deal a quarter of a billion dollars into the unhoused $100 million for violence prevention. You know we have established a brand-new office dedicated to those who are returning residents from jails and incarceration. It’s never happened before.

These investments could have been made two administrations ago it could have been three administrations ago. They didn’t do it. I did. And that’s why I’m optimistic in this moment because everything that I said that we need to do as a city together we are doing that. We’re investing in people. And we’re addressing age-old systems that have failed the people of Chicago for too long.

Q: We hear that (Deputy Mayor of Community Safety) Garien Gatewood and a violence interrupter were on the scene Saturday attempting to de-escalate a clash between CPD and (the School of the Art Institute of Chicago) protesters. Did CPD ignore the wishes of the fifth floor when they moved on the protesters anyway?

A: The most important thing here for everyone to remember is that I’m a strong advocate for the First Amendment and particularly protests. I’ve been a part of demonstrations multiple demonstrations. What we also need to make sure that happens is that we keep people safe and that’s the most important thing here.

And so the work to de-escalate is work that is ongoing. The work to keep people safe that’s the most important element here. And we’ve done both of those things. We’re keeping people safe. We’re protecting people’s First Amendment right. And when things get to be more intense we’re pushing for greater de-escalation.

Q: Was the final response the outcome — which led to dozens of arrests — was that necessary?

A: Well in some instances — and I’ve been a part of these demonstrations — in some instances arrests are part of the objective. I’ll say it like that. I’ve taken arrest before. It’s not unprecedented for demonstrators to take arrest. The most important thing though here is that the First Amendment? Protected. Keeping people safe it’s the primary goal and we’ve done both of those.

Q: Let’s talk about the pace of your personnel appointments. For example the ZBA (Zoning Board of Appeals) vacancy that you could have filled upon taking office ultimately cost your administration the approval of a homeless shelter in Uptown. Do you regret not acting sooner in that case and others?

A: Our appointments are working well. We have the most diverse administration in the history of Chicago; 60% of my administration are women. We have more brown folks represented in my administration more Black folks represented in my administration and we’re very proud of that. Whether it’s (Public Health Commissioner) Dr. Olusimbo “Simbo” Ige her leadership (Planning) Commissioner (Ciere) Boatright (Housing Commissioner Lissette) Castañeda the first chief homelessness officer in the history of the city of Chicago (Sendy Soto).

All of our appointments really speak to the values of our administration building better stronger safer communities. And we’re doing it in an equitable just way. And so we’re going to continue to make sure that we get it right and I’m very proud of the administration that I put together.

Q: Speaking of identity: During a Lunar New Year celebration you raised some eyebrows when you said the 11th Ward is one that “has been known for its racism.” I bring this up because some of your critics worry this language is alienating. Are their concerns valid? Or is your description of the 11th Ward fair and necessary?

A: Well I think that the entire city of Chicago certainly no one is going to deny the fact that we’ve had deep segregation in this city. And the fact that for the first time in the history of Chicago you have an Asian American representing the 11th Ward that shows that there’s tremendous progress that’s being made.

And so we have to address the harsh reality in this city that we are hypersegregated that there has been racism expressed in this city whether it be through school closures whether it be the shuttering of mental health clinics whether it be cutting off transportation stops and lines through various communities redlining the push-out of people gentrifying communities. You know these are real issues that we’ve had to face over the course of decades now.

And it’s incumbent upon all of us in this city to address racism that exists around the city while also making sure that we’re building capacity with a variety of voices and perspectives and experiences that can ultimately help build a more unified city. And that’s what we’re doing.

Q: The day after you won in April you told our colleague that you’ve never called 911 before which is a sentiment that other South and West siders have shared with me from time to time. But after ShotSpotter goes away 911 calls will presumably be the main alert system for first responders. Do you envision residents will have to adapt to calling 911 more to fill that gap?

A: Well let me just say where violence has been most pervasive particularly on the West and South sides of the city of Chicago these communities call 911 more than any other group and that’s well-documented. The challenge that we have in this city is that we have not had administrations that were committed to investing in people. I’m committed.

Look community safety is a top priority for me and it’s on the minds of all Chicagoans. Homicides are down in the city. Shootings are down in the city. The 35 most violent beats in the city of Chicago where over 50% of the violent crime occurs in those neighborhoods. Homicides are down 35% shootings are down 31%. The work that we have to continue to do to build a better stronger safer Chicago has to be very clear about how we invest in people.

If 911 is our response to community safety then we already have a failed strategy. That is not my strategy. I’m not committed to failing. I’m committed to investing in people and that’s what I’m doing.

Q: Mayor you’re a champion of the progressive movement here in Chicago. What has shifted in the mood and morale of the movement while you’ve been in office?

A: Well there’s a lot to be excited about. You know again paid time off. We’re talking about 1.38 million people. That’s part of the progressive agenda. We abolished the subminimum wage. It has its vestiges of course in slavery. So Black and brown women we’re talking about 100000 workers who are primarily the workforce of restaurants in particular they’re all going to get raises.

Treatment Not Trauma that policy had been lingering in the city of Chicago for years. We got it done within the first year of my administration. You know again this $1.25 billion bond deal right? We’re talking about $625 million dollars to build homes another $625 million for economic development and resources workforce development as well.

I mean this is a part of the progressive agenda that has been stagnant for now an entire generation. We’ve been able to move with expediency. This is an exciting time for the city of Chicago as we build a better stronger safer city through the lens of progressive politics through the lens of working people. And that we’re very proud of.

Q: That same movement was delivered a pretty big setback when Bring Chicago Home lost and its opponents sought to tie the referendum vote to you. Do you think that association hurt the referendum? And do you think you could have done more to back Bring Chicago Home and get it over the finish line?

A: Well we know there were some legal restraints that I had. I was not able to campaign for it. But let’s be very clear: We dedicated a quarter of a billion dollars to homelessness. We have for the first time in the history of Chicago a homelessness officer. Again this bonds deal was designed to build homes and we’re doing that. We’ve already built 100 affordable housing units since I’ve been in office.

There are another 700 that are in the pipeline as we speak. Look the same forces — and thank you because your publication actually is the source of it — the same forces that worked to stop (Cook County Board President) President John Stroger from moving this same agenda those same forces were in full effect to push back against the will of the people.

The bottom line is this it’s the most important thing: We have to deal with the homelessness crisis in this city and that’s what I’m doing. And so individuals or anyone of interests that are not committed to addressing the homelessness crisis perhaps they have to dig a little bit deeper and understand why they’re actually opposing that because the people of Chicago want us to address homelessness. So in other words their attack was against the people of Chicago.

Q: You have a reputation of being a pretty affable guy but also one common criticism of your administration has been struggles with relationships with some other governments City Council maybe the governor as well. How do you respond to that criticism? Do you think there’s room for improvement there?

A: Well look at what we’ve accomplished. Look at what we’ve accomplished together. Working with City Hall. Again the most substantive paid time-off ordinance in the country abolishing subminimum wage passing Treatment Not Trauma. We’re moving on the execution of plowing the sidewalks. We’re building affordable housing. We have a bond deal.

Working with the state and the county we put together an operation to address this migrant mission. We’ve done that together. Everything that I said that we needed to do that we needed to do it together we’ve accomplished that. And so my relationship with City Council with other executives I’m very proud of the work that we’ve accomplished and what we’ve done together.

Q: You campaigned on a platform of racial justice and unity. But on the floor of the City Council many aldermen especially Black aldermen describe a Chicago and City Council as more and more racially divided. Do you agree with that narrative?

A: Yeah well look 40 years of disinvestment. Whether it’s North Lawndale Englewood Roseland Austin Garfield Park every single crisis that we are dealing with right now I inherited it. There’s not one crisis right now that I caused. Not one.

And I’ve been on the front line fighting for education fighting for mental health services fighting to create more job opportunities for people and we’re doing that. Again we’re talking about the largest investment from a bond deal in the history of Chicago a $1.25 billion bond 100 affordable housing units that have already been built 700 right now in the pipeline.

This new Office for Reentry returning residents will now have a place where an entire department coordinates across city departments and sister agencies; $10 million in home repairs right now for families particularly on the West and South sides of the city of Chicago. And so we are addressing what we inherited. Forty years of neglect and within one year we have made hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and now the largest bond deal in the history of Chicago to address the neglect.

That’s what I was purposed to do: Build homes create economic opportunities for Black Chicago. There are more Black folks in my administration than in the history of this city. And no one else lost because of it. And 60% of my administration made up of women. I’m very proud of the work that we’ve done together.

Q: There’s no doubt that you’ve had a lot of big bold ideas in the agenda that you campaigned on. Those ideas also cost a lot of money. Out of all the other revenue ideas that you floated — a head tax financial transactions jet fuel hotels — which one do you think has the most realistic path to passing in this term?

A: Well the key is what do we ultimately want to do right? Do we want to build more homes that are affordable? Do we want to really create more pathways for our young people? Do we want to make sure that our public education system is fully supported? That’s the real question.

And the other question that we have to answer is: What happens if we don’t invest in those key areas? And so my approach is put the ideas on the table. You give people an opportunity to debate them to discuss them. And then we come to consensus together. Building a better stronger safer Chicago is going to require investments bottom line. I’ve made that very clear.

With the quarter-billion dollars into the unhoused the $1.25 billion bond deal the $100 million for violence prevention. Everyone says that they want to address these issues in our city the segregation the disinvestment. Turns out if you believe in something you’re willing to pay for it.

Q: But out of that process you just laid out what stage are you at in terms of deciding what to prioritize in that revenue package?

A: Those conversations are ongoing. You both know that we have a subcommittee dedicated to revenue. I created that for that very purpose. Look my responsibility in this moment is to bring people together and I’ve done it. I’ve done it consistently. And that’s why this subcommittee exists so that we can have these substantive conversations about what it’s going to take to right the wrongs that we inherited.

We’re talking about 40 years of gross neglect in the city of Chicago. I really want to just drive that point home — 40 years of neglect. It has caused tremendous harm to people. Do you know what that’s like to wake up and you’re not sure if your school is going to exist? Or if it’s fully funded? Do you know what it’s like to wake up and you’re unhoused?

I mean these are severe issues that the people of Chicago are facing and that’s why I’m dedicated to opening up mental health centers that’s why I’ve been pushing so hard for this investment around the unhoused. It’s why this $1.25 billion bond deal is a start in that right direction. And we’ve accomplished all of this in less than a year. Keep that in mind.

It has not even been a year yet. And everything that I said that I would do bring people together to build a better stronger safer Chicago every single platform point we’ve addressed it. And then to your question around our revenue sources there’s an entire committee dedicated to building an infrastructure of revenue that doesn’t place the burden on everyday people.

Q: Have you vetted or looked at potential replacements for CTA President Dorval Carter?

A: Well as you know discussing personnel issues I actually find that to be irresponsible and I’ve said that repeatedly. And so what I’m committed to doing right now is making sure that our ridership continues to go up which it has. We have hired more people which we’ve done that I’ve made a commitment to doing that. Our better streets for buses it’s the first initiative of its kind to build a better street signal sidewalk infrastructure. These are all investments that I have put forward in order to build a CTA that we can be proud of. And again as far as personnel matters I don’t discuss those publicly.

Q: Why?

A: Because it’s not responsible. Should your employer discuss individuals’ employment status out loud about who they’re going to fire and keep?

Q: In fairness though these are also employees not just of yours but of the city right? The CTA president also serves Chicagoans and they have a lot of questions about him and all of the appointments that you make.

A: Having questions about how we build a transportation system that ultimately meets the needs and demands of the people of Chicago those questions are welcome. Determining who I get to fire and hire I find that to be irresponsible and I won’t discuss personnel matters publicly.

Q: Out of all the current CTU demands — 9% raises housing assistance dual-language expansion sports and fine arts at each school more sustainable community schools abortion and gender-affirming care coverage and more — what do you already know that you could say yes to?

A: Well look my vision for public education has been made very clear. I want every single child to have what my children have right? We’re talking about manageable class sizes arts libraries librarians access to the trades. You know that’s what a public education system should entail.

Now I’m a firm believer in sustainable community schools and primarily because it gives you know real ownership of the school community over the actual school. And where there are areas where there’s alignment with my vision and what is being negotiated in the contract we’ll lean into that. And where there are areas that are disjointed we’ll have to work through it. We’ll just have to work through it.

The public education system in this city is another area where there’s been gross neglect. And my job in this moment is to lay out a vision that working families want in their school system. Now who better to help lay out that vision than someone who actually relies upon the school system? I’m the first mayor in the history of Chicago to send their children to the public schools in Chicago. I have a real vested interest in ensuring that every single family can feel proud of their school and that their school is fully supported and resourced.

Now what we also have to recognize is that the state of Illinois conservatively owes us the people of Chicago $1 billion. One billion dollars. And so I’m going to be working with our partners in Springfield to ensure that the people of Chicago get what they deserve.

Q: How does your lived experience as a CPS parent inform some of your education decisions and positions? Can you name a specific policy where you thought about your kids and made your decision?

A: Yeah just access to the arts. Access to a library and a librarian. When I taught in middle school the level of research that I asked my middle schoolers to engage in was pretty substantial. It was. I wanted them to really dig deeper into their lessons. Not to have any library or a librarian I could not imagine teaching at the time in which I taught and not have the ability to take my children to the library.

And that’s something as simple and as fundamental as a librarian I just want to emphasize this because sometimes I think we brush past that really fast. Just think about your own personal journeys: What if you did not have a library or librarian to reference as you developed your skill set to become the professionals that you are today? Children in Chicago are being denied a library and a librarian.

The second thing is class sizes. When the school was closed when I taught we inherited an entire school. Our class sizes ballooned. When you are a middle school teacher there are 35 38 children in your classroom and you literally have desks stuffed in corners it is almost — it is impossible to have full engagement with 35 38 children in your classrooms. Impossible. We managed it but it’s impossible. That’s the second thing.

The third thing is this: The number of children who experience trauma every single day because they were unhoused their parents are unemployed or underemployed and when that trauma shows up in your classroom I can tell you they’re not always thinking about the causes of the American Revolution or comma splices or the author’s main point. They’re thinking about food. They’re thinking about sleep. Those are the three areas that I can tell you emphatically as a public school teacher if you don’t address those dynamics you can’t say that you’re really in for the public good.

Q: If I can zoom in on a specific moment in your migrant crisis response. You know the Brighton Park base camp plan generated some of the biggest pushback you’ve seen against your administration. Looking back do you think that set you back with building trust on that issue? And is there a lesson to be learned from that?

A: Well again the chaos at the border has still not gone addressed. Part of the challenge in this moment is the frustration that the people of Chicago have we’re not giving enough attention to where that frustration is really based out of. You have a governor of Texas who was out of control.

We had 15000 migrants in shelters at its height. There are 8000 now. We’ve saved the taxpayers $200 million. Do you know not a bus has arrived in the city of Chicago since the end of December? Not one bus. Why? Because we put forth a structure that I promised that I would do to create a real operation that’s centered around people’s humanity.

Look I’ve said from the very beginning this mission is unsustainable for a local municipality. Because local government is not designed to address an international migrant crisis. We are being woefully neglected by the federal government and primarily because you have a former president who is controlling the Republican Party.

And so what I’ve done is created an infrastructure that is operationalized that is centered around people’s dignity and humanity under severe circumstances in which we don’t have control of what’s happening at the border. We continue to work hard to save taxpayer dollars while still making investments. All of the investments that I’ve already laid out I’m sure you probably can repeat them.

Q: If I could walk down memory lane one of the first things I remember you telling me right after George Floyd’s murder is “I wanted to destroy every bit of a system that would permit such a heinous crime.” Obviously as mayor now you oversee a large police department you have a security detail and you’ve had to stand behind the CPD seal at pressers. Has it been strange to grapple with this adjustment so soon after living through the rawness of 2020 and being a Black man?

A: Well the system that we are referring to is quite frankly it’s a system of oppression. And that manifests across the board. I just talked to you very candidly about how the education system has also been an oppressive system right? We know that from the Civil Rights Movement the movement really began to take form around the fight for public transportation.

Policing is no different than any other system that has been mired by an oppressive ideology. And it is still my desire to dismantle the oppressive structures that prevent us from experiencing justice.

Look law enforcement has a responsibility to serve people and to protect. But it is not the responsibility alone of law enforcement to address some of these other critical issues. We continue to rely upon the police system for everything and that’s a problem.

You know as far as grappling with the contradictions that exist within our society that’s something that we all work through whether you’re a woman a woman of color a Black man. Advocating for better structures that have historically left marginalized people behind that is the optimism that perhaps you speak of. If our people Black and brown people women would have given up on these systems you and I wouldn’t be here. And so we continue to push these systems to respond to the needs of people.

The most important thing to note here is that the progress that we have made in less than a year the billions of dollars of investment dealing with the migrant crisis bringing down homicides and shootings moving forward with our progressive agenda that really speaks to working people and the people of Chicago that’s the part that I’m leaning into most. It’s an exciting time for the city of Chicago and I’m looking forward to the work that I will do with every resident of this city together. Thank you both.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpZ2JsdWV2aWV3LmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvMTIvMjQxNTQ0NDYvY2FuLWdpYW50cy10aGVvLWpvaG5zb24tYmUtYmV0dGVyLXByby10aGFuLWNvbGxlZ2UtcGxheWVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can Giants' Theo Johnson be better pro than college player?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bigblueview.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2024/5/12/24154446/can-giants-theo-johnson-be-better-pro-than-college-player (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3065900>, 'Connection to www.bigblueview.com timed out.

Look out for Jordaine Johnson!!!

Johnson who missed the entire outdoor season last spring with a broken toe left lots of smoke at Schools Stadium on Saturday when he produced one of the greatest and electrifying sprint triples in state history at the Super Essex Conference Championships in Newark.

Johnson a junior at East Orange Campus started off his day by running a meet record 10.53 in the trials of the American Division 100-meter dash No. 5 in the state this season. He followed that up by winning the 100 dash final in 10.70.

Johnson returned to the track 15 minutes later to finish first in the 400 in 47.91 No. 2 in the state this season. Later in the day Johnson completed the sprint trifecta with his best performance of them all when he blazed his way to a meet and Essex County record 21.04 which is No. 8 in NJ history for all conditions (there was no wind gauge).

How rare and remarkable is Johnson's triple!!!?

I can only find three other sprinters in state history who ran under 10.55 under 21.10 and under 48.00 in their high school careers!!!

Olympic gold medalist Dennis Mitchell a 1984 graduate of Edgewood ran 10.47 21.06 and 46.02. The late Mario Heslop of Franklin (Class of 2019) went 10.33 20.74 and 46.73 and Shamali Whittle of Hamilton North (Class of 2022) had high school PR's of 10.48 20.55 and 47.82.

That's some fast company that Johnson joined!!

And Johnson might be the first to ever go under 10.55 under 21.10 and sub 48 on the same day!! Heslop and Whittle accomplished their times on different days. Still checking on Mitchell.

Here's some more info on Johnson's 21.04 in the 200.

Johnson's 21.04 broke the Essex County automatic time record for all conditions of 21.22 that Maxwell Booker of Essex Catholic ran when he finished second to Danny Johnson of Rahway (21.03) at the 2000 Meet of Champions at Frank Jost Field in South Plainfield. The times by Booker and Johnson were wind-aided as they were run with a tailwind of 2.3 meters per second.

In case you're wondering the state record in the 200 for all-conditions is a wind-aided 20.51 (2.8 meters per second) by Antonio Tarantino of Paul VI in the trials of the 2018 New Balance Nationals Championships at North Carolina A&T in Greensboro N.C. The wind-legal state record is 20.75 that Shamali Whittle ran in the trials of the 200 at the 2021 Outdoor National Championships at Hayward Field in Oregon.

PFAS or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances represent a class of thousands of synthetic chemicals found in products like nonstick cookware and firefighting foam. They’ve been linked to kidney and testicular cancers fertility issues thyroid disease and reduced response to vaccines. PFAS have been dubbed “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down easily in the environment.

Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison used a forensic approach to identify the PFAS chemical fingerprint for the aqueous film-forming foam or AFFF used by Tyco Fire Products in Marinette. Sampling of water within a ditch near Tyco’s fire training facility and along the shoreline in the bay of Green Bay on Lake Michigan showed PFAS chemicals that were identical.

“Chemically they’re really the same so we could kind of link those two together” Christy Remucal the study’s lead investigator said.

Remucal a civil and environmental engineering professor at UW-Madison said she and another researcher found 17 out of 26 PFAS compounds they searched for across roughly 2.5 miles or 4 kilometers of shoreline. Concentrations of the chemicals ranged up to 250 parts per trillion.

She said that’s more than 10 times higher than what you would find in Lake Michigan as a whole. It’s also more than triple Wisconsin’s drinking water standard of 70 parts per trillion. That threshold was based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s health advisory level issued in 2016. More recently the agency updated its advisory levels in June last year to less than zero for two of the most widely studied PFAS chemicals PFOA and PFOS.

“It’s really hard to contain groundwater contamination and so that’s concerning” Remucal said. “That’s something that we need to think about. Once PFAS are kind of out into the Great Lakes there’s really not much you can do. You can’t treat the entire Great Lakes.”

Sarah Balgooyen the study’s co-investigator said the findings can help steer efforts to prevent chemicals from entering the Great Lakes and other water bodies.

“It’s much easier to test and treat water when it’s more concentrated closer to the source rather than downstream when it becomes really dispersed” Balgooyen said. “I hope that this study helps people make decisions to test more for PFAS and treat it when they find it.”

In September Tyco and its parent company Johnson Controls began operation of a groundwater extraction and treatment system that they claim will treat 95 percent of PFAS in the area. In a statement Tyco said it welcomed research on PFAS and planned to review the study.

“Tyco has stepped up and taken responsibility investing tens of millions of dollars to address the PFAS from our historic operations at our Fire Technology Center in Marinette” Johnson Controls spokesperson Kathleen Cantillon said in a statement. “We have built an expansive groundwater treatment system that is already achieving thorough PFAS removal in the water treated; we have excavated soils with aggregated PFAS; and we’ve worked in partnership with neighbors to accelerate the delivery to them of their preferred long-term drinking water solutions.”

State environmental regulators have warned the treatment system will reduce but not eliminate the so-called forever chemicals in groundwater and surface water over the next 30 years. The DNR’s Alyssa Sellwood a project manager overseeing PFAS contamination from Tyco said the study’s findings underscore that AFFF from Tyco’s facility is a primary source of PFAS pollution in the area.

“Based on my read through on the study I would say it definitely looks like a strong line of evidence that could be pursued as helping to answer some questions out there” Sellwood said.

Questions like whether Tyco is responsible for contamination in an area that extends beyond its facility. The company and DNR have disputed whether Tyco is the source of PFAS pollution in private wells sampled in a broader area around the fire training center. Remucal said the fingerprinting method will work in some cases to identify the source of contamination but others may prove more complex.

In March last year Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit against Tyco and Johnson Controls over their failure to report the release of PFAS from its site for years. Company officials have said they believed contamination was confined to their facility. Tyco is facing multiple lawsuits over its use of firefighting foam containing the chemicals.

The study also sampled rivers and streams near fields that received treated sewage sludge known as biosolids. Remucal said sampling showed active ingredients from Tyco’s firefighting foam in sites near fields where biosolids from the Marinette wastewater treatment plant were spread.

Moving forward she said the hope is to see if the fingerprinting method can be used to identify sources of PFAS contamination in other locations. Remucal is examining PFAS that builds up in foam on the surface of waters around Madison such as Starkweather Creek and Lake Monona. She’s also working with researchers at the U.S. Geological Survey to sample tributaries of Lake Superior for PFAS across Michigan Minnesota and Wisconsin.

‘We’re looking at tributary impacts kind of using the same idea looking at the different types of PFAS coming in different rivers” she said. “We’re also going to be looking at precipitation in that study as well.”

Meanwhile Balgooyen is now working as an EPA contractor in Duluth examining PFAS in fish that have been caught on the Great Lakes and frozen over the last 40 years.

“We want to try and get a historical trend of PFAS in Great Lakes fish” Balgooyen said.

She said researchers are starting to examine fish from Lake Superior. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources began urging anglers to limit the amount of smelt they eat from Lake Superior in 2021 after testing showed high PFAS concentrations in rainbow smelt near the Apostle Islands.

PFAS have been found in all five Great Lakes which are a source of drinking water for roughly 40 million people.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qc29ubGluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9icmVha2luZy8yMDIzLzAxLzAzL3BmYXMtZnJvbS1tYXJpbmV0dGUtZmlyZWZpZ2h0aW5nLWZvYW0tcGxhbnQtZm91bmQtaW4tbGFrZS1taWNoaWdhbi82OTc3MzgzMTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Forever chemicals' from Marinette firefighting foam plant are in Lake Michigan UW researchers find,"MADISON - A large plume of ""forever chemicals"" found in the Bay of Green Bay has been traced back to Tyco Fire Products a Marinette-based company known for mixing firefighting foam at its facility.

The study conducted by UW-Madison department of civil and environmental engineering researcher Christy Remucal and postdoctoral co-investigator Sarah Balgooyen was published in the Environmental Science & Technology journal in late December.

The two researchers sampled water along the shores of the Bay Remucal said where Tyco consultants had previously marked the PFAS plume as ending. In those samples PFAS identical to those used at the Marinette facility were found at rates 10 times higher than the rest of Lake Michigan.

A previous study by the two researchers found that tributaries feeding into the Bay were contributing to the levels of PFAS found but this study was able to use ""fingerprinting"" to pinpoint where the compounds came from.

""In this case the PFAS fingerprint in Green Bay is nearly identical to PFAS associated with Tyco and includes PFAS known to be active ingredients in firefighting foams"" the study says.

The fingerprinting method could be used to hold accountable manufacturers or other polluting companies responsible for contamination.

Tyco a subsidiary of Johnson Controls tested firefighting foam containing PFAS outdoors from 1962 until ending the practice in 2017. The foam ended up on the soil surrounding the company's fire training center as well as in the Marinette sewer system when the foam was washed into drains.

Tyco formerly known as the Ansul Company was purchased by Johnson Controls in 2016.

The contamination in Marinette and Peshtigo stems from the Tyco fire training site where fires were set outdoors and then doused with foam. The foam contaminated the ground it came into contact and eventually the PFAS were carried across the area by the groundwater and the sanitary sewers it was washed into after testing.

Outdoor testing was halted in 2017 but PFAS have continued to be an issue forcing hundreds of residents in the town of Peshtigo to rely on treatment systems to filter the water from their private wells or bottled water for drinking and cooking.

In addition to higher concentrations in the Bay elevated levels of PFAS were also found in rivers near fields treated with biosolids — treated sewage sludge — likely from the Marinette treatment plant. Biosolids are often spread on agricultural fields as fertilizer.

The study found that PFAS in biosolids can become mobile making their way into streams despite being spread on land.

""Using biosolids is really great it recycles nutrients it's a green way to do agriculture"" Remucal said. ""But if the biosolids have PFAS you can spread the PFAS further.""

Remucal suggested that treatment plants selling their biosolids should begin testing but acknowledged that many people are hesitant to look because of the risk of no longer being able to get rid of the treated sludge.

""But it's better to find out"" she said.

Doug Oitzinger the former mayor of Marinette and member of the activist group Save Our H2O said the findings have upheld community concerns regarding how far the contamination has reached from Tyco.

""It confirms what we suspected of the biosolids having leached into the Peshtigo River"" he said.

In the past Tyco has disputed that PFAS found in private wells near fields receiving biosolids were linked to the company though it has conducted some sampling.

Karen Tognarelli a media relations employee for Tyco said in a statement that the company welcomes continued research on PFAS and has been transparent with the data they've collected in Marinette.

""Our work has been overseen by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources at every stage and Tyco has shared all workplans data and the results we have achieved with the public"" she said in an email. ""PFAS is a problem across the country and it is clear that Tyco’s cleanup efforts are the most comprehensive and advanced in Wisconsin while many other known sources are yet to be addressed.”

PFAS or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are a family of man-made chemicals used for their water- and stain-resistant qualities in products like clothing and carpet nonstick cookware packaging and firefighting foam. The family includes over 6000 compounds which are persistent remaining both in the environment and human body over time.

The chemicals have been linked to types of kidney and testicular cancers lower birth weights harm to immune and reproductive systems altered hormone regulation and altered thyroid hormones. The chemicals enter the human body largely through drinking water.

The Great Lakes serve as a drinking water source for nearly 30 million people across the U.S. and Canada − 10 percent of the total U.S. population and 30 percent of Canada's.

Although the City of Green Bay does not get its drinking water directly from the bay the Great Lakes are all connected. And by the time contamination winds up in the bay it's already been in the groundwater rivers and streams for years or even decades said Joel Brammeier the CEO at the Alliance for the Great Lakes.

""This really is about preventing it at the source and getting away from this mentality that the Great Lakes are something to be cleaned up"" Brammeier said.

""We spent decades in the Great Lakes region spending billions on cleaning up pollution caused by companies and people who are no longer here. We can't let history repeat like this"" he said.

According to Brammeier this new information calls for a regional commitment to provide safe and clean drinking water for everyone at the source.

Remucal said this kind of sampling shows how much of an issue PFAS will continue to be and raises more questions about what other compounds in the PFAS family could be there. The UW sampling included 22 compounds but there are thousands more that can't even be sampled yet that could potentially cause health or environmental issues.

""This is going to be an issue for a very long time and we don't know the extent of what is there"" Remucal said.

In a new study researchers used chemical fingerprinting to link contaminants entering Green Bay to Tyco Fire Products a manufacturer along the Menominee River in Marinette Wis. which is owned by Johnson Controls Inc.

The contaminants were tracked through groundwater surface water and biosolid sludges. Tyco’s facilities in Marinette and Peshtigo have previously been identified as PFAS sources in groundwater and local private drinking water wells.

The plume entering Green Bay is estimated to be about 2.49 miles wide and extends an unknown distance along the bay according to researchers.

“A lot of PFAS from that source is going into Lake Michigan and it will be hard to contain” Christy Remucal an associate University of Wisconsin-Madison professor of civil and environmental engineering told the Associated Press.

“It’s really dispersed hard to capture and treat” she said.

Toxic PFAS are often referred to as “forever chemicals” because they do not readily break down in the environment or in humans. They have been used to make a wide range of products resistant to water grease oil and stains and are also found in foams used to fight hydrocarbon fires.

The chemicals are the subject of intense health study and exposure has already been linked to health problems such as cancer thyroid and liver disease pregnancy complications low birthweight and reduced vaccine effectiveness among others.

Various versions of the chemicals have been found at dilute concentrations in all five of the Great Lakes as well as in drinking water systems which draw from them.

In Wisconsin researchers linked the Marinette plume to Tyco using a chemical fingerprinting technique that uses ratios of individual PFAS compounds to identify their sources.

Seventeen different compounds were found in the bay and testing found concentrations up to 250 parts-per-trillion along the shoreline in the Marinette area.

The PFAS fingerprint in Green Bay is nearly identical to PFAS associated with Tyco and includes PFAS known to be active ingredients in firefighting foams researchers said.

They suggested that the fingerprinting method could be used by regulators to hold polluting companies and institutions responsible for contaminated water supplies.

Tyco told the Associated Press that it welcomed the Wisconsin study and is spending millions on treatment systems to deliver “long-term drinking water solutions” in the area.

Tyco is one of nearly 20 companies the Wisconsin attorney general sued in July alleging environmental contamination caused by PFAS chemicals.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel sued Tyco for similar reasons in 2020 as part of host of new and ongoing PFAS lawsuits against corporate polluters.

Nessel filed the latest case in December against a South Carolina paper company which owns a Port Huron composting facility where PFAS contaminates are draining to the St. Clair River a connecting channel between Lake Huron and Lake Erie.

In Wisconsin PFAS spiked in drinking water during an enormous October fire which destroyed a warehouse in which Tyco firefighting foam was stored. The cities of Menominee and Marinette draw water from the bay.

The Wisconsin study also found PFAS associated with Tyco facilities present in streams near some agricultural fields prompting their conclusion that the pollutants may have come from the treated biosolids many farmers use to fertilize crops.

Biosolids are cake-like sludges generated by wastewater treatment and are rich in nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. In wastewater systems tend to concentrate in biosolids during treatment as few systems are designed to remove the chemicals through filtration.

Remucal said PFAS from biosolids can move after being spread on land and can eventually make their way to adjacent streams after farmers spread sludge on fields.

“Treated biosolids are commonly spread on fields all across Wisconsin” postdoctoral investigator Sarah Balgooyen said. “This information may impact how municipalities across Wisconsin and other states approach the use of biosolids as an agricultural fertilizer.”

In Michigan contaminated biosolids spread on farmland have contaminated soil groundwater and food supplies. The state is investigating a former hog farm near Walkerville where industrial tannery waste was spread on cropland.

In Livingston County an organic cattle farm is suing an auto supplier after contaminated bioslids from municipal wastewater resulted in high PFAS levels in beef products.

Kentucky's legislature enacted a law in 2022 that required the state's treasurer's office to publish an annual list of financial firms found to be engaging in a boycott of energy companies. Under the law state entities have 30 days to notify the treasurer's office if they have any direct or indirect holdings of listed firms and must inform those firms. A listed financial institution has 90 days after receiving the notice to end the boycott or face divestment.

""When companies boycott fossil fuels they intentionally choke off the lifeblood of capital to Kentucky's signature industries"" Kentucky Treasurer Allison Ball said in a statement. ""Traditional energy sources fuel our Kentucky economy provide much needed jobs and warm our homes. Kentucky must not allow our signature industries to be irreparably damaged based upon the ideological whims of a select few.""

BLACKROCK'S FINK TALKS UKRAINE RECONSTRUCTIONS WITH ZELENSKYY

Fossil fuel production and use are vital to the state's economy. Ball's office noted there are 143994 energy sector jobs in the state of Kentucky representing about 7.8% of the state's workforce.

Kentucky has the third-most operating coal mines in the country trailing only West Virginia and Pennsylvania making the Bluegrass State the seventh-largest coal-producing state in 2021. Kentucky's mines yielded over 26 million tons of coal according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Kentuckians are also fossil-fuel customers. About 71% of the electrical power consumed by Kentuckians in 2021 was coal-fired the fourth-largest share in the country and energy prices were the second-lowest of any state east of the Mississippi River per the EIA.

BLACKROCK’S ESG PUSH PUTS CEO LARRY FINK IN ACTIVIST CROSSHAIRS

BlackRock and JPMorgan respond

BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase are two of the largest financial institutions in the U.S. and were among the 11 companies subject to Kentucky's warning.

BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager with about $8 trillion under management while JPMorgan Chase is America's largest bank with over $3 trillion in assets. Both firms pushed back against Kentucky's claims that they're boycotting energy companies.

JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Patricia Wexler told FOX Business in a statement: ""The fact is that we are among the largest financiers of the U.S. traditional and renewable energy industries including in Kentucky where we serve some of its largest energy companies and utilities. We believe our business practices are in line with Kentucky law and we are hopeful a deeper look at these facts would lead to reconsideration.""

A BlackRock spokesperson told Fox Business ""BlackRock's only agenda is delivering the best financial results for our clients. On behalf of our clients we have invested approximately $276 billion in energy companies globally. BlackRock does not boycott energy companies and will continue to be investors across the energy sector.""

BLACKROCK NOT CHANGING STANCE ON ESG INVESTING DESPITE CRITICISM

Efforts by investment banks to push environmental social and governance (ESG) standards that often promote investment in green energy ventures at the expense of fossil fuel firms have unnerved lawmakers in states that are major producers of coal oil and natural gas.

Those economic considerations along with concerns that ESG investment strategies may diminish investors' returns have led a number of states to divest state assets from financial firms advocating for such policies.

George was reportedly fired Saturday just four days after she filed a lawsuit in a Manhattan federal court on behalf of the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands alleging that JPMorgan Chase ""turned a blind eye"" to Epstein’s sex crimes.

The Virgin Island Consortium which first reported George's firing cited a person with ""knowledge of the matter"" who claimed she filed the lawsuit ""without first informing Governor Bryan of such a major action"" suggesting the two events could be related.

The governor’s communications director Richard Motta Jr. said the reports are not ""entirely"" accurate but he declined to comment further.

BIDEN VACATIONS IN VIRGIN ISLANDS AS AMERICANS FACE PROBLEMS AT HOME

""The governor relieved Denise George of her duties as attorney general"" Motta told Fox News Digital. ""I am not at liberty to discuss details on personnel matters. I can only confirm that media reports indicating the JP Morgan lawsuit as the reason are not entirely accurate. I hope you understand.""

In her lawsuit George alleged that JPMorgan Chase violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Act the Virgin Islands Criminally Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and the Virgin Islands Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.

""The Attorney General brings this action after presenting her findings in September 2022 in her ongoing effort to protect public safety and to hold accountable those who facilitated or participated in directly or indirectly the trafficking enterprise Epstein helmed"" the complaint read. ""The investigation revealed that JP Morgan knowingly negligently and unlawfully provided and pulled the levers through which recruiters and victims were paid and was indispensable to the operation and concealment of the Epstein trafficking enterprise.""

George claimed JPMorgan Chase ""knowingly"" facilitated sustained and concealed Epstein’s human trafficking network which he operated from his home in the U.S. Virgin Islands and failed to comply with federal banking regulations.

She alleged that the financial institution facilitated and concealed suspicious wire and cash transactions for Epstein’s ""criminal enterprise whose currency was the sexual servitude of dozens of women and girls in and beyond the Virgin Islands.""

JPMORGAN CHASE ACCUSED OF TURNING ‘BLIND EYE’ TO EPSTEIN SEX CRIMES: LAWSUIT

""Upon information and belief JP Morgan turned a blind eye to evidence of human trafficking over more than a decade because of Epstein’s own financial footprint and because of the deals and clients that Epstein brought and promised to the bank"" the lawsuit read. ""These decisions were advocated and approved at the senior levels of JP Morgan including by the former chief executive of its asset management division and investment bank whose inappropriate relationship with Epstein should have been evident to the bank.""

""Indeed it was only after Epstein’s death that JP Morgan belatedly complied with federal banking regulations regarding Epstein’s accounts"" the lawsuit continued.

George did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

JPMorgan told Benzinga this week that it ""ended its relationship with Epstein long before his ongoing misconduct became known.""

""Since then JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with investigations into Epstein and others"" the bank said. ""JPMorgan Chase’s ongoing commitment to combating money laundering and sex trafficking is unwavering and steadfast.""

The bank declined to comment further when reached by Fox News Digital on Tuesday.

Two of Epstein's alleged victims filed suit against JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank in November alleging that the banks turned a blind eye to the late billionaire's sex trafficking. On Saturday the banks asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuits.

Analysts predict that going into 2023 companies will invest in products that save money and resources as networks drift deeper into the cloud. These multi-cloud networking trends include network as a service connectivity for a cloud-native network function and more observability for network security.

What is multi-cloud networking? Multi-cloud networking connects multiple public clouds or a mix of public and private clouds (hybrid clouds). Most enterprises are embracing multi-cloud networking and using at least two or three cloud providers said Shamus McGillicuddy vice president of network management research at Enterprise Management Associates. The cloud team instead of the networking team often configures networking inside the cloud -- but that will change. ""I think more networking pros will start looking at multi-cloud networking as a strategic imperative in 2023"" McGillicuddy said. This initiative could involve multiple products and services such as network as a service (NaaS) providers data center networking overlays that extend into the cloud cloud networking specialists and software-defined WAN (SD-WAN). Enterprises also have the option of using a single-vendor strategy for networking inside the cloud. ""Either way network teams must get more centralized control and visibility over multi-cloud networks to ensure resilient and secure services that provide a good user experience"" McGillicuddy said. Bob Laliberte senior analyst at TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group agrees. There's a greater need to simplify the connectivity to multiple clouds he said. Several companies offer one tool that can learn the unique intricacies of each cloud to work with all of them. These tools save time for IT personnel who would otherwise need to become experts in each cloud rather than just learning one tool. Companies offering a single tool for cloud connectivity include Cisco Aviatrix Alkira Prosimo and F5. Here are the details on this year's multi-cloud networking trends:

1. NaaS NaaS is a way for enterprises to deliver network services on a subscription basis. Service providers have offered bandwidth as a service for a long time. But as budgets tighten organizations have a harder time predicting the ebbs and flows of the network said Derek Granath senior director of product and technical marketing at Aruba. Given the unpredictability more and more companies want to consume networking as a service. ""They don't want to own the Wi-Fi access points. They don't want to own the switches. They don't want to think about it"" Granath said. ""They just want to connect their employees and they want it to work."" Customers prefer to pay for services on an as-needed basis rather than obtaining full-time ownership like using a ride-sharing service rather than buying a car Granath said. As a result more and more network infrastructure will be consumed deployed and managed as a service. NaaS offerings include HPE's GreenLake for Aruba and Cisco's Cisco+ Laliberte said. Another is Nile the NaaS startup co-founded by Cisco's former CEO John Chambers and former executive vice president Pankaj Patel. Nile launched in 2022 has a usage-based consumption model and offers networking delivered entirely as a service. ""I think everyone's keeping their eye on them"" Laliberte said.

2. Connectivity for a cloud-native network function Building architectures for a cloud-native network function (CNF) requires a container network interface (CNI) an ingress controller and a service mesh according to IDC analyst Brad Casemore. A CNI defines how plugins should communicate and interoperate with the container runtime. An ingress controller is a load balancer for container environments that manages communications from outside the container. A service mesh is a part of the infrastructure that delivers service-to-service communications. ""Those are all operating at the highest layers of the OSI model"" Casemore said. These products are offered by Isovalent a company that provides cloud-native networking by harnessing eBPF technology. Its Cilium Enterprise product is an open source scalable CNI that supports multi-cluster networking. Cilium is becoming more popular as a data plane CNI for container networking which is a fast-growing area he said. Many other companies offer cloud-native networking service meshes including HashiCorp Solo.io and F5 Casemore said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vcHJvZmVzc2lvbmFsL2luc2lnaHRzL2RhdGEvZGF0YS1jZW50ZXItbmV0d29ya3MtcG9pc2VkLWZvci04LWJvb3N0LWZyb20tY2xvdWQtZW50ZXJwcmlzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Data center networks poised for 8% boost from cloud enterprise | Insights,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bloomberg.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /professional/insights/data/data-center-networks-poised-for-8-boost-from-cloud-enterprise/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3594A90>, 'Connection to www.bloomberg.com timed out.

NDAs have historically been misused by businesses to silence employees particularly women from speaking out about issues like sexual harassment and discrimination according to Simon. Over the last few years many U.S. states have enacted laws requiring employers to lessen restrictions on an employee’s ability to speak out about abuses at work.

Bolthouse Farms becomes the first food company to take a public stand on this issue announcing an updated NDA policy modeled on a Washington State law that took effect last June. It is considered to be the strongest in the U.S. While the company has seasonal operations in Washington state most of its operations are in California. Instead of having a state-by-state policy the company decided to apply the strongest policy across the board.

“It was important that we ensured uniform and maximum protection for all our 3000 employees be it an agricultural employee in California or an operations manager in Washington” said Iveth Adriana Plascencia the company’s labor and employment counsel. ""We feel it is the right thing to do. While California law has also restricted the use of NDAs we decided to adopt Washington State’s stronger policy to ensure uniform and maximum protection for all our employees regardless of where they are based.”

The NDA change specifically relates to any illegal acts or other wrongdoing by the company trade secrets and intellectual property are still protected.

“If there are problems our employees are facing we want to know about it and address the issue. We don’t want to silence our people whether they work in the fields in the plant or in our offices” said Rachel Serrano the company’s SVP of people culture and capabilities. Full Story

Although not exactly high-end units the HP 33120A makes for a pretty nice unit for a home lab. During the first test run however [Tom] discovered that one of the units had a dead output which made it rather useless. Undeterred [Tom] set to work diagnosing it helped by the repair manual and full schematics.

While the cause was quickly tracked down to the general area around an exploded MLCC fixing the fried Zener diode that may have initiated the short on the -15V rail revealed an unpleasant surprise. To [Tom]’s horror he saw a portal to Hell itself open when part of the PCB caught on fire due to an internal short. After making sure to capture a video of this event he then proceeded to use a thermal camera to track down the hot spot and uses a drill to remove the short.

While one can argue with the use of a drill to remove shorts on inner layers of a PCB ultimately the fix was effective.

After a year like 2022 a new year is a great opportunity to look for safe stocks to buy and hold. The definition of a safe stock is broad so this article will focus on a select group of stocks known as dividend kings.

Dividends are a portion of a company’s profits (i.e. earnings) paid as cash on a regular schedule frequently quarterly. Investors should look for companies that not only continue to issue dividends on a year-over-year (YOY) basis but continue to increase their dividends every year.

The best of the best are the dividend kings. These companies have increased their dividend for at least 50 consecutive years. That’s longer than many investors reading this article have been alive.

They may not offer the highest dividend yield. But the reliability of the company’s dividend points to mature stable business models that allow the company to generate sufficient profit to reward their shareholders while continuing to invest in their businesses.

In bull markets these companies won’t be the highest flyers. But when the market is struggling these stocks can help you mitigate your risk. Here are seven dividend kings that should be on your list of safe stocks to buy and hold forever.

Safe Stocks to Buy and Hold: PPG Industries (PPG)

PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) is a more recent addition to the dividend kings list. The company is a global manufacturer and distributor of paints coatings and specialty materials. In addition to being the parent company of consumer brands like Glidden paint PPG offers removable coatings for a range of commercial applications in sectors including automotive industrial and aerospace.

Like many companies PPG will post a YOY drop in earnings. However it’s expected to post earnings in 2023 that will outpace 2021 numbers.

Dividend kings are frequently seen as low-growth companies. However PPG continues to pursue a strategy of growth through acquisition. At the company’s 2022 Investor Day it reported that over the last 10 years the company is has committed 37% of its cash to acquisitions.

That hasn’t prevented the company from allocating approximately 55% of its cash for dividends with three-year dividend growth coming in at around 7% annually. PPG has a dividend yield of 1.98% and a payout of $2.48 per share on an annual basis.

Stepan (SCL)

Many investors may not be familiar with Stepan (NYSE:SCL). The company produces and distributes specialty chemicals used in a variety of applications such as soap and cosmetics. Because of the specialty nature of the company’s chemicals it doesn’t have competitors that precisely match its business.

In 2022 SCL stock dropped 14%. That was better than the broader market but still somewhat curious since the company grew revenue and earnings on a YOY basis. That pattern is expected to continue over the next five years.

That growth helps support the company’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio which is below the market average at around 16 times earnings. And that will be more than enough to support the company’s dividend payout ratio which is around 20% as of this writing.

Stepan isn’t heavily covered by the analyst community. But it does have a price target of $137 which is a 30% increase from the current stock price.

Safe Stocks to Buy and Hold: Emerson Electric (EMR)

Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com

Prior to October 2022 Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) stock was down more than 20% for the year. But it’s made a charge in the last quarter and is now trading flat over the last 12 months.

This may mean investors who are looking for safety are putting the company’s dividend over its declining earnings due to a restructuring. Emerson Electric is attempting to become a pure-play automation company. This would allow it to compete with Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK). However the cost of this restructuring affected earnings in 2022 and may continue to be a slight drag in 2023.

The company has a net margin of 16.5% which is more than double the sector average. And with a 65-year history of increasing its dividend Emerson Electric is one of the longest standing of the dividend kings. The current dividend yield is 2.17% and it has an average annual payout of $2.08.

Dover Corporation (DOV)

Dover Corporation (NYSE:DOV) is the next dividend king on this list of safe stocks to buy and hold. The company operates in the industrial sector. This helps the company provide a steady stream of consistent revenue and earnings. Dover has a global presence. However just over 50% of the company’s revenues come from the United States.

Due to the realization of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed by Congress in 2021 the industrial sector is expected to be one of the leading sectors in 2023. But the company’s growth is expected to continue in the next five years and will be assisted by a profit margin which is well above the sector average.

The company’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are expected to be about $8.44 in 2022. That would be a 24% gain from the prior year. And in 2023 the company projects EPS of $8.92.

Safe Stocks to Buy and Hold: American States Water (AWR)

Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.com

When it comes to safe stocks to buy and hold the utility sector is a logical choice and American States Water (NYSE:AWR) is a leader among water companies. The utility giant has a service territory that spans nine states and one million customers.

Historical performance shows American States Water is a strong performer. One benefit of owning dividend kings is the total return you can get over time. AWR stock was down 19% in 2022. That’s better than the broader market. However over the last five years the company has generated stock price growth of 74%. That combines with a dividend that has grown at a 10% average annual rate over the last three years.

Investors who are considering American States Water as a long-term investment can point to its net margin. At 16.6% it’s more than double the sector average of 7.9%. That helps provide some context to a stock that has a forward P/E ratio around 34 times earnings.

PepsiCo (PEP)

Late last year I put both Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) on a list of consumer stocks that could soar in 2023. One of the reasons is both companies are defensive stocks. This means they have products that are in demand no matter what is happening in the broader economy.

PepsiCo offers a portfolio that includes both beverages and snack foods. With brand names such as Doritos and Quaker Foods the company straddles the line between “junk foods” and healthy options. Pepsi’s products can be considered both discretionary purchases and staples in consumer pantries.

The company delivers strong fundamentals including a profit margin that is slightly above the sector average. Plus PEP is a low-beta stock which means it tends to be less volatile than the broader market. Pepsi is a more recent entry into the dividend king club and currently has a dividend yield of 2.6%.

Safe Stocks to Buy and Hold: Kimberly Clark (KMB)

Last on this list of safe stocks to buy and hold is Kimberly Clark (NYSE:KMB). When you think about defensive stocks you think about a stock like KMB. The company has a portfolio of products that are the definition of consumer staples. And with trusted name brands consumers will continue to buy the company’s products.

Revenue growth hasn’t been spectacular. But at a time when companies are having trouble passing along higher prices Kimberly Clark appears to have pricing power.

Over the past five years the stock has grown about 16%. That averages out to around 3% per year. For the four years prior to 2022 that wouldn’t be seen as impressive growth. But last year the stock’s loss of 5% was well below the market average. And when you factor in a dividend yield of 3.4% you can see how defensive stocks can be a great fit for a portfolio in any economy.

Conceptualised by Ogilvy the film features the key attributes of the brand and its new visuals.

The film uses the baby’s voice as a creative device to highlight their discomforts with diapers. It also shows different babies protesting and revolting against what is not enough for them and asking for more before Huggies comes their way.

Saakshi Verma Menon marketing director Kimberly – Clark India said “Huggies as a brand has always strived to go the extra mile to make the world a more comfortable place for babies. Through extensive consumer research we realised that babies need complete comfort with multiple benefits in one product. We are proud to introduce the new Huggies Complete Comfort to our Indian consumers to help babies and their parents navigate the unknowns of babyhood. Our research showed that 9 out of 10 moms feel that Huggies is more comfortable than their regular diaper which reinforces the trust that consumers have on this iconic brand.”

She added “We are launching a digital first campaign across platforms where mums today are spending most of their time. The content is hyper personalised and contextualised to specific consumer cohorts for heightened relevance and engagement. Also as a challenger brand in India it is imperative for us to break clutter and stand out as a preferred brand.

Gus Schumacher crossed the finish line and started a long skidding stop. His skis chattered as klister gripped in spots and bits on the transformed re-frozen snow at Oberstdorf Germany. Finally he came to a stop in front of the leader’s chair. Schumacher had raced brilliantly—improving his overall position from 62nd to top 20 in the Tour de Ski—but the look of happy astonishment on his face was not due to his own performance but to the identity of the occupant of the leader’s chair at the side of the finish corral: his teammate Ben Ogden sat perched there in the chair—smiling broadly cool as ever throwback Oakley’s and all.

“It almost didn’t feel right” Ogden said on sitting down in the leader’s chair during the 10 k individual start classic race that wound itself around three laps of Oberstdorf’s 3.3 k course. The leader’s chair is reserved for those who sit atop the World Cup field: that’s the sort of thing that would’ve been a dream for Ogden. After today those sorts of dreams are a bit closer to reality.

Ogden started his race with an auspicious 2 k checkpoint where the 23 year old Vermonter was 10 seconds up on a field. Five kilometers later—the checkpoint at roughly 7 k—his lead had come down to two seconds but when Ogden finally powered into the stadium he had closed his race with determination. There was no doubt where he stood in the early standings—there were 27.8 seconds between Ogden and 2nd place—but there were many more racers still to come . . .

The perennial powerhouses of the men’s World Cup were slated to start later in the race. Paal Golberg the Overall leader wore bib 42. Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo the Tour de Ski Leader started a minute and a half after that wearing bib 45. Ogden and Schumacher pulled up the live timing and waited for the perspective to be gained for the whole picture to come into view. What was apparent though as Schumacher’s time popped up as 2nd behind only Ogden and Hunter Wonders soon finished to slot in between them in 2nd place was that the American men were having a great day. Just how great would have to wait would have to be tempered by the Norwegian race playing out behind them.

Golberg was the leading edge of that piece of the picture. He was in a dead heat with Ogden through the 2 k checkpoint. Thoughts that Golberg would open a gap later in the race could have been excused: he is the Overall leader of the World Cup this year and in the finest form of his racing career. Today though the checkpoints through the race indicated a dead heat. By 8 k Goldberg held the lead by just two seconds over Ogden. As Golberg sprinted across the line he had only managed to gain a single second more: 1st) Paal Golberg 2nd) Ben Ogden +3.1 sec.

That Klaebo was quickly coming through behind Golberg—and opening a gap over the second half of the course—seemed like an afterthought. It is almost easy to overlook the astonishing nature of Klaebo’s racing even when he appeared sure to win the race by the time he passed the 6 k checkpoint with an 11 second gap over Golberg and Ogden. By 8 k that gap had expanded to 20 seconds. At the finish Klaebo’s winning margin extended to 28.3 seconds over 2nd place Golberg.

A little further down the start list a few more of the perennial favorites filed in with results. Simen Hegsted Krueger (NOR) split the difference between Klaebo and Golberg and finished in 2nd place +12.4 seconds off of Klaebo’s 21:38.5. Didrik Toenseth (NOR) and Calle Halfvarsson (SWE) wearing bibs 60 and 64 soon bested Golberg as well with Toenseth rounding out the podium in 3rd place +22.4 seconds and Halfvarsson in 4th place +24.9 seconds.

When the whole picture came together the full extent of what the Americans had achieved on the day was realized. Ben Ogden—who up until this point has made his progress through the World Cup field primarily through his Sprint results—had the best result of his young career coming in 6th place. Hunter Wonders had the best result of his young career too finishing in 11th place on the day. Gus Schumacher turned in a 15th place finish and Scott Patterson finished in 29th place. Americans had 4 men in the top 30: that’s quite a day.

That team accomplishment strikes a particular chord given the conditions in Oberstdorf. Skiing is always a team effort but on some days the team becomes every bit as important as the effort. With the abrasive warm conditions that confronted the World Cup today— with the pastures of Bavaria looking like the month of July—classic technique racing becomes a coordinated dance of a team of techs coaches athletes and racers. As Gus Schumacher said in his post-race comments “When the skis are running this [well] everything else is secondary.” For the Americans to have one of their best days ever will be viewed in that context. An accomplishment which speaks to the heart of a program that has pioneered emphasizing the holistic work required for individual results on the sport’s highest level.

That US team will now turn towards the opportunity to do some skiing together on Stage 4 tomorrow where a pursuit start awaits with a 20 k Skate on the same man-made loop in Oberstdorf. As the US men look to hold onto places gained in the pack Tour de Ski leader Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo will look to expand his lead over 2nd place Golberg a lead that currently stands at 37 seconds through three stages of racing. Simen Hegstad Krueger is just three seconds behind Golberg in 3rd place overall with Didrik Toenseth in 4th place at 57 seconds back.

In the meantime across the American continent today many skiers will be echoing the feelings of Ben Ogden on Stage 3 today: “It was a real treat” he said. “A ton of fun.”

Nominations will close February 19 at 11:59 p.m. ET.

Since launching 17 years ago Kraft Hockeyville has awarded $4.5 million to 93 communities to address the growing costs associated with aging sports and recreation infrastructure in Canada. This year former NHL defenseman P.K. Subban joins the program’s ongoing efforts to fuel the passion and pride of hockey cities and towns from coast-to-coast. Subban's storied career in hockey and his legacy of giving back makes him the perfect program ambassador.

“I had a passion for the game from the moment my mom & dad first put a stick in my hand and that passion grew every time I laced up my skates at my local arena” said P.K.

Capri Sun apple juice class action overview:

Who: An apple juice consumer sued Kraft Heinz the maker of Capri Sun.

An apple juice consumer sued Kraft Heinz the maker of Capri Sun. Why: The plaintiff says the juice is falsely marketed as having all-natural ingredients.

The plaintiff says the juice is falsely marketed as having all-natural ingredients. Where: The Capri Sun apple juice class action was filed in a New York federal court.

Capri Sun apple juice is falsely marketed as having no preservatives when it contains the known preservative citric acid a new class action lawsuit alleges.

Plaintiff Eboni Forbes filed the class action lawsuit against Kraft Heinz Food Company Jan. 2 in a New York federal court alleging violations of state and federal consumer laws.

According to her complaint the Kraft Heinz Foods Company makes and sells apple juice marketed as having “All Natural Ingredients” and “No Artificial Colors Flavors or Preservatives” under the Capri Sun brand.

However the statement of “No Artificial Colors Flavors or Preservatives” is false deceptive and misleading because the product contains citric acid an artificial ingredient which serves multiple preservative functions the Capri Sun apple juice class action alleges.

“Federal and identical state law require that foods containing chemical preservatives disclose this in a way likely to be read by consumers” the lawsuit claims.

Apple juice should have stated citric acid as preservative Capri Sun class action states

Where a chemical preservative is used it must be accompanied by a parenthetical in the ingredient list that describes its function such as “preservative” the Capri Sun class action says.

“Instead of identifying citric acid’s function as a preservative or any of the other examples provided Defendant’s parenthetical declaration that it is used ‘FOR TARTNESS’ is misleading and contrary to law” the lawsuit states.

A customer would just think the citric acid impacts the product’s flavor which is true but also misleading because it fails to disclose that the Capri Sun apple juice requires this ingredient to maintain preserve and protect its flavor from deteriorating the Capri Sun class action claims.

Forbes sued on behalf of anyone who bought the product in New York plus a consumer fraud multistate class of consumers from South Dakota Wyoming Idaho Alaska Iowa Mississippi Arkansas South Carolina and Utah.

She also sued for violations of state consumer laws breach of warranty fraud and unjust enrichment.

Forbes seeks certification of the class action damages fees costs and a jury trial.

In December a consumer hit Kraft with another Capri Sun class action lawsuit alleging it falsely advertises its Capri Sun Strawberry Kiwi juice drink as containing “all natural ingredients” when the product contains per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances.

(WRDW/WAGT) - On Monday Kroger will break ground on Eisenhower Crossing the new Kroger Marketplace expected to open in spring of 2024.

The new store on Jimmie Dyess Parkway near Gordon Highway represents a $32 million investment and will create 250-300 new jobs.

Here's the site plan for the new Kroger store along Jimmie Dyess Parkway near Gordon Highway. (Contributed)

It will encompass 124000 square feet with an adjacent fuel center and a wide variety of features including:

• Murray’s Cheese Shop.

• Expanded deli offerings including sushi.

• Grocery pickup.

• New belted self-checkouts that are extremely popular with Kroger customers.

• Mural designed by a local artist.

• Pharmacy with an exterior drive thru.

The Augusta Commission voted Tuesday to approve a boundary plat for 24 acres near the corner of Jimmie Dyess Parkway and Harper Franklin Avenue which clears the way to construct a 118000-square-foot Kroger.

The size fits the parameters of a Kroger Marketplace which during the past two years have “ranged in size from 100000 to 130000 square feet” according to the supermarket chain’s website.

The supermarket would anchor a commercial development that includes four outparcels – three that are an acre each and another that is 1.5 acres – on which freestanding buildings can be constructed according to plans on file with the city.

Already included in the initial Kroger development is a pair of stores labeled “Shops A” and “Shops B” on the plans. While no specific business is identified for either store each building measures 5400 square feet and shows access for a drive-through window.

The Kroger is expected to include a pharmacy and a Kroger Fuel Center. Kroger Marketplaces differ from typical Kroger supermarkets and carry wider product offerings of food apparel and other general merchandise.

Wrecking ball:Kroger to close 15th Street store

New development:New Kroger possibly Marketplace headed for Jimmie Dyess Parkway in Augusta

Access to the Kroger and the other stores would be off Harper Franklin Drive. That puts the new store across from the Belair K-8 School that was built in 2018 and next to the new Governors Place subdivision of single-family homes and two- and three-bedroom townhomes. Governors Place residents would have access to the Kroger through George W. Crawford Drive which loops around the back of the subdivision.

A development of two-bedroom apartments Pointe Grand lies south of the store development closer to Jimmie Dyess’ intersection with Gordon Highway.

The new Kroger would be the closest off-base supermarket to Fort Gordon which contains the Fort Gordon Commissary grocery store.

The Marketplace would become Richmond County’s second current Kroger location. The Kroger in the Washington Walk shopping center at 2801 Washington Road opened in 1987. A Kroger that opened on 15th Street in 1981 was demolished in 2017. There are three Krogers in neighboring Columbia County.

In mid-October 2022 North American grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons announced their intent to merge. If successful the move will mark one of the largest grocery deals in history creating an opportunity for the combined brand to compete with Walmart—a grocery retailer that has a physical presence within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population—Amazon’s at-home delivery and Costco.

For Kroger and Albertsons the benefits of this consolidation are clear. Across industries consumers are seeking out a personalized shopping experience even at the grocery store. In an already low-margin industry it has been difficult for the second and fourth largest grocers by market share (Kroger and Albertsons respectively) to build sustainable and competitive grocery delivery programs.

As the grocery industry continues to become increasingly fulfillment oriented the consolidation of Kroger and Albertsons’ business teams will be primed to accommodate this shift in consumer behavior. Furthermore the crossover in geographies created if this merger comes to fruition will help both players iron out the logistics and bring down the overhead of orchestrating direct-to-consumer delivery.

Morphing these two brands into one grocery goliath will put pressure on Walmart to advance its current offerings likely to benefit consumers in the end.

Off to a bumpy start

The Kroger-Albertsons merger plan has seen a few hiccups. Both entities have storefronts scattered across the country but political leaders in some localities have voiced their concerns about potential price gouging in places where those storefronts overlap. For example Albertsons and Ralphs (a Kroger subsidiary) compete for customers in California and Carrs (Albertsons) and Fred Meyer (Kroger) are the two dominant grocery chains in Alaska. To mitigate drastic competition reduction Kroger has proposed spinning off up to 375 stores under a separate brand.

On the other hand scale buying and assortment of inventory are all augmented in a merger like this one where two prevalent industry players come together. A merger of this magnitude will leave a lasting impression on the industry and change the way consumers interact with their hometown grocers. In recent history only one brand move has created similar waves in the space—Amazon’s 2017 acquisition of Whole Foods. Done right the Kroger and Albertsons partnership could mean similar and significant improvements in consumer experience.

As the new entity gets its ducks in a row there is a unique opportunity for Kroger and Albertsons’ leaders to capitalize on the learnings of previous mergers and acquisitions and position themselves as a customer ally amid criticism. The key to success for Kroger and Albertsons now is how they communicate their intent to their customers and employees and lean into the benefits this coalition brings.

Potential opportunities to drive better CX

There are two customer-centric opportunities created as a result of this merger that Kroger and Albertsons should take advantage of to build out a competitive customer-first fulfillment-oriented business model: smart personalization and intelligent fulfillment.

Smart personalization

For decades grocery brands focused on scaled reach and mass marketing to engage and retain customers. They relied heavily on “milk bread and eggs” loyalty. However increasingly discerning consumer choices—including emerging preferences for sustainability transparency organics and value savings—along with ubiquitous omnichannel competition have heralded a new era where former loyalties can no longer be taken for granted.

A strong recommendation engine can renew foregone brand loyalty. Grocery chains can help to drive future purchases by prompting the purchase of frequently recurring or last purchase items—through push notifications or custom email campaigns. Furthermore assorted recommendations can introduce customers to local favorites samplers for the experimental shopper “complete the recipe” suggestions for DIY cooks and more.

To take this to the next level data should be used to simulate a value-based pricing experience by crafting smart promotions and loyalty options to drive retention and maximize customer lifetime value.

Key levers to drive smart personalization and build customer loyalty include:

Rewards —Both Kroger and Albertsons have been praised for their stand-out loyalty programs which according to 2020 data from Kroger allows the brand to capture 96% of purchasing decisions. Combined with new data from Albertson’s top-ranking loyalty program the joint brand has the resources necessary to create the leading personalized shopping experience—should they use the data to their advantage.

Combined with new data from Albertson’s top-ranking loyalty program the joint brand has the resources necessary to create the leading personalized shopping experience—should they use the data to their advantage. Subscription economy —It is critical for the joint brand to identify the core reason that current customers are subscribed to Kroger and Albertsons individually and what value the merged entity can offer to consumers as an incentive to stay subscribed. Is it savings on essential purchases like fuel or subscriber-only discounts on regularly purchased items?

Digital marketing —On the retail media business side the combination of already-established Kroger Precision Marketing and the Albertsons Media Collective would serve over 85 million households providing cross-country reach an extensive store of transactional data and an impactful advertising opportunity for other CPG brands through the sale of online banner ads.

Intelligent fulfillment

Intelligent fulfillment is the other half of the successful merger puzzle. In our modern connected world demand forecasting warehousing and the physical network need to be reimagined to meet new customer promises.

The grocery network of the future will have a rationalized store fleet in which select storefronts are converted to “dark stores” or fulfillment hubs created based upon factors like demand proximity route optimization storage space and zonal regulations.

Reach is everything in the turf war for retail supremacy. Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods gave Amazon access to Whole Foods’ network of suppliers and distributors—driving down prices and putting pressure on competitors. With 4996 stores 66 distribution centers 52 manufacturing plants 2015 fuel centers and more than 710000 associates across 48 states and the District of Columbia two out of every three households in the US could be serviced by the merged Kroger-Albertsons entity.

To achieve an evolved intelligent fulfillment future through this merger the following should be considered:

Changing consumer demand— Evolving buying journeys and situational changes that impact purchasing decisions like job loss and rising inflation rates married with the diverse range of products grocery distributors provide in a post-COVID world have presented a challenge for grocers. To effectively operate in the changing economy they look to answer “What products and how much of each are consumers likely to buy?” At the same time previously dependable methods of forecasting consumer demand—purely predicated on past behavior—have come up severely short with variance levels reaching more than 40%. There is an immediate need to predict drivers of demand by sub-category and bring it into the forecasting equation so that inventory can be stocked appropriately.

There is an immediate need to predict drivers of demand by sub-category and bring it into the forecasting equation so that inventory can be stocked appropriately. Supplier intelligence & efficiency— Kroger with 1600 suppliers  and Albertsons with nearly 1000 suppliers  have a strong infrastructure to meet the various needs of several consumer segments. But with more than 80% overlap in product categories based on an assessment of their websites there is a significant opportunity for the combined entity to rationalize product breadth and depth consolidate merchandising and buying drive greater economies of scale in purchasing and cross-leverage data to improve supply availability on-time performance and product quality.

1600 suppliers 1000 suppliers Supply chain network— Instead of shuttering stores in congested areas the pair should make use of existing storefronts by converting them to micro-fulfillment centers or “dark stores.” Made popular by the convenience delivery brand GoPuff dark stores increase the bandwidth for timely direct-to-consumer delivery. The move would position Kroger to compete against Amazon which offers Prime members a 2-hour guaranteed delivery for $9.99.

Supply chain visibility —Augmented inventory and an expanded regional presence among other things require a more thoughtful supply chain strategy. Kroger and Albertsons should be considering how they use the data at hand to bring total visibility to the supply chain. As inflation worsens what products will be “need to have” and “nice to have” in 2023 and beyond? Where should they be stocked? Managing inventory to proactively meet customer needs could be a key differentiating factor in the Kroger-Albertsons partnership.

Should this merger successfully endure FTC scrutiny the combined brand will be well-positioned to strengthen its initiatives across the value chain. Ultimately the new data available is of no use to either brand without a concrete plan for its utilization. Kroger and Albertsons should take this time to think through how they will use their newfound data to bring total visibility to their operations in order to create a customer-centric grocery shopping experience.

The TDL products also called Link 16 are integrated on military platforms to securely transmit voice and data communications. The business includes 450 employees and generates about $400 million in annual sales.

Separately NV5 Global in late December said it has agreed to acquire the Visual Information Solutions business of L3Harris in a deal that would expand its work in geospatial data services. The acquisition is expected to close during the first half of 2023 subject to regulatory approvals. L3Harris said it expects the divestiture to result in a $100 million benefit to the company.

Christopher Kubasik chairman and CEO of L3Harris said in December that the company was looking at a couple of business divestitures in 2023.

The journal focuses on theoretical applied and comparative studies and predictive research by adopting cross-disciplinary methodological approaches. Moreover the journal will be a knowledge and scientific platform available to researchers and academics in this field and a tributary to enrich the theoretical methodological and applied intellectual production of media and communication especially in light of the problems that this field is experiencing in the Arab world the lack of creativity of academic institutions in scientific programmes and the lack of developmental and future research.

The first issue of the journal includes scientific research and studies immersed in the current debate on media issues that are of wide interest to the research community and stem from the journal’s aim to expand research on them through a multi-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary perspective and contribute to the enrichment of media knowledge by approaching the dimensions of research problems that present them. The first study “The Crisis of the Arab Printed Press and the Difficulty of Transformation in the Digital Environment” by Nacer Eddine Layadi focuses on understanding the causes of the fragility of the Arab press by highlighting the causal relationships of multiple variables and analysing the factors of its continued adherence to the traditional model that defines what journalism the journalist and readers are. The study attempts to answer a problematic question: Why is this press still facing the crisis that American and European newspapers managed to overcome? It converges with many studies that argue that the crisis of the Arab press is of a political and economic nature as it is due to the absence of democracy in journalistic practice and the difficulty of building an alternative economic model.

The second study “Towards Total Journalism: Journalism from a Future Perspective by Sadok Hammami and Abdel Aziz Ktata deals with the developments of journalism in the context of technological transformations and the so-called information disorder. The study examines the most important international reports on global journalism trends focusing on the problems addressed by eight international reports such as the decline of the printed press and publicity and investment revenues; the competition of social and digital media platforms; risks to the press as a public facility; the decline of trust in the media; the impact of the continuous spread of fake and misleading news on journalists' role in the public sphere; transformations in the advertising market; the characteristics of new editorial innovations; and artificial intelligence. Ultimately the study concludes that the approach of “total journalism” takes into account the combination of global normative principles on which the press is based and its political primary roles on the one hand and the editorial and technological innovations that journalism needs to renew itself on the other.

The third study “Fake News Politicians’ Statements on Social Media Platforms and their Role in the Emergence of Fact-Checking Journalism Models in Yemen” by Abdullah Salem Bakhuraisa investigates the role of fake news and politicians' statements on social media platforms in the emergence of the mechanisms of fact-checking and models of investigative journalism in Yemen. It was conducted on a purposive sample of 120 journalists working in Yemen using the descriptive method to approach the dimensions of the research problem. Bakhuraisa finds that the spread of fake news and the statements of politicians in Yemen led to the interest of journalists in the process of verifying and investigating information and that events in Yemen after 2011 helped the vast spread of information images and videos on social media platforms.

The study conducted by Manal Al-Mazahreh “The Problems of Arab Media Research and Methods of Developing in light of a New Digital Media Environment: A Critical and Analytical Vision” seeks to identify the methodological problems faced by Arab media research in the context of the new digital environment based on a qualitative analysis of an intentional sample of Arab media research containing 66 studies and a critical view that examines the compatibility of traditional approaches and theories with the digital environment and their ability to frame and analyse new phenomena. The study finds that most Arab media research given the new digital media environment relies on the survey method and lacks diversity in the use of data collection tools. It also faces the problem of applying many of the theories that were used in traditional media research in new media. In addition many studies are not based on theoretical insights.

In a book review of Media Futures: Theory and Aesthetics by Jens Schröter and Christoph Ernst Mahmoud Galander approaches the future of media outlets from a theoretical and aesthetic standpoint by referring to imagination regarding the future as indicative of the current reality in the field of media. Therefore it considers media the element through which the future can be controlled. The authors discuss the theories of imagination and their relation to the future of media presenting four examples: imaginations related to interactive television and its relation to media art; “ubiquitous computing” which still exists today; three-dimensional holographic imagination seen in cinema; and contemporary imagination related to quantum computing and how it has been exhibited in science fiction. Additionally the book focuses on treating technological developments in the world more than it looks into media outlets and places more importance on technological aspects than people’s socio-cultural reality. In fact it does not even address vital issues that are currently some of the most important issues pertaining to media especially in its evolution towards social media.

Moreover the first issue of Al Jazeera li Dirasat al-Itisal wa al-I’lam presents the first building block in the Modern Media Dictionary a cognitive contribution to the lexical industry that achieves an accumulation of media knowledge as a scientific means of documenting the connection to its field of work. This gives readers a deep awareness of how the lexical system expresses the process of phenomena and the issues that it deals with through research on the origins of words forming vocabulary and concepts and investigating their historical development. The scientific material was prepared by Kamal Hamidou former head of the Department of Mass Communication at Qatar University.

Researchers experts and academics interested in contributing to and participating in the journal’s following issues are invited to contact the editor-in-chief at ajcm@aljazeera.net. The second issue will be released in June 2023. Research must be written in Arabic original and conducted specifically for the journal. It must not be extracted from a university thesis published in part or in whole in any paper or electronic publication presented at a conference or submitted for publication in a periodical.

Buffalo Bill’s Hotel-Casino in Primm reopened on Christmas Eve after being closed since March 2020 because of the pandemic. It is one of three casinos operated by Las Vegas-based Affinity Gaming in the community along Interstate 15 at the Nevada-California border.

The privately held company did not make any formal announcement about the re-opening other than a post on the Primm Valley Resorts Twitter site saying it was proud “to have the reels spinning again at Buffalo Bill’s.”

Representatives from Primm did not respond to emailed questions about the reopening. Buffalo Bill’s was the last of the three Primm casinos to reopen.

In the Twitter statement Primm Valley said “multi-million-dollar upgrades” would be coming to the casinos in 2023.

Primm said slot machines and table games were available at the casino along with the Wagon Wheel Grill restaurant although a Nevada Independent photographer found only a handful of customers a few days after Christmas.

The Desperado Rollercoaster at Buffalo Bill’s remained closed. It was considered one of the world’s tallest roller coasters when it opened in 1994 with a height of 209 feet and a drop of 225 feet with a portion of the track running through the casino.

Affinity then known as Herbst Gaming acquired the three Primm casinos – Buffalo Bill’s Primm Valley and Whiskey Pete’s – from MGM Resorts in 2007 for $400 million. Herbst Gaming filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy two years later.

The company was rebranded as Affinity Gaming in 2011 following the bankruptcy reorganization. Affinity is now owned by Illinois-based Z Capital Group which took Affinity private in 2017. In 2019 Mary Beth Higgins was named CEO.

Affinity operates five casinos in Nevada – the three Primm properties Silver Sevens in Las Vegas and Rail City in Sparks. The company also owns two casinos in Missouri and a casino in Iowa.

GAN deal with WynnBet increases reach for the sports betting platform

Sports betting software provider GAN Ltd. is awaiting licensing by Nevada gaming regulators. But the absence of that approval hasn’t slowed the company’s growth in the continuously evolving market.

The Irvine California-based company which has offices in Las Vegas announced an agreement in late December to provide the sports betting platform and technology to WynnBet the sports betting subsidiary of Wynn Resorts operated by Wynn Interactive.

Terms of the deal between GAN and Wynn were not announced. In a statement GAN said its sports betting technology would be used for the retail sportsbook and online sports betting operations at Encore Boston Harbor when the activity launches in Massachusetts in the next few months.

GAN already provides the online platform for WynnBET’s operations in Michigan. Nevada licensing could eventually lead to GAN becoming the supplier for Wynn’s sports betting in Nevada which currently includes just a retail sportsbook at Wynn Las Vegas.

“We look forward to growing our partnership with GAN and bringing an enhanced sports betting experience to our players” Wynn Interactive President Ian Williams said in a statement.

The agreement with Wynn follows an announcement by GAN in October 2021 to build out the sports betting infrastructure for Station Casinos retail sportsbooks betting kiosks and the STN mobile app.

GAN’s technology and platform are being used by the sportsbook at the Island View Casino in Gulfport Mississippi.

GAN Vice President of North America Sports Rob Lekites said in a statement the company has developed a strong partnership with WynnBET in Massachusetts.

“The reception of GAN Sports remains highly encouraging as we look to carry this positive momentum into a strong cadence of new partner launches over the coming quarters” Lekites said.

In a research note Macquarie Securities gaming analyst Chad Beynon said Wynn and Station Casinos give GAN “two major partners.” He suggested GAN’s Massachusetts sports betting opportunity through Wynn would translate into $2.6 million of revenue and an annual cash flow of $700000.

GAN Vice President of Investor Relations and Capital Markets Robert Shore said in an email the deal with Wynn is “an exclusive national agreement” and additional markets “will be disclosed at the appropriate time.” He said GAN didn’t want to reveal much more to be respectful of the Nevada licensing process.

The company has caught the attention of the investment community as it moves to expand its presence in the ultra-competitive U.S. sports betting market. Ohio became the nation’s 31st state with legal sports betting when it launched on New Year’s Day.

During the Global Gaming Expo in October the GAN booth drew a strong share of interested customers.

VICI contributing $350M toward Fontainebleau’s $2.2B financing package

Real estate investment trust VICI Properties was part of one last Strip deal before 2022 ended.

The company will contribute $350 million toward a $2.2 billion construction loan package that will allow developers of the Fontainebleau resort to complete the long-stalled north Strip project.

Fontainebleau Development and Koch Real Estate Investments announced the loan package on Dec. 23. The Fontainebleau project restarted in November 2021 when the original Florida-based developer reacquired the 25-acre site nine months earlier. The project sat unfinished for 12 years after construction was halted in 2009.

“We believe the addition of the property will contribute to the increased vitality of the north end of the Las Vegas Strip” VICI CFO David Kieske said in a statement.

VICI is the Strip’s largest landowner controlling more than 660 acres that house a dozen properties leased to four companies – MGM Resorts International Caesars Entertainment Apollo Global Management and Hard Rock International.

Last year VICI completed a $17.2 billion buyout of rival real estate investment trust MGM Growth Properties and was part of a $6.25 billion purchase of the Strip properties that were operated by Las Vegas Sands Corp. VICI also owns the 77 acres underneath The Mirage whose operations were purchased in December by Hard Rock from MGM Resorts for almost $1.1 billion.

“VICI wraps an active 2022 which completely changed the complexion of the company increasing its size enhancing visibility with the investment community and upgrading portfolio quality” JMP Securities gaming analyst Mitch Germain told investors in a Dec. 17 research note.

VICI said in its statement the Fontainebleau investment would be funded in accordance with a construction draw schedule.

Fontainebleau Las Vegas is expected to open later this year with 3700 hotel rooms a casino 550000 square feet of convention and meeting space and a collection of dining retail and lifestyle attractions.

Following the construction financing announcement Fontainebleau named five executives who will oversee the day-to-day operations of the property including former Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas Vice President Colleen Birch who was named chief operating officer.

Maverick Gaming adds four more Washington cardrooms in an $80.5M deal

Privately held Maverick Gaming expanded its presence in Washington State acquiring four cardroom casinos for $80.5 million at the end of December.

The company which owns four hotel-casinos in West Wendover and Elko took over operations of Evergreen Gaming’s cardrooms in the Seattle area. Maverick now owns and operates 23 of Washington’s 44 licensed cardrooms.

“Strategically this acquisition is crucial to Maverick’s continued dominance in Washington State” Maverick Gaming CEO Eric Persson said in a statement. “We expect there to be enormous consolidation as well as operational and marketing benefits to our company as a result of this transaction.”

Cardrooms in Washington are limited to a total of 15 table games which can include baccarat poker and variations of blackjack.

Maverick which moved its corporate headquarters from Las Vegas to the Seattle community of Kirkland is seeking to add sports betting to its mix. The company failed in 2020 and 2021 to get the Washington Legislature to include cardrooms in legislation that allowed the state’s tribal casinos to offer sports betting.

Last year Maverick filed a federal lawsuit claiming the state unlawfully granted Native American casinos a “discriminatory tribal gaming monopoly.”

Maverick also owns three casinos in Colorado in Central City and Black Hawk which are 45 minutes outside of Denver.

$5.3B in casino revenue in 2022 marks Macau’s lowest in 18 years

Macau — once the world’s largest gambling market — ended 2022 with its casino industry reporting its lowest 12-month gaming revenue total since 2004.

China’s zero-COVID policies which included travel restrictions quarantines and business shutdowns put a damper on Macau casinos throughout the year. The constraints led to a final revenue figure of $5.3 billion a 51.4 percent decline from 2021 according to a report released by Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau on New Year’s Day.

One positive sign from the December numbers was gaming revenue of $435 million was 13 percent higher than November’s single month total.

However even as China has publicly stated plans to move beyond its zero-COVID policy Stifel Financial gaming analyst Steven Wieczynski said investors shouldn’t get too excited. In a research note published Monday Wieczynski predicted Macau “won’t become more ‘normal’ until after March.”

He said the positive signs that the Chinese government is changing from its “harsh COVID stance” could be upended by any spikes in the virus.

“We still believe the next couple of months will be a roller coaster as China goes through the Covid wave” Wieczynski said. “Investors have to understand the market probably won’t go into recovery mode until mid-2023 at the earliest.”

The gaming revenue results were announced shortly after Macau finalized its relicensing process with its six casino operators on new 10-year agreements. The companies including MGM Resorts International Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands agreed to invest upward of $15 billion into non-gaming entertainment attractions.

To put Macau’s gaming revenue decline into perspective casinos collected a record $45 billion in 2013 with analysts predicting the market would hit $100 million in a few years. Last year yielded one-ninth the revenue of 2013.

Economic conditions in China and a crackdown on the junket industry which delivered large-spending customers to the casinos led to revenue declines over the next six years resulting in $36.6 billion in gaming revenue in 2019 a year before the pandemic upended Macau’s gaming industry.

In 2020 Macau casinos reported gaming revenue of $7.56 billion its lowest figure in 14 years following the cancellations of Chinese New Year celebrations in January a 15-day casino shutdown in February and six straight months of 90 percent gaming declines.

The market rebounded in 2021 to $10.8 billion.

When the final numbers are counted the American Gaming Association suggested the combined gaming revenue from commercial and tribal operations could top $100 billion in 2022.

“We saw increased consumer demand coming out of the pandemic that’s been sustained. And operators have done a really good job in terms of serving those customers. Our industry probably doesn’t get enough credit for how innovative we always are about creating experiences that our customers want.”

Disgraced former gaming executive Steve Wynn is looking to sell a huge swath of his personal real estate for close to $300 million. Wynn the former chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts listed two adjacent Sun Valley Idaho properties for $27 million after listing a Palm Beach residence for $78.5 million and a New York City penthouse for $90 million. Wynn has also sought $100 million for the Beverly Hills estate he listed last year. He sold his Las Vegas home for $17.5 million in June records show.

Wynn is “not an easy seller. He wants what he wants” in terms of price. “Otherwise he doesn’t sell.”

The Nevada Gaming Commission approved new cybersecurity regulations to protect operators’ information systems from attacks that could shutter casinos and compromise customer data. Casinos are required to do a risk assessment of their systems by the end of 2023. Properties are also required to report any successful breach that compromised player or employee data credit card information and/or other records to gaming regulators within 72 hours.

“It doesn’t mean they can wait 72 hours to respond or react to the cyberattack but to notify us. We felt that was limited enough time that the Board if there were risks to the industry as a whole could take necessary measures to mitigate damage to other participants in the industry.”

Writing in a farewell message announcing the new job on social media Saxon said he has accepted a vice president role with Leidos focused on customer advocacy.

Saxon served at CMS most recently as deputy director of its Office of Information Technology and deputy CIO. Before that he held several other roles at CMS including as chief technology officer for Healthcare.gov — in which he helped improve the performance of the program’s website and systems with little downtime during its fifth open enrollment period — and as the acting director for emergency preparedness and response operations during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

At FedTalks in August Saxon spoke about the work his office led by CIO Rajiv Uppal is doing to modernize legacy IT systems saying that CMS has “more than a “half a dozen or so mainframes” that provide critical services for the American public and could be up for modernization in the near future.

“Medicare for example — sixty-something million people are dependent upon our mainframes functioning the way we want them to function” he said. “They do function well which is why we’re still on them” Saxon added noting that this is in part because the agency is “somewhat risk averse” culturally.

He added: “Our teams are the ones that are pushing back [on proposed changes] because it does function on a daily basis it does deliver that capability. And our challenge is to figure out how we can get past their concerns with risk to get to a place where we can see ourselves that 10 years down the road.”

A retired Army colonel Saxon has more than 30 years of IT leadership experience and is a combat veteran. He also served the Department of the Army as assistant deputy CIO for operations and plans.

U.S. Navy photo by Ensign Helena Blaisdell-Black WASHINGTON D.C. The U.S. Navy has awarded eight companies positions on a follow-on contract -- which could run as much as 10 years and $4.1 billion -- to deliver production units software laboratory equipment system components and spares for surface shore and submarine platforms in support of the Navy’s Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) program.

The companies awarded positions on the contract are BAE Systems Global Technical Systems L3Harris Technologies Leidos Leonardo DRS Peraton Serco and the VT Group's Milcom subsidiary. The work under the follow-on contract is expected to be done through December 2032 in Alabama California Florida Massachusetts Mississippi New Jersey Pennsylvania South Carolina and Virginia.

Star India batter Rishabh Pant will be shifted from Dehradun hospital to a Mumbai hospital where he will undergo extensive treatment for his ligament injuries in the knee and ankle sources in the BCCI said on Wednesday.

”Rishabh is being shifted to Mumbai for diagnosis and treatment of his ligament injuries and decide upon the further course of action. He is expected to be under the supervision of BCCI-empanelled renowned sports orthopaedic Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala. If there is advice for surgery a call will be taken if it will happen in the UK or USA” a senior BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

Pant 25 survived a horrific car accident when he was driving down from Delhi to his hometown Rourkee but lost control on NH-58 highway and hit the divider.

Pant sustained cuts on his forehead a severely-bruised back along with injuries in his knee and ankle.

While most injuries are superficial the worrying factor will be the ankle and knee as he got treated at Max Dehradun.

However being a centrally-contracted BCCI cricketer his injury treatment was the board’s prerogative.

The MRIs of his injured knee and ankle couldn’t be performed as there was extensive swelling and hence the degree of tear is yet to be ascertained.

However it is understood that any sports-related injury diagnosis and prognosis for a centrally-contracted cricketer will be done by BCCI’s list of doctors and the rehabilitation and recuperation will be managed by the Sports and Medical Science team at NCA led by Dr Nitin Patel.",,,,,,

As calls grow for action to rein in the concert monopoly in the US and abroad the company seems to have hit on a new strategy: spending big in Washington.

Live Nation’s spending on lobbying jumped from about $250000 in 2018 to nearly $1.3m in 2021 federal records show and it may top that peak in 2022 and beyond. It has focused its lobbying campaign on the department of justice as well as legislation aimed at greater transparency around ticket sales.

The spending is a response to the “serious challenges” Live Nation faces said Sheila Krumholz executive director of campaign finance analyst Open Secrets.

“The spending has a lot to do with them playing defense because they have been accused for several years of behavior that has been anticompetitive they have been accused of being a monopoly company and they have the DoJ investigation so they are fighting on a number of fronts” Krumholz said.

The political spending comes amid mounting frustration among concertgoers and sports fans over alleged price gouging soaring fees and Live Nation’s practice of withholding tickets that are then sold on the secondary market at inflated cost among other issues.

In the US the problems escalated after a chaotic November rollout of Taylor Swift Era tour presale tickets left thousands of fans without access to her shows. The controversy ignited bipartisan outrage among lawmakers who have called for Ticketmaster and Live Nation to be split and led to a lawsuit that accuses Live Nation of fraud and antitrust violations.

In the mess’s wake news broke of a justice department antitrust investigation that opened earlier this year and within weeks the company was back in the headlines after at least hundreds of Bad Bunny fans were locked out of a Mexico City concert.

Meanwhile Live Nation’s “dynamic pricing scheme” dramatically drives up ticket prices for popular events and its fees which critics say are excessive sometimes top the cost of a ticket. Live Nation has worked closely with secondary market brokers and set up its own secondary market where ticket prices are increased by an average of 50-150% depending on the type of event a government report found.

Consumer advocates a growing number of lawmakers and attorneys general say the problems stem from Live Nation’s stranglehold on live entertainment which has eliminated meaningful competition and they claim harmed artists and consumers. Since merging with Ticketmaster in 2010 Live Nation has controlled most of the US’s ticketing and is among the largest promoters venue owners and artist managers. When it doesn’t control one of those elements it uses its leverage to force companies to work with it critics say.

“The approval of the Ticketmaster-Live Nation merger led to a marketplace and concert space where there is a complete inability to go up against this company” said Krista Brown senior policy analyst at the American Economic Liberties Project which is helping lead a campaign to reverse the merger.

The justice department investigation started months before the Swift debacle and Live Nation’s 2021-2022 lobbying records show the company spending $960000. However the nation’s vague lobbying laws make it impossible for the public to know how much was spent specifically on lobbying the department.

Ticketmaster and Live Nation’s control of the regulatory environment whether overt or covert seems quite strong Krista Brown

Regardless the Department of Justice has drawn criticism for how it has handled Live Nation in recent years. As part of the terms of its 2010 merger with Ticketmaster Live Nation had to enter into a 10-year consent decree with the justice department. Among other provisions it prohibited the new company from retaliating against venues for working with other ticketing services or forcing them to accept its terms in exchange for access to Live Nation artists.

The justice department found in late 2019 that Live Nation had repeatedly violated those rules but industry observers say it took little meaningful action. Though the justice department extended the consent decree for five years the problems persist.

“Ticketmaster and Live Nation have come out on top every single time – even when the consent decree was reviewed and it was established by the DoJ that Live Nation violated it very little changed” Brown said. “Their control of the regulatory environment whether overt or covert seems quite strong.”

Live Nation’s lobbying records from the current election total $1.7m. The increase came after the introduction of the Boss Act though vague reporting requirements make it impossible for the public to know how much of that sum was spent specifically on the act.

The Boss Act was named after Bruce Springsteen’s nickname and drawn up following a 2009 controversy in which fans were prevented by Ticketmaster from buying tickets to Springsteen’s tour. If passed it would increase transparency around ticket sales and impose some new restrictions on secondary market sales.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced in October that it intended to develop new rules around “junk fees” and charges imposed on “captive” customers across the economy.

The rules aim to address “the black box nature of the fees” Brown said. That would probably have implications for the entertainment industry and Live Nation which imposes facility convenience and processing fees that consumers must pay because Ticketmaster is the only company selling tickets to an event.

Live Nation’s recent financial filings show the number of tickets sold increased from 117m to 135m or 15% from Q3 2019 to Q3 2022. The revenue it collected from fees during the same time period jumped by about 65% from $355m to $588m.

Meanwhile its revenue jumped by 87% during the same period fueled by increased ticket fees higher ticket prices more lucrative sponsorships and a push into the festival market.

After the company boasted of the spike during a 3 November earnings call with investors shareholders repeatedly asked about legislation and the justice department investigation. The chief financial officer Joe Berchtold and other executives downplayed any potential threat. Berchtold said the discussion centered around “transparency” and did not pose a risk to the company’s revenues or structure.

“The commentary was not about fee levels or any of the other issues that some people have brought up” he said. “That’s been looked at and we feel comfortable with what our business model is in that regard.”

Executives said in the earnings call that they were supportive of “all in” pricing that is part of the Boss Act and would require companies to show the full price of a ticket up front including fees.

Though no lobbying records are available for the period since the FTC made its announcement Live Nation’s Berchtold assured shareholders there was no need to worry: “We will work with the FTC” he said in the earnings call.

The company is also politically active at the state level and spent $90000 in Florida on legislation aimed at loosening regulations around secondary ticket market sales Open Secrets found while executives said they “worked with” the New York attorney general on the state’s implementation of “all in” pricing.

Still Brown from the American Economic Liberties Project said consumer advocates are optimistic now that the Biden administration and the justice department have in place a much more serious antitrust team than the Trump administration had which put up “weak guardrails”. The new antitrust team may be willing to take on the structural changes needed to protect consumers and artists despite Live Nation’s lobbying Brown added.

Acrisure Arena opening near Palm Springs caps busy year for Oak View Group

Acrisure Arena a linchpin for expanding live music in Greater Palm Springs and the home of the AHL’s new Coachella Valley Firebirds was poised for its debut as John Bolton the building’s general manager led a recent hardhat tour through the facility.

The $300 million arena was privately funded by OVG Live Nation and the NHL Seattle Kraken the Firebirds’ parent team. Comedians Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock were booked to christen the facility on Dec. 14 followed by the Doobie Brothers the next night.

Capacity runs about 11000 for a building expected to book major tours in a desert resort market that’s a two-hour drive southeast of Los Angeles. The arena features touches of indoor/outdoor aspects common among Southern California venues but with elements that speak to the desert climate.

“Everything’s in the lower bowl in terms of seating” Bolton said stepping inside the venue managed by OVG360. “You enter at ground level then go down to

the seats. The only thing upstairs are 770 club seats and 20 suites.”

Construction crews dug 25 feet below the surface to where the main ice sheet sits. The practice rink also sits below grade about 12.5 feet giving both ice sheets the advantage of cooler temperatures than at the surface in the desert where temperatures can reach 120 degrees.

“We didn’t want to obstruct any mountain views” Bolton said. “That was the purpose of digging down instead of going up.”

The building is no more than 60 feet above grade at its highest point as opposed to 100 feet at a typical arena. “The design complements the natural environment” Bolton said of the building’s low profile which creates less wind resistance.

There are elevators but no escalators to reach the premium level upstairs which is just 15 feet above the main concourse said lead designer Robert Norvell principal and senior architect at Populous. The premium level serves fewer than 2000 patrons Norvell said.

One distinction in the seating bowl: there is no center-hung videoboard which is a trend among new midsize arenas. OVG instead opted for a Daktronics flat screen installed in the west end and a ribbon board that rings the lower bowl.

“It makes it easier for the show rigging” Bolton said. “For us it was about being able to hang 400000 pounds from the roof and not have interference with a center-hung. For people when you look at a scoreboard you’re seeing about a third of it depending on where you are and you’re always looking up. Here you really get better quality than what you’d see in a traditional scoreboard three times the amount of viewing.”

There’s an outdoor artist and crew compound on the west side adjacent to the green rooms plus a catering kitchen and dining area that extends to lounge seating shade/shelter a firepit bocce ball and a 9-hole putt-putt course all with a view of the San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountain ranges.

“We think it sets us apart from other arenas nationwide” Bolton said of the compound with plans to open it in the first quarter of 2023. “We’re trying to take advantage of the beautiful landscape that’s all around us and for most of the year pretty nice weather though not in August.”

Five loading bays provide easy access for trucks in a marshaling area with additional space for tour buses.

The main entrance on the east side is designed to protect guests from the funneled desert winds Norvell said. A canopied outdoor concessions plaza within the ticketed space will be populated by five vendors serving from food “pods.”

“That’s unique for a hockey venue to have an exterior concourse to take advantage of the climate here” Norvell said.

“The amenities on this side are on the outside of the bowl versus on the inside” said Phillip Ransford Acrisure Arena’s vice president of operations. “It’s really kind of grab-and-go after they cook it.”

The Berger Foundation Iceplex the Firebirds’ practice facility is attached to the arena. It’s named for the local H.N. and Frances C. Berger Foundation. It will be open year-round for community skating leagues and lessons.

The Firebirds’ merchandise is flying off the shelves of a team store in a nearby shopping center that showcases a model of Acrisure Arena Bolton said.

The Palm Springs region has a large contingent of snowbirds and transplants from Canada and northern U.S. states where hockey is popular and Bolton expects that to weigh heavily in the Firebirds’ favor. The team’s home debut is Dec. 18.

Palm Springs International Airport 12 miles southeast of the arena has six daily non-stop flights to Seattle with sponsor Alaska Airlines and serves other key feeder markets such as Portland Oregon San Francisco and San Jose California with connections to scores of other locations.

“Seattle is one of our top fly-in markets” Bolton said. “A lot of people have second homes here and the Canadian influence here I can’t underestimate how big that is and they’re all huge hockey fans.”

Acrisure Arena has three electric Zambonis one for the practice rink with two dozen sustainability features Norvell said.

Electrical lines and other infrastructure lie beneath a surface parking lot that can accommodate 3000 vehicles with solar arrays that should generate enough electricity to power the arena on non-event days Ransford said.

The arena sits on a 400-acre parcel as part of a future mixed-use development of retail office a hotel and residential units Bolton said. The site is adjacent to the Classic Club home of the PGA Tour’s American Express Desert Classic golf tournament formerly the Bob Hope Desert Classic.

“Hopefully I’ll look out there one day and there will be a nice huge hotel” he said.

The arena is two miles from the San Andreas Fault which required additional engineering for earthquake resistance. It also requires an exit plan and signage plus training staff to handle a potential seismic event Norvell said.

Norvell said the arena was originally contemplated for downtown Palm Springs right off the main strip and it ended up 15 miles closer to the fault increasing potential seismic forces by 20% to 50% compared to the original site.

In addition the site is part of a 100-year flood plain which required a plan to divert water from the golf course he said.

“COVID hit things happened and we moved sites” Norvell said. “Luckily we found a good partner in the Berger association. They had this site ready to go. There was a 2006 environmental impact study done on this piece of land. They had done some rough grading so it wasn’t technically a green field. The environmental study went quicker.”

The 18-month timeline from groundbreaking to grand opening came during the pandemic which Bolton attributes to being 100% design ready.

“As COVID was shutting things down it was full speed ahead” he said.

CAA Icon is the owner’s representative on the project while AECOM Hunt is the general contractor.

Norvell said the client’s marching orders called for “a flagship music venue for the Coachella Valley” that would also be optimal for AHL hockey.

“Coachella Valley has such a historic music presence without having a venue that matched its history” he said. “One of the thoughts from OVG was that this could be the starting place for big acts to get their show figured out before doing West Coast tours and hitting bigger markets. It was a music-first outlook for the arena while also creating a state-of-the-art AHL facility.”

OVG Hospitality is handling the food and beverage operations at the arena which is cashless. A grab-and-go market will allow fans to quickly get back to the action. Arena bars are situated across the west end of the bowl. Milagro Tequila sponsors one bar Garrison Brothers Bourbon the other. Founding partner Buzzbox is the arena’s exclusive ready-to-drink beverage supplier. Both bars have views to the event floor.

One month before opening the 770 club seats and all but two of the 20 suites have been sold. Most club seats are situated in the East and West Lofts and have access to outdoor patios. The Chairman’s Club with room for about 250 is situated off the concourse. Two Founders Lounges are in addition to the 20 suites which each fit 20.

“It’s like owning a suite without owning one” Ransford said. “You can buy two individual seats for the lounge and it comes with the bar and the food. It’s like a club suite.”

Staffing has gone surprisingly well Ransford said.

“The numbers that we’re pulling for crews is astounding” he said.

“We did nine job fairs one in each city throughout the Valley” added Bolton. “We needed to hire over 1000 people. We had a huge response and all of our positions and most of our third-party vendors are fully staffed. There are a lot of retired people and this is a cool part-time opportunity especially for the ones who love hockey and music.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb21tZXJjaWFsYXBwZWFsLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LzIwMjMvMDEvMDMvY2hyaXMtcm9jay1kYXZlLWNoYXBwZWxsZS10b3VyLWRhdGVzLW1lbXBoaXMtZmVkZXhmb3J1bS10aWNrZXRzLW9uLXNhbGUvNjk3NzM3NzQwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle are coming to Memphis,"Comedians Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle will co-headline a concert Jan. 23 at FedExForum.

In 2022 however both men were in the headlines in association with various controversies.

On March 27 Rock was the victim of the slap heard 'round world when actor Will Smith walked onstage during the Academy Awards and smacked the comedian across the face in response to a joke Rock made about Smith's wife actress Jada Pinkett Smith.

The complaint lists a multitude of grievances centered around accusations of “fraudulent practices and various antitrust violations.” Ticketmaster has tussled with fans and artists alike in the past for high prices and fees manipulating the second-hand resale market and other slimy situations. In the wake of an antitrust movement in state and federal government agencies alike what are the implications of the lawsuit for other entertainment giants; in other words what is the End Game?

On Nov. 15 verified presale for the Eras Tour launched at 10 am local time and presale for Capital One cardholders occurred the following day. However on the day of the presale launch only a fraction of the whopping 3.5 million fans who signed up for Verified presale received a code. Furthermore fans were outraged by the site booting them out of line and crashing with tickets in the cart. Fans who purchased tickets for Lover Fest Swift’s attempted 2020 tour which was canceled due to the COVID pandemic received a ‘boost’ meant to help ensure their acquisition of tickets. However a multitude of fans who received boosts found themselves without tickets while others without boosts received them. One analysis even produced evidence that having a boost somehow “backfired” for fans reducing their chances of getting tickets.

Julie Barfuss the lawsuit’s lead plaintiff and Jennifer Kinder a plaintiff’s lawyer both became involved in the case after experiencing the frenzy firsthand. After trying and failing both presale days to get tickets Kinder sent out a Google Form for jaded Swifties to “submit details about their own experiences and gauge interest in a possible class action lawsuit” when she realized just how widespread the problem was. Barfuss also had a terrible experience with presale as the site’s crashing forced her to try — and fail — to check out so many times that “the website had identified her as a bot”; she was also charged for each unsuccessfully acquired ticket before Ticketmaster finally refunded her. The lawsuit began with 26 plaintiffs but since the suit was filed the number of plaintiffs has nearly doubled.

The charges leveled against Ticketmaster in the lawsuit include “fraud misrepresentation and antitrust violations over its botched Eras Tour ticket sale.” More specifically the plaintiffs’ lawyers argued that Ticketmaster has monopolized the concert industry forcing artists and their fans to pay inflated prices and also effectively wiped out competition in secondary resale markets. Because Ticketmaster has made exclusive deals with the largest venues in the nation stars like Swift who require massive stadiums for shows have no choice but to sell through Ticketmaster resulting in “virtually all major music concert ticket sales in California and the United States go through Ticketmaster’s Primary Ticket Platform.” The plaintiffs also alleged that for the fans who actually did receive their promised verified presale codes “Ticketmaster intentionally provided codes when it could not satisfy ticket demand” for verified presale (with 1.6 million codes given out allowing 6 tickets each each stadium would have been filled up on just the first day of sales). Due to the over-saturation of verified presale fans the Capital One presale was essentially a sham as Ticketmaster only allotted “less than ten percent of the venues’ seating capacity.”

On Nov. 18 (when the general sale was scheduled to occur) Ticketmaster issued an apology to “Taylor and all of her fans.” However there was a ‘but’ involved; the company also released an explanation for the fiasco. Ticketmaster claimed that based on historical concert sales they sent out a manageable amount of presale codes. Since the interest in tickets broke several records for the company including “the most tickets ever sold for an artist in a single day” on the 15th Ticketmaster insinuated that they were doomed from the start. The company also blamed an unprecedented amount of bots as well as traffic from non-verified fans for the site’s crashes; because they chose to slow down the rate of sales to stabilize the site “the tradeoff was longer wait times in queue for some fans.”

Then Miss Swift herself responded. In a lengthy Instagram post she called the experience of watching the debacle play out “excruciating” as she also described herself as being “extremely protective” of her fans. She did not shy away from calling out Ticketmaster (which she did not mention by name) explaining that the company assured her over and over again that they could handle the gravity of the task. While she expressed gratitude for the over 2 million tickets that were successfully sold she also fumed that “a lot of [fans] feel like they went through several bear attacks to get them.” Swift closed by apologizing to her loyal fans who couldn’t get their hands on tickets and promised to work on ways “to provide more opportunities for us to all get together and sing these songs.” On Monday the 12th she appeared to follow through on her promise as many fans who received a ‘boost’ but did not get tickets received an email stating: “Congratulations you have been selected to participate in a limited-time opportunity to request to purchase 2 tickets to Taylor Swift.” According to Ticketmaster these tickets will not be a free-for-all like the presale but a “purchase request” system.

The Eras Tour massacre is not Ticketmaster’s first rodeo in regards to outrage from artists and fans alike. In the early 1990s the popular rock band Pearl Jam attempted to arrange a free Labor Day concert so when Ticketmaster claimed it would require a $1 service fee for each ticket the band handed out tickets themselves. The event marked a lengthy feud between the band and the company culminating in Ticketmaster virtually organizing a boycott of the band’s tour via “veiled legal threats to promoters.” The issue reached Capitol Hill spurring a Justice Department probe. After Pearl Jam itself testified in the House of Representatives the House proposed the ‘Pearl Jam Bill’ which aimed to ensure ticket brokers “print service charges clearly on the ticket or receipt.” Unfortunately the bill never materialized and Ticketmaster continued to spar with stars (including Bruce Springsteen) over exorbitant fees and resale prices.

Capitol Hill has come out strong again in the Eras Tour case with various states’ attorneys general launching investigations into the accusations leveled against Ticketmaster. In addition a wide array of Democrats in Congress like the famous Alexandria Ocasio-Ortez or AOC called for the dissolution of the Ticketmaster monopoly. Amy Klobuchar a Democratic senator who ran for president in 2020 claimed that the Eras Tour fiasco brought light to the “vertically-integrated giant” of Ticketmaster that existed long before outraged Swifties became involved. The scandal comes at a time of growing antitrust sentiment and legislation; President Biden chose antitrust advocate and expert Lisa Khan to serve as the nation’s “top competition regulator” and lawmakers across the aisle came together in recent efforts to break up massive social media monopolies like Facebook and Google.

Along with showing just how powerful millions of angry Swifties are the Eras Tour debacle highlights the tension between massive entertainment companies and an increasingly antitrust federal government. However it’s important to note that at the end of the day the plaintiffs of the case only want to ensure fairness in future concert sales by creating an equal playing field. In the words of Jennifer Kinder “Until transparency and fairness is won in live entertainment ticket purchases the Great War continues.”"

The unit cost of F-35 fighters will creep up in a $30 billion three-lot deal announced Dec. 30 driven by a more sophisticated product inflation and lower U.S. sales volume while annual deliveries will slip.

Meanwhile some F-35s remain grounded and others undelivered following the crash of an F-35B on Dec. 15.

The deal which defines production for Lots 15 and 16 and sets options for Lot 17 calls for 398 F-35s to be built over the three years including foreign orders. The agreement calls for 145 aircraft in Lot 15 127 aircraft in Lot 16 and up to 126 in Lot 17 which will include the first airplanes delivered to Belgium Finland and Poland.

The open-ended Lot 17 allows for 23 more jets than the Pentagon originally planned. When the “handshake deal” on the three lots was announced in July 2022 Pentagon acquisition and sustainment chief William LaPlante said it was “based on” as many as 375 jets.

Either way however deliveries are declining—the Lot 12-14 deal inked in 2019 covered 478 aircraft. The Air Force has requested fewer F-35s in the last couple of years saying it prefers to wait for the all-up Block 4 model of the jet in order to avoid modifying older aircraft to the more capable configuration later. The other services have followed suit. Making up for some of the deferral of purchases though has been strong international sales of the F-35. Congress has also added back some of the jets the services did not request.

The agreed Lot 15-17 numbers average 132 airplanes per year; well below the 156 per year predicted by Lockheed Martin CEO Jim Taiclet in an investors’ call a year ago. Lockheed is anxious to avoid a boom-and-bust cycle of production as it plays havoc with workforce and economic materials purchases.

In a January 2022 investor call CFO John Mollard said “the last thing you want is a sawtooth pattern” of up-and-down production rates.

In a statement announcing the deal F-35 Joint Program Office director and program executive officer Lt. Gen. Michael Schmidt said the deal “strikes the right balance between what’s best for the U.S. taxpayers the military services allies and our foreign military sales customers.”

The unit cost of the fighters will average about $75 million a copy but that is without the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. With the engine the last three-lot deal achieved a unit cost below $80 million per jet. The JPO did not provide Air & Space Forces Magazine an all-up cost for the fighters in Lots 15-17.

For the airframe and mission equipment only the Lot 15-17 cost of F-35s ranges “from $70.2 million to $69.9 million for the F-35A $80.9 million to $78.3 million for the F-35B and $90 to $89.3 million for the F-35C” a Lockheed spokesperson said.

The A model is a conventional takeoff type while the B is short takeoff/vertical landing version and the C is configured for aircraft carrier operations. It has larger wing and tail surfaces and other structural differences to make it capable of withstanding carrier takeoffs and landings.

From Lot 14 to 17 “the F-35A aircraft vehicle cost on average only increased 6.5 percent; less than the rate of inflation” the Lockheed spokesperson added. The Lot 15 airplanes are already in early stages of manufacture.

The agreement represented the longest period of negotiation on an F-35 lot to date. The “handshake deal” was reached ten months after it was expected to be concluded—when it had already been under negotiation for more than a year—which former JPO officials said was due to extensive bargaining over inflation labor costs for Lockheed lingering supply chain effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainties attending the services’ planned buys. The final deal came after a further five months of haggling.

Lockheed has been warning for two years that Lot 15 and later lots would cost more due to the greater capability being built into the jet. Another factor has been the slower sales growth for the U.S. services which are the biggest customers for the fighter.

Lot 15 is the first that will include Tech Refresh 3 (TR-3) which is a suite of more powerful processors and other capabilities that make the Block 4 version of the F-35 possible. Other improvements in Lot 15 include a panoramic cockpit display and a more powerful memory.

As part of the Block 4 upgrade some 75 changes are in the works. These include new or additional weapons communications and networking upgrades electronic warfare improvements cockpit and navigation enhancements and “radar and [sensor] fusion updates” the Lockheed spokesperson said.

After 141 aircraft delivered in 2022 the worldwide F-35 fleet now numbers 894 airplanes. Lockheed officials have said they are contemplating a celebration at their Fort Worth Texas facility in late summer when the 1000th F-35 will roll off the assembly line.

Lockheed was due to deliver 148 F-35s in 2022 but the Dec. 15 crash of an F-35B caused the government to stop accepting deliveries of the fighter. The mishap aircraft suffered an engine problem in vertical landing mode; video of the accident became a viral sensation last month. The pilot survived a low-altitude ejection. The jet had not yet been transferred to the government at the time of the crash.

The halt meant that Lockheed fell seven aircraft short of its planned deliveries in 2022 even though the aircraft were finished. The accident stopped both final test flights and acceptance flights.

There are now nine aircraft waiting for final test and delivery.

An Air Force spokesperson said that a “small number” F-35As in USAF service are grounded until a technical compliance/technical directive is completed. While she did not provide details a TC/TD usually means that a part or system must undergo inspection and if a problem or faulty part is found be replaced.

A government source said the problem seems to be engine-related and so far only jets with “a few dozen” flying hours or less are being inspected for the problem.

“The scope and duration” of the effect on the USAF F-35A fleet “are to be determined based on additional ongoing analysis” the Air Force spokesperson said. She did not say how many F-35As are affected or whether they are in a single unit or dispersed across the combat air forces.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8wMy91cy1hcm15LXRlc3RzLWEtbmV3LWZsb3ctYmF0dGVyeS1mcm9tLWxvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi_SAV9odHRwczovL2NsZWFudGVjaG5pY2EuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvMDMvdXMtYXJteS10ZXN0cy1hLW5ldy1mbG93LWJhdHRlcnktZnJvbS1sb2NraGVlZC1tYXJ0aW4vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Army Tests A New Flow Battery From Lockheed Martin,"Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

Apparently the US Army did not get the memo about woke capitalism and ESG investing. It has a strategy to cut fossil fuels and one step towards that goal is a new flow battery from Lockheed Martin to be tested at Fort Carson in Colorado. If all goes according to plan the new battery will be installed at Department of Defense facilities throughout the US and overseas opening the door for more wind and solar.

Flow Batteries Are Growing Up & Taking Over

Flow battery technology is very different from conventional lithium-ion batteries. Flow batteries deploy the ability of two specialized liquids to generate electricity when they flow adjacent to each other. The setup mainly consists of tanks and pumps which can be easily scaled to fit various applications. Fire hazards are practically zero and the battery solutions can consist of nontoxic and abundant substances.

Typically — but not necessarily — the solutions are separated by a thin membrane when in motion.

Basic flow battery technology is not a new thing but previous iterations were impractical for widespread usage. That’s not for lack of trying. The US Department of Energy has been nursing the domestic flow battery industry along since the 1980s. A lack of adequate R&D funding in the earlier years stalled notable progress towards commercialization. The picture changed after former President Obama took office in 2009 with a climate action agenda. The falling cost of wind and solar power began to propel the demand for low cost long duration energy storage solutions.

Flow Batteries Hit Their Stride

Recent technology improvements have widened the span of applications for flow batteries. Back in 2013 for example the Energy Department funded a GE project aimed at engineering a flow battery small enough to power an electric car and at least one EV startup is now offering a flow battery car for sale. A research team at Case Western University is also developing a scaled-down flow battery for use in zero emission all-electric homes and the startup Influit Energy is working on an airborne flow battery for electric aircraft.

More flow battery activity is taking place in the stationary energy storage area. In addition to smoothing over gaps in the availability of wind and solar energy stationary flow batteries could be used in tandem with other clean technologies. In Scotland for example researchers are demonstrating a tidal energy and green hydrogen system integrated with a flow battery.

Here in the US stationary flow batteries fit the Department of Energy’s search for long duration energy storage technology that outlasts conventional lithium-ion battery packs and costs less too.

The Energy Department is focusing on energy storage systems that last at least 10 hours into days weeks months and whole seasons.

The Long Duration Energy Storage Difference



Lockheed Martin defines long duration as a discharge of more than six hours. As a long duration stakeholder the company points out that lithium-ion energy storage is generally confined to about four hours of duration after which cost-effectiveness breaks down.

The extra hours of duration provide for additional services as the grid absorbs more intermittent wind and solar energy.

“Growing market applications such as transmission and distribution deferral and renewables shifting require long- duration energy storage” Lockheed explains. “In general requirements for energy storage on the grid are becoming more challenging – requiring batteries with not only longer duration but higher flexibility.”

“Currently the dominant technology in the energy storage industry lithium-ion has proven to have significant durability flexibility and cost limitations for long-duration storage” they add.

The operational advantages of flow batteries also come into play. In contrast to lithium-ion batteries flow batteries can be idled for long periods without losing their charge and called into action quickly when needed.

US Army Did Not Get The Woke Capitalism Memo

The Republican party has been doing a lot of sword-rattling over “woke capitalism” aka the corporate ESG (environmental social governance) movement. Anti-ESG policymakers purport to have the best interests of shareholders at heart but in practice they are simply supporting fossil energy stakeholders at the expense of renewables.

The effort to stymie ESG investing puts the party of Support our Troops! out of step with the troops. The US Department of Defense has been on a renewable energy tear ever since it officially recognized climate change as a significant threat to national security during the Obama administration and they stepped things up after President Biden took office.

The Army introduced its first net zero plan back in 2010. Last February it followed up with its first Climate Strategy aimed at reducing fossil energy use.

“Producing a fleet of field purpose-built hybrid-drive tactical vehicles by 2035 and providing 100% carbon pollution-free electricity at Army installations by 2030 are among the goals outlined by the Army’s first Climate Strategy as the service adapts to the effects of changing weather” the Army explained.

“The Army’s innovation plans also include installing a microgrid or self-sufficient energy system on every installation by 2035 as well as self-power generation at each Army post” they added.

Long Duration Energy Storage For The Whole DOD

Fort Carson has been a net zero showcase for the Army since 2011 and the new Lockheed “Gridstar” flow battery fits neatly into the decarbonization picture. It will undergo a two-year test in a project that partners the Army and Lockheed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Colorado Springs Utilities.

“The large redox flow battery otherwise known as GridStar Flow by the Lockheed Designers is a one-megawatt battery that once operational is expected to provide long-duration clean energy storage and mission critical power” the Army explained. “It’s estimated the power delivered by the battery will be the equivalent of the electricity consumption of 400 Fort Carson homes for an average day.”

In addition to helping Fort Carson maintain operations during grid-wide power outages the Army anticipates that the new flow battery will help prevent grid outages by easing demand during peak periods.

The project broke ground last November. If all goes according to plan the operational lessons learned at Fort Carson will be applied to flow battery installations at all Department of Defense installations according to the Army.

Doing the math that’s about 500 installations including overseas facilities according to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment.

As for “woke capitalism” Lockheed is not shy about expressing the bottom line benefits of attending to the social leg of the ESG stool.

“By building an inclusive work environment we help ensure that Lockheed Martin is able to attract develop and retain a diverse workforce that has the opportunity to showcase and develop their skills and abilities” Lockheed explains.

“We believe that all employees should have a safe and inclusive work environment — one in which everyone is treated fairly with the highest standards of professionalism ethical conduct and full compliance with the law” they emphasize.

Lockheed and other leading US corporations may have some ‘splaining to do if the Republican-led US House of Representatives follows through on their promise to hold hearings on woke capitalism this year so stay tuned for more on that.

Flow battery technology features electrolyte storage for long-duration large-capacity clean energy storage.

The GridStar flow battery which can provide up to one megawatt for up to 10 hours should be operational in 2024.

The U.S. Army recently began testing something called a “flow battery” at Fort Carson Colorado. If successful the flow battery which is powered by two chemical components dissolved in liquids that are pumped through the battery system could someday help bring long-duration large-capacity energy storage to many U.S. military bases.

In partnership with Lockheed Martin the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center team at the Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) Operational Energy broke ground late last year on GridStar Flow a rechargeable redox flow battery featuring electrochemistry consisting of engineered electrolytes.

“Bottom line is the Lockheed Martin flow battery will provide a feasible means of long-duration grid scale energy storage to Fort Carson and their mission-critical assets that no other Army installation currently possesses” Tom Decker Army program manager said in a news release. “This is a significant tool and has potential to make an impact on future military bases.”

The flow battery at Fort Carson uses renewable energy to charge the battery via the stored electrolytes. When the flow battery system is completely charged or when the stored energy is required this electrolyte passes back through the flow battery providing up to one megawatt for up to 10 hours.

U.S. Army/Lockheed Martin Rendering of the flow battery at Fort Carson.

Lockheed’s technology uses a power module to convert electricity into chemical energy. The electrolytes pick up ions and flow through battery stacks. Then the electrons stored in the electrolyte increase the state of charge. The Gridstar can change from charging to discharging holding positive electrolytes and negative electrolytes in storage modules.

Paul Farnan deputy assistant secretary of the Army (Installations Energy and Environment) touted the flow battery’s potential to provide essential power during ill-timed grid outages:

“We need to be able to operate no matter what’s going on outside of the fence line. If the grid goes down for whatever reason not just for a couple of hours but for weeks or months we are still able to operate and maintain mission readiness.”

Lockheed says the system is designed to scale to hundreds of megawatts in repeatable blocks with no acute toxicity or fire hazard. The company also claims the flow battery system is designed to last for 20 years. If the Fort Carson flow battery proves to be successful it could mark a start for flow battery technology capable of long-duration storage with scalability to meet the needs of various Department of Defense installations around the country.

Construction on the flow battery at Fort Carson is scheduled for a late 2023 completion and commissioning in 2024. The Army’s Operational Energy team will test and evaluate the battery once installed and develop a report on its performance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwaS5jb20vVG9wX05ld3MvVVMvMjAyMy8wMS8wMy9kZXBhcnRtZW50LWRlZmVuc2UtbG9ja2hlZWQtbWFydGluLWYtMzUtY29udHJhY3QvMTM5MTY3Mjc4ODk4MC_SAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy51cGkuY29tL2FtcC9Ub3BfTmV3cy9VUy8yMDIzLzAxLzAzL2RlcGFydG1lbnQtZGVmZW5zZS1sb2NraGVlZC1tYXJ0aW4tZi0zNS1jb250cmFjdC8xMzkxNjcyNzg4OTgwLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. purchases $30B in F-35 jets from Lockheed Martin,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwaS5jb20vVG9wX05ld3MvVVMvMjAyMy8wMS8wMy9kZXBhcnRtZW50LWRlZmVuc2UtbG9ja2hlZWQtbWFydGluLWYtMzUtY29udHJhY3QvMTM5MTY3Mjc4ODk4MC_SAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy51cGkuY29tL2FtcC9Ub3BfTmV3cy9VUy8yMDIzLzAxLzAzL2RlcGFydG1lbnQtZGVmZW5zZS1sb2NraGVlZC1tYXJ0aW4tZi0zNS1jb250cmFjdC8xMzkxNjcyNzg4OTgwLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2BF78E0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Located at 3085 Point Grey Road in the city's Kitsilano neighbourhood the BC Assessment valued Wilson's estate at a staggering $74089000 -- $28507000 for the custom home itself and another $45582000 for the land on which it sits.

The home's value increased by $942000 over last year's assessment of $73147000 but remains below its 2018 peak of $78837000. The province's second most-valuable home 4707 Belmont Avenue was valued at $66964000.

Constructed by the business mogul in 2008 the two-storey abode boasts seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms across more than 15000 sq. ft of living space. The waterfront property also features an outdoor pool and a tennis court.

In the coming days Wilson and the owners of more than 1089000 properties across BC's Lower Mainland will receive their 2023 assessment notices which reflect market values as of July 1 2022.

""Despite the real estate market peaking last spring and showing signs of cooling down by summer homes were still selling notably higher around July 1 2022 compared to the previous year"" BC Assessment Assessor Bryan Murao said in a release.

""For both single-family homes and condos in Greater Vancouver most homeowners can expect about a 9% rise in values whereas the Fraser Valley will be a bit higher at about 10% for houses and 15% for condos and townhomes.""

According to recent data from the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver the benchmark price for single detached homes in Metro Vancouver fell to $1856800 in November 2022 a 1.9% decline from a month prior and a 1.7% drop year-over-year.

The clothing market is very competitive but good management and intelligent buying pays off.

Buy Clothing stocks YOUR CAPITAL IS AT RISK

Some of the branded stocks on our list may look fairly middle of the road in fashion terms but their stock price performance is anything but. If the stars align even dowdy retailers can see their stock price increase by more than 150% in less than a year.

This guide looks behind the curtain on six of the best clothing stocks to buy right now and offers inside tips on how to find the right broker to trade them.

Is It a Fashionable Time to Be Investing in Clothing and Apparel Stocks?

It can be said that fashion is always fashionable but the companies and creators of sellable goods that pique the public’s interest can come and go like the wind. When you think of clothing you think of basic necessities. Who doesn’t need clothing? This industry however can be very fickle. The latest trendsetter may rise and then fall as the next competitor comes along. On the whole the industry could very well be performing admirably but individual firms may not show success.

Some years back prognosticators such as McKinsey and other industry observers predicted that the overall industry would grow at roughly 5% a year from 2018 forward. And then COVID-19 struck. The severe shaking of consumer behaviour benefited some firms and was detrimental to others depending primarily upon what sector of the business the firm was in. Low-cost apparel did well. Sports apparel did not but analysts are confident that consumer demand will shift.

Manufacturing costs have also forced major changes upon the industry in the past few decades but the digital age is now upon us. Companies must use technology to compete effectively in today’s market by bringing their ideas to consumers more quickly. Labour issues and global concerns over environmental sustainability add to the pressures that this industry must endure and address.

Buy Clothing stocks YOUR CAPITAL IS AT RISK

Investing in the clothing industry can be risky. It is highly competitive and the pace of change is only increasing with each passing year. What are the major threats that could impact the clothing and apparel industry going forward? Here are just a few to consider:

Consumer Sentiment: Generation X is now giving way to the Millennials. Attitudes and fashion consciousness are shifting and retailers must adapt quickly when sustainability and social responsibility come into play.

Environmental Impact: Unfortunately there is a great deal of waste in the fashion industry as well as a heavy dependence on water for production and securing raw materials. Technology will play a large role going forward.

Labour Issues: Globalisation has enabled a dependence upon cheap labour and studies reflect that extreme climate variations may put pressure on existing labour pools.

Transportation Logistics: When oil resources are under pressure all of this industry suffers due in part to transportation woes and logistical timetables. Apparel and clothing stocks are not immune to these issues.

Government Regulation: Concerns over water use oil dependency and the environment could also drive government officials to be more aggressive in restrictive regulations.

How Healthy Is the Clothing and Apparel Industry?

How can we measure the health of the clothing and apparel industry? There may be private funds or thematic attempts to formulate a comparable index but for now most investors look to a sub-index of the S&P 500 index. Let’s take a look at the current charting for this sub-index:

Buy Clothing stocks YOUR CAPITAL IS AT RISK

A COVID-19-driven dip occurred in early 2020 but the industry has rebounded as a recovery in shopping by consumers took place in 2021. Apparel and clothing stocks however were not immune to the overall downturn in share prices that overwhelmed stock markets across the globe in 2022. The latter half of 2022 was a different story. Shopping picked up and those store chains that found themselves well positioned for a recovery were the first to benefit.

What about 2023? McKinsey’s best thoughts on the topic are that the industry will not deliver the same level of profit growth in 2020-2021 some 21% overall and that going forward growth rates might be sluggish except in the luxury sector. There will be challenges but there will always be companies that are ahead of the game and adapt to increasing complexity. The best clothing stocks detailed below could be the firms that will shine.

The Best Clothing Stocks to Buy Right Now

The clothing and apparel sector reflects the fashion tastes of individual consumers so the nature of these companies is also particularly diverse. As a result our top six clothing stocks offer exposure to firms that are very different from each other and operating in different parts of the world.

It’s not a question of high fashion or low fashion more a case of spotting the business with a good business model an eye for current trends and a share price positioned to head higher.

TJX Companies

TJX Companies based out of Massachusetts contains a range of household names that operate from North America to Europe and Australia. Brands include Marshalls TJ Maxx TK Maxx Sierra and Winners.

The investment opportunity relating to TJX relates to its approach to doing business. The firm scoops up excess or unwanted stock that strong-brand retailers no longer want. The COVID-19 pandemic therefore represented something of a golden opportunity for the firm.

With their stores boarded up due to lockdown retailers such as GAP cancelled or refused shipments from producers in Asia. TJX stepped in and bought up inventory at the bottom of the market. As CEO Ernie Herrman explains: “Historically disruptions in the marketplace have created off-price buying opportunities for us.” ( S&P Global )

After its recent third fiscal quarter the company announced a $0.295 dividend for shareholders of record on 1st December. Based on these results alone analysts at Barclays raised their price target from $76 to $94.

The number of hedge funds following this stock has also increased by 10%. Fund managers have noted that TJX benefited handsomely from the COVID-19 pandemic and was able to capture the change in consumers’ attitudes. Eager shoppers in both the US and Europe were quick to visit TJX for the bargains that it is known for.

The TJX stock price is currently $78.87 at the time of writing. It has more than doubled from its 2020 lows and shows no signs of slowing down having already recovered from its mid-year dip in 2022. If analysts are correct a $94 price looks doable.

Lululemon Athletica

Another clothing retailer that is a good prospect is athleisure wear specialist Lululemon Athletica. The firm was already building a clothing market share prior to the global lockdown but its range of comfortable but classy products was the perfect fit for home-based working. The firm uses a two-pronged attack in the Canadian market by selling directly to consumers as well as through its company-owned outlets.

The firm has pioneered the home-shopping revolution and provides a live chat service for clients looking to learn more about an online product. It has also adopted Klarna to make payment easier and has got a good track record of complying with ethical concerns such as modern slavery and gender pay gaps.

The firm’s stock has been on a tear since pre-pandemic nearly tripling in value. It has pulled back to catch its breath now sitting at $327 roughly support from late 2020. JP Morgan analysts however have a price target of $413 having recently reduced it from $464.

Farfetch

Farfetch headquartered in London may be a good play if the analysts are correct about luxury goods outperforming the general apparel and clothing market. The firm’s specialty is selling luxury goods online to the US Europe and other global marketplaces. Share prices hit a high of nearly $75 in early 2021 but have nosedived down to $4.45.

At these low prices hedge funds have piled in raising the number of funds owning FTCH from 39 to 50 firms. Societe Generale has also reiterated its ‘Buy’ recommendation and revised its target upward to $12. Analysts regard Farfetch as the premier luxury online marketplace far surpassing its competitors in reach and diversity of products offered. Do you hear ‘undervalued’?

NIKE

NIKE a perennial favourite among investors hit a stock price high of $175+ at the end of 2021 only to fall sharply in 2022 down to $112. NIKE is the obvious leader in its field of athletic footwear apparel and equipment but it is one firm that has suffered due to high shipping costs and the ongoing strength of the US dollar.

Chart courtesy of eToro

Share prices have recovered a bit of late but analysts regard NIKE as a good long-term investment and expect it to regain its form and deliver 10% revenue growth and accelerating profit margins. The global demand for active wear is a trend favouring NIKE and quality usually does rise to the top.

Ross Stores

Ross Stores is yet another off-price apparel and home fashion retailer. Headquartered in California the company has survived a round of store closures made during the pandemic only to see demand increase for its products. As a result its profits have gyrated the reason for the rollercoaster appearance of its share-pricing chart.

Chart courtesy of eToro

Results for Q3 2022 beat Street estimates and prices rose accordingly. Analysts at Barclays have restated their ‘Overweight’ rating and are targeting $127. Current share price is $116.

Tapestry Inc.

Tapestry represents another play in the luxury segment of accessories and lifestyle products. The firm focuses on markets in the US China Japan and other selected international markets.

Chart courtesy of eToro

Buy Clothing stocks YOUR CAPITAL IS AT RISK

The stock soared in late 2021 tripling in value in six months but it has tapered off slowly to $38 today. Analysts at Citibank are targeting $42 but it set a high of $50 in May 2021. Do you want to bet?

What to Know Before Investing in Clothing Stocks

It’s important to keep a few factors in mind when trading retail company stocks:

Firms do go bust – This highly competitive sector has claimed many high-profile victims and if this happens equity holders see their positions go to zero.

Reputational risk – The clothing industry has the second-largest carbon footprint in the world. Fast fashion risks losing its client base if ethical concerns outweigh the ‘must-have’ attraction of items.

Squeezed margins – Labour practices in the industry have come under intense scrutiny. Operators are now looking a long way down their supply chain to ensure that workers are paid a fair wage and unless these added costs are passed on to consumers profits will decrease.

High Street challenges — Even before the pandemic the High Street was on its knees. How this situation pans out will be crucial to the fortunes of clothing retailers and the price of their stock.

How to Start Trading Stocks Online

Stock trading has been transformed by online platforms and mobile trading apps. Accounts take minutes to set up and brokers offer free demo accounts to practice with and an extensive range of research and analysis tools to help you develop your trading skills.

The ‘democratisation’ of trading has also seen costs driven down as brokers compete for market share.

It’s particularly important for beginners to appreciate the need to use a well-regulated broker – one operating under licence from any of the below is a good place to start.

Tier-1 Regulators

Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)

Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)

US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC)

1. Research Clothing Stocks

Successful trading relies on basing decisions on a well-thought-out strategy. Brokers offer free in-depth analysis and news feeds on the different stocks and taking advantage of that offer is a good first step.

2. Find a Broker

Different brokers specialise in different markets. If you’re looking to trade a particular name it’s worth checking if your broker of choice covers that market prior to going through the registration process.

Broker choice will to a large extent come down to personal preference. Each broker has a different ‘feel’ and finding one to suit you is important. It might be the case that you’re looking to trade on the go in which case cross-referencing to these reviews will help you find out those ranked highly in terms of mobile trading.

3. Open and Fund an Account

Brokers are required to ask a few questions of onboarding clients. These are to comply with regulatory obligations and designed to protect the customer. While they involve a bit of form filling they are ultimately a sign that you’re making a good broker choice.

Funding accounts is very straightforward but costs and speed of processing may be factors you want to consider. Trading is hard enough without paying out on account admin charges so it is worth checking the T&Cs of your short-listed brokers.

The process of verifying your account and logging your Know Your Client (KYC) documentation should take only a matter of minutes. After that you’re ready to fund your account and start trading

4. Set Order Types

Practicing using a demo account is a good way to get to grips with the mechanics of trading. Demo accounts use virtual funds so fat-finger errors won’t cost you but will instead represent valuable lessons on how to trade.

The platforms will offer you a range of order types that can help you manage risk. Stop losses are trading instructions that are built into your account to kick you out of a position at a certain price. This is very useful in the event that a position goes wrong.

Take-profit instructions are automated instructions that work in the opposite direction.

5. Select and Buy Clothing Stocks

Buying the best clothing stocks is as simple as logging on entering the amount of shares you want to purchase and clicking ‘buy’.

eToro: 68% of retail CFD accounts lose money Trader Rating Take a look Tickmill: FCA Regulated Trader Rating Take a look IG: Over 16k stocks to trade Trader Rating Take a look

These trading platforms have invested heavily in developing functionality which is ideal for beginners. They’ve also addressed the issue of client safety and operate under licence from Tier-1 regulators. Successful trading involves choosing a safe broker that offers extra support such as educational resources and high-quality customer service. These brokers tick those boxes and even if you’re just curious it’s possible to visit their sites and try the service in a risk-free demo account.

Summary

Hunting out the best clothing stocks can be a profitable experience. There are risks involved with all trading but by choosing a safe broker you at least mitigate the risk of losing your money to a scammer.

Investing in clothing retailers also offers investors the chance to carry out ground-level research. Institutional investors send interns and analysts out to stores to ‘see if they’re busy’ and in the same way there’s nothing to stop individual investors going with their gut instinct on how they think a particular brand might fare.",,,,,,

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

As the global demand for water increases and seasonal droughts strain supply water scarcity becomes an ever-greater threat. This scarcity affects many industries especially the oil and gas industry. To combat water scarcity conservation of this essential resource must be at the forefront of the minds and efforts of leaders in the O&G industry. According to Dan Harbs senior technical consultant at Veolia Water Technologies and Solutions water is a resource that companies invest in and maintain every day to ensure the smooth operation of their business.

“Firstly you’ve put effort into bringing in that water whether you bought it from municipality pulled it from a well or clarified it from a river. That is a resource you have invested in that you don’t want to use inefficiently or waste” explained Harbs at the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers 2022 Summit held in San Antonio. “From a corporate sustainability standpoint it does look bad if you’re wasting your valuable resource of fresh water and obviously there are costs associated with it.”

Those costs can add up which can result in water scarcity issues later on.

With ESG and sustainability goals becoming more prominent in the refining and petrochemical industry conserving water is now more important than ever according to Karen Green water technologist at Marathon Petroleum.

“The issue of water availability is not a new issue for us at all” said Green. “However what is a new issue for us as a refining and petrochemical industry is the challenge of sustainability goals and being able to demonstrate progress and transparency to reduce our water footprint all whilst aligned with greenhouse gas and other sustainability type goals.”

× Expand Marathon highlights water conservation to meet sustainability goals

Another business goal to sustainable water usage can be related to reducing water costs. However it is important to ensure that volumetric water usage is accounted for when looking at sites with a cost reduction opportunity according to Green.

“It is important to align business unit goals with corporate goals. As an organization you have a corporate goal to reduce water usage whether it’s a volumetric goal or water intensity goals but as a business unit if you’re focusing just on those assets that are burdened with water cost you’re very likely to miss out on some of those big volume users” said Green. “When you’re looking at corporate wellness with a volumetric reduction don’t just necessarily focus on those sites with a cost reduction opportunity.”

When implementing water conservation goals the first step for a worksite should be recognizing the current water footprint eliminating wastage and taking measures to evaluate how water conservation can be implemented in a work environment.

“Make sure that you’re including water conservation or water optimization as part of any project maintenance turnaround and whatever might be part of the facility’s needs” said Green. “It’s not just one group that’s responsible it’s a top down effort that involves every different aspect of the organization. With that you should be successful in reaching your corporate goals.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3JldGFpbC1lbmVyZ3ktcHJvdmlkZXItbWFyYXRob24tZW5lcmd5LWFubm91bmNlcy1yZWJyYW5kLWNoYW5nZXMtY29tcGFueS1uYW1lLXRvLWVuZXJnby0zMDE3MTI4NDEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Retail Energy Provider Marathon Energy Announces Rebrand Changes Company Name to Energo!,"WOODSIDE N.Y.

2022 showed investors why it is important to consider energy stocks for their portfolios.

For the most part of the last decade investors chased new-age technology stocks and overlooked the energy sector which was in the middle of an expensive transition to renewables.

In 2022 energy stocks outperformed broader markets despite high inflation and rising interest rates as elevated oil and gas prices helped these companies post record revenues and profits. Here we name some of the best energy stocks to watch and the energy sector outlook.

What are energy stocks?

Energy stocks refer to companies associated with the exploration production and distribution of energy sources like crude oil natural gas coal and renewable fuels.

The energy sector is crucial to the global economy. Without energy cars will not run factories will not function devices will not turn on and the world would come to a standstill.

Today the energy sector is at a crossroads. Industry insiders are working on new solutions to lower the dependence on fossil fuels. Global warming and climate change concerns and the limited supply of fossil fuels are driving innovation in the sector.

Despite the leaps made over the years in the adoption of renewable power generation our world still remains heavily dependent on oil coal and natural gas. According to Enerdata non-renewable sources made up about 72% of global electricity production in 2021.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) classified the primary sources of energy as oil gas coal renewables and nuclear.

There were two energy companies in the CompaniesMarketCap’s list of the top 10 largest companies in the world by market capitalisation as of 3 January. Middle East energy juggernaut Saudi Aramco was the world’s second largest company valued at $1.887trn. US-based Exxon Mobil (XOM) came in ninth at a market valuation of $454.24bn.

Energy sector trends for 2023 and beyond

If you are looking for the best energy stocks to buy in 2023 you will need to be aware of ongoing trends and developments in the sector.

Global energy crisis

2022 was a year that saw energy prices surge to multi-year highs following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Crude oil prices rose to trade over the $100 per barrel mark as the West imposed economic sanctions on Russia one of the world’s top three crude producers.

Brent crude oil live price chart

The natural gas market saw supply disruptions with European countries affected the most due to their over-dependence on Russia for gas imports. The high fuel prices and tight supply resulted in a “shock to the system” that had “far-reaching implications for households businesses and entire economies” said the IEA.

While consumers were the clear losers from the crisis energy producers saw windfall profits in 2022. The agency added:

“High energy prices are causing a huge transfer of wealth from consumers to producers back to the levels seen in 2014 for oil but entirely unprecedented for natural gas.”

Unsurprisingly energy producers dominated the list of the most profitable companies in the world taking up five spots in the top 10 compiled by CompaniesMarketCap on 3 January 2023.

Saudi Aramco was the highest earner in the world above tech giants Apple (AAPL) Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL). Other energy companies on the list were New York-listed Equinor and Exxon Mobil (XOM) Anglo-Dutch energy major Shell (RDS) and Brazil’s Petrobras (PBR).

Renewables sources of energy gain momentum

Over the years governments have come together to push for a green energy transition. Over 196 nations adopted a legally binding international treaty on climate change called the Paris Agreement in 2015.

The treaty aimed to “reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century”.

Another significant deal for the energy sector was the European Green Deal signed in 2019 to lower greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.

There is pressure from governments activists and shareholders on energy firms to transform their business away from fossil fuels that are considered “dirty”. As pointed out by ING:

“The share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix has been stubbornly high at around 80% for decades. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) this share needs to come down to 22% by 2050 in a net-zero economy.”

Energy companies are investing billions to increase their share of renewable energy. The elevated energy prices and windfall profits seen in 2022 are expected to help fossil fuel companies in this expensive transition.

How to select energy stocks to buy?

When searching for the best energy stocks to watch in 2023 market participants can sort companies by the following criteria:

Market capitalisation

Market capitalisation or market cap in simple words is the market valuation of a company which can be calculated by the share price multiplied by the number of shares. It is the total dollar market value of the number of outstanding shares of a security.

Companies gain high market valuations based on their financial health future prospects and upbeat investor sentiment.

Revenue and earnings

The revenue and earnings of energy companies are heavily dependent on the state of energy prices during the reporting period.

As mentioned earlier energy producers saw record revenue and profits in 2022 following a surge in energy prices.

Market participants looking to invest in top energy stocks should note that energy prices are volatile. Energy prices are dependent on global demand-supply dynamics. Leading oil-producing regions like the US and OPEC+ nations exert significant influence on energy prices.

Debt

Energy companies spend enormous amounts of capital on exploration drilling and production from new sources. These exploration projects are carried out based on geographical studies that may or may not lead to full realisation of expected results.

Moreover the transition of the sector to green energy sources has forced energy companies to invest in renewable energy. These initiatives are expensive and may require the company to take on debt.

Market participants should monitor if a company’s debt is at sustainable levels. Financial metrics such as debt-to-assets and debt-to-equity ratios are useful.

Environmental social and governance (ESG)

ESG is an important standard that market participants should be aware of. ESG investing refers to investing only in those companies that meet a set of environmental social and governance standards.

For energy companies environmental standards may refer to their commitment to reducing greenhouse emissions and increasing their share of renewables. Socially it could also mean safeguarding the interest of the native population by drilling sites. Governance standards refer to a company’s management internal controls and shareholder rights.

List of top-performing energy stocks

In our top energy stocks list we referred to the S&P 500 Energy Index. It consists of energy companies included in the US benchmark S&P 500 (US500).

In 2022 all of the 23 components of the S&P 500 Energy posted yearly gains underscoring investor preference for energy stocks amid elevated crude oil and natural gas prices during the year.

Here are the top energy companies from the S&P 500 Energy index based on their market performance over the last five years as of 3 January 2023 compiled by Trading View.

Hess Corp (HES)- 195%; ConocoPhillips (COP) - 114%; Marathon Petroleum (MPC) - 76%; Marathon Oil (MRO) - 58%; Targa Resources (TRGP) - 50%; Devon Energy (DVN) - 47%; Chevron (CVX) - 42%; Valero Energy (VLO) - 37%; Exxon Mobil (XOM) - 31%; Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) - 31%.

Energy sector forecast for years ahead

Financial services company Fidelity expected conditions of tight energy supply and rising demand that helped the energy sector post a “strong year” in 2022 to continue in 2023.

Maurice Fitzmaurice sector portfolio manager at Fidelity said this was due to the long lead time to ramp up new supply and refining capacity:

“For 2023 barring a severe global recession I believe that outperformance could continue as many of the forces that propelled the stocks in 2022 could persist. Oil and gas demand should continue to grow in 2023 as economies continue to rebound from the pandemic. And supply is likely to remain constrained due to disruptions related to the Russian war in Ukraine and years of low investment in production.”

Elsewhere McKinsey & Co expected the global energy mix to shift towards power synfuels and hydrogen rapidly and to make up 32% of the global energy mix by 2035 and 50% by 2050.

The company said crude oil demand is projected to “decline rapidly” only after 2030. McKinsey said natural gas will play a “pivotal role throughout the transition by its wide range of applications” with its demand projected to peak by 2035.

When researching the best energy stocks it’s important to remember that analysts’ forecasts can be wrong. Remember that past performance does not guarantee future returns.

Always conduct your own due diligence before trading looking at the latest news technical and fundamental analysis and a wide range of commentary. This article should not be used as a one-stop shop in your research.

Remember there are no guarantees. Markets are volatile. Never trade more money than you can afford to lose.

The price of crude oil ran up to a multiyear high of $120 a barrel shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine and again in mid-June as demand peaked with the summer driving season. However oil prices have steadily fallen in recent months as concerns grow about the prospects of a global recession and the impact that anti-Covid-19 lockdowns in China will have on energy demand.

The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil the U.S. standard is trading below $80 a barrel after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies announced that they plan to cut oil output by as much as 2 million barrels a day and the European Union imposed a $60 per barrel price cap on imports of Russian oil. As of this writing WTI crude oil is trading at $77 a barrel down from more than $90 per barrel at the start of November. Brent crude oil the international benchmark is hovering near $83 per barrel.

Oil stocks which also declined over the summer are now trading sideways or trending lower along with oil prices. This presents a potential buying opportunity for investors who are looking to ride oil stocks higher as we head into the New Year.

Nonetheless geopolitical tensions continued easing of Chinese lockdowns and/or an economic rebound could boost oil prices next year. Here are seven of the best oil stocks to buy for 2023.

XOM ExxonMobil $107 DVN Devon Energy $58.85 CVX Chevron $172.92 BP BP PLC $33.80 MRO Marathon Oil $25.77 OXY Occidental Petroleum $61.50 SU Suncor Energy $30.10

The Best Oil Stocks to Buy for 2023: ExxonMobil (XOM)

XOM Stock Is on the Way Back but It Will Take Some Time

ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has benefitted from elevated energy prices throughout 2022. On Oct. 28 the integrated oil and natural gas company reported a record profit for last year’s third-quarter causing analysts and investors to cheer. The Texas-based company said it earned a record $18.7 billion in Q3 up 177% from the same period a year earlier. Its earnings per share of $4.45 blew past analysts’ average $3.79 forecast according to Refinitiv data.

The Q3 print was the latest in a string of record-breaking earnings for America’s largest oil company. The outperformance sent XOM stock up 67% in 2022 to $105 a share. If the company manages to keep its quarterly profits flowing the upward momentum of its stock should continue as well.

Another great attribute of XOM stock is that it is a Dividend Aristocrat. Specifically ExxonMobil has increased its dividend payout to shareholders for 39 consecutive years. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of 91 cents per share and its yield stands at 3.3%.

Devon Energy (DVN)

Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is a good pick right now because the company is not just a leading oil company but it is also a major producer of natural gas and natural gas liquids making it a diversified energy company.

The U.S. struck a deal with the European Union earlier this year aimed at reducing the bloc’s reliance on natural gas from Russia. The U.S. committed to provide Europe with at least 15 billion cubic meters more of liquified natural gas by the end of 2022. The goal of the deal is to wean European countries such as Germany and France off natural gas that comes from Russia. Previously about 40% of Europe’s energy supply came from Russia.

DVN stock is up 28% in the past 12 months but currently sits 25% below its 52-week high of $79.40. Buy the dip before the share price recovers.

The stock also pays a monster dividend that currently yields 8.8% which is good for a quarterly payout of $1.29 per share.

Chevron (CVX)

CVX stock

There are a couple of reasons for investors to consider buying the shares of California-based Chevron (NYSE:CVX). First the company recently reported a net profit for the third quarter of $11.2 billion its second-highest quarterly profit ever.

Second while CVX stock is up 45% over the last year at $173 the shares still do not look overvalued with a price-earnings ratio of only 9.85 and a market capitalization of $335 billion. Lastly the company pays a quarterly dividend of $1.42 a share for an attractive 3.2% yield.

Chevron’s Q3 net profit of $11.2 billion equaled $5.78 per share nearly double the $6.1 billion that it achieved in the same quarter of 2021 and ahead of the average EPS estimate of Wall Street analysts of $4.86.

The blockbuster earnings have led analysts across Wall Street to revise their forecasts and ratings on CVX stock throughout the year. Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) for example maintains an “outperform” rating on the stock and a price target of $202.

Chevron has also boosted its share buybacks this year lifting them to $15 billion.

Occidental Petroleum (OXY)

Houston-based Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has gotten a lot of attention over the last year as the new favorite stock of famed value investor Warren Buffett. A relentless deal hunter Buffett says he is always on the lookout for strong businesses and undervalued stocks and when he finds the right combination he buys shares with a purpose.

Buffett seems to like what he sees from OXY stock. The Oracle of Omaha has been buying shares of the U.S. oil company hand over fist since last spring. His total investment now stands at 188.4 million shares or 20.2% of the company worth $11.3 billion.

Buffett no doubt likes that OXY stock nearly doubled in 2022 making it one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500. He also certainly likes Occidental Petroleum’s low P/E ratio of 5.3.

While the quarterly dividend yields a skimpy 0.83% Buffett probably likes that Occidental reinvests its profits in its business in the same way that his holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A NYSE:BRK-B) does. (Buffett’s company does not pay a dividend to its shareholders).

Also like Berkshire Occidental Petroleum is using its profits to buy back its own stock as it has announced a $3 billion share repurchase program.

British Petroleum (BP)

British Petroleum (NYSE:BP) is another oil producer whose stock is looking very attractive right now. Its shares are up 25% in the last year and trading at $34. The stock has a dividend yield of 4% and an ultra-low forward P/E ratio of 5.4.

Based in London England BP is one of the energy “supermajors” with trailing annual revenue of more than $200 billion 60000 employees and a market capitalization of $102 billion.

BP hiked its quarterly dividend to 36 cents per share following its exceptional earnings. The company announced that its Q3 net profit this year more than doubled from a year earlier to $8.2 billion.

In addition to hiking its dividend BP has been buying back stock with a vengeance recently announcing that it is boosting its share buybacks by $2.5 billion to further reward shareholders.

Suncor Energy (SU)

Canadian company Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU) has attracted activist investor Elliott Management which took a stake in the oil producer in 2022 and promptly called for changes at the company. To appease Elliott Management which is run by hedge fund titan Paul Singer Suncor announced in July that it would expand its board of directors and undertake a strategic review of its retail business which includes 1500 gas stations across Canada with a view to selling the part of its business estimated to be worth about 11 billion CAD ($8.05 billion).

In July Suncor Energy fired then-CEO Mark Little who was replaced on an interim basis by the Executive Vice President for Downstream Operations Kris Smith. Mark Little’s departure came after Elliott Management raised concerns about safety and operational problems at Suncor noting that there have been 12 fatalities at the company’s oil sites since 2014.

In terms of its stock Suncor Energy’s share price is up 17% in the past 12 months and is currently trading at $30 per share. It has a thrifty P/E ratio of 7.5 and a solid dividend that yields 4.8% or 38 cents a share per quarter.

Marathon Oil (MRO)

A truly diversified energy company that deals in natural gas as well as oil products Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is a direct descendant of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company. Houston-based Marathon Oil is one of America’s preeminent energy companies.

Its share price has risen 50% to $25 in the last year as the price of crude oil has climbed. In addition to the share price appreciation other reasons to like MRO stock include its 1.42% dividend yield $3 billion stock buyback program and its low P/E ratio of 4.88. Plus Wall Street analysts on average forecast that the company’s earnings more than tripled in 2022.

Marathon Oil’s latest earnings certainly didn’t disappoint. The company announced Q3 net income of $832 million or $1.24 per share up 168% from $310 million or 39 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts’ average forecast called for earnings of $1.19 per share according to Refinitiv data.

NACS is a founding member of the MPC.

“Main Street businesses thank the Federal Trade Commission for its work to ensure that Mastercard stops blocking competition for e-commerce debit card payments” said Doug Kantor NACS general counsel and MPC executive committee member. “More than a decade after debit reform became law it is well past time for Mastercard and also Visa and major banks to drop all of their efforts to undermine debit card competition. We look forward to additional enforcement actions to ensure that happens.”

The FTC said an investigation found Mastercard’s tokenization of debit card data and refusal to de-tokenize that data for competitors has prevented e-commerce transactions from being routed over networks like Star NYCE or Shazam that can offer lower swipe fees for processing. The agency said that violates the Durbin Amendment a 2010 law that requires that at least two unaffiliated networks—Visa or Mastercard plus a competitor—be enabled on debit cards and that the merchant be allowed to choose which to use.

The FTC ordered that Mastercard make the primary account number and other data available to competing networks going forward even if has been tokenized. The agency specifically cited Mastercard’s treatment of data from transactions made with digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay as having violated the Durbin Amendment but the order applies to all e-commerce transactions including digital wallets and online purchases.

The FTC action follows regulations issued by the Federal Reserve in October clarifying that debit card routing choice applies to online transactions the same as in-store transactions and said Visa and Mastercard cannot take steps to block routing. Tokenization and other practices have kept all but about 6% of online debit transactions from being routed over competing networks according to the Fed.

The Durbin Amendment has saved merchants billions of dollars a year in swipe fees with 70% of the savings passed on to consumers according to studies. Debit card swipe fees cost merchants and their customers $32.6 billion in 2021 with payments processed over Visa and Mastercard’s networks accounting for $28.1 billion of the total.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbnRlY2huZXh1cy5jb20vc29maS10ZWFtcy11cC13aXRoLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtd2l0aC1wYXktaW4tNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SoFi teams up with Mastercard with 'Pay in 4',"SoFi is the first bank to begin ‘Pay in 4’ within the Mastercard Instalments program that began in mid-December.

The company said this partnership is only available for eligible members and will slowly roll out to select members.

How do permitted members know if they have early access?

If you are eligible for ‘Pay in 4’ you must maintain a direct deposit to a SoFi Checking & Saving account and pass a soft credit check which doesn’t affect your credit score. When logging in eligible members will see an offer to ‘Pay in 4’ within the bank section online or tab-in app and then go through the activation process.

Anthony Noto

This new choice will map out an additional way to pay when it comes to larger purchases and provides a way to stretch out the payments interest-free.

SoFi members who use ‘Pay in 4’ have the security and flexibility when making purchases across the country and option online and-in store at checkout. Members who may use this latest feature should know it comes with Mastercard Zero Liability protection to protect against fraudulent transactions.

How does ‘Pay in 4’ work?

‘Pay in 4’ will allow members to chop their purchase payment of $50-$500 into four payments without interest for only thirty days. The $50-$500 is for purchases on a one-time use digital Mastercard. It can be added to your digital wallet. The amount members are eligible for is based on their monthly deposits and credit.

Once you have been approved and have made a purchase your first payment is due and is pulled from your SoFi account then every two weeks your remaining amount is due.

For any reason if a member doesn’t make the payments SoFi can eventually withdraw funds from a member’s account if payments have not been made after reminders. To qualify for another ‘Pay in 4’ payment arrangement you must pay off the current one in full. This program is for those that are financially stable.

Where can I use my one-time use digital Mastercard?

‘Pay in 4’ can be used for purchases at any major and small retailer anywhere Mastercard is accepted. However it cannot be used on daily purchases and activities such as filling up the tank at gas stations buying groceries or eating at restaurants and bars.

SoFi’s goal is to help promote and want members to manage their money in a way that best suits them and to stay on track.

One way is members will be prompted to set up Autopay directly from their SoFi checking account. They want to encourage and practice healthy spending not carry on with a circle of debt and manage their money responsibly especially during the holidays and current inflation."

Sikkim started off with a win against Manipur followed by a 10-wicket loss to Meghalaya who have won all three games so far. Sikkim have 12 points from three ties.In their last game in Shillong Bihar lost the low-scoring match inside three days even after taking a 97-run lead in the first innings as their batters capitulated in the second innings to score only 99. Four batters scored ducks while two scored only one each in that innings as Bihar batting crashed like a house of cards.Even after that Bihar had 200 runs to defend on a wicket which was never batting friendly but except medium pacer Abhijeet Saket none could trouble the hosts as Meghalaya reached home with four wickets to spare in the last session of Day 3.So Bihar will have to up their performance in all departments of the game to put Sikkim under pressure and come out winners in the match.

Richest Asian Gautam Adani's group on Tuesday said it will pay an additional ₹48.65 a share to NDTV stockholders who tendered their shares in its open offer to help match what it had paid to buy out a stake of the news broadcaster's founders.

Adani Enterprises in a stock exchange filing said it will pay an additional ₹48.65 per NDTV share to investors who had sold their shares in an open offer between November 22 and December 5 taking the payout to ₹342.65 a share and matching what it paid to buy Prannoy Roy and Radhika Roy's stake.

Explained | What’s next on Adani’s proposal to acquire NDTV?

Adani Group first acquired Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited a little-known company that had given ₹403 crore of an interest-free loan to RRPR Holdings - a company founded by the Roys and bore their initials in its name - in 2009-10 in exchange for warrants that allowed it to buy a stake in the newsgroup at any time. Adani group exercised those rights in August last year which NDTV at that time said was done without its consent.

By virtue of that the Adani group took control of RRPR Holdings which held a 29.18% stake in NDTV. Thereafter it made an open offer to acquire an additional 26% from public shareholders.

That open offer was made at a price of ₹294 per share. And despite the open offer price being at a deep discount to the stock's trading price it found investors willing to sell over 53 lakh shares or 8.27% shareholding.

The twin transactions gave Adani group a stake higher than what founders Prannoy Roy and his wife Radhika held in the firm.

And last week Adani group bought 27.26% of the 32.26% stake that Roys had in the firm for ₹342.65 per share.

In all Roys got ₹602 crore.

Prannoy Roy held a 15.94% stake in NDTV of which he has sold all but a 2.5% shareholding. His wife Radhika Roy too sold all but 2.5% of the 16.32% stake she had in NDTV.

Adani group now holds 64.71% of New Delhi Television Ltd (NDTV) according to a regulatory filing.

Post that Roys resigned from the NDTV board. Prannoy Roy was the chairperson of the company.

Adani group which had named two directors on the NDTV board following its acquisition of Radhika Roy Prannoy Roy (RRPR) Holdings Pvt Ltd replaced them with two more of its nominees.

It has appointed retired IAS officer Sunil Kumar and former civil servant Aman Kumar Singh to the board of NDTV.

The two served under BJP's Raman Singh who was Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh from 2003 to 2018. While Sunil Kumar retired as chief secretary of Chhattisgarh in 2014 Aman Singh who was principal secretary to former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh resigned from service after BJP lost power in 2018.

While Sunil Kumar's exact role in the Adani group is not known Aman Singh heads the corporate communications department.

Adani group had previously named Sanjay Pugalia and Senthil Sinniah Chengalvarayan as its directors on the NDTV board.

Mr. Pugalia a former journalist is the chief executive officer and editor-in-chief of media initiatives at Adani Group. Mr. Chengalvarayan a journalist is an independent director at Quintillion Business Media Pvt another media firm in which Mr. Adani bought a stake last year.

NDTV will give Adani Group a footprint in the media space as part of its broader diversification spree that has led to the expansion of the conglomerate beyond coal mining and ports into airports data centres cement and digital services."
MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3N0ZWVsZXJzZGVwb3QuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvc21hbGwtc2Nob29sLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1leHBsYWlucy13aHktaGUtc3RheWVkLWxveWFsLXRvLXNkc3UtcmF0aGVyLXRoYW4tdHJhbnNmZXItdG8tYmlnZ2VyLXNjaG9vbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Small-School Mason McCormick Explains Why He Stayed Loyal To SDSU Rather Than Transfer To Bigger School,"Loyalty has as much to do with how you’re raised as it does with how you live according to Mason McCormick. At least that’s what the Pittsburgh Steelers’ fourth-round draft pick credits for his own sense of loyalty.

An FCS football player out of the Missouri Valley Football Conference’s South Dakota State Jackrabbits McCormick faced the same challenges as any small-school prospect. No matter how well you dominate your competition you’re always asked who did you beat? Such questions often cap their potential to the middle rounds of the draft.

A lot of times NFL-worthy prospects from small schools must answer those questions in Bowl games and practices. Arguably fewer small-school players make it this far because those who have that talent enter the transfer portal. They end up changing schools where they can raise their profile. McCormick never did despite the opportunity to do so and he explained why.

“Yes I had offers. The temptation was not there” he told reporters on Friday via the team’s website. “South Dakota State gave so much to me and developed me into who I am now. Who am I to leave South Dakota State? They poured so much into me. I feel like they should be able to reap the benefits of what they helped create. Sure some money would be cool or whatever but it’s just ultimately my loyalties lie with the people that are good to me.”

Reporters asked him questions in the same vein after the draft and he gave the same answer. “I feel like in today’s world loyalty is kind of an afterthought” he said at the time via 93.7 The Fan. “South Dakota State did so much for me it was a no-brainer for me to be loyal to them.”

McCormick first arrived at South Dakota State in 2018 redshirting his first season as a zero-star prospect from Sioux Falls. He managed two starts the following season before the COVID-19 pandemic wiped out his redshirt sophomore year. In all he spent six years there logging comfortably over 3000 career snaps on the offensive line.

We’ll see how loyalty influences McCormick’s relationship with the Pittsburgh Steelers moving forward. He has a chance to earn a starting job though not as a rookie. They drafted him after taking linemen in the first two rounds precisely for that reason. If he does crack the starting lineup will he show loyalty to the Steelers when he hits free agency?

That doesn’t mean taking a cheap contract because business is always a part of the equation. But for some more than others so are our core values. McCormick credits his family for the emphasis he puts on loyalty.

McCormick listened to struggles and challenges in the community firsthand from commonwealth veterans who attended.

He was welcomed to speak by Congressman Glenn “GT” Thompson and the chairman of the Clinton County Republican Party Kurt Smith who praised McCormick for what he’s been doing during his campaign.

Some of the topics McCormick touched on were the economy immigration the fentanyl crisis term limits the country’s spiritual decline and support of veterans across the country.

He answered questions from the crowd using his perspective as someone who served in the U.S. military and spoke about what he would do to better support veterans as Pennsylvania’s next U.S. Senator.

Those in attendance had the opportunity to sign McCormick’s bus which he hopes to fill with signatures from across the commonwealth.

Mr McCormick's decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Mr Swinney as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down.

Mr Yousaf said he was resigning last week after he decided to end the power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Green Party.

Reports of a contest began early on Sunday when Mr McCormick said he had secured the 100 nominations from 20 branches needed to run against Mr Swinney.

But in a statement shared with Sky News the party activist said he had had a ""lengthy and fruitful conversation"" with Mr Swinney adding he had ""met the threshold set by the party rules"".

""John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months"" he said.

""This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I'm sure that John's determination to deliver Independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

""I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney's nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.""

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

Who is John Swinney?

What direction will the SNP take?

Earlier on Sunday Mr Swinney warned potential challengers from entering the race saying it would delay the party from ""rebuilding"".

""My bid to become SNP leader has received very very comprehensive support within the SNP. I have sent out a message which is about unifying the SNP to strengthen our party and win Scottish independence"" he told Sky's Trevor Phillips.

""I think that is necessary as the SNP is not as cohesive today as the party needs to be and my campaign has attracted very wide support.

""So I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we've had under my leadership and bluntly I would just like to get on with that as quickly as I can do because every day that we spend in an internal contest which I think we all probably know the outcome of we delay the ability for the SNP to start its rebuilding and I want to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do."""

According to the New York Times Coca-Cola and McDonald’s have a longstanding relationship that has helped both companies grow into the global icons the two are today.

And with that relationship delivery and production of Coke to McDonald’s locations are different than other restaurants. Coke syrup is usually delivered in plastic bags to restaurants but it is delivered to McDonald’s establishments in stainless steel tanks “that ensure its freshness” the New York Times reported.

The syrup is then pre-chilled along with water before going into the soda fountain according to Reader’s Digest. This process helps keep the liquid chilled and boosts the carbonation.

Reader’s Digest said as soda warms up CO2 wants to escape faster and because the soda is kept cooler for longer it keeps the carbonation.

And all those elements help make the product better.

Closing a restaurant is a difficult decision in any city but we look forward to continuing to serve our customers at our other McDonald’s restaurants in the greater Denver area.”

Marking the end of an era the McDonald's located at the start of the 16th Street Mall at Cleveland Place has closed for good according to a sign posted to the business's entrance.""Dear valued guests. Thank you for your loyalty and business with our company. Unfortunately we will be permanently closing this location on December 31 2022 at 4 p.m. Sincerely McDonald's"" the sign states.In operation since the early 1980s the McDonald's at 200 16th Street Mall served as a place to grab a quick bite and at times a resource for people experiencing homelessness and the mentally ill. In fact certain McDonald's employees went above and beyond to assist those living on the streets However these same employees often had to deal with unruly and occasionally dangerous customers which sometimes led to the McDonald's employees suffering injuries According to the Denver property assessor McDonald's owns the location itself. The news of the closure was first reported by Denver 7 Just recently the 16th Street Mall which was designed by I.M. Pei and Partners and opened in October 1982 turned forty years old.The Mall is in the midst of a $149 million construction project that will completely overhaul the pedestrian corridor most notably by replacing the four-decades-old pavement which has become a slip danger in the rain. The project is set to wrap up at the end of 2024.While downtown boosters have said that the renovations were much needed the construction has had the unfortunate effect of throwing off the flow of the mall as certain sections have been fenced off while work is underway. But even with the construction happening right now the Downtown Denver Partnership is still pushing for a return to downtown having a bit more vibrancy an element the mall hasn't had since before the pandemic began.""It’s having people back in our restaurants it’s having our employees back it’s getting the energy back in downtown Denver. That safety that beautification all of the things we love about our city"" Kourtny Garrett president and CEO of the Downtown Denver Partnership said at a November 10 press conference at the Colorado Convention Center The press conference came as local and state governments officials announced various plans to improve safety and the experience downtown . According to those plans there will be increased police presence improved lighting and increased trash and graffiti removal downtown.The City of Denver has also earmarked grant money to dole out to businesses negatively affected by the construction along the 16th Street Mall The closure of the McDonald's along the 16th Street Mall comes on the heels of another business exiting from the popular pedestrian path: T.J. Maxx which has been located at 710 16th Street Mall since 1993 will shut down on January 14.""While we are always assessing and reviewing our real estate strategies the decision to close any store is one we make with thoughtful consideration"" says Andrew Mastrangelo a T.J. Maxx spokesperson. ""We are grateful for the loyalty of our Denver customers and invite them to visit our nearby stores to continue to find great values."""

The company said the product line issues have been corrected but the problem impacted about 6000 In.Pact Admiral drug-coated balloon (DCB) catheters. Now two recent studies have emerged to shine a more positive light on the device.

In one study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and presented at VIVA 2022 in November a pooled analysis of four studies compared three-year outcomes in patients with femoropopliteal disease treated with the In.Pact Admiral DCB versus a bare metal stent. The research was motivated by clinical frustrations from dealing with stented patients that had occluded stents and stent fractures Mehdi Shishehbor DO told MD+DI.

""We used to do angioplasty and then place a full metal jacket in the SFA [superficial femoral artery] and the popliteal arteries we're talking about 20- 30- 40 centimeters of a stent"" said Shishehbor president of University Hospitals Harrington Heart & Vascular Institute in Cleveland OH. ""These patients would come back in six months three months [or] nine months with total occlusion.""

Many of those patients ended up with critical limb ischemia putting them at risk for amputation.

""When we tried to open up these occluded stents we would have a lot of struggles technically [because we didn't] have good devices to deal with them"" he said. ""We didn't want to put another stent inside because it would be another layer of metal which will make it even more complicated in the future and we didn't have medicated balloons to deal with them.""

While the market now has drug-coated balloons like the Medtronic In.Pact Admiral and other devices to treat patients with blocked arteries Shishehbor said about 20% to 25% of patients in the United States are being treated with angioplasty alone despite multiple studies showing the superiority of drug-coated balloons over angioplasty with long-term follow up. Another 25% of patients are still being treated with bare metal stents (BMS) he said.

So Shishehbor reached out to Medtronic to ask if he could get access to the data from four multicenter prospective studies to do a pooled analysis comparing the In.Pact Admiral DCB to bare metal stents for patients with femoral popliteal occlusions and stenosis. Going into the analysis he expected to find the DCB would have a reasonable efficacy benefit at one year and that the efficacy of bare metal stents would catch up by the three-year follow up. So the results of the study surprised him.

A total of 771 patients (288 DCB 483 BMS) were included in the primary analysis. Based on inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates DCB demonstrated superior primary patency and freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR). Highlights include:

· Twelve-month primary patency: 90.4% DCB 80.9% BMS P=0.007

· Freedom from 36-month clinically driven TLR: 85.6% DCB 73.7% BMS P=0.001

· Cumulative incidence of 36-month major adverse events: 25.3% DCB 38.8% BMS

· No statistically significant differences observed in the cumulative incidence of IPTW-adjusted all-cause mortality (9.5% DCB 13.0% BMS P=0.23) major target limb amputation (0.0% DCB 0.8% BMS P=0.29) or thrombosis at the target lesion site (1.0% DCB 2.1% BMS P=0.41) through 36 months

""The truth of the matter is that if you have a patient that is at equipoise that can either receive a stent or a DCB if you offer them drug-coated balloon they will have ... a better patency at one year and they will have a higher freedom from clinically-driven TLR at three years"" Shishehbor said. ""That was a surprise honestly. I thought maybe it would be a wash at three years.""

Another analysis conducted in collaboration between Medtronic and the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) evaluated the In.Pact Admiral DCB in 300 patients with femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis across 43 sites. Participants included high-risk real-world patients Medtronic noted. Daniel Bertges MD a vascular surgeon at the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington VT presented the results at VIVA 2022.

Participants included real-world patients with ischemic rest pain (Rutherford 4) (20%) diabetes (56%) total occlusions (43%) and TASC C-D lesions (54%). Clinical outcomes by Kaplan-Meier estimates for this high-risk real-world cohort include:

· Freedom from TLR: 89.8% at 12 months and 72.0% at 24 months

· Freedom from major target limb amputation: 99.6% at 12 months and 98.8% at 24 months

· Freedom from all-cause mortality: 95.3% at 12 months and 89.3% at 24 months

""Our results show promising results in treating the challenging problem of femoral popliteal in-stent restenosis with the Medtronic In.Pact Admiral Balloon. Freedom from TLR was 90% at one-year and 72% at two years. These results demonstrate the ability of the SVS VQI to conduct post-market evaluation of peripheral devices in partnership with industry and federal regulators. We anticipate reporting the three-year results by late summer of 2023"" Bertges told MD+DI.

Bertges said the results should increase confidence that paclitaxel drug-coated balloon angioplasty is a safe and effective tool for recurrent stenosis. Given the accumulated evidence it can be considered a first line device for in-stent restenosis he said.

What about the increased mortality concern with paclitaxel devices?

Paclitaxel devices came into the spotlight in late December 2018 after a meta-analysis showed an increased risk of death for patients treated with these devices. After a two-day meeting of the Circulatory System Devices Panel FDA concluded that there is a signal associated with an increase in mortality through five years of paclitaxel-coated devices as compared to non-coated devices. The agency was not however able to attribute this increased risk to a specific cause and the committee was befuddled by data discrepancies.

""The question of increased mortality with paclitaxel treatment that emerged in the latter part of 2018 was undoubtedly the biggest surprise"" Bertges told MD+DI. ""The VQI worked to study the mortality signal in two separate registry-based analysis. The first was a prospective tracking of morality in the VQI using the Data Extraction and Longitudinal Trend Analysis for active surveillance and the second was a VQI-Medicare claims linked analysis through the Vascular Implant Surveillance and Interventional Outcomes (VISION) Coordinated Registry Network. Both studies did not find increased mortality in patients treated for femoral-popliteal disease with paclitaxel devices which refuted the meta-analysis.""

Medtronic's In.Pact 018 paclitaxel-coated balloon

In June 2022 FDA approved the In.Pact 018 DCB catheter which was developed in response to physician feedback regarding the need for an 0.018” guidewire compatible DCB.

Built on equivalent technology to the In.Pact Admiral DCB the In.Pact 018 is indicated for the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of de novo restenotic or in-stent restenotic lesions with lengths up to 360 mm with vessel diameters of 4-7 mm. It is engineered to cross tight lesions provide better deliverability and is compatible with 0.018"" guidewires Medtronic said.

At the time of approval the In.Pact 018 DCB had not been evaluated in a clinical study. However given the design similarities with the In.Pact Admiral DCB Medtronic said the data from that clinical program can be considered supportive for the In.Pact 018. The company noted that the In.Pact Admiral DCB has been evaluated in 21 clinical studies with more than 3500 patients.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5tZWR0cm9uaWMuY29tL0hvdy1lbWJyYWNpbmctZmFpbHVyZS1oZWxwZWQtdGhpcy1sZWFkZXItbW92ZS1mb3J3YXJkLW5ld3Nyb29t0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How embracing failure helped this leader move forward,"One of Sheri Dodd’s first jobs was at the World Health Organization (WHO) so she’s no stranger to health equity work. But she remembers when it all really clicked.

One of her cousins died in her 40s from complications from type 2 diabetes. Dodd remembers watching her struggle to get holistic care.

“She needed mental health support endocrinology and cardiovascular care. And she didn't get it” Sheri said. “I thought that if she just tried harder that she could help herself. I had it completely wrong.”

After spending some time in the Diabetes business Dodd started to understand the inequities that many people living with diabetes face.

Now the 12-year Medtronic veteran is bringing that perspective – and more – into her new role as President of Medtronic Canada.

Embracing a ‘failure résumé’

Dodd is a firm believer in the idea of a “failure résumé.” Ever since high school when she did a summer foreign exchange program being willing to fail and figuring things out has been a theme in her life including her time at Medtronic.

“Throughout my career I’ve learned about taking the big swings the bounce the recovery the resilience how to be proud of the scars and bruises – and how to apply those as you move forward” she said.

But the real power in looking back is how it helps her shape the future.

“I’m spending less time in the rearview mirror. There’s a reason that mirror is smaller” she said.

Creating believers in a vision is one way she’s applying that philosophy as she dives into her role. Medtronic already has high market share in Canada and a history of being a trusted partner to the healthcare system and Dodd knows there is still untapped growth potential.

After spending a month connecting with key customers she knows there is an appetite for support to help address some of the biggest healthcare challenges of our time including the surgical backlog health human resources crisis plaguing the country and advancing health equity.

Play big – then bigger

For Dodd thinking differently and being bold are a link between the Canadian business and the Medtronic Mission.

The problems that we are solving now in healthcare are different than the problems we were trying to solve 20 years ago she said.

“Patients are more like consumers. There is more awareness of access and equity in healthcare and the decision makers are not a narrow group. It’s a multi-stakeholder ecosystem” she said.

Dodd’s excitement for what’s next keeps her up at night.

“There is no better place to be than in healthcare right now” she said. “This is the time for transformation and Canada is the place.”

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.nytimes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2024/04/18/health/hpv-vaccine-africa-merck.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3E7EE60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA0LzI1L3N0b2Nrcy1tYWtpbmctdGhlLWJpZ2dlc3QtbW92ZXMtcHJlbWFya2V0LW1ldGEtcGxhdGZvcm1zLWhvbmV5d2VsbC1tZXJjay1zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtYW5kLW1vcmUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stocks making biggest moves premarket: Meta Merck Southwest and more,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA0LzI1L3N0b2Nrcy1tYWtpbmctdGhlLWJpZ2dlc3QtbW92ZXMtcHJlbWFya2V0LW1ldGEtcGxhdGZvcm1zLWhvbmV5d2VsbC1tZXJjay1zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtYW5kLW1vcmUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3E7C370>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The Irish Data Protection Commission said that Meta should be ordered to pay two fines — one a 210 million euro ($222.5 million) fine over violations of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR and the second a 180 million euro fine related to breaches of the same law by Instagram.

Combined the penalties amount to 390 million euros ($414 million).

The fines mark the conclusion of two lengthy investigations into Meta by the Irish regulator which had been criticized over delays in the process. The DPC began investigating the company on May 25 2018 the day the EU's GDPR came into effect.

GDPR places strict requirements on firms with regard to the processing of people's information. Firms that run afoul of the rules risk facing penalties as high as 4% of global annual revenues.

In the ruling Wednesday the DPC said that Meta must bring its data processing operations into compliance within three months. The watchdog is the lead regulatory authority for Meta and several other U.S. tech giants which hold their headquarters in Ireland.

Meta which changed its name from Facebook in 2021 said in a statement Wednesday that it planned to appeal the ruling. The decision does not amount to a ban on personalized advertising and businesses can continue using Meta's platforms to target users with ads it added.

""The suggestion that personalised ads can no longer be offered by Meta across Europe unless each user's agreement has first been sought is incorrect"" a Meta spokesperson told CNBC via email.

""There has been a lack of regulatory clarity on this issue and the debate among regulators and policymakers around which legal basis is most appropriate in a given situation has been ongoing for some time"" the spokesperson added.

""That's why we strongly disagree with the DPC's final decision and believe we fully comply with GDPR by relying on Contractual Necessity for behavioural ads given the nature of our services. As a result we will appeal the substance of the decision."""

The question going forward is whether a review of the Home Loan banks will result in any major changes to the 11 regional banks — whose offices stretch from San Francisco to New York — or if the status quo will remain preserved.

Most consumers know little if anything about the system. It was created in 1932 in the depths of the Great Depression when the Hoover administration was trying to stanch a wave of millions of home foreclosures. At the time hundreds of savings and loan companies went bust and the Home Loan banks were devised as a way to prop up the sagging housing market.

Now critics argue the system has strayed from its core mission. Former Federal Reserve Gov. Daniel Tarullo called the system ""irrelevant"" in housing finance — the very reason it exists. Though large banks and insurers are among the system's biggest users community banks have come to depend heavily on the Home Loan banks for liquidity and balance sheet management.

Whether the regulatory review will identify major shortcomings of the system and work to change them remains unclear. But critics — including some former Washington insiders — continue to push for oversight including for a deeper review and understanding of whether taxpayers are getting a return on their investment.

Against that backdrop here are four areas that bankers are paying attention to regarding the Home Loan banks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAxLzA0L2JlbmdhbHMtc3Rvcmllcy1yZXZlYWwtbmZsLWh1bWFuLXNpZGUtYXMtYmlsbHMtZGFtYXItaGFtbGluLXNob3dzLXNpZ25zLW9mLWltcHJvdmVtZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bengals coach Zac Taylor shares info on Damar Hamlin incident,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.nydailynews.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2023/01/04/bengals-stories-reveal-nfl-human-side-as-bills-damar-hamlin-shows-signs-of-improvement/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E57ADF30>, 'Connection to www.nydailynews.com timed out.

MGM Resorts International did not disclose the sale price for acreage across from Luxor known as the Village property but said the transaction did not involve a 2-acre parcel that was committed to house the official permanent memorial marking the shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival on Oct. 1 2017 which killed 60 people and wounded more than 400.

“We know the importance this location holds to so many and have always put tremendous thought into every consideration involving the site. This is no exception” MGM Resorts CEO Bill Hornbuckle wrote in a Dec. 30 letter to employees.

In 2020 the Three Affiliated Tribes of North Dakota – which includes Mandan Hidatsa and Arikara Nations – spent $12 million to buy a nearby 8.7-acre parcel out of bankruptcy. That site which is zoned for gaming and other uses was part of the $100 million SkyVue observation wheel and entertainment project that stalled in 2013 and eventually went bankrupt.

The Three Affiliated Tribes operates North Dakota’s third-largest casino the Four Bears Casino and Lodge at its reservation in Fort Berthold.

In his letter Hornbuckle said the tribes “have demonstrated that they care about our community its future and of course its past. I’d like to thank them for their commitment to the community and wish them the best moving forward.”

In the summer of 2020 with Las Vegas’ economy reeling from the pandemic a North Dakota tribal nation acquired a vacant lot off the south Strip.

The value has since soared its chairman says — and now it owns the spread next door for a hefty price.

MGM Resorts International announced last week that it sold most of the 15-acre former Route 91 Harvest festival site to the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.

MGM did not announce the sales price but Clark County records show the casino giant sold the property on Las Vegas Boulevard across from the Luxor for about $92.8 million. The sale amounts to more than $7 million per acre.

The tribal nation operators of the 4 Bears casino in North Dakota acquired 13 acres of a site that was the scene of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The other two acres have been set aside for a permanent memorial to the Oct. 1 2017 tragedy.

MGM spokesman Brian Ahern confirmed the sales price to the Review-Journal this week and said there were no “specific plans” for how the company will use the proceeds.

A new chapter

The sale marks a new chapter for a property that once had unspeakable violence.

MGM sought county approvals in 2013 to turn what had been a parking lot into a fairgrounds for concerts festivals and other outdoor events. The following year the inaugural Route 91 Harvest country music festival was held there.

Perched from the 32nd floor of nearby Mandalay Bay a heavily armed gunman broke through two windows and killed 58 people as well as two others who later died from their injuries at the Route 91 outdoor music festival across the street. Hundreds more were injured. The gunman killed himself before police breached his room.

In September 2019 almost two years after the shooting MGM announced the site would offer parking during games and concerts at Allegiant Stadium.

It said this was a near-term use as it planned to build a community and athletic center and support future efforts for a memorial to the massacre.

MGM which operates Mandalay Bay announced in October 2019 that it reached a settlement agreement over litigation stemming from the shooting. The settlement was expected to total between $735 million and $800 million.

In 2021 MGM said it was donating two acres of the site for the memorial. The community and athletic center never materialized.

‘Whole-heartedly supports’

The sale gives the buyers more than 20 acres total along the south edge of the Strip a sleepier stretch of Las Vegas’ famed casino corridor that has seen increased activity the past few years.

The Three Affiliated Tribes — also known as Mandan Hidatsa and Arikara Nation or MHA Nation — said in a news release that the purchase “represents a substantial opportunity for investment and return” and revenue generated would help fund tribal projects and programs.

It also said it “whole-heartedly supports” the memorial site for the Las Vegas massacre.

“Given our culture and who we are as a people we understand and are sympathetic to the suffering that occurred five years ago and it is our hope that whatever is determined to be developed on the site will be positive for the Las Vegas community and the millions of visitors who go to the area annually” MHA Nation Chairman Mark Fox said in the release.

In July 2020 the tribal nation purchased an 8.7-acre lot immediately east of the former Route 91 site for $12 million property records show. It acquired the land through a bankruptcy case. At the time Fox said he had been eyeing activity in Las Vegas for years. His group had no concrete plans for the site though he described the purchase as “an investment for us plain and simple.”

This week Fox told the Review-Journal the tribal nation bought the new property for the same reason and that its original plot is now valued at more than $30 million.

He said MHA Nation asked MGM to sell the site adding it’s easier to build a project on 20-plus acres. He expects to commit to a plan for the site within a year.

More deals

The south edge of the Strip has a decidedly mixed landscape with megaresorts on one side of Las Vegas Boulevard and small motels retail space boarded-up buildings and a never-finished Ferris wheel project on the other.

But real estate activity has gained momentum in this area. In 2021 Clark County commissioners approved buying 34.5 acres in the area for $115.3 million combined for the Department of Aviation.

Last year developers broke ground on Dream Las Vegas a 531-room casino resort and a 2.2-acre plot on the south Strip sold for about $12.8 million.

The Oakland Athletics have also reportedly eyed Tropicana Las Vegas immediately north of the former Route 91 site as a potential location for a new baseball stadium.

And MHA Nation might not be finished buying property either.

The long-shuttered former White Sands Motel juts into the former Route 91 site with the narrow 1.1-acre parcel surrounded on three sides by the recently-purchased property.

“We’re absolutely looking to acquire that too” Fox said.

LAS VEGAS (KVRR) — A North Dakota tribe has bought the land where a mass shooting took place in Las Vegas in 2017.

MGM Resorts International sold the 15-acre open lot across from Luxor on the strip to Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.

The sale price was not disclosed.

In 2020 Three Affiliated Tribes bought nearly 7 acres on the east side of the site for $12 million.

The tribe has not announced its plans for the land.

The sale does not include two acres MGM gave to the county for a Route 91 Harvest music festival memorial.

Chairman Mark Fox said the Three Affiliated Tribes bought 13 acres for approximately $90 million. Combined with 8.7 acres the tribe acquired nearby in 2021 for $12 million  the tribes now have almost 22 acres in a rapidly growing area of Las Vegas.

“So many things are going into that area prospectively” making it an appealing investment property Fox said on Tuesday Jan. 3.

The tribe now will take about a year to determine what to do with the real estate located in an area that is filling up with new resorts a new major league baseball stadium and underground transportation he said.

“My goal is to find opportunities to bring in revenues a return” he said. Proceeds from the tribe’s investment portfolio help to build infrastructure and programs including health care and housing for the tribe.

Possibilities include holding the land allowing it to appreciate in value or to develop the land with possibilities including a resort and casino Fox said.

“We have options now” he said. “We want to examine those options.”

The 13 acre purchase from MGM Resorts which closed on Friday Dec. 30 includes an area across from the Luxor called the Village where a gunman in a hotel shot down on concert goers at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in 2017 killing 60 and injuring more than 850.

MGM donated two acres of land on the parcel’s northeast corner last August for a permanent memorial. The tribe supports the memorial which won’t interfere with any development plans Fox said.

One option would be to build a resort and casino an undertaking that likely would require an investment of $1 billion or more to succeed he said. If MHA Nation takes that route it would seek business partners to spread the risk Fox said.

“We will strongly consider that option” he said. Nearby attractions include Mandalay Bay.

Fox didn’t want to decide what to do with the land until negotiations for the MGM land which occurred over the past year were completed.

“I didn’t want to put the cart before the horse” he said. “Now that we have the land we’ll consider our options.”

Three other tribes also have bought land in Las Vegas in recent years Fox said.

MHA Nation which owns the 4 Bears Casino & Lodge west of New Town has been involved in gaming for almost 30 years Fox said.

“Our gaming has been severely limited” with casino jobs down 68% and revenues down 65% he said.

MHA Nation also has bought 25 or 30 acres in Bismarck as an investment property and recently acquired about 2000 acres on the Fort Berthold Reservation’s southern boundary with plans to make a park and recreation area.

The area surrounds the location where the Little Missouri River enters Lake Sakakawea commonly called the Lost Bridge area. Plans include campsites a scenic overlook canoeing and kayaking and possibly cabins.

“We’re basically going to build what could be a national park” he said. “We’re doing our part to enhance the economy but it takes investment.”

Combined with other attractions at Fort Berthold including the casino a riverboat interpretive center and beaches “We want to become a destination resort” Fox said."

At the same time it has targeted the supply side of the chip industry introducing generous federal subsidies to attract manufacturing back to the US. Other governments in Europe and Asia that are home to major chip companies have introduced similar policies to maintain their own positions in the industry.

As these changes continue to take effect in 2023 they will throw a new element of uncertainty into an industry that has long relied on globally distributed supply chains and a fair amount of freedom in deciding who they do business with.

What will these new geopolitical machinations mean for the more than $500 billion semiconductor industry? MIT Technology Review asked experts how they think it will all play out in the coming year. Here’s what they said.

The great “reshoring” push

The US committed $52 billion to semiconductor manufacturing and research in 2022 with the CHIPS and Science Act. Of that $39 billion will be used to subsidize building factories domestically. Companies will be able to officially apply for that funding in February 2023 and the awards will be announced on a rolling basis.

Some of the funding could be used to help firms with US-based factories manufacture military chips; the US government has long been concerned about the national security risks of sourcing chips from abroad. “Probably more and more manufacturing would be reinstated within the US with the purpose to rebuild the defense supply chain” says Jason Hsu a former legislator in Taiwan who is currently researching the intersection of semiconductors and geopolitics as a senior fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School. Hsu says that defense applications are likely one of the main reasons the Taiwanese chip giant TSMC decided to invest $40 billion in manufacturing five- and three-nanometer chips currently the two most advanced generations in the US.

But “reshoring” commercial chip production is another matter. Most of the chips that go into consumer products and data centers among other commercial applications are produced in Asia.

In a TikTok video with over 110000 likes a woman unlocks her house with a microchip in the back of her hand. Chipgirlhere as she’s known on TikTok says she lives in a smart house equipped with radio-frequency identification sensors. Instead of using a key card to unlock drawers or doors she uses an implant under her skin. It looks pretty convenient.

A darker tale emerges from a company called Neuralink owned by Elon Musk. While Musk roiled the internet with wild changes of direction and bewildering new rules of engagement at Twitter Neuralink has been under investigation for allegations of animal abuse and suffering resulting from Musk’s orders to rush animal testing. The company is trying to invent implanted brain devices that will cure neurological impairments like enabling paralyzed people to walk again.

These may seem like something out of a sci-fi novel but the underlying technology for both is not far-fetched.

Implantable technology has evolved from life-sustaining things like pacemakers to what Dr. Katina Michael calls life-enhancing tech.

Michael is a professor at the School for the Future of Innovation in Society at Arizona State University. She is a leading scholar in emerging technologies and has interests in how technologies are used for national security and the social implications that may result. I sat down to talk with her about the risks that come with that life-enhancing tech being implanted in the human body. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Devices like Apple Watches or Fitbits aren’t new. Can you give us a brief history of the blurring of the line between human bodies and technology?

Humans used to fit inside the machine if you look back into the 1940s and the ENIAC the first general purpose computer. And then silicon came into the picture and changed everything. More and more we went from large-scale computers to mini computers to microcomputers to wearable computers. And now we are looking at biomedical devices for example that are embedded in the human body. So we’ve juxtaposed being inside the machine and the machine being inside us.

Subscribe to our Authoritarian Tech newsletter From biometrics to surveillance — when people in power abuse technology the rest of us suffer. Coda Newsletters Oligarchy Authoritarian Tech Disinfo Matters Leave this field empty if you’re human:

I think what has happened is computers used to store what we think; computers now know what we feel. There’s a complete difference here. I used to have to ask somebody via telephone “What’s your opinion on this? How does it make you feel?” But with embedded or wearable sensors you don’t have to ask that question anymore. We know when someone has sweaty palms if they’re stressed if their pulse rate is high or low.

The greatest invention that has allowed this to come closer and closer to the body of course is the smartphone. But now that’s not enough because it’s too cumbersome and it’s not as accurate as if it could be embedded. There were many patents in the 1990s for personal digital assistants before smartphones came onto the scene. They used to have embedded PDAs in the upper tricep or wearable PDAs on a head-mounted unit. But now we’re saying well why do we need this clunkiness? Why not brain-to-brain interfaces? Why not brain-to-computer interfaces?

Are there certain technologies that are emblematic of the trend of tech increasingly becoming part of the human body?

You can’t go past Elon Musk’s Neuralink. But to be honest this is really late in the game. He created Neuralink in 2017.

But going back 20 years there was a company on the New York Stock Exchange by the name of VeriChip. The parent company was Applied Digital Solutions. They had a patent for an implantable device in the right tricep that indicated they would be exploring a variety of applications such as being able to secure a physical space. Instead of using a radio-frequency identification card you would use the implantable. There was a veripay system. Instead of using a credit card that you had to lug around in a purse you could actually use a free arm to get a read on an implantable device.

I visited the Baja Beach Club in Barcelona Spain in 2009 that was using a system for frequent visitors. There were over a hundred patrons that were chipped in that club. There have been hundreds of use cases since then. There’s been SJ Railways in Sweden that created implantables for VIP customers on their trains. So instead of somebody coming past and scanning your ticket to see if you were a valid passenger they would simply scan your arm.

These are all companies that exist or have existed that have tinkered in the implantable space. So I’m not really looking for a Musk-like figure to come in and say “Oh look we’ve demonstrated the business case for implants.” People have been demonstrating that since around 1998. We just don’t know about it because it comes and goes as a fad. The thing is when will the market be ready for that next leap?

At what point does this become more widespread?

It could be in a number of different scenarios. I often talk about the three C’s — control care and convenience. There’s a fourth one called the cool factor.

We just have to look at the pandemic. The Western Australian police bought $3 million worth of anklet devices to put on people that weren’t adhering to quarantine if they had Covid-19.

It could be we’re just fed up with all the wires. I have a device for this and that. The big suppliers are probably waiting for that one-stop-shop security device. You don’t have to remember passwords or use biometrics or two-factor authentication. It’s just you. Of course there are risks with that kind of approach. The other line of thinking is well it’s time. Why are we still holding our keys in our hands? We could enter our vehicle and our home with a proximity chip. It can’t be that bad. Surely someone’s not going to chop off our arm to get access to a physical location. So there are all these reasons we’re being told the benefits far outweigh the risks.

What are those risks?

I am concerned about control. I’m worried about how care and convenience will be used as an argument: I’m doing this because I care about you and you need it because you have dementia or schizophrenia or you’re a harm to yourself or you’re incarcerated. So I’m doing this for your own good and I care about you.

In totality it points to what we define as “uberveillance.”

Uberveillance. What is that?

It’s embedded surveillance. It’s the ultimate form of surveillance. Big Brother on the inside looking out. Which is subject to misinformation information manipulation and misrepresentation.

The problem is the context is missing. You can have this near real-time omnipresence but never omniscience. You can’t play God. You can’t pretend to be a star in the heavens that can see everything that’s going on and know what you’re thinking. Uberveillance attempts to infer your context without asking you what you are doing.

Okay maybe 95% of the time I might get the story right because of inferences patterns of behavior habits. Human activity monitoring will show us each week that we participate in almost exactly the same things at almost exactly the same time. That other 5% we can’t infer and shouldn’t infer. Context is missing. We can’t take innocent people and convict them of crimes. We need to give people their space. We’re not robots.

Here’s an example. I was awarded an Australian Research Council grant to study location-based services and implantable devices. I gave my students three days of my personal data: GPS data showing my altitude the direction of travel time stamps every 30 seconds and the X and Y coordinates of my location. And I told them you tell me what I’ve been doing in these three days. I wanted to see how different their responses would be.

They found I was in Kiama in Australia one day and then in Derby in the U.K. the next day and then came back to Kiama. They asked me how did you travel to the U.K. and come back? Now obviously I had not. There were errors in the GPS data that happened naturally. For some reason the GPS locked me to Derby. I wasn’t there. Then they said oh my goodness you were speeding at 260 kilometers per hour. No I was not. My car was old. It does not go that fast. But nobody questioned the data. They were questioning me about my ability to be in ten places at once. They all got it wrong because we trust the data.

What does that tell you about the potential risk of relying heavily on implantable technology like this?

Most of the proponents of these technologies basically say deploy now worry about the risk later. I’m not of that opinion. You don’t want to go down a path or a point of no return.

We start to try to constrain people in a particular way. They can’t breathe. When you can’t breathe you just want out. And so my fear is that this kind of technology will be used to track in an inhuman way. It’s inhuman. We’re not machines. We shouldn’t be replicating models of machines.

And even if we do place digital technology in the human body the brain is not stupid. We will override based on our intuition and intelligence. Our brain is smarter than the machine. We know we’re being mechanized and digitized.

What’s the path forward with this technology?

Many of the people I’ve spoken to through research have said the ideal scenario is to keep that technology on the outside. So if you want to rip it off your head or you want to do away with it for 24 hours because you just don’t want to be connected to the grid you can. You have the autonomy.

In the end that’s what we’re talking about — human dignity human rights autonomy our ability to make decisions for ourselves. But if you embed devices this notion of switching off is not so easy. You can switch off but remotely someone’s still tracking it. That’s not switching off completely.

Once you embed that device the manipulation heightens. The ability to control others is much more heightened than we realize. You can have control convenience care and cool. But the dominant theme is control. It doesn’t matter what application. The underlying concept is control.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3RoZWN1cnJlbmN5Lm5ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTA1OTE3L2JpbGxpb25zLWluLWRpdmlkZW5kcy1taWxsaW9ucy1pbi10YXgtdGhlLWJlbmVmaXRzLW9mLW1pY3JvY2hpcHMtZG91YmxlLW1hbHQtc3RydWN0dXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billions in dividends millions in tax: The benefits of Microchip's double malt structure - The Currency,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3RoZWN1cnJlbmN5Lm5ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTA1OTE3L2JpbGxpb25zLWluLWRpdmlkZW5kcy1taWxsaW9ucy1pbi10YXgtdGhlLWJlbmVmaXRzLW9mLW1pY3JvY2hpcHMtZG91YmxlLW1hbHQtc3RydWN0dXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E4CABC40>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

This year winners range from solutions preventing device defects to processing-in-memory architecture analysis.

In the 2022 edition six candidates have won an award as detailed below.

Georgios Keramidis Aristotle University of Thessaloniki: Design space exploration methodology for tensor train decomposition.

The THESSIS group at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and the University of Plymouth (Professor Vasilios Kelefouras) developed a design space exploration (DSE) methodology for employing low-rank factorization (LSF) a well-known compression technique in the dense layers of a deep neural network (DNN). The DSE methodology drastically prunes the huge LSF design space. The technology has been transferred to Think Silicon a provider of ultra-low-power graphics processing units (GPUs) and machine learning accelerators.

Yun Zhou Ghent University: RWRoute: Open-source timing-driven routing for commercial FPGAs.

The Hardware and Embedded Systems (HES) research group at Ghent University has been investigating how to reduce routing runtime for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and thereby achieve a shorter FPGA design cycle which would improve designer productivity. Building on previous work together with Xilinx (now the AMD Adaptive & Embedded Computing Group) the group developed RWRoute an open-source timing-driven router for commercial FPGAs (FPT 2021). RWRoute has been integrated into the AMD RapidWright framework under the Apache 2.0 licence laying the groundwork for fast domain-specific FPGA implementation solutions.

Said Hamdioui Delft University of Technology: Device-aware testing: The road towards one defective part per billion.

The Device-Aware-Test (DAT) (patent pending) developed at TU Delft seeks to overcome the shortcomings of existing commercial solutions for outgoing product quality in for example memory devices. This solution incorporates the impact of the manufacturing physical defect into the technology parameters of the device and thereafter in its electrical parameters before integrating the model in a memory fault-analysis simulation platform. Using the insights generated optimal and appropriate test solutions are developed. Working with industrial partners including imec demonstrated the advantages of DAT which has won several best paper awards.

Valerio Schiavoni University of Neuchâtel: Full-stack trusted WebAssembly runtime using Intel SGX enclaves for secure crypto-currency credit scoring.

As part of the EU-funded project VEDLIoT the team at the University of Neuchatel (UniNE) contributed novel libraries and support to deploy WebAssembly applications inside trusted execution environments (such as Intel SGX or ARM TrustZone). Credora (formerly X-Margin Inc.) collaborated with UniNE to help develop and use these novel libraries in their distributed architecture and technology to power their provably private credit evaluations that promote transparent crypto credit markets. Several of the enhancements to the WebAssembly runtime and libraries have been merged into open-source repositories further transferring the results towards widespread public use.

The race to develop and administer COVID-19 vaccines had significantly slowed and discussions about what’s next for the Flagship-founded mRNA behemoth began to permeate to the top of investor calls. High up the list of questions: With the company flush with cash and biotech valuations low will Moderna turn to M&A?

Now we have an answer albeit a sample size. Moderna is buying Japanese DNA supplier OriCiro Genomics K.K. for $85 million the U.S. company’s first acquisition since launching in 2010. It’s not the major splash that some may have expected or even hoped for but in many ways it fits the tea leaves executives had teased all last year.

In an interview with Fierce Biotech this morning Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said OriCiro’s technology is a critical upgrade in the conveyor-beltlike path that is Moderna's clinical development.

“It's faster product to clinic faster product to market” he said. “And then the research part is: We can iterate much faster.”

Scooping up OriCiro is a tactical corporate upgrade versus a gargantuan upheaval adding on cell-free assembly and amplification of DNA rather than relying on E. coli. Whereas E. coli cloning can take several days OriCiro’s amplification process takes hours—which Bancel says could reduce large-scale manufacturing time by up to 30%.

Related Moderna manufacturing site in UK will be able to produce 250M vaccines annually

The move follows quarterly hints from Bancel about the company’s business development effort. In May the CEO said his team had “never been as busy” with respect to M&A considerations. Throughout the year Bancel said Moderna was focused on other targets that could expand the company’s budding nucleic capabilities rather than in his words “doing a large acquisition for the sake of large acquisition.”

And while OriCiro is Moderna’s first acquisition the almost 13-year-old company has been bullish in its licensing strategy. Moderna's joint collaboration with Merck combining the former’s cancer immunotherapy with Keytruda just passed a phase 2 test improving recurrence-free survival in melanoma patients compared to Keytruda alone. Merck had opted into the deal two months earlier handing Moderna $250 million.

The OriCiro buy doesn't eliminate the prospect of Moderna acquiring a therapeutics company but its focus on nucleic acid is unchanged. Bancel says that would include gene therapy and gene editing companies but not for example biotechs focused on small molecules.

“They might be helpful for the sales next year or stuff like that but we're not solving for that” he said. “We’re solving for [the] best RNA company because we believe that science is going to generate for this platform so many medicines.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tb2Rlcm5hLXNuYXBzLXVwLWphcGFucy1vcmljaXJvLWdlbm9taWNzLW1ybmEtbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1wdXNoLTIwMjMtMDEtMDQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moderna snaps up Japan's OriCiro Genomics in mRNA manufacturing push,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.reuters.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-snaps-up-japans-oriciro-genomics-mrna-manufacturing-push-2023-01-04/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2989180>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tb2Rlcm5hLXNuYXBzLXVwLWphcGFucy1vcmljaXJvLWdlbm9taWNzLW1ybmEtbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1wdXNoLTIwMjMtMDEtMDQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLW1lZGljYWwubmV0L25ld3MvMjAyMzAxMDMvU3R1ZHktY29tcGFyZXMtZWZmZWN0aXZlbmVzcy1vZi1QZml6ZXItdnMtTW9kZXJuYS1ib29zdGVyLUNPVklELXZhY2NpbmVzLWFmdGVyLXRoaXJkLWRvc2UuYXNweNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Study compares effectiveness of Pfizer vs. Moderna booster COVID vaccines after third dose,"In a recent scientific paper published in the journal Nature Microbiology researchers reproduced two target trials using electronic health records (EHRs) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to compare the effectiveness of the third dose of BNT162b2 or messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-1273 vaccine among United States (US) veterans.

Study: Comparative effectiveness of third doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in US veterans. Image Credit: Steve Heap / Shutterstock

Background

There is a lack of head-to-head comparative studies of the effectiveness of a third booster dose of different mRNA-technology-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. An ideal comparative effectiveness study of mRNA vaccines should cover racially diverse populations and evaluate possible differences in vaccine efficacy based on the time when an individual completed the primary vaccination series. Most importantly these studies should account for the time windows of the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants.

During the current SARS-CoV-2-induced pandemic vaccination effectively reduced the burden of severe disease and death from COVID-19. Especially booster doses of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines countered waning immunity and broadened protection against novel highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. In one of their previous work covering 439684 US veterans researchers found that both mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 lowered the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease outcomes during SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant prevalence.

About the study

In the present study researchers matched recipients of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines in a 1:1 ratio based on their risk factors to estimate their comparative effectiveness over 16 and nine weeks in the Delta-Omicron and Omicron period respectively for five COVID-19 outcomes:

reported SARS-CoV-2 infection

reported symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection

SARS-CoV-2 infection-related hospitalization

intensive care unit (ICU) admission and

death.

The veterans in the first emulated trial received the third dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines between 20 October 2021 and 8 February 2022. This period corresponded to SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants prevalence. For each veteran in the primary analysis the team started follow-up on the day of the third vaccination (baseline). It ended 16 weeks after baseline death or the end of study duration i.e. 15 February 2022 as applicable.

The veteran population of the second emulated trial received the third dose of any of the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines between 1 January and 1 March 2022 the period of only Omicron predominance. The median follow-up continued over nine weeks during which the team documented 214 SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Study findings

In the first emulated trial 147553 and 214728 veterans received the third dose of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 respectively. The baseline characteristics of 65196 BNT162b2 recipients matched to an equal number of mRNA-1273 recipients were comparable compared to the eligible population. The median age of this veteran population was 70 years 96% were males and 24% were Blacks.

During the 16-week follow-up spanning Delta and Omicron prevalence the researchers documented 2994 SARS-CoV-2 infections of which 200 were symptomatic COVID-19 cases 194 sought hospitalization 52 needed ICU admission and 22 culminated in death. During this time the estimated risk of reported infection for the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 third dose was 353.9 and 308.5 events per 10000 individuals respectively.

In the second emulated trial 25557 and 36809 eligible veterans received the third dose of BNT162b2 mRNA-1273 respectively. Like in the first trial the matched population comprised 7894 BNT162b2 and an equal number of mRNA-1273 recipients with comparable baseline demographic and clinical characteristics relative to the eligible population. They had a higher proportion of men and White people.

During nine weeks of follow-up amid Omicron predominance the estimated risk of documented SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher with a third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine vs. mRNA-1273. Accordingly the estimated risk ratio was 1.57 presented as events per 10000 individuals.

Conclusions

The present study remarkably showed the comparative effect of the third (booster) dose of two mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1272 among a nationwide cohort of US veterans. Both vaccines reduced the absolute risks of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections and severe COVID-19 outcomes. However mRNA-1273 recipients had a lower risk of COVID-19-related adverse events over 16 weeks of follow-up than the BNT162b2 vaccine recipients particularly for reported SARS-CoV-2 infections. The findings remained comparable across periods spanning Delta and Omicron predominance and only Omicron predominance. The authors advocated continuous evaluation of the comparative effectiveness and safety of additional (booster) doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL2Jpb3RlY2gvbW9kZXJuYS1jZW8tc2F5cy1tcG94LXZhY2NpbmUtZGF0YS1mYW50YXN0aWMtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtbm90LWhpZ2gtcHJpb3JpdHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moderna CEO: Mpox vaccine development is not a high priority,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/moderna-ceo-says-mpox-vaccine-data-fantastic-development-not-high-priority on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL2Jpb3RlY2gvbW9kZXJuYS1jZW8tc2F5cy1tcG94LXZhY2NpbmUtZGF0YS1mYW50YXN0aWMtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtbm90LWhpZ2gtcHJpb3JpdHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWx0aC5jb20vY29uZGl0aW9uL2luZmVjdGlvdXMtZGlzZWFzZXMvY29yb25hdmlydXMvaXMtamotY292aWQtYm9vc3Rlci1uZWVkZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What To Know About Boosters After J&J COVID-19 Vaccine,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.health.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/is-jj-covid-booster-needed (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2988220>, 'Connection to www.health.com timed out.

But when the winners were announced several insurers complained about the process and potential impact on patient care.

In a significant course change the California Department of Health Care Services announced that it has negotiated with five commercial health plans to provide Medi-Cal services in 2024 scratching a two-year-long bidding process for the coveted state contracts.

This upends the state’s previous plans of awarding contracts to only three health plans. It means more Medi-Cal enrollees will likely get to keep their current insurer and doctors averting a confusing re-enrollment process for most members and preventing disruption to patient care. It also means that the state will avoid a protracted legal battle amid lawsuit threats from insurers who had previously been left out.

The big winners: Blue Shield and Community Health Group will get a contract after initially having lost bids and Health Net will get to keep at least some of its Los Angeles enrollees.

​​“To bring certainty for members providers and plans the State used its authority to work directly with the plans to re-chart our partnership and move with confidence and speed toward the implementation of the changes we want to see” the department wrote in a statement released Friday afternoon. The department did not provide answers to follow-up questions before publication.

“At some level it makes the transition easier but we want to do better than the status quo” said Anthony Wright executive director of Health Access a consumer advocacy group. “Less disruption is good but we don’t want to lose the reason for the change which is to have more accountability on these plans going forward.”

Medi-Cal provides health coverage to more than 14 million low-income Californians more than a third of the state’s population. In 2021 the Department of Health Care Services which oversees the Medi-Cal program embarked on a bidding process that would allow it to rework contracts with commercial Medi-Cal health plans. The state’s goal was to reduce the number of participating health plans from the current nine and move forward with only the most qualified plans which would be held to higher standards related to patient outcomes wait times and satisfaction as well as improving health disparities.

In August of last year the state announced that it would tentatively award $14 billion worth of Medi-Cal contracts to three companies — Health Net Molina and Anthem Blue Cross. This proposed decision would force close to 2 million Medi-Cal enrollees to switch insurance and likely find new providers. Some health providers decried the department’s original contract decision claiming it would have caused “immeasurable” disruption to care.

“Less disruption is good but we don’t want to lose the reason for the change which is to have more accountability.” Anthony Wright executive director of Health Access

Kaiser Permanente negotiated a special contract with the state early last year bypassing the bidding process. And most nonprofit community-based health plans did not have to compete for a contract.



The state’s summer announcement quickly became controversial as health plans that were left out questioned the state’s process for choosing the three insurers appealed the decision and sued the state.

This change of course calls into question the power that insurance companies can have in pressuring state action with legal threats. Health advocates say they hope it does not set a precedent. Wright at Health Access said he’d like for the department to make clear that the state is not backing away from the competitive contract process in the future as he considers it is a key tool for accountability.

Blue Shield one of the insurance companies initially left out filed a complaint against the Department of Health Care Services requesting that the department release all documents used in the selection process.

The insurance giant even launched a campaign in the fall asking Californians to speak out against the state’s decision. The company argued that the state failed to sufficiently engage Medi-Cal enrollees and doctors in the process. “The message of this campaign is that it’s not too late for the state to change course and make choices that will advance innovation and health equity for everyone” Kristen Cerf president and CEO of Blue Shield’s Medi-Cal plan said in a statement in October.

Under the revised agreement Blue Shield will get to keep serving the San Diego area. Blue Shield declined a request for an interview instead referring reporters to a statement released Tuesday.

Meanwhile Health Net which in the summer was tentatively awarded contracts in nine counties but lost its previous and largest contract in Los Angeles also sued the state. Under the new agreement Health Net will get to stay in Los Angeles and will divide its share of Medi-Cal enrollees evenly with its commercial counterpart Molina Healthcare. Health Net will also keep its Sacramento membership but lose the San Diego market.

Centene the parent company of Health Net said in a Tuesday statement that it would end its legal actions against the state’s health services department.

The splitting of members evenly between Molina and Health Net through a subcontracting agreement is a “step in the right direction” said Jim Mangia president and CEO of St. John’s Community Health which serves low-income patients in south LA but much remains uncertain.

“Who’s the 50 percent that are going to be able to stay with Health Net and who are the 50 percent that are going to have to move?” Mangia said. “We don’t have answers to that so I think it’s problematic in that it still displaces a significant number of patients.”

Currently Health Net manages more than 1 million Medi-Cal patients in Los Angeles County. Nearly a quarter of St. John’s Community Health patients have Health Net with the publicly run L.A. Care Health Plan accounting for the rest. (Most Angelenos with Medi-Cal are enrolled in and will be able to continue with L.A. Care a publicly operated plan.)

Mangia said the latest decision will still disrupt services for the 12500 patients at St. John’s alone who will be forced to switch to Molina. He anticipates the clinic needing to hire more staff to help with patient navigation but there’s no money for that.

“It was obviously an attempt to rectify the initial decision but I’m not sure the impact on patients is going to be all that different. That’s my concern” Mangia said. “It’s essentially an unfunded mandate.”

“Who’s the 50 percent that are going to be able to stay with Health Net and who are the 50 percent that are going to have to move?” Jim Mangia president and CEO of St. John’s Community Health

Health Net and Molina Healthcare did not reply to requests for comment but in an early Tuesday morning call with investors Molina CEO Joseph Zubretsky characterized the state’s final decision as “taking three steps forward taking one step back” for the company which had originally hoped to triple its Medi-Cal membership under the tentative award announced in August.

In discussing the decision Zubretsky and CFO Mark Keim alluded to closed-door negotiations between Molina the state health care services department and the appealing insurers. When asked whether the state ever considered restarting the bidding process Zubretsky said California regulators had “broad discretionary authority” to award contracts and new bids could have taken a significant amount of time.

“With that as the understanding we thought it best for the company for membership and for investors to participate in the negotiation” Zubretsky said.

Molina has agreed not to protest the final contract award and will subcontract with Health Net in Los Angeles County in the “negotiated settlement” Zubretsky said. Molina will double its Medi-Cal membership — from 600000 to 1.2 million — by 2024 as a result of this latest contract.

“We’ve agreed to the membership allocations that the state has now articulated in addition to waiving other types of legal rights that one would normally have” Zubretsky told investors.

Community Health Group the largest Medi-Cal provider in San Diego County will also get a new contract in 2024. The insurer was excluded in the original summer announcement but appealed the state’s decision.

Community Health Group declined an interview request but over the summer the company’s chief operating officer Joseph Garcia told CalMatters that the state’s decision had been shocking because his company routinely outperformed other insurers.

Zara Marselian CEO of La Maestra Community Health Centers in San Diego said the state’s new decision was a welcome surprise. La Maestra’s clinics serve low-income patients throughout the county and have worked with Community Health Group for nearly three decades. About 26% of its patients rely on Community Health Group for Medi-Cal the most of any single patient group. Previously Marselian had also predicted having to hire more staff to help patients navigate the transition.

“It’s really better for the Medi-Cal recipients that will not now have to transfer to another health plan and have their whole continuity of care disrupted” Marselian said. “I’m really grateful however this happened. I’m really grateful on behalf of our patients.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIzMDEwNDAwNTI5Ni9lbi9Nb2xpbmEtSGVhbHRoY2FyZS1vZi1OZXctTWV4aWNvLUFwcG9pbnRzLURyLi1EYXJjaWUtUm9icmFuLU1hcnF1ZXolQzIlQTBDaGllZi1NZWRpY2FsLU9mZmljZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Molina Healthcare of New Mexico Appoints Dr. Darcie Robran-Marquez Chief Medical Officer,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.businesswire.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/home/20230104005296/en/Molina-Healthcare-of-New-Mexico-Appoints-Dr.-Darcie-Robran-Marquez%C2%A0Chief-Medical-Officer (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3627AF0>, 'Connection to www.businesswire.com timed out.

That is because the Jan 20 2023 $20.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What do the Analysts Think?

Clearly options traders are pricing in a big move for Molson Coors shares but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently Molson Coors is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Beverages - Alcohol industry that ranks in the Top 26% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.01 per share to $1.07 in that period.



Given the way analysts feel about Molson Coors right now this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

One of my first highlights was working on the Cadbury sponsorship of the 2016 Rio Olympic & Paralympic Games and working directly with ambassadors Anna Meares Sally Pearson & Dylan Alcott. This truly ignited my love for marketing & partnerships it was a surreal experience to see the work I was doing out in the market being enjoyed by consumers & it was clear that marketing would be the career I would like to pursue.

I’ve had the pleasure of working on many new products over the time some highlights would be Cadbury Dream with Oreo a range of Cadbury Dairy Milk blocks launches Cadbury Favourites Dark Edition & more recently Oreo Double Stuff Cinnamon Bun – both delicious products!

From an activation perspective the highlight has been creating the World’s Biggest Cadbury Favourites box – seeing this box standing 10 meters tall with the backdrop of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and literally dangling Ash London over the box to try to win $1m for a consumer was one of the proudest moments of my career to date. Not only was it an amazing day but delivered amazing results for the company & our customers.

I’m currently working as Senior Brand Manager on Oreo and have the pleasure of leading our partnership with Sydney Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras & Sydney WorldPride 2023 which has been exciting & fulfilling in an entirely different way.

What do you think people can expect from a career with Mondelēz?

New joiners can expect a range of great brands and opportunities and to meet great people along the way. There are incredibly talented people at Mondelēz and even better brands – it’s a privilege to be a custodian to this portfolio of brands.

There is also huge diversity in the roles – within the different brands I’ve worked on across chocolate and biscuits every brand has presented different opportunities to learn from local manufacturing of Cadbury Dairy Milk blocks in Claremont to Cadbury Favourites in Ringwood and learning the world of importing products on Oreo each opportunity has presented lots to learn.

What is unique about working a role in marketing at Mondelēz?

The privilege of working on some of not only the biggest brands in Australia but the world – I’m currently working on Oreo which is the world’s #1 biscuit! The love and passion that consumers have for our brands provides us with constant fuel and the challenges and strength in the marketplace of the brands create a positive working environment bringing out the best in our teams. It is unique to work at a company with leading brands across so many categories.

What does flexibility mean for you?

For me it’s the opportunity to work how & where I want to work. Even before the pandemic could work from home when needed & always felt trusted that would get work done. That might mean going out for a walk at lunchtime to clear my head flexible start or finish times to fit in a pilates class coming in to see the team for collaboration on a couple of days of the week & working from home the others!

How would you describe the working culture?

With the privilege of working on brands that consumers love comes a high expectation we work hard & deliver great results but there is always support from the team and there are great people at MDLZ which makes it a great place to work. There’s been a lot of focus on flexible working the last couple of years & great support throughout the pandemic and that flexibility has continued as we’ve settled into our new hybrid ways of working.

What advice do you have for someone considering an opportunity with Mondelēz?

I would definitely recommend going for it – it is a great place to grow a career with many opportunities to learn whilst working on some of the country’s most iconic brands.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YWxraW5ncmV0YWlsLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy1uZXdzL2dyb2NlcnkvY2FkYnVyeS1vZmZlcnMtc2hvcHBlcnMtdGhlLWNoYW5jZS10by13aW4tc3BlY3RhY3VsYXJseS1uaWNlLXByaXplcy0wMy0wMS0yMDIzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cadbury offers shoppers the chance to win 'Spectacularly Nice' prizes,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YWxraW5ncmV0YWlsLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy1uZXdzL2dyb2NlcnkvY2FkYnVyeS1vZmZlcnMtc2hvcHBlcnMtdGhlLWNoYW5jZS10by13aW4tc3BlY3RhY3VsYXJseS1uaWNlLXByaXplcy0wMy0wMS0yMDIzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E48B2D70>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Who can honestly say they had ‘crowds queueing outside Aldi at 5 a.m. for a viral energy drink’ on their bingo card? The must-have product in question is Prime a caffeine-free energy drink created by YouTube influencers Logan Paul and KSI. Since going on sale in the UK recently it has quickly generated the sort of frenzied hype once reserved for cryptocurrencies or pictures of cartoon monkeys with stock running out brawls breaking out and one shop reportedly cashing in by charging £10 a bottle.

On the face of it the Prime story is baffling. But tempting as it might be to scoff at the sight of the wide-eyed obsessives rushing for their fix I am also painfully aware that I cannot really judge them. For I myself am an energy drink addict.

Admittedly my personal poison isn’t Prime – or at least not yet. Instead I’ve spent much of the past three years dependent on Monster the American energy drink usually consumed by late-night video gamers and shaven-headed Polish labourers. These days it’s rare for me to start the working day without one. My brain just refuses to rev into action without a sip of that fizzy tang.

Is it a problem? Not necessarily. Yes Monster is packed with caffeine but not as much as the garish branding might lead you to believe. In fact the average can doesn’t contain much more caffeine than a Starbucks latte. And given I don’t drink coffee it’s not like I’m doubling up on my daily allowance.

Prime has generated the sort of frenzied hype once reserved for cryptocurrencies or pictures of cartoon monkeys with stock running out and brawls breaking out

Monster isn’t cheap at around £1.65 for a 500ml can. But even at Tesco Express prices a can a day is hardly going to break the bank. And as the vast majority of flavours are available in a sugar-free ‘Ultra’ variety I don’t have to worry about excess calories either. (Nor will those who’ve managed to get their hands on Prime – which has zero added sugar.)

Yet at the same time I’m grimly aware of a genuine dependence. Just last month I was working at the crack of dawn on a last-minute deadline when I clumsily knocked over my last can of Monster. After swearing loudly I caught myself trying to usher the spilt liquid from my desk and into a glass.

It wasn’t the first time that energy drinks have caused a twinge of shame. Call it vanity but I’ve always been embarrassed by the rather low-status image of Monster. To the uninitiated the supersize cans look just like a supermarket lager – making for self-conscious sipping on my morning walk.

To minimise the shame I used to buy my Monster from the self-service check-out so as not to be seen. But now the big supermarkets insist on doing an in-person age check due to the high caffeine content. To the hardened addict it’s yet another indignity: an unwelcome close-up at your moment of weakness.

Sometimes the best thing to do is just embrace it. Last year I was meeting a friend for lunch when I noticed an unopened can of Monster in my bag. We decided to ask the lovely folks at Hawksmoor steakhouse whether they could turn it into one of their trademark custom cocktails. To my delight they did just that – and even spared me the corkage charge.

Another guilty pleasure is sampling the various Monster knock-offs you can find in newsagents and discount retailers (thanks largely to an influx of cheap energy drinks from eastern Europe). My personal favourite is the utterly ludicrous Moose Juice which you can often pick up in Poundland.

And at least I can always remind myself that I’m not alone. Energy drinks have been seriously big business for years now. In the past decade Monster’s stock price has doubled six times (full disclosure: I own a small holding) making it one of the best performers on the New York Stock Exchange.

And long before Logan Paul got involved energy drinks have had their superfans. Just look at the Monster connoisseurs who parade their collections of rare and vintage cans on social media. Apparently some varieties of empty can fetch more than $100 online.

Until last month this subculture was largely underground. But the chaotic headline-grabbing scenes at Aldi have put a stop to that. Amid a cost-of-living crisis a £2 energy drink has become the ultimate consumer craze triggering Black Friday-like chaos across Britain.

As a secret enthusiast I can only smile at all. Am I relieved to know I’m not the only one going loco for a glorified can of fizzy pop? Perhaps. Or then again like all true addicts maybe I’m just glad to finally have someone that even I can look down on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0ZnRyZW5kcy5jb20vcG9ydGZvbGlvLXN0cmF0ZWdpZXMtY2hhbm5lbC9lcXVhbC13ZWlnaHQtcnNwLW91dHBlcmZvcm1zLXNwLTUwMC1ieS02NTAtYmFzaXMtcG9pbnRzLWluLTIwMjIv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXRmdHJlbmRzLmNvbS9wb3J0Zm9saW8tc3RyYXRlZ2llcy1jaGFubmVsL2VxdWFsLXdlaWdodC1yc3Atb3V0cGVyZm9ybXMtc3AtNTAwLWJ5LTY1MC1iYXNpcy1wb2ludHMtaW4tMjAyMi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Equal-Weight RSP Outperforms S&P 500 by 650 Basis Points in 2022,"Equal weight outperformed the cap-weighted S&P 500 by 650 basis points in 2022.

The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) tracks the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index which includes all constituents in the S&P 500 but gives them equal weights at each quarterly rebalance. The portfolio overlap as measured by the percentage of index weights held in common between the S&P 500 and equal weighting is 52% as of September 30 according to S&P Dow Jones Indexes.

The S&P 500 declined -18.1% in 2022 compared to RSP’s decline of -11.6% each on a total return basis. While equal weight consistently outperformed last year the gap between RSP and the S&P 500 widened substantially during the fourth quarter.

Equal weight’s methodology of selling relative winners and buying relative losers adds factor tilts to a portfolio. As of the end of the third quarter the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index tilts towards small size (47.8%) value (33.4%) and dividend (15.6%) compared to the S&P 500. It also has a tilt away from quality (-23.7%) low volatility (-6.0%) high beta (-4.5%) and momentum (-3.1%) according to S&P Dow Jones Indexes.

The Invesco ESG S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSPE) offers the same methodology as RSP but implements a screen for ESG criteria. RSPE declined -12.2% in 2022 maintaining a lead over the S&P 500 throughout last year.

Holdings in RSP that have been screened out of RSPE include FedEx Corp. (FDX) Duke Realty Corp. (DRE) Boeing Co. (BA) Incyte Corp. (INCY) Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST) Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings (LH) Zoetis Inc. (ZTS) Arthur J Gallagher & Co. (AJG) and FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS) among others.

RSP and RSPE each charge a 20 basis point expense ratio.

Oatly has struck a production deal with Canada-based Ya Ya Foods Corporation as the alternative-milk group looks to move to an “asset-light” model.

The agreement will see Ya Ya Foods take control of two of Oatly’s North America-based production facilities and acquire technical equipment.

Sweden-headquartered Oatly said it will retain full ownership and operation of its oat-base production lines in its facilities in Ogden Utah and in Fort Worth Texas. The oat base will then be transferred to Ya Ya Foods to be co-packed on-site.

Oatly said the deal is part of a “shift towards an asset-light supply chain strategy to expand its hybrid production network globally to better support its growth capacity needs and product and format innovations”.

It added that it “expects this hybrid partnership to result in future capital expenditures savings and have a net positive effect on its cash flow outlook”.

The deal comes as Oatly was forced to cut jobs to save costs following disappointing third-quarter results in 2022. It said at the time it expected annual savings of up to US$25m from the reorganisation announced in November which will take effect from this year.

Meanwhile the deal with Oatly marks Ya Ya Foods’ first foray into the US manufacturing market. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of this year.

Ya Ya Foods will take over the lease of Oatly’s factory in Ogden and acquire its mixing and filling equipment. The company will also be responsible for completing the construction of the facility in Fort Worth.

Oatly will also receive “an additional credit amount towards future use of shared assets” at its facility in Ogden and an additional credit towards ongoing construction at its Fort Worth site.

Toni Petersson Oatly’s CEO said: “We believe an increased focus on our oat base technology innovation branding and commercial execution will better position Oatly to drive profitable growth while reducing the capital intensity of our future facilities and ultimately convert more consumers to plant-based and create more products that are healthy for people and the planet.”

Ya Ya Foods CEO Yahya Abbas added: “We expect this transaction to enhance our growth and further strengthen our capabilities: the two properties we are acquiring will increase our geographic profile and scale allowing us to serve the vast majority of the United States and Canada.

“This highly strategic partnership with Oatly is a key step towards achieving our goal of becoming the leading aseptic beverage co-manufacturer in North America.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vc2hvcC1lYXQtc3VyZi5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS9pbmR1c3RyeS1sZWFkZXJzLW9uLWtlbi1ibG9ja3MtbGVnYWN5LWFuZC1pbmZsdWVuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Industry Leaders on Ken Block's Legacy and Influence,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vc2hvcC1lYXQtc3VyZi5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS9pbmR1c3RyeS1sZWFkZXJzLW9uLWtlbi1ibG9ja3MtbGVnYWN5LWFuZC1pbmZsdWVuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E34FE110>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Westfield South Shore in Bay Shore and Westfield Trumbull in Trumbull Connecticut were sold by Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield for $196 million Friday URW said in a statement Tuesday.

The buyer was a Great Neck-based partnership formed by Namdar Realty Group a commercial real estate investment firm; Mason Asset Management a real estate investment and advisory company; and CH Capital Group said Michael Czerepka a spokesman for the partnership.

Since URW also sold Sunrise Mall in Massapequa in 2020 it no longer owns any Long Island properties.

Built in 1963 Westfield South Shore is 1.2 million square feet in size.

The mall is 89% leased according to URW’s statement. It has 68 stores and 25 restaurants according to its website. Anchor tenants include Macy’s JCPenney and Dick’s Sporting Goods.

These days more mall operators are choosing to reduce their retail holdings due to the uncertainty in the retail market and/or the high costs of upgrading the properties for modern shopping trends said Thomas LaSalvia a senior economist at Moody's Analytics CRE a Manhattan-based real estate information provider.

But Westfield South Shore is performing well compared to many of its mall peers despite being an older midsize mall with traditional anchors characteristics that have hurt other malls he said.

Westfield South Shore’s vacancy rate has risen over the past few years but its rent growth has been strong at $40 per square foot in November compared to the average of $25 per square foot in the Islip/Smithtown submarket LaSalvia said.

“Competition is somewhat limited on this part of the Island and the neighborhood location is actually a bit of an asset. Our Commercial Location Score which is an index of a variety of locational economic indicators has this property in the 88th percentile of the submarket with strong marks for economic prosperity and safety” he said.

The new ownership group did not respond to a Newsday inquiry about its plans for the mall including whether a redevelopment would occur.

'Radical reduction'

Australia-based Westfield Corp. bought Westfield South Shore then known as South Shore Mall from Macy’s Acquiring Corp. in 1986. In 2005 Westfield bought Sunrise Mall in Massapequa from the Muss-Tankoos Corp.

In 2017 French property investor Unibail-Rodamco bought Westfield which then owned 35 shopping centers and malls in the United States and Britain forming Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield.

The largest mall operator in Europe URW announced in the spring that it would be reducing its debt by selling its U.S. malls.

""Following the completion of its comprehensive deleveraging program which includes the radical reduction of financial exposure to the U.S. in 2022 and 2023 URW will emerge"" focused on its European ""portfolio of high-quality high-performing assets located in the continent’s wealthiest cities and catchment areas” the company announced in March.

With some of URW’s U.S. malls performing reasonably well the company selling its U.S. assets even at the 30% discount compared to the 2021 valuation that the company estimated will allow URW to reduce debt and focus on its European assets said Brandon Svec national director of U.S. Retail Analytics for the CoStar Group a Washington D.C.-based real estate information provider.

URW has made $1.3 billion to date by selling some of its U.S. properties including Westfield South Shore Westfield Trumbull and Westfield Santa Anita and The Village shopping center in Los Angeles according to its statement.

The company has 21 retail properties left in the United States.

In December 2020 URW sold Sunrise Mall in Massapequa to Sunrise Mall Holdings LLC a joint venture led by Manhattan-based real estate investment trust Urban Edge Properties for $29.7 million a steep decline from the $143 million the property sold for in 2005.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGV0ZXJjb2hhbi8yMDIzLzAxLzAzL29wZW50ZXh0cy1taWNyby1mb2N1cy1idXktdG8tbmVhcmx5LWRvdWJsZS1yZXZlbnVlLXRvLTYtYmlsbGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OpenText's Micro Focus Buy To Nearly Double Revenue To $6 Billion,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.forbes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /sites/petercohan/2023/01/03/opentexts-micro-focus-buy-to-nearly-double-revenue-to-6-billion/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E430EF80>, 'Connection to www.forbes.com timed out.

Elizabeth Chand head of Morgan Stanley’s Family Office Resources Generalists came up with the idea for the program while attending an event put on by a traditional estate planning institute. She realized “There really is a gap here” according to Glenn Kurlander managing director at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.

“There really was a void and an opportunity for us to step into the void and fill it” he said during a recent interview. “And that’s what we did with the Family Legacy and Governance Institute.”

During the interview Kurlander and Chand discussed what the program has achieved so far and what is planned for this year and beyond.

THINKADVISOR: What is the FLAG Institute and what needs does it specifically address in the UHNW sector?

GLENN KURLANDER: There are many programs that focus on what we think of as traditional estate planning: programs that are focused on the advisor community on estate planning professionals and address the challenges that ultra-high-net-worth clients face from the perspective of traditional estate planning which is typically about tax-driven matters: managing estate tax gift tax generation-skipping transfer tax income tax and the like.

Obviously those are very important very significant challenges but there are very few if any programs that focus on the more qualitative challenges that ultra-high-net-worth families face and those challenges come under the umbrella of family governance: a term admittedly that is somewhat amorphous but is meant to encompass challenges that are more qualitative in nature that relate to the impact that financial capital has on the family.

And so we saw a need for helping wealth-planning professionals deal with those challenges develop greater understanding and expertise in that area so that they can help their clients not just with the tax-driven challenges the more traditional estate planning challenges that all of these other institutes address but instead focus on these more qualitative challenges as well. And that was the impetus behind the Family Legacy and Governance Institute.

How does the institute benefit financial professionals with UHNW clients?

By providing education in this space. We think it’s something that is desperately needed because there aren’t really other vehicles for getting this form of education.

We think it’s very much needed in the space and also we think that this is an area that has tremendous impact in the lives of ultra-high-net-worth clients as important as managing these quantitative challenges are as important as it is to our clients to manage estate tax and gift tax exposure.

Clearly those are important undertakings. Nevertheless when one thinks about the long-term success of families we think it’s undeniable that managing these qualitative challenges has the far greater impact.

When you think about the long-term success of families over two three four generations or more the things that have the greatest impact are not the extent to which they manage estate and gift tax. It’s the extent to which they manage the human capital challenges the challenges that affect whether wealth will destroy initiative and ambition. Whether the family will be destroyed over devastating family conflict. Those are the areas that we address in the Family Legacy and Governance Institute.

Those are the things that make the difference over two three four generations or more.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbnN0YW5sZXkuY29tL2lkZWFzL2NhcGV4LWN5Y2xlLXByb2R1Y3Rpdml0eS1ib29tLWludmVzdGluZy13ZWFsdGgtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1pbnNpZ2h0cy1hdWRpb2Nhc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CapEx Cycle Outlook: How to Invest | Wealth Management Insights,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbnN0YW5sZXkuY29tL2lkZWFzL2NhcGV4LWN5Y2xlLXByb2R1Y3Rpdml0eS1ib29tLWludmVzdGluZy13ZWFsdGgtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1pbnNpZ2h0cy1hdWRpb2Nhc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E5D40B50>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Three Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitrators including one industry and two public panelists awarded the broker Mark W. Birringer $926593 in compensatory damages for deferred compensation which he had earned in the two calendar years prior to his termination according to a December 15-finalized award.

However the panel noted it did not find that Birringer had been wrongfully terminated by Morgan Stanley. It denied his request to expunge from his record the related discharge language which had cited “management discretion to end employment relationship following a third-party’s social media posting involving the employee” according to its U5 termination notice for the broker.

A friend of Birringer in 2020 had posted a photo to Facebook of a boating party that included Birringer who was shown holding a noose-like rope knot according to a previous AdvisorHub report. The caption of the later-deleted post first reported by the Herald Times Reporter in Manitowoc Wisconsin read: “It really is a garage door pull.”

The reference was an apparent allusion to a rope found in NASCAR racing champion Bubba Wallace’s team garage a few days earlier that was mistakenly thought to be a noose. Wallace is one of the few Blacks on the NASCAR circuit and the incident had prompted an FBI hate crime investigation.

Morgan Stanley’s U5 filing said that Birringer had explained to the firm that the Facebook posting “was not approved by him.”

Birringer prior to his termination from Morgan Stanley ranked 24th on Forbes’ list of best-in-state wealth advisors and had managed $1.7 billion in client assets with the firm as of January 2020 according to the publication. He joined Raymond James’ Alex. Brown unit in September 2020 after he was dismissed in July of that year by Morgan Stanley.

A Raymond James spokesperson upon the firm’s hire of Birringer noted that the broker had “immediately disavowed” the posting upon learning about it.

In his January 2021-filed statement of claim with Finra Birringer had sought among other remedies in excess of $100 million in damages–for “the revenues that [Morgan Stanley] has received and will continue to receive as a result of [Birringer’s] efforts and labor”–plus statutory interest. He had also sought damages of unspecified amounts based on his claims that Morgan Stanley by filing the U5 remarks libeled and defamed him with “employees internally” and “in the marketplace.”

Birringer’s lawyer John D. Singer of Singer Deutsch LLP downplayed the panel’s denial of the punitive damages as the broker had filed his complaint before all his clients’ accounts transferred to his new firm and underscored that Birringer was awarded 100% of the deferred compensation damages he had sought.

Singer said that Morgan Stanley “had irrefutably failed to conclude that Mr. Birringer had engaged in any wrongdoing whatsoever much less any type of racist act.” Singer also welcomed the Finra panel’s ruling because he said the arbitrators had “determined in applying equitable principles that Morgan Stanley’s craven and utilitarian decision to confiscate Mr. Birringer’s deferred compensation concomitant with his separation without cause from the company was patently unfair unwarranted and motivated solely by optics.”

Singer declined to comment on Birringer’s current book of business and the broker via Singer declined to comment separately.

A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley which in an April 2021-filed response in the arbitration had denied the allegations declined to comment.

Birringer was assessed $15750 of the $16500 in total hearing session fees according to the Finra award.

Between May 25 and 30 2022 a total of 522 healthy adults aged 18 years and older who had received primary vaccinations of the inactivated vaccine BBIBP-CorV at least 6 months prior were screened and enrolled. After enrollment six individuals withdrew from the study and 516 participants received the booster dose of vaccination (Fig. 1). Among these 516 participants 21 were administered with two doses of BBIBP-CorV and 495 with three doses prior to the study. The participants were randomly assigned to receive a booster dose of NVSI-06-09 (N = 260) or a booster vaccination of BBIBP-CorV (N = 256). All the 516 participants were contained in the full analysis set (FAS) for baseline characterization as well as in the safety set (SS) for the assessment of vaccine safety. A total of 504 participants (N = 255 with NVSI-06-09 and N = 249 with BBIBP-CorV) who had valid immunogenicity results without protocol deviation were included in the per-protocol set (PPS) for the assessment of vaccine immunogenicity (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 Screening randomization and analysis populations. 522 healthy adults were screened and enrolled of which 6 persons withdrew before vaccination and 516 participated in the study. The participants were randomly assigned to receive a booster injection of either NVSI-06-09 (260 participants) or BBIBP-CorV (256 participants). All these participants that received the booster vaccination were contained in the safety set (SS) for the analysis of vaccine safety. 255 participants in NVSI-06-09 booster group and 249 in BBIBP-CorV booster group who had valid immunogenicity data were included in the per-protocol set (PPS) for the analysis of vaccine immunogenicity Full size image

Male participants accounted for 94.57% of the population and Asian was the majority (93.99%). Baseline demographic characteristics were well-balanced between the NVSI-06-09 and BBIBP-CorV booster groups. The age composition male-to-female ratio race distribution and physiological status were quite similar across groups (all p > 0.05) (Table 1). Before booster vaccination 24 participants from NVSI-06-09 group and 23 from BBIBP-CorV group were tested positive or weak positive for COVID-19 infection by the swab PCR assay (Table 1).

Safety

At the time of writing this report no serious adverse event or adverse event of special interest was observed. Within 7 days after booster vaccination 31 participants (11.92%) in NVSI-06-09 group and 34 (13.28%) in BBIBP-CorV group reported at least one solicited adverse reaction all of which were ranked as grade 1 or 2. The occurrence of solicited adverse reactions was low and similar between two groups (p = 0.6915) (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). The local adverse reactions reported were injection site pain of grade 1 or 2 by NVSI-06-09 group and injection site pain (grade 1) and pruritus (grade 1) by BBIBP-CorV group. The systemic adverse reactions reported by both groups were mainly muscle pain (non-vaccination site) headache fever and fatigue (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Within 30 days post-booster 8 (3.08%) participants in NVSI-06-09 group and 7 (2.73%) in BBIBP-CorV group reported unsolicited adverse reactions all of which were grade 1 or 2. The incidence and severity of unsolicited adverse reactions were low and similar between two booster groups (p = 1.0000) (Supplementary Table 1). Overall both the NVSI-06-09 and BBIBP-CorV booster vaccinations showed good tolerance and safety with limited adverse reactions observed and the safety profile was comparable between two groups.

Immunogenicity against prototype SARS-CoV-2 virus and omicron BA.1.1 variant

The immunogenicity of NVSI-06-09 as a booster dose was evaluated and compared with BBIBP-CorV by using a live-virus microneutralization assay. Before booster vaccination neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against the prototype SARS-CoV-2 virus were detectable (nAb titer ≥4) in most participants in NVSI-06-09 (99.61%) and BBIBP-CorV (99.20%) groups with nAb geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 119.42 (95%CI 106.47–133.95) and 113.29 (100.50–127.71) respectively (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 2). After booster vaccination nAb response against the prototype virus was significantly improved in both groups but the post-booster antibody titers induced by NVSI-06-09 booster were distinctly higher than those boosted by BBIBP-CorV. On day 14 post-booster nAb GMT against the prototype strain in the homologous BBIBP-CorV booster group increased to 506.47 (95% CI 458.25–559.77) with a 4.47-fold (4.01–4.99) rise compared to the pre-booster baseline. Whereas neutralizing GMT in the NVSI-06-09 booster group reached 2349.44 (95% CI 2061.42–2677.70) with a remarkably 19.67-fold (16.79–23.06) increase from baseline. Correspondingly the fourfold rise rate of nAb titers against the prototype virus induced by NVSI-06-09 was 93.33% (95% CI 89.54–96.07%) which was much greater than 59.44% (53.06–65.59%) by BBIBP-CorV (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 2). Some participants exhibited positive (or weak positive) COVID-19 PCR tests before booster vaccination. After excluding these positive participants similar results were also obtained (Supplementary Table 2). Then we compared the neutralizing responses between two booster groups stratified by different doses (i.e. two or three doses) of prior primary BBIBP-CorV vaccinations. For the participants receiving two-dose primary vaccinations the fold rise of nAb GMT induced by the booster of NVSI-06-09 was significantly greater than that of the BBIBP-CorV booster (15.26-fold vs 2.77-fold) (p = 0.0042) (Supplementary Table 2). A similar trend was also observed in the participants with three-dose primary vaccinations where the GMT fold rise was distinctly higher in NVSI-06-09 group than BBIBP-CorV group (19.90-fold vs 4.55-fold) (p < 0.0001) (Supplementary Table 2). But within NVSI-06-09 or BBIBP-CorV booster group no significant difference was found in the fold rise of nAb GMT between the participants who previously received two and three doses of primary vaccinations of BBIBP-CorV (p > 0.05) (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).

At pre-booster baseline 96.86% participants in NVSI-06-09 group and 97.19% in BBIBP-CorV group exhibited detectable nAbs against the Omicron BA.1.1 variant with the GMT values of 40.47 (95% CI 34.86–46.97) and 37.91 (32.64–44.04) respectively (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 5). The baseline level of nAb GMT against Omicron BA.1.1 variant was obviously lower than that against the prototype strain indicating that the Omicron BA.1.1 variant was partially resistant to two- or three-dose BBIBP-CorV vaccinations. Both NVSI-06-09 and BBIBP-CorV booster vaccinations markedly elevated Omicron BA.1.1-specific nAb response and similar to that of prototype virus the nAb level against Omicron BA.1.1 variant elicited by NVSI-06-09 was dramatically higher than that induced by BBIBP-CorV. On day 14 post-booster the increase of Omicron BA.1.1-specific nAbs from pre-booster baseline by NVSI-06-09 arrived at 42.35-fold (95% CI 35.15–51.03) with GMT of 1713.71 (95% CI 1447.12–2029.41) and 3.78-fold (3.40–4.20) by BBIBP-CorV with GMT of 143.23 (124.48–164.80). Correspondingly the fourfold rise rate of nAb titers against the Omicron BA.1.1 induced by NVSI-06-09 booster was also significantly greater than that by BBIBP-CorV booster (96.86% vs 53.82%) (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 5). After excluding the participants with pre-booster positive COVID-19 infections similar results were also obtained (Supplementary Table 5). When investigating the participants separately with two or three primary doses similar superiority was observed in NVSI-06-09 group. The NVSI-06-09 booster elicited 27.48-fold (95% CI 7.32–103.15) and 43.18-fold (35.78–52.11) rises of Omicron BA.1.1-specific nAb GMT in participants receiving two and three primary doses respectively. In contrast the BBIBP-CorV booster only induced a 1.49-fold (95% CI 0.94–2.37) increase in two-dose regimen and a 3.91-fold (3.51–4.35) in three-dose regimen (Supplementary Table 5). The immune response boosted by NVSI-06-09 was significantly higher than that by BBIBP-CorV in both regimens. Within BBIBP-CorV booster group the fold rise of nAb GMT in subjects who received three doses of primary vaccination was significantly greater than those who received two doses (p = 0.0008). But within NVSI-06-09 booster group no significant difference in the immune response was observed between participants receiving two and three doses of primary vaccinations (p > 0.05) (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7).

As demonstrated by the results presented above the BBIBP-CorV booster elicited similar or lower nAb GMT fold rise against Omicron BA.1.1 variant than that against prototype strain (3.78-fold vs 4.47-fold). By contrary the NVSI-06-09 booster induced a much greater GMT fold rise against Omicron BA.1.1 strain than that against prototype virus (42.35-fold vs 19.67-fold). These results indicated that the NVSI-06-09 booster exhibited remarkably better immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 virus especially Omicron BA.1.1 variant.

Then we further investigated whether the gender and age of participants have influences on the immune response of booster vaccinations. Statistical analyses were performed after stratifying participants into male and female subgroups as well as into different age subgroups. The analysis results showed that the nAb responses against prototype virus and Omicron BA.1.1 variant boosted by either NVSI-06-09 or BBIBP-CorV were gender-independent and also age-independent. The post-booster nAb GMTs were comparable between male and female participants (all p > 0.05) (Supplementary Tables 8–11) and also similar between different age subgroups (all p > 0.05) (Supplementary Tables 12–19) except that the adjusted nAb GMT boosted by BBIBP-CorV in ≥60 years subgroup was significantly higher than that of 45–59 years subgroup (p = 0.0005). Nevertheless it should be pointed out that the number of female subjects in the trial was far less than male and elder subjects far less than younger. The immunogenicity of the NVSI-06-09 booster in female population as well as in elder population should be investigated further in the future study.

Cross-reactive immunogenicity against other Omicron sub-variants

SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant evolves rapidly and many sub-variants have emerged. Owing to its higher transmissibility and immune-evasive capability Omicron BA.2 replaced BA.1 quickly and was soon replaced by BA.4 and BA.5 afterwards. Currently BA.4 and BA.5 have become the dominantly circulating variants worldwide. Besides Omicron BA.1.1 the cross-reactive immunogenicity of NVSI-06-09 against BA.2 BA.4 and BA.5 was also evaluated by using the live-virus microneutralization assay. The nAb responses against these three Omicron sub-variants were tested in all participants in PPS and compared between the NVSI-06-09 and BBIBP-CorV booster groups.

Before booster vaccination 96.85%-97.64% participants in NVSI-06-09 group and 95.58–97.99% in BBIBP-CorV group had detectable nAbs against the Omicron BA.2 BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants. The anti-BA.2 anti-BA.4 and anti-BA.5 neutralizing baseline GMTs were similar between two groups i.e. 39.19 (95% CI 34.27–44.82) 40.59 (35.75–46.10) and 36.95 (32.38–42.16) in the NVSI-06-09 booster group and 40.35 (35.05–46.45) 42.14 (36.80–48.25) and 34.98 (30.53–40.09) in the BBIBP-CorV booster group (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Tables 20–22). The pre-booster GMTs against these three Omicron sub-variants were noticeably less than that against prototype virus implying less sensitive of these Omicron sub-variants to primary BBIBP-CorV vaccinations. On day 14 after booster vaccination the BA.2- BA.4- and BA.5-specific neutralizing GMTs in BBIBP-CorV booster group increased to 117.33 (95% CI 103.07–133.55) 113.51 (98.50–130.81) and 165.39 (142.99–191.30) with 2.91-fold (95% CI 2.60–3.25) 2.69-fold (2.38–3.05) and 4.73-fold (4.10–5.45) increase from baselines respectively. By contrast a dramatically higher neutralizing response was induced by NVSI-06-09 booster in which the BA.2- BA.4- and BA.5-specific neutralizing GMTs reached 983.36 (95% CI 852.25–1134.64) 910.19 (779.53–1062.75) and 999.85 (872.41–1145.90) with the GMT fold rises of 25.09-fold (95% CI 21.17–29.73) 22.42-fold (18.78–26.77) and 27.06-fold (23.04–31.78) respectively (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Tables 20-22). The remarkably better immunogenicity of NVSI-06-09 can also be observed from the four-fold rise rates in nAb titers. In participants from NVSI-06-09 booster group the fourfold rise rates of anti-BA.2 anti-BA.4 and anti-BA.5 neutralizing titers were 94.49% (95% CI 90.92–96.95%) 92.52 % (95% CI 88.56–95.44%) and 94.88% (95% CI 91.41–97.25%) respectively which were significantly higher than 41.77% (95% CI 35.57–48.16%) 42.97% (95% CI 36.74–49.37%) and 59.04% (95% CI 52.65–65.20%) in BBIBP-CorV booster group (all p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Tables 20–22). After excluding the participants with pre-booster positive COVID-19 infections similar results were obtained (Supplementary Tables 20–22). Similar results were also obtained when participants were stratified by two-dose or three-dose primary vaccination regimens. Whether two or three doses of BBIBP-CorV were administered previously by the participants a booster dose of NVSI-06-09 induced much higher nAb responses against Omicron BA.2 BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants than those boosted by BBIBP-CorV (Supplementary Tables 20–22). But within either NVSI-06-09 or BBIBP-CorV booster group the post-booster nAb GMTs in subjects primed with two doses of BBIBP-CorV were comparable to those primed with three doses (all p > 0.05) (Supplementary Tables 23–28). In addition statistical analyses of the participants with different sexes and ages demonstrated that the post-booster nAb GMTs against Omicron BA.2 BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants boosted by NVSI-06-09 and BBIBP-CorV were gender-independent (all p > 0.05) (Supplementary Tables 29–34) and also age-independent (all p > 0.05) (Supplementary Tables 35–46).

Cross-reactive immunogenicity against Beta and Delta variants

NVSI-06-09 is designed as a potential broad-spectrum COVID-19 vaccine. Besides the Omicron variants the cross-reactive immunogenicity of NVSI-06-09 booster vaccination was also tested against other immune-evasive variants including Beta and Delta using BBIBP-CorV as a comparison. A subset of serum samples with sequential numbers collected from 99 participants in NVSI-06-09 group and 100 participants in BBIBP-CorV group were used to evaluate the cross-neutralization against Beta and Delta variants.

The results showed that nAb GMTs against Beta and Delta variants induced by NVSI-06-09 booster were 3075.59 (95% CI 2393.00–3952.89) and 2831.50 (2200.42–3643.58) respectively which were 6.60-fold and 7.17-fold higher than those boosted by BBIBP-CorV with the GMT values of 465.69 (95% CI 376.75–575.63) and 395.05 (316.82–492.58) (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 47). In particular statistical analyses showed that the nAb GMT against Delta variant induced by the booster vaccination of NVSI-06-09 was comparable to that against the prototype virus (p = 0.1536) and the nAb GMT against Beta variant was significantly higher than that against the prototype strain (p = 0.0408) (Supplementary Table 47). The reason for this phenomenon is that several mutations carried by NVSI-06-09 were taken from the Beta and Delta variants. Therefore the immunogen of NVSI-06-09 is more like the RBDs of Beta and Delta variants instead of that of the prototype strain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdmFubmFobm93LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvcmVjcmVhdGlvbi8yMDIzLzAxLzA0L2JpZ3Nob3RzLWdvbGYtY29taW5nLXBvb2xlci1nYS10b3Bnb2xmLzY5Nzc0NDgxMDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BigShots Golf planning to open new course in Pooler GA,"Pooler residents could soon be practicing their golf swings at a driving range off the city's main thoroughfare.

BigShots Golf a TopGolf competitor is looking to locate to the Mosaic Town Center development near the intersection of Interstate 16 and Pooler Parkway which already features popular businesses such as Costco and Chick-fil-A. The “eatertainment” model combines the game of golf with food and drink for all skill levels and ages.

BigShots which is owned by ClubCorp the largest owner and operator of private golf and country clubs in the U.S. has several locations across the country including their original in Vero Beach Florida as well as one in the United Kingdom.

The company dials in on smaller or secondary markets according to reporting from Golf Inc. Magazine an industry publication for golf course developers owners and operators.

“We’re very similar to the Top Golf product” said BigShots Golfs' corporate and civil engineer Devin Birch at a Dec. 19 Pooler council meeting. “However I believe we substantially differentiate ourselves by offering a few more amenities.”

According to Birch BigShots is a more tech-driven company offering virtual or video game-like golf options alongside their putting courses. Other amenities that BigShots traditionally offers at its existing locations include yard games fire pits live music and their Anthem Kitchen and bar.

Plans for the Pooler location are modeled after BigShots' ""Generation Four"" design which puts the putting course and a kids' play area indoors rather than outdoors. Current plans also feature a multi-use space that includes a large screen for golf games corporate presentations or movies said Birch.

A few more steps are needed before plans are finalized for the BigShots Pooler location. While the council unanimously passed a height variance that would allow their golf ball nets to reach 175 feet during a Dec. 19 2022 meeting the petitioner will have to return to council for the full site plan review.

Birch clarified that the height variance increased from the PUD maximum of 125 feet will apply to poles supporting the netting. Pooler’s Fire Chief Wade Simmons added that the department has the equipment and training to address any potential incidents at the requested height variance.

Current plans for the building max out at around 56 feet according to a BigShots representative and the rest of the development will consist of a typical two-story building. The full buildout on the property will total approximately 12 acres.

BigShots Gold will have to return to council for an official site plan approval at a future date."

As many of the optimistic trends of the previous year reversed ETFs booked just over €80bn inflows in 2022 less than half the new money of 2021 and the slowest asset gathering since 2018 according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence.

However these figures obscure the significant shift from mutual funds to ETFs in 2022 with flows into ETFs outpacing mutual funds every month through November.

While core vanilla products dominated this resilience flows also point to other trends such as a resurgence in commodities a yield reversal in fixed income and even ESG products maintaining their resolve.

Low-cost building blocks

For the second year in a row the iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF (IWDA) claimed the crown of ETF with the highest inflows in 2022 gathering $6.5bn net new assets according to data from ETFLogic.

The figure follows $10.2bn flowing into the ETF in 2021 which at the time was more than double the top inflow of the previous year.

Other core ETFs with huge asset gathering included the iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF (CSPX) with $4.5bn inflows the Xtrackers DAX UCITS ETF (DBXD) with $3.6bn the Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF (VWRL) with $3.5bn and the iShares MSCI ACWI UCITS ETF (ISAC) with $2.6bn.

Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Athanasios Psarofagis and Henry Jim noted the popularity of low-cost core ETFs contributed to “among the most important” years for the wrapper.

In fact European investors piled €22bn into ETPs with a fee of less than 0.20% in the six months to 16 November while pulling €28bn from more expensive products illustrating the preference for low-cost ETP offerings during market volatility.

Furthermore cheap passive giant Vanguard only claims a 6% stake of Europe’s ETP market but made up 16% of new assets in 2022.

David Hsu senior equity index and ETF product specialist at Vanguard told ETF Stream: “It is clear that the growth of ETFs is not just about investment trend chasing but fuelled by longer-term secular trends in the marketplace in particular the shift towards low-cost investing. With this in mind we think the outlook is very positive for further ETF adoption in Europe.”

US Treasuries capitalise on a yield reversal

ETFs also allowed investors to express convictions in fixed income including the return to favour of US Treasuries as yields surged on the back of the fastest interest rate hiking in two decades.

The leading beneficiaries of this were the iShares $ Treasury Bond 7-10yr UCITS ETF (IBTM) and iShares $ Treasury Bond 3-7yr UCITS ETF (CBU7) which saw $4.7bn and $3.2bn inflows respectively as yield of 10-year Treasuries shot from 1.51% to 3.49% in the first 10 months of 2022.

Investors also sought protection from monetary policy shifts by allocating to ETFs capturing shorter-duration US Treasuries with $1.4bn flooding into the iShares $ Treasury Bond 0-1yr UCITS ETF (IB01).

Commodities in vogue

Far from purely being low-cost tools for buy-and-hold investment ETFs also demonstrated their stripes as a tool for tactical asset allocation last year with over $2trn annual trading volume in Europe as investors used the wrapper to express short-term and cyclical convictions.

A prime example of this was the Xtrackers Bloomberg Commodity ex-Agriculture & Livestock Swap UCITS ETF (VBCU) which saw $2.3bn inflows as investors sought exposure to inflated energy and material prices while side-stepping food-related commodities.

As Russia invaded Ukraine threatening Europe’s gas supply OPEC members agreed to new daily oil production caps sending the price of fossil fuels to levels not seen in more than a decade.

This trend also saw $918m flow into the targeted WisdomTree Brent Crude Oil ETC (BRNT) according to ETFLogic.

Outside of energy investors were undeterred by the strength of the US dollar and continued adding to their gold allocations. As investors sought safe havens the iShares Physical Gold ETC (IGLN) welcomed $1.2bn net new assets.

ESG stands firm

A final notable trend was the resilience of the appetite for ESG ETFs in Europe. Despite underperforming due to their underweight to energy and question marks surrounding their sustainable credentials ahead of phase two of the EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation ESG blends of core allocations claimed some of the top spots in European flows in 2022.

Leading the way with $4.7bn new money was the iShares MSCI USA ESG Enhanced UCITS ETF (EEDS) along with equivalents for other regions such as the iShares MSCI Europe ESG Enhanced UCITS ETF (EEUD) and the iShares MSCI EM ESG Enhanced UCITS ETF (EDM2) with $1.6bn and $1.3bn inflows respectively.

Interestingly similar appetite was seen in green thematic exposures. Despite being downgraded to ‘light green’ Article 8 under SFDR the iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF (INRG) saw $758m inflows over the past 12 months.

How ESG ETFs will be categorised and whether they will maintain the run of popularity they have enjoyed in recent years will be a key theme to watch in 2023.

Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine in February sent shockwaves through global markets as western governments were quick to implement financial sanctions keen to make Russia an economic pariah.

In crypto land the terra crash last May and the dramatic collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX in November created one of the harshest ‘crypto winter’ for investors in digital currencies and the broader ecosystem.

The crash has even led several crypto issuers – including Bitpanda and ETC Group – to pull their ETPs from the market on low demand.

However equities were down across the board as rising interest rates hit tech stocks particularly hard with some thematic ETFs falling dramatically.

While bonds offered little respite in 2022 a historic month for UK gilts following former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s ‘mini budget’ was enough to make sure the asset class was one of the worst performing over the last 12 months.

Russian assets trapped

Investors in Russia-focused ETFs were likely the biggest losers this year with the products essentially losing their entire value overnight. Following the rapid closure of the Russian markets ETF issuers were left scrambling to understand what impact it would have on their products.

The fast-moving situation was sparked when the Moscow Exchange shut just a few days after the invasion leaving the world’s largest index provider MSCI to label the market “uninvestable”.

ETF issuers swiftly suspended creation and redemption orders on Russian ETFs closing primary markets. Exchanges globally then halted trading of Russia ETFs until further notice shutting off the secondary market.

According to Bloomberg Intelligence standalone Russia ETFs saw almost all of their $4bn assets under management (AUM) wiped off between the end of January and mid-March as asset managers wrote down the value of their assets.

Can any ETF assets escape from Russia?

In the months ensuing asset managers decided to terminate their Russia ETFs with BlackRock Invesco and DWS all delisting their products.

As it stands the Lyxor PEA Russia MSCI Russia IMI Select GDR UCITS ETF (PRUS) Lyxor MSCI Russia UCITS ETF (RUS) and HSBC MSCI Russia Capped UCITS ETF (HRUD) are Europe’s remaining Russia ETFs.

The ‘crypto winter’ freeze

The crypto winter turned into an ice blast in the second half of 2022 after the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange FTX went bankrupt leaving the industry in a tailspin.

However the industry had already faced a tumultuous six months following the collapse of terra which led several ETP issuers to shutter their ETPs having lost almost 100% of their value.

Meanwhile ETPs tracking bitcoin have also underperformed significantly with the cryptocurrency down over 64% last year.

Crypto equity products were the worst-performing ETFs over the last 12 months a sign the pain was felt across broader digital assets and the technology that backs them.

The VanEck Crypto and Blockchain Innovators UCITS ETF (DABG) returned -86.6% over the period while the ETC Group Digital Assets & Blockchain Equity UCITS ETF (KOIP) returned -77.3%. Elsewhere the Invesco CoinShares Global Blockchain UCITS ETF (BCHS) faired a little better but still fell 52.4%.

There are signs things could get worse for the industry. The second-largest crypto exchange Binance is now under the spotlight after it temporarily halted withdrawals of the stablecoin USDC last December.

Thematics feel the pain

ETFs investing in tech-driven megatrends such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence posted high double-digit negative returns as the tech sector faced headwinds including inflation rising interest rates and an economic slowdown.

The tech-driven Nasdaq 100 hit harder than most by these headwinds is down 33.8% over 2022 versus 19.9% for the S&P 500.

The worst-performing ETF in this category was the HANetf's Global Online Retail UCITS ETF (PBUY) which returned -72.2%.

This was followed by the WisdomTree Cloud Computing UCITS ETF (KLWD) and the Global X Fintech UCITS ETF (FING) which returned -54.3% and -53.5% respectively.

Other themes that performed poorly were cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. The WisdomTree Cybersecurity UCITS ETF (CYSE) was down 44.2% for the year followed by the L&G Artificial Intelligence UCITS ETF (AIAG) which returned -41.2%.

Meanwhile the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence UCITS ETF (BOTZ) and the WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence UCITS ETF (INTL) fell 43.5% and 43.1% respectively.

The UK gilt meltdown

The UK gilt market was sent into meltdown at the end of September after Chancellor Kwarteng unleashed extravagant spending plans and unfunded tax cuts that sent 30-year gilt yields to a two-decade high.

Responding to the yield volatility gilt ETFs experienced double-digit losses in September confounding a poor year for UK government bonds.

A historic month for UK gilt ETFs

Leading the way was the longer-dated SPDR Bloomberg 15+ Year Gilt UCITS ETF (GLTL) which returned -46.9% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile the iShares £ Index-Linked Gilts UCITS ETF (INXG) returned -41.8% followed by -41% for the Lyxor Core FTSE Actuaries UK Gilts Inflation-Linked UCITS ETF (GILI).

The ETFs experienced somewhat of a comeback in Q4 following the demise of the Liz Truss government and the end of the ‘growth at all costs’ policy with INXG and GILI 13.5% and 12.8% up since the end of September.

Generating outperformance has been a mighty task for almost every asset class over the past 12 months as geopolitical and macro headwinds have left little place for investors to hide.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent global energy crisis meant another bumper year for the sector while broad commodities also experienced strong performance as most of the world fully opened following two years of COVID-19.

Highlighting energy stocks’ dominance the price of crude oil remains at an eight-year high despite retreating to where it was at the start of the year.

Following a torrid year for the Turkish equity market in 2021 the country has experienced a remarkable turnaround over the past 12 months. Despite facing rampant inflation Turkey’s central bank has gone against global consensus and cut interest rates in a bid to boost consumer spending.

Meanwhile Brazil ETFs have also benefitted from the strong commodity performance catapulting them toward the top of the charts of the best-performing ETFs of last year.

Turkey’s turnaround

Having featured in the worst-performing ETFs article of 2021 last year proved to be a remarkable turnaround for Turkish equities despite facing many of the same headwinds as its emerging market counterparts.

Much of this can be attributed to President Recep Erdogen’s approach to monetary policy highlighting the need for investors to tread with caution.

In stark contrast to most other governments dealing with rampant inflation Erdogen slashed interest rates from 19% in September 2021 to 9% last November to boost the economy and even fired central bankers who disagreed with his measures.

While the strategy delivered a boost to its stock market it has had a disastrous effect on the country’s economy. Inflation hit 84.4% in November versus 21.3% 12 months earlier while the Turkish lira is 36.5% down on the US dollar over the same period.

Looking to safeguard their savings local retail investors have poured into Turkish stocks with trading accounts up 32% this year according to Turkey’s Central Securities Depository.

This has helped ETFs tracking Turkish stocks to see a huge outperformance over this period. Topping the charts is the Lyxor MSCI Turkey UCITS ETF (TURL) which returned 89% in 2022 and was the best-performing ETF in Europe over the period.

Following closely behind are the HSBC MSCI Turkey UCITS ETF (HTRY) and the iShares MSCI Turkey UCITS ETF (ITKY) which returned 86.5% and 85.6% respectively.

Energy reigns

As rising demand following the big COVID-19 reopening pushed energy stocks to the top of the charts in 2021 a supply shock following the shunning of Russian oil and gas has led to a huge outperformance of the sector in 2022.

Crude oil hit a 14-year high in June at $120 a barrel as the energy crisis following the Russian invasion of Ukraine peaked fuelling strong sector performance.

Topping the charts are several US energy sector ETFs. The sector was the biggest contributor to earnings growth for the S&P 500 at 5.1% as oil companies posted bumper profits.

These include the iShares S&P 500 Energy Sector UCITS ETF (IESU) the Xtrackers MSCI USA Energy UCITS ETF (XSEN) and the SPDR S&P US Energy Select Sector UCITS ETF (GXLE) which returned 64.8% 64.2% and 63.9% respectively.

This is followed by the iShares MSCI World Energy Sector UCITS ETF (WENS) and the Xtrackers MSCI World Energy UCITS ETF (XDW0) – both of which are 63% weighted to the US – with returns of 47.6% each.

Meanwhile the purer sector plays including the iShares Oil & Gas Exploration & Production UCITS ETF (SPOG) which tracks the S&P Commodity Producers Oil and Gas Exploration & Production index returned 41.4% in 2022.

Commodities outperform

Much like the energy sector the early-year rally of commodity ETFs cooled in the second half of 2022 as supply pressures eased following the onset of the war in Ukraine in February.

Diversified commodity ETFs still posted a strong year however as energy agriculture and precious metals all saw favourable macro-economic conditions.

Leading the way was the Lyxor Commodities Refinitiv/CoreCommodity CRB TR UCITS ETF (CRBL) with returns of 23%.

This was closely followed by the L&G Multi-Strategy Enhanced Commodities UCITS ETF (ENCO) and the Xtrackers Bloomberg Commodity ex-Agriculture & Livestock Swap UCITS ETF (XBCU) which returned 22.6% and 20.3% respectively.

Despite its outperformance over the past 12 months JP Morgan said the asset class was in a “super-cycle” and maintained an overweight positioning to the asset class going into next year but added these must be balanced against a recession risk.

Brazil bounces

Brazilian equity ETFs have experienced a strong year driven by performance in the first half of the year in particular after Russia’s invasions of Ukraine pushed up commodity prices globally.

Exports reached record-high levels in 2022 pushed up by the positive commodity shock and diversification of its export partners according to the Bank of America.

The ETFs that best captured the market in 2022 are the iShares MSCI Brazil UCITS ETF (IBZL) and the Lyxor MSCI Brazil UCITS ETF (RIOL) which returned 15.9% and 15.5% respectively. Meanwhile the Amundi MSCI Brazil UCITS ETF (BRZ) posted returns of 12.8%.

A recent poll by Reuters suggested Brazil stocks will rally a further 13% by the end of 2023 however market experts have warned recently elected president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s potential slower than anticipated monetary policy easing and lower commodity prices could hurt its stock market.

The Coldago Research Map 2022 for Object Storage lists and ranks 15 vendors playing in the object storage market segment. They are in alphabetic order: Cloudian Cohesity Commvault DataCore Dell Hitachi Vantara IBM MinIO NetApp Pure Storage Quantum Scality Spectra Logic VAST Data and WEKA. There are seven leaders: Cloudian Hitachi Vantara IBM MinIO NetApp Pure Storage and Quantum in alphabetic order.

DDN Huawei and Fujitsu which all appeared in Coldago’s 2021 object storage map disappeared from the 2022 supplier rankings while WEKA is a new entrant.

We asked Coldago analyst Philippe Nicolas questions about about this year’s map.

Blocks & Files: Could you describe the basic Map concept please?

Philippe Nicolas

Philippe Nicolas: A Coldago Map has essentially 2 dimensions: one – Vision and Strategy and two – Execution and Capabilities. A leader is recognized by its position to the right but also to the top. Coldago doesn’t only compare products … but analyzes companies playing in a domain. This includes company profile business and strategy products solutions and technologies. I recognized that the product part occupied a large piece and our features matrix uses more than 50 criteria or attributes.

Blocks & Files: What are your data sources?

Philippe Nicolas: We have collected lots of data during this period from end-users partners and vendors meetings watching companies and products announcements cases studies integrations or partnerships. These informations could be positive like number of deployments large configurations application integrations or negative like product un-installations data integrity and sales behaviors. Of course negative info could have serious impacts. All these data are then digested segmented grouped and normalized to make comparison and ranking easier.

Blocks & Files: Talk us through some of the vendor highlights.

Philippe Nicolas: Pure Storage and VAST Data had an excellent year in many aspects; product release and features deployments revenues or market penetration. MinIO and Cloudian are leaders like last year even if their positions changed a little based on their 12 month’s operations.

Scality is still a serious challenger and it reflects their 12 month’s activity. Relatively Scality has vertically a better position that Cloudian but it belongs in the challenger partition.

For MinIO the company continues to confirm their ubiquitous presence with tons of integrations large adoption and it has moved up vertically. Again Cloudian is a leader which is not the case for DataCore and Cohesity. DataCore delivered a better job than Caringo – which it acquired in January 2021.

Cohesity had clearly some positive aspects on the execution side with strong channels and a comprehensive product with multiple deployment flavors. WEKA is added this year entering for the first time as it provides an S3 interface like all others but it belongs in the specialists’ section. We’ll carefully monitor WEKA’s S3 activity in 2023.

Blocks & Files: Any comments about the other suppliers?

Philippe Nicolas: The historical players many of them missed some opportunities and clearly lost some visibility except Hitachi Vantara or MinIO. Also Quantum has made an interesting move with a product established for years and several developments; it now belongs in the leader’s section thanks to an improved activity in many aspects during the 12 months. NetApp and IBM Red Hat included also occupied a leader’s position.

Blocks & Files: What has changed in the object storage market since last year?

Philippe Nicolas: What is important to realize is the shift in the market for a few years. Being internally an object storage with the few characteristics we know like flat address space… is no longer so important. In other words the Map is not about object storage purists but more about the market reality. On the users’ side they care about a S3 interface with a high degree of compatibility with the Amazon API but less on other aspects. They’re looking for ease of deployment maintenance and support scalability capacity and a few other core features of course especially in the data protection area.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaG5vbG9neW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9pbm5vdmF0aXZlLXNvbHV0aW9ucy1zaWducy1zdHJhdGVnaWMtYWdyZWVtZW50LXdpdGgtYXdz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Innovative Solutions signs strategic agreement with AWS,"Cloud services provider Innovative Solutions has announced that it has entered into a multi-year strategic collaboration agreement with Amazon Web Services with the two organisations aligning their sales marketing and delivery teams to accelerate the adoption of cloud services in the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and startup industry segments.

Innovative will enhance their customer's cloud journey experience through managed services offerings as well as the company's ability to support customers through the full digital transformation lifecycle; migration modernisation data strategy and machine learning (ML).

""We're thrilled to work with AWS on this remarkable opportunity"" said Justin Copie CEO of Innovative. ""This agreement helps us achieve our vision of helping every SME customer become a technology company. The size and scale of this agreement and how it will help us accelerate is without precedent.""

Agreement to drive investment in several key areas

The agreement between Innovative and AWS drives key investments in several areas that address the growing demand for AWS products and services across Innovative's base of 600+ SME customers as well as with new customers in the US and Canada. Innovative will expand its migration and modernisation practice and managed services offerings and build out new practices in data analytics and ML to support the advanced stages of its customers' journey to the cloud. Innovative will also invest in the development and scale of its portfolio listing the company's solutions in AWS Marketplace to help SMB customers quickly procure and further accelerate migration to AWS.

""Talent acquisition and growth is a central part of our strategy"" said Jaime Eisenhauer Chief People Officer at Innovative. ""We provide our customers with proven experts so we have aligned both our recruiting and training programs to provide our services with the best talent in North America.

“It starts with a solid foundation and every employee at Innovative – from administrative support to accounting to sales to the executive team – has earned an AWS certification. From there we go deep with AWS Solutions Architects DevOps engineers and specialties that match the needs of our customers. Working at Innovative is like getting a graduate degree in the cloud.""

As an AWS Premier Tier Services Partner Innovative has rapidly expanded by adding specialised services for businesses wishing to migrate their server infrastructure to AWS and managing a customer's cloud operations thereafter. With this new agreement Innovative Solutions plans to accelerate growth and customer satisfaction by creating four practice groups: Migrations Modernisation Data Engagements and Machine Learning. Each will serve as its own lines of business and be responsible for increasing the depth scale agility and reach to provide the best customer experience to Innovative and AWS's mutual customers at all stages in their digital transformation.

Innovative's growth plans include the expansion of its Managed Cloud Services (MCS) line of business. MCS customers are more confident when growing on the cloud because their infrastructure is managed for cost security and compliance with a combination of tools and services. One foundational capability included for all MCS customers at no additional charge is CloudCheckr a cloud management product in Spot by NetApp's portfolio for cloud operations. In concert with Innovative's cloud experts CloudCheckr provides visibility and intelligence to better manage costs make infrastructure more secure and in compliance and optimise resources in use.

""Innovative's growth and strategic relationship with AWS is a testament to the quality of service they provide their customers"" said Kevin McGrath vice president and general manager of Spot by NetApp. ""NetApp is proud to be working with successful service providers like Innovative to together help our joint customers take full advantage of the power of AWS.""

""Over the last 24 months we have seen a significant rise in demand and adoption of cloud solutions as small and medium size business businesses look to grow their digital offerings"" said Ruba Borno vice president of Worldwide Channels & Alliances at AWS. ""We are excited to expand our relationship with Innovative Solutions and help businesses broaden their customer base and bring new products to market and continue on their cloud migration journey.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhhbnNpbmRpYS5jb20vYW5kaHJhLXByYWRlc2gvamFnYW4tY3JlYXRpbmctd2VsZmFyZS1yZXZvbHV0aW9uLWluLXN0YXRlLTc3NjAyN9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhhbnNpbmRpYS5jb20vYW1wL2FuZGhyYS1wcmFkZXNoL2phZ2FuLWNyZWF0aW5nLXdlbGZhcmUtcmV2b2x1dGlvbi1pbi1zdGF0ZS03NzYwMjc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jagan creating welfare revolution in State,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhhbnNpbmRpYS5jb20vYW5kaHJhLXByYWRlc2gvamFnYW4tY3JlYXRpbmctd2VsZmFyZS1yZXZvbHV0aW9uLWluLXN0YXRlLTc3NjAyN9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhhbnNpbmRpYS5jb20vYW1wL2FuZGhyYS1wcmFkZXNoL2phZ2FuLWNyZWF0aW5nLXdlbGZhcmUtcmV2b2x1dGlvbi1pbi1zdGF0ZS03NzYwMjc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E26701F0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The chances are though that there is still large number of movies and TV series you did not know were on there.

Unless you have a lot of time one your hands and spend hours scrolling through the entire library there is plenty of stuff tucked away that does not immediately appear on your homescreen.

The titles that you can readily see are based on the previous things you’ve watched or added to your list – however if you’d like to stream something from a genre that isn’t available on the main page you won’t be able to easily find what you’re looking for.

It turns out there are actually thousands of codes that will make searching through the platform much easier for you.

These codes correlate with some pretty specific genres ranging from “Romantic Foreign Movies” to “B-Horror Movies” and they’ve been put in one place for you to scroll through.

To visit each genre’s webpage all you need to do is input the four-digit code into your web browser after the following address: http://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/

It is worth noting that this only works on the website and won’t be available on phones NOW boxes or the Amazon Firestick.

What to Know,"Netflix's heist drama Kaleidoscope is filled with twists but perhaps the biggest of all is that it's inspired by a real-life event.

The series — which stars Giancarlo Esposito Paz Vega Rufus Sewell Tati Gabrielle Peter Mark Kendall Rosaline Elbay Jai Courtney Niousha Noor Jordan Mendoza Soojeong Son and Hemky Madera — follows a group of thieves who attempt an epic heist worth $7 billion.

Captivating audiences with its unique format the show ""takes a non-linear approach to storytelling"" by encouraging people to watch the eight episodes in different orders.

Spanning from 24 years before the heist occurred to 6 months after the show allows audiences to fill in the gaps of the mystery as they watch.

So how exactly did creator Eric Garcia come up with the idea for the show? Though the actual heist and characters are fictional a real-life event in N.Y.C. during Hurricane Sandy was the inspiration for the show's central plot.

Read ahead to learn more about the true story behind the show.

What is the true story behind Kaleidoscope?

David Scott Holloway/Netflix

Per Netflix the series is ""loosely inspired by the real-life story where seventy billion dollars in bonds went missing in downtown Manhattan during Hurricane Sandy in 2012."" Though damage to the bonds was primarily attributed to flooding at the time Kaleidoscope creator Garcia took the concept a bit further for his show.

""It's loosely based on something that might have happened"" Garcia told Tudum about his inspiration behind the show. ""After Hurricane Sandy 70 billion dollars worth of bonds got flooded in the basement of the DTCC which is a large clearing effort that's owned by a bunch of the big banks. To my mind I was like 'Well that's a perfect coverup for a heist!'""

Like the series the real-life event largely centered around bearer bonds which ""were phased out in the 1980s"" as they were unregistered and kept no records of the owner making them ""easily used by money launderers and tax evaders"" per The Wall Street Journal.

What happened during the real-life event?

According to the New York Post in 2012 Hurricane Sandy flooded a 10000-square-foot underground vault at 55 Water St. ""soaking 1.3 million bond and stock certificates — including bearer bonds that function like cash.""

The publication reported that some of the notes were ""drenched in diesel- and sewage-tinged water"" though many sources wouldn't discuss the actual damage.

""It's nobody's business"" a contractor said at the time. ""The public doesn't need to know what's in that vault. It's between them and their customers.""

How much money was in the vault?

Courtesy of Netflix

At the time the New York Post dubbed the event the ""biggest mystery on Wall Street"" as the actual value of the notes remained relatively unknown except to the ""innermost circle of Wall Street bankers.""

The Depository Trust and Clearing Corp. also wouldn't confirm what was in the vaults and who owned what but a source told the New York Post that ""$70 billion in bearer bonds were in jeopardy.""

According to the New York Post DTCC records showed that in 1990 two-thirds of the 32 million notes in the vault were bearer bonds. By late 2003 the vault was said to have held up to 5.4 million bearer bonds.

What happened to the bearer bonds in the vault?

Clifton Prescod/Netflix

It's still unclear what exactly happened to the bearer bonds in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. At the time a worker on site told the New York Post that there were three vaults and ""they were all under water"" adding that ""billions of dollars' worth [were] soaked.""

At the time experts told the publication that the bonds might only be salvageable by freeze-drying them in a cold vacuum chamber. ""As the air pressure in the chamber is reduced and heat is increased moisture in the documents would evaporate"" the source added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy90di9uZXdzL2dsYXNzLW9uaW9uLW5ldGZsaXgtdGhpcmQtbW9zdC13YXRjaGVkLWZpbG0tMjA5LW1pbGxpb24taG91cnMtd2F0Y2hlZC0xMjM1NDc3OTk0L9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy90di9uZXdzL2dsYXNzLW9uaW9uLW5ldGZsaXgtdGhpcmQtbW9zdC13YXRjaGVkLWZpbG0tMjA5LW1pbGxpb24taG91cnMtd2F0Y2hlZC0xMjM1NDc3OTk0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Glass Onion’ Becomes Netflix’s Third Most Watched Film in 10-Day Period,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='variety.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2023/tv/news/glass-onion-netflix-third-most-watched-film-209-million-hours-watched-1235477994/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E4261ED0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy90di9uZXdzL2dsYXNzLW9uaW9uLW5ldGZsaXgtdGhpcmQtbW9zdC13YXRjaGVkLWZpbG0tMjA5LW1pbGxpb24taG91cnMtd2F0Y2hlZC0xMjM1NDc3OTk0L9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy90di9uZXdzL2dsYXNzLW9uaW9uLW5ldGZsaXgtdGhpcmQtbW9zdC13YXRjaGVkLWZpbG0tMjA5LW1pbGxpb24taG91cnMtd2F0Y2hlZC0xMjM1NDc3OTk0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The combined lease was signed in 2022 but kept under wraps until now. It was Manhattan’s largest last year and the largest in Manhattan in three years.

It’s a huge shot in the arm for Sixth Avenue which has lost fewer tenants to the far West Side and downtown than have Third and Park Avenues. Several other mid-20th century towers in the West 40s and 50s have also undergone significant improvements such as Rockefeller Group’s former Time + Life Building at 1271 Sixth.

The 1211 Sixth deals represent a stroke of faith in the future of offices defying forecasts that employees especially in media jobs would all work from home.

Sign 20-Year Lease Renewals At New York Headquarters Building A Hopeful Sign For Return Of Midtown Manhattan Office Pulse,"Rupert Murdoch‘s News Corp. and Fox Corp. have signed 20-year renewals of their leases in their longtime shared headquarters in New York at 1211 Avenue of the Americas.

The updated agreements with Ivanhoé Cambridge a real estate subsidiary of a Québec investment firm span 1.2 million square feet of office space. Together they represent the largest commercial lease deal of 2022 as well as the biggest in Manhattan since 2019. Along with the interior space the renewals call for renovations of the plaza and outdoor spaces where Fox Sports and Fox News have hosted broadcasts. There will also be a new tenant lobby on 47th Street. Renovation work is due to start later this year.

In a time of deep uncertainty about the state of office life in general across the U.S. the renewals offer hope for a number of stakeholders including New York City officials commercial landlords and local businesses. Companies have had to implement waves of changes to their office strategies since Covid started sweeping across the country nearly three years ago. Commercial occupancy rates in Manhattan are still low with many employees opting to work remotely and the future of Midtown’s famously dense forest of skyscrapers is the subject of regular debate among policy wonks as well as average New Yorkers.

Particularly in the media business the string of postwar towers from 42nd to 57th streets on Sixth Avenue (as the Avenue of the Americas was known before 1945) has long had an outsized symbolic importance. NBCUniversal’s home at 30 Rockefeller Plaza remains intact but the street was also once home to companies like CBS Time-Life and McGraw-Hill. Today it is still known for its many office towers as well as landmarks like Radio City Music Hall and Carnegie Hall. Helped by its proximity to transit hubs it has fared better than other neighborhoods during the Covid era despite a relative lack of the kinds of ultra-modern corporate sites found in Hudson Yards or downtown. The Murdoch-dominated building 1211 opened in 1973 the same year as the original twin towers of the World Trade Center and bears all of the geometric design hallmarks of that era.

The office leases now run through 2042 and carry further extension options. Fox has almost 670000 square feet and its lease extension takes effect in December 2025. News Corp.’s lease for 486000 square feet gets extended at the end of 2027.

Overall Midtown total leasing exceeded 21 million square feet in 2022 Ivanhoé Cambridge noted which is on par with the historical 20-year average of 21.2 million square feet. The company said the level of activity demonstrates “the resilience of the Midtown office leasing market in a post-pandemic world.”

Jonathan Pearce EVP Leasing & Development North America at Ivanhoé Cambridge said Fox and News Corp. have placed a “clear vote of confidence in 1211 and Midtown Manhattan” with the reup. The renewal “also underscores the importance that these leading companies place on having a dynamic workplace that supports its business activities as well as the attraction and retention of key talent and to offer a leading experience to its viewers customers guests and employees.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vY29tbWVyY2lhbG9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAxL2ZveC1jb3Jwb3JhdGlvbi1hbmQtbmV3cy1jb3JwLXJlbmV3LWNvbWJpbmVkLTEtMW0tc2YtYXQtMTIxMS1hdmVudWUtb2YtdGhlLWFtZXJpY2FzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fox Corporation and News Corp.

A few years ago batteries played an insignificant role on the U.S. grid or any grid really. Advocates talked up the theoretical benefits batteries could deliver for a cleaner more efficient grid if only someone would notice how great they were and like pay them for it.

How quickly things change. In the rosy dawn of 2022 the federal government predicted that the U.S. would add 5.1 gigawatts of batteries over the course of the year equating to 11 percent of new power plant capacity. At the close of the year the count looked more like 5.4 gigawatts according to the storage analysts at Wood Mackenzie.

“Up to 2020 we’d never had a single year break a gigawatt” of storage deployments said Jason Burwen an architect of U.S. grid-storage policy and vice president of energy storage at the American Clean Power Association. ​“That is a bonkers rate of acceleration.”

Batteries have taken over the market for new power capacity in California. The wildcat free-marketeers of Texas chase close behind in their zeal for this new type of power plant. And the authors of the Inflation Reduction Act delivered the storage industry’s most ardent desire: its very own tax credit. It’s off to the races.

But while that phrase generally connotes speed the storage market today is the kind of race where the starting gun unleashes sheer chaos as more contestants than the course has room for jockey to pull to the front of the pack.

Just as everybody’s decided they want to install grid batteries the batteries themselves have become nearly impossible to get ahold of. Factory capacity to manufacture lithium-ion batteries lags demand by a few years. But now both electric-vehicle manufacturers and grid-storage companies are clamoring for more than ever before. Those who can’t buy in historically unprecedented bulk will have to wait a few years.

The annual ritual of tracking lithium-ion batteries’ inexorable cost declines crashed into a hard reality this year: Prices rose for the first time since BloombergNEF started tracking them a decade ago. Startups shouting into the wind that they had invented viable alternatives to lithium finally found some receptive ears. The scarcity of new batteries even inspired investors to put money behind used electric-vehicle batteries as a grid-storage resource — one of those supposed slam dunks that nobody has managed to dunk thus far.

Buy big or go home: The era of portfolio-level storage procurement

Electric-vehicle makers have always gotten first dibs on battery supply because they buy so much more volume than grid-storage companies. But developers used to be able to go to market when they had a project ready to build and get some high-quality lithium-ion batteries to power it. Now it’s not so easy.

“Our expectation is that most of the supply is spoken for for 2023 and a lot of 2024 is probably spoken for as well” said Burwen.

In such a moment of scarcity developers are unlikely to get a seller’s attention unless they stack their shopping lists for many battery projects and buy at the portfolio scale instead.

“The project is probably not going to get the capacity — the portfolio is” said Kelcy Pegler CEO of storage integrator FlexGen during a September interview.

This principle trickles down to the storage integrators who buy battery cells and assemble them into containers with the controls and power electronics needed to make a viable energy-storage facility. In 2022 integrators started touting their own battery purchases to signal to customers that they actually had something to sell.

Thus at RE+ in September the biggest annual conference for the solar and storage industry FlexGen held a signing ceremony to celebrate its purchase of 10 gigawatt-hours of liquid-cooled lithium-ion batteries from Chinese manufacturing giant CATL.

“In a world of haves and have-nots FlexGen customers will have battery capacity” Pegler told Canary Media.

Another leading U.S. storage integrator Oregon’s Powin Energy announced in February it was buying 5.8 gigawatt-hours of capacity to deliver across multiple developer customers over the next three years. Then in May it said it would buy a stupendous 28.5 gigawatt-hours of battery cells from Norway’s Freyr from 2024 through 2030.

Locking in massive cell purchases gave Powin the assurance to sell big deals of its own. In May it pledged 2.5 gigawatt-hours to Ameresco. Later in the year Powin announced a deal to supply 1.7 gigawatt-hours over two years to Akaysha Energy an Australian storage developer that got acquired by BlackRock last summer. With battery supply secured Akaysha subsequently announced it would build the world’s largest battery to replace a massive retiring coal plant.

Any one of these portfolio deals constitutes more storage capacity than the entire annual U.S. storage market just a few years ago.

Alternate technologies shoot their shot

The increase in battery costs that BloombergNEF identified won’t persist past the medium term Burwen said.

“High prices become really good reasons to invest in expansion of supply and innovations to produce that supply more efficiently” he noted.

Plenty of startups have innovated to make ways to store energy without relying on the lithium-ion monoculture. For years mass-produced lithium-ion batteries crushed all competitors just like mass-produced crystalline-silicon solar panels dominate their market. But challengers seized on the logjam in mainstream storage to put bigger numbers on the board in 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmRtdXNjbGUuY29tL25ld3MvdGhvcnNwb3J0LXJhY2luZy1yZXR1cm5zLXRvLWZvcmQtYW5kLWJyaW5ncy10cmFpbGJsYXppbmctZHJpdmVyLW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ThorSport Racing Returns To Ford And Brings Trailblazing Driver On,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.fordmuscle.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Last year served as an unpleasant yet important reminder that the stock market doesn't move up in a straight line -- even if 2021 made everyone believe it did. When the closing bell tolled the benchmark S&P 500 ended down by 19% with the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also entering bear market territory during the course of the year.

Thankfully a new year brings new opportunities for investors. Despite historically high inflation and growing economic uncertainty the following 10 top stocks have the tools and intangibles necessary to make you richer in 2023.

1. Mastercard

The first top-notch stock that can help you build wealth in the new year is payment processor Mastercard (MA 0.33%). Even though financial stocks are cyclical and therefore prone to weakness when economic downturns arise Mastercard has clear-cut competitive advantages that should shield it from much of this potential weakness in 2023.

To begin with Mastercard's management team has kept the company focused on payment processing while avoiding the lending arena. When the U.S. and global economy weaken it's not uncommon for delinquencies and loan losses to rise. Since Mastercard doesn't lend it's not required to set aside capital to cover loan losses. This small but important detail helps explain why its profit margin is consistently above 40%.

Furthermore Mastercard should continue to benefit from historically high inflation. With the U.S. personal saving rate plunging more consumers and businesses than ever are turning to credit cards to fund their purchases. Mastercard is No. 2 in the U.S. in credit card network purchase volume and has plenty of runway to organically expand into underbanked emerging markets over the coming years.

2. NextEra Energy

A second top stock that can make you richer in 2023 is the largest publicly traded electric utility by market cap in the U.S. NextEra Energy (NEE -1.06%). Despite a modest down year in 2022 NextEra has delivered a positive total return including dividends paid to its shareholders in 19 of the past 21 years.

Buying into profitable time-tested dividend-paying companies that provide basic necessity goods and services is often a smart strategy during a bear market. Since electricity consumption habits don't change much from one year to the next a company like NextEra can accurately forecast its operating cash flow in advance. This lets the company outlay capital for new projects acquisitions and its distribution without having to worry about adversely impacting profits.

The other key to NextEra Energy's outperformance is its willingness to invest big in renewable energy. No electric utility is generating more capacity from wind or solar power. These investments have lowered the company's electricity generation costs and lifted its adjusted earnings growth to an annualized average of 8.4% since 2006.

3. Vertex Pharmaceuticals

Biotech stock Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 0.91%) is another top stock that can make you richer in the new year. Since we can't control when we get sick or what ailment(s) we develop there's always going to be demand for prescription drugs medical devices and healthcare services no matter how the economy or stock market perform.

What makes Vertex so special is its dominance in helping patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) a genetic disease characterized by thick mucus production that can obstruct the lungs and pancreas. Vertex has developed four generations of CF therapies designed to improve lung function and is currently working on a fifth. Combination CF therapy Trikafta is pacing over $8 billion in annual run-rate sales.

The company's product pipeline beyond CF is also promising. It's working with CRISPR Therapeutics to use gene editing as a way to treat sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia and it has novel treatments in its pipeline to treat pain type 1 diabetes and APOL1-mediated kidney disease. Positive data readouts in 2023 can send Vertex even higher.

4. Markel

The fourth top stock capable of growing your wealth in 2023 is specialty insurance company Markel (MKL 0.96%). Though Hurricane Ian put the hurt on the insurance industry last year Markel brings its own advantages to the table.

From a macro perspective insurers and reinsurers have exceptional pricing power. Whether a catastrophe necessitates higher premiums or an insurer is prepping ahead of the next inevitable event insurers have no trouble increasing premiums on their customers. It's what tends to lift profits over time.

To add to this point the Fed's hawkish monetary policy is a positive for Markel and its peers. Collected but unused premium (known as ""float"") is typically invested by insurance companies in U.S. Treasury bonds. As the Fed has lifted rates the yield Markel is netting from its float has jumped considerably.

Lastly Markel has nearly $7 billion invested in equities. The company's diverse investment portfolio has historically helped it take advantage of long-term growth in the U.S. and global economy.

5. Fiverr International

A lesser-known top stock that can make you richer in 2023 is small-cap online-services marketplace Fiverr International (FVRR 4.95%). Fiverr offers two key differences from other freelancer marketplaces that makes it a screaming buy.

First Fiverr's platform provides better price transparency for buyers. While most online marketplaces present freelancer jobs on an hourly basis Fiverr freelancers present tasks at an all-inclusive price. This price transparency is likely a key reason that both spend per buyer and the aggregate number of buyers on Fiverr's platform climbed throughout 2022.

Arguably the top reason Fiverr stock can advance in 2023 is its take-rate -- i.e. the percentage of each deal negotiated on its marketplace that it gets to keep. During the September-ended quarter the company's take-rate hit 30% on the nose. Its take-rate has consistently expanded which should yield juicier operating margins in the quarters to come.

6. AT&T

Telecom stock AT&T (T -0.06%) is a sixth top-tier company that can make you richer this year. Since having access to wireless services and a smartphone have effectively evolved into necessities over time near-term economic weakness isn't a concern for one of the nation's largest wireless service providers.

AT&T's core catalyst remains the rollout of 5G. Although upgrading its wireless infrastructure to support faster download speeds isn't cheap and won't happen overnight it's created an ideal scenario that'll see consumers and businesses upgrade their wireless devices and consume more data. Not surprisingly AT&T recognized its fastest wireless services revenue growth in more than a decade during the third quarter.

AT&T's balance sheet has also improved from the prior-year period. The spinoff of Time Warner in April and its subsequent merger with Discovery to create Warner Bros. Discovery led to the assumption of certain debt lots by the new company as well as cash payments to AT&T.

With a more flexible balance sheet AT&T's 6% yield looks especially sound.

7. AGNC Investment

Despite being disliked by Wall Street mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) AGNC Investment (AGNC 0.21%) is well positioned to make its shareholders richer in 2023. AGNC is one of Wall Street's highest-yielding stocks (13.7% yield) and has maintained a double-digit yield in 13 of the past 14 years.

Last year rapidly rising interest rates made short-term borrowing costlier for AGNC. Additionally the inversion of the interest rate yield curve hurt the company's net interest margin and book value.

But things could change in 2023 as the pace of interest rate hikes slows. A reversal of the yield-curve inversion can quickly right the ship for AGNC.

What's more all but $1.7 billion of AGNC Investment's $61.5 billion investment portfolio was tied up in agency assets at the end of September. An agency security is backed by the federal government in the event of default. This added protection on AGNC's portfolio allows it to prudently use leverage to magnify its profits and sustain its inflation-crushing distribution.

8. UnitedHealth Group

The eighth top stock that can make you richer in 2023 is health insurance and healthcare services juggernaut UnitedHealth Group (UNH 1.14%). Like NextEra UnitedHealth Group has produced only two negative total returns for its shareholders over the past 21 years.

As mentioned earlier insurance companies almost always possess excellent premium pricing power. While the Affordable Care Act did place some level of constraint on health insurers UnitedHealth hasn't had any trouble passing along higher premiums to its individual and corporate members.

The far bigger opportunity for UnitedHealth Group has been its healthcare services subsidiary Optum. This diverse segment which provides everything from healthcare software to prescription filling services has consistently grown at a faster pace than traditional health insurance and offers better operating margins. If a recession were to occur this year many of UnitedHealth Group's operating segments would be insulated.

9. Enterprise Products Partners

While it's no guarantee energy stocks deliver an encore performance this year oil and gas stock Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.59%) certainly has the ability to make its shareholders richer. Enterprise is doling out a 7.9% yield and has increased its base annual distribution in each of the past 24 years.

Whereas drilling and exploration stocks can be whipsawed by crude oil and natural gas spot price volatility Enterprise Products Partners avoids most of this instability. That's because it's a midstream energy company responsible for transporting storing and processing crude oil natural gas natural gas liquids and refined products. Because it signs long-term fixed-fee contracts that remove inflation from the equation Enterprise can accurately forecast its operating cash flow year in and year out.

A globally broken energy supply chain should also help Enterprise Products Partners. Russia's invasion of Ukraine coupled with reduced capital investment during the pandemic by major energy companies will make it incredibly difficult to quickly increase the global supply of oil and natural gas. If the price of these commodities remains elevated Enterprise shouldn't have any trouble landing new long-term contracts in 2023.

10. Berkshire Hathaway

Last but not least Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%) is a top stock that can make you richer in 2023. Buffett's company outperformed the S&P 500 by 23 percentage points last year.

While there is a long list of reasons for Warren Buffett's success as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway a lot of it can be explained by a clear-cut focus on cyclical stocks and dividend-paying companies. Buffett understands that recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle and trying to time these events isn't possible. Instead he's packed Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio with companies that'll thrive during long-winded periods of economic expansion.

The other key attribute is dividend income. Berkshire Hathaway is on track to collect more than $6 billion in payouts this year -- most of which will come from just a few holdings. Dividend stocks are typically profitable and have demonstrated an ability to handily outperform stocks that don't offer a dividend over long periods. Using time as an ally has long been one of Buffett's not-so-subtle secrets to success."

Yes that’s a reference to Peloton which we’ll get to momentarily.

On Dec. 30 Netflix announced that “Just before the new year Netflix members will be able to stream fitness content from Nike Training Club for the first time ever. Each Nike Training Club program has multiple episodes — a grand total of 30 hours of exercise sessions released in two batches.”

Nike’s news of the deal came 10 days earlier noting in a Dec. 21 press release that “Members will be able to access curated programs or select workouts by type or duration and the programming will be available in 10 languages via all Netflix plans. The new initiative will feature a custom Nike collection on Netflix.”

Members can simply search “Nike” on Netflix to bring up the catalog of workout routines.

For Netflix it’s a worthwhile gambit that some portion of the 223 million global paid subscribers who are deeply engaged in watching streaming TV will want to get off the couch and exercise increasing engagement with the platform while adding value to the subscription.

Nike Training Club (NTC) was the fitness brand’s first app launched in 2009 but the company stopped charging for access to the service in 2020 which some saw as a shrewd move.

Reuters reported in 2020 that “Between January and November [2020] the Nike Run Club app was downloaded 15.4 million times around the world up 45.3% versus the same period in 2019 according to data firm Sensor Tower.”

That same article added: “‘Early in the pandemic Nike made in-app workouts for its Nike Training Club app free. This was a masterstroke … They know everything – exactly what you’re searching where you live what your credit card details are how much you’re willing to pay’ said Michael Faherty a portfolio manager at Nike investor Seilern Investment Management.”

Exchanging subscription fees for user data Nike has reportedly used the insights to inform pricing strategies especially on its most expensive footwear.

Meanwhile Peloton — a pandemic darling whose share price increased 477% from its September 2019 IPO to a high of $167.42 in January 2021 — has lost about 95% of its value since and is currently trading in the range of $8 per share.

With its catalog of thousands of workouts — many of which do not require Peloton hardware to engage — it begs the question: how did Peloton miss a golden distribution opportunity like Netflix?

Streaming continues to be a leading connected economy activity thus offering a gaping doorway to consumer engagement. The PYMNTS Q3 report “How The World Does Digital: Different Paths To Digital Transformation” noted that “as in previous quarters video streaming captured more daily users than other digital activities we track at 35% followed by messaging at 29% social media browsing at 29% and streaming music at 26% which maintain their position as the top four.”

Too Little Too Late

In a classic case of too little too late Peloton announced the availability of its bikes treadmills and accessories on Amazon in August.

In a press release former Peloton Chief Commercial Officer Kevin Cornils said: “Expanding our distribution channels through Amazon is a natural extension of our business and an organic way to increase access to our brand. We want to meet consumers where they are and they are shopping on Amazon. Providing additional opportunities to expose people to Peloton is a clear next step.”

Not included in that deal however was Peloton programming on Amazon Prime Video which would make Peloton workouts available to the fitness-minded segment of Amazon Prime’s 200 million subscribers all of whom get Amazon Prime Video with their subscription.

While it remains to be seen how the Netflix-Nike deal will perform over time Peloton continues its slide from pandemic heights to new and nail-biting lows.

The Motley Fool reported on Tuesday (Jan. 3) “Peloton’s near-term outlook is grim. Inflation is curbing consumer demand for its pricey bikes and treadmills which start at $1445 and $3495 respectively and require monthly subscriptions. Rising interest rates will also make it tougher for Peloton to raise fresh cash while driving investors toward more profitable companies. In other words all the tailwinds that made Peloton such a compelling growth stock in 2020 and 2021 have been replaced by brutal headwinds.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvMDMvZGVpb24tc2FuZGVycy1jb2FjaC1wcmltZS1jdS1idWZmcy1uaWtlLXVuZGVyLWFybW91ci1jb250cmFjdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deion Sanders must wear Nike while coaching CU Buffs per approved contract,"Deion Sanders at least while representing CU football will wear Nike. For now.

Included in the five-year contract approved late last month by CU’s Board of Regents and provided to The Denver Post on Tuesday was a clause that requires the new Buffs coach who had a deal with competing apparel company Under Armour to wear Nike-branded Buffs products “as appropriate” in his new role as CU football coach.

Sanders and his son Shedeur a sophomore quarterback who recently transferred to CU from Jackson State both recently signed deals with Under Armour. The Buffs’ contract with Nike as noted in its agreement with Sanders expires on June 30 2025.

Coach Prime’s previous school Jackson State also had an apparel contract with Nike when the elder Sanders joined the program — before eventually switching to Under Armour.

While the details of the approved contract — a five-year deal worth up to $29.5 million before bonuses and incentives — largely match the framework outlined in CU’s initial terms sheet the agreement also gives the new Buffs football coach access to upgrades predecessor Karl Dorrell didn’t have at his disposal. Including a chance to hit something of a reset button after the 2025 season.

The contract features a clause that effectively opens a window for the renegotiation of salary and separation terms after the 2025 season which would be Sanders’ third.

In the paragraph CU and Sanders agree to “meet and confer in good faith” on a contract extension after Year 3 in which topics for discussion “must” include “base supplemental and incentive salary … liquidated damages … and termination without cause and obligation to mitigate.”

The contract approved by an 8-1 vote by the Regents this past Dec. 22 also provides Sanders a budget of $200000 annually to use on a private jet “for recruiting.”

Neither the re-negotiation window nor the private jet were present in the 2020 contract given to Sanders’ predecessor Dorrell who was let go by the university this past October after an 0-5 start to the season.

The agreement between CU and the 55-year-old Sanders also differs from Dorrell’s deal in terms of the reporting and approval of the coach’s outside benefits income promotions and endorsements. Sanders is represented by SMAC Entertainment a multimedia content company co-founded by ex-NFL great Michael Strahan and whose offerings include the documentary series “Coach Prime” which chronicled Sanders’ 2022 season at Jackson State and premiered on Amazon’s Prime streaming service on Dec. 29.

The new Buffs coach must provide athletic director Rick George and CU chancellor Phil DiStefano with a verbal notification of such outside benefits income promotions or endorsements by Sept. 1; Dorrell required written notice of said arrangements.

“During the term of this Agreement” the contract states “as long as the above-described existing sponsorship and endorsement deals are deemed not to conflict with University sponsorship/endorsement deals (Sanders) shall have the right to renew or extend the existing deals without restriction.”

Sanders is scheduled to earn $5.5 million in his first season with a base pay of $500000 supplemented by $1.75 million for radio television and public appearances; another $1.75 million for promotion and fundraising; and another $1.5 million for “development of the student-athlete.” That compensation would increase to $5.7 million in ’24 $5.9 million in ’25 $6.1 million in ’26 and $6.3 million in ‘27.

Sanders also received a $5 million salary pool for his assistants and any support staff.

Coach Prime would owe CU $15 million in liquidated damages if he leaves the school after the first year of his deal. Those damages drop to $10 million if it’s after his second year; $8 million after the third; and $5 million if after his fourth or final years.

If CU chooses to buy out Sanders’ contract prematurely it would owe him 75% of the remaining base and supplemental salary left on the duration of the agreement.

Sanders’ other incentives include:

• $750000 if CU wins the national championship;

• $450000 if CU is invited to a “New Year’s 6” bowl game;

• $150000 if CU wins six games in a season;

• $150000 if CU wins the Pac-12;

• $150000 if CU is invited to a non-“New Year’s 6” bowl game;

• $150000 if Sanders is named National Coach of the Year;

• $100000 for each additional win after six games;

• $75000 if CU plays in a Pac-12 Championship game;

• $75000 if Sanders is named Pac-12 Coach of the Year;

• $50000 each time CU attains a team APR of at least 965. In Year 1 that bonus is achieved if CU attains a team APR of at least 954."

Julian Sawyer has been confirmed as the new CEO.

For a year and a half Sawyer was CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BitStamp until May 9 2022. That followed a brief stint at Gemini Europe and a four-year term at UK challenger bank Starling where he was Chief Operating Officer.

Zodia described it as a planned succession with Sawyer’s experience designed to accelerate the firm’s path from startup to scale up.

UK-based Zodia Custody has Northern Trust as a minority partner that owns 5%. To date the two owners have funded the startup to the tune of $60 million. It received approval from the UK regulator the FCA in mid-2021.

In a December announcement Zodia Custody launched Interchange which offers an alternative to pre-funding and margin models on exchanges. Zodia Custody enables clients to keep assets using Interchange which can be mirrored on a cryptocurrency exchange but are protected in the case of an exchange bankruptcy.

There are two Zodia brands one for custody and the other is a crypto brokerage Zodia Markets through a partnership with Hong Kong exchange OSL.

In July Standard Chartered announced a partnership with Japan’s SBI to build a digital asset ecosystem involving SC Ventures. At the time SBI mentioned a digital asset custody joint venture between a ‘global UK enterprise’ and two SBI subsidiaries SBI Digital Assets Holdings and crypto exchange SBI VC Trade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0ZnN0cmVhbS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbnRhbS1zLXdvam5hci1ldXJvcGVhbi1pbnZlc3RvcnMtcmVtYWluLWF0LWZvcmVmcm9udC1vZi1zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1pbnZlc3RpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NTAM's Wojnar: European investors remain at forefront of sustainable investing,"European investors remain at the forefront of sustainable investing but their views on ESG continue to evolve Darek Wojnar head of funds and managed accounts for Northern Trust Asset Management (NTAM) said.

Speaking to ETF Stream Wojnar said investors in Europe are far more conscious of the risks associated with not investing sustainably than some of their global counterparts with many highlighting the tightly linked relationship between portfolio risks and ESG.

“From a European-centric view investors care not only about having well-constructed portfolios but they also care to understand any risks related to sustainability that might be embedded within” he said.

“We all have varying views on how much risk capacity a portfolio can take which is why some investors are more likely to accept certain risks related to environmental governance and social practices while others try to avoid them

“Many investors want to understand the risk implications of the environmental practices the companies they invest in adopt. European investors particularly institutional investors tend to be at the forefront of that concern.”

While European investors might be more sophisticated in their view on ESG a recent Morningstar survey found that asset owners still have a diverse range of approaches to the implementation of ESG within their portfolios.

When it comes to investors’ approaches to ESG 59% said they were considered only to the extent they were deemed financially relevant while 41% saw ESG considerations as a valid objective in their own right.

Just 11% of respondents were willing to sacrifice financial return to pursue ESG objectives.

Wojnar added “investors are continuing to evolve their views on ESG which are still heavily reliant on companies’ inconsistent ESG disclosures and a shifting regulatory environment.”

“Regulation is definitely shifting and can be viewed by some as prescriptive” he said. “While investors are still evolving their views our goal is to try and help them make the best decision out of the available information.”

Wojnar said NTAM leverages frameworks such as those developed by the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and Sustainable Accounting Standards Board to help s investors view sustainable investing through a “more comprehensive lens”.

Towards that end NTAM has developed the Northern Trust ESG Vector Score a measurement that assesses financially relevant ESG-related risks.

NTAM also offers several registered products incorporating sustainable elements including four ESG and climate ETFs in its FlexShares European-registered funds that target low volatility and high dividend-paying stocks across developed and emerging markets.

Measured growth

Alongside its sustainable offering the group also listed the $134.6m FlexShares Listed Private Equity UCITS ETF (FLPE) in December 2021 taking its ETF range to five since coming to market in March 2021.

Wojnar said the firm will continue to build on this offering in a “measured way” targeting fixed income and thematic products with a sustainable twist as deemed necessary.

“You will not see us flooding the marketplace with products but gradually we will expand over time leveraging our global platform and delivering it with a local focus on clients” he said. “If you look at our global platform NTAM has a unique offering of fixed-income capabilities which we are still yet to develop in EMEA. We also have thematic products that include global natural resources and sustainable infrastructure.”

Uncertainties around the current macro environment will also be key to how NTAM grows its ETF range going forward. The asset manager said it will also provide opportunities for investors.

“All of that uncertainty provides openings for investors to assess their strategic and tactical allocations” Wojnar said. “That creates an opportunity for asset managers too.”

He added both asset managers and investors are switching to the reality of the rising costs of running an “appropriately risk-managed business in a challenging asset environment”.

“Revenues for everyone in the industry seem to be somewhat lower” Wojnar said. “We always want to make sure that we can serve clients today but also make investments that will pay dividends five years from now.

“It is imperative that we take a longer-term view while also managing current uncertainties within the shifting market environment.”

That’s because Royal Caribbean’s Icon of the Seas won’t make its inaugural sailing from Miami until January 2024 even though the cruise line will take delivery of the behemoth before the end of the year.

That isn’t to say Florida will be completely lacking of new vessels in 2023 although several cruise lines will still be riding the highs of their 2022’s debut.

The crowds are still booking this past year’s new ships including first-in-class vessels from Disney Cruise Line with Disney Wish and Norwegian Cruise Line’s Norwegian Prima. Both will continue to sail from Port Canaveral in the new year along with the new ship and current title for world’s largest cruise ship Royal Caribbean’s Wonder of the Seas.

Meanwhile PortMiami still has Carnival Celebration MSC Seascape and Virgin Voyages’ Valiant Lady among new vessels and Port Everglades welcomed the Celebrity Beyond in November.

While the major cruise lines dial back the debuts Florida will see new classes of ships from both higher-end lines Oceania Cruises which has not had a new ship in more than a decade and Silversea Cruises.

A new luxury line called Explora Journeys the upscale offering from MSC Cruises will make its way to Miami. The state will also welcome the latest hardware from existing classes from both Celebrity with its fourth Edge-class ship and Regent Seven Seas Cruises with its third Explorer-class vessel.

In port news Disney Cruise Line is leaving behind Miami for new digs in Fort Lauderdale for its official second Florida home when it sends Disney Dream to Port Everglades beginning this fall.

Here’s a look at the new hardware arriving to the Sunshine State this year:

Oceania Vista: Food fans can rejoice as the mid-premium brand for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd is debuting its first new ship since 2012. The 67700-gross-ton 1200-guest ship will feature 12 dining venues so options will abound for foodies on board. They include new venue Ember with American dishes like braised short ribs on Polenta and grilled swordfish with asparagus. Another new offering is Aquamar Kitchen focusing on health-oriented guilt-free cuisine. Think organic and whole-grain.

With 800 staff there is a 1-to-1.5 crew-to-guest ratio. All accommodations feature a verandah and the three owners’ suites span the entire width of the ship all designed along with the top-of-the-ship library by Ralph Lauren Home. The ship also includes veranda staterooms for solo travelers. Standard staterooms are among the largest at sea coming in at 290 square feet.

The line often sails to a variety of destinations skipped over by major cruise lines often built around culinary adventures. And the ship will once again let cruisers learn new kitchen skills with The Culinary Center on board with chef-led classes.

Vista will debut in Europe in May before arriving to Miami in October sailing to Los Angeles and back before settling in for four months of round-trip Caribbean itineraries.

Silversea Silver Nova: Silversea Cruises which falls under the Royal Caribbean Group umbrella and caters to a luxury market will debut its 11th ship touted as a first-in-class asymmetrical design. That includes an outward-facing pool deck al fresco dining area and a sky bar with panoramic views from the aft of the ship.

The outdoor venues are an effort by the line to embrace cruisers’ ability to get panoramic views of its destinations. The pool deck includes an infinity-edge whirlpool. Dining options include The Marquee a 220-guest option adjacent the pool that combines two of the line’s existing venues The Grill and Spaccanapoli into one casual al fresco experience for lunch and dinner. Adjacent to that is the new Dusk Bar with 27-degree views from the ship’s stern.

The 54700-gross-ton vessel has a 728-passenger capacity based on double occupancy with all-verandah suites across 13 categories. It features eight dining venues overall including French option La Dame and sushi venue Kaiseki.

The line touts its fuel-cell technology so that the ship won’t have any emissions while in port. The ship which will debut in Europe in the summer doesn’t stay in one port long but will make its way and bump around the Caribbean in late 2023 before arriving to Port Everglades just after the new year in 2024.

Explora 1: Explora Journeys is a new foray of the MSC Group into luxury cruises with the first of six ships on order to debut this summer. The 63900-gross-ton ship has a 922-guest capacity based on double occupancy with 461 oceanfront suites penthouses and residences offering a 1-to-1.25 crew-to-guest ratio. It will feature six restaurants 12 bars and lounges as well as a chef’s kitchen.

Venues include Anthology which touts global guest chef specialties on the menu; Pan-Asian concept Sakura European steakhouse Marble & Co. Grill plus Mediterranean and French fare.

The beverage program promises hand-selected options including boutique fine wines direct from vineyards and exclusive blends for the ship’s mixologists and sommeliers plus cocktail-making masterclasses and meet-the-winemaker events.

In its first year in service Explora I will visit 132 ports in more than 40 countries including several embarkations from Miami from November-March 2024.

Celebrity Ascent is the fourth Edge-class vessel from Celebrity Cruises set to debut in 2023.

Celebrity Ascent: Following in the footsteps of Celebrity Edge Icon and Beyond the fourth ship in this class will once again call Port Everglades home when it arrives to sail alternating Eastern and Western Caribbean seven-night voyages beginning Dec. 3. Still under construction at the Chantiers de l’Atlantique shipyard in St. Nazaire France the 140600-gross-ton vessel will have a 3260-passenger capacity based on double occupancy. It will be about 60 feet longer than the original Celebrity Edge to allow for more space but will still feature the same unique features that set the class apart.

That includes the Magic Carpet the exterior elevator platform that performs multiple roles acting as an innovative way for passengers to disembark and reboard the ship when it tenders at ports of call but also doubling as an entertainment and dining venue. It will also feature the three-story venue called Eden at the aft of the ship that acts as lounge and avant-garde aerialist performance stage. The ship will also feature the Infinite Verandah staterooms in which the balcony is part of the cabin.

Unique dining and entertainment details have yet to be revealed.

Regent Seven Seas Grandeur: The luxury line of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. welcomes a sister ship to Seven Seas Explorer and Seven Seas Splendor.

Built at Fincantieri shipyards in Italy the 55254-gross-ton Explorer class ship is larger than the line’s oldest vessels. All three of the new sister ships have a 750-passenger capacity in 375 suites most of which boast what the line has called the largest balconies at sea. The ship also has more than 600 crew for a 1:1.38 passenger-to-crew ratio.

Seven Seas Grandeur will have some features that set it apart from its sister ships including the redesigned main dining space Compass Rose with a cascading waterfall sculpture with laser-cut metal and hand-blown glass at the entrance. Inside the dining space is a design with a canopy of interwoven crystal and wood-edge illuminated trees going for an enchanted forest feel.

Seven Seas Grandeur will sail out of Miami from December through March 2024 with a variety of itineraries. Fares include suite accommodations round-trip flights free and unlimited shore excursions unlimited internet prepaid gratuities ground transfers and other amenities.

Beyond Florida

Norwegian Viva the sister ship to Prima will make one seven-night sailing from Miami in December but will debut in the Mediterranean in May and then sail mostly from San Juan Puerto Rico from December into spring 2024.

MSC Cruises will be debuting a new massive class of ship called the MSC World Europa that will approach the behemoth size of Royal’s Oasis-class vessels and sail in the Mediterranean. A sister ship named MSC World America will eventually be deployed to Florida but not until 2025. At 205700 gross tons and 6762 maximum-passenger capacity it falls within striking distance of the Oasis-class ships.

Carnival Cruise Line is sending Carnival Jubilee a sister ship to Carnival Celebration and Mardi Gras to Galveston. It’s also rebranding the Costa Venezia that was originally to be deployed in China as Carnival Venezia which will sail from New York. Venezia and a second Costa ship to be rebranded in 2024 will feature an Italian theme for Carnival.

Virgin Voyages welcomes its third ship Resilient Lady which will sail the Mediterranean and then migrate to Australia.

One more year

Royal Caribbean’s Icon of the Seas is a new class that will dwarf the Oasis class of ships. The 20-deck ship will come in at 250800 gross tons and 1198 feet in length and the ability to carry as many as 7600 passengers about 600 more than Wonder of the Seas. While similar to their design neighborhoods will have their own look including an enclosed AquaTheater for the first time.

Princess Cruises is continuing work on its new class of vessel as well — the largest ever built for the fleet and first to run on liquefied natural gas similar to Carnival’s Mardi Gras. The ship will have a familiar name for the line Sun Princess but it won’t debut until spring 2024 in the Mediterranean and then make its way to Port Everglades for winter 2024.

Disney Cruise Line will continue work on Disney Wish’s sister ship in the Trident Class — Disney Treasure — which also won’t debut until 2024 but the line has yet to say from where it will first sail.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2NydWlzZS1saW5lcy1kaXNhZ3JlZS13aXRoLWN1YmEtanVkZ2VtZW50LWZyb20tZmxvcmlkYS1jb3VydC85MTg0NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise Lines Disagree With Cuba Judgement from Florida Court,"Both Carnival Corporation and Royal Caribbean have made it clear they will seek to appeal the decision from a Florida Judge to award the Havana Docks Corporation with four hundred and forty million dollars in damages.

U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom in Miami ruled that the use of the Havana Cruise Port Terminal constitutes trafficking in confiscated property owned by the plaintiff. This Delaware-registered company is owned by two individuals said to be direct descendants of the original owners of the docks in Havana Cuba. This decision follows her ruling in March on the same issue.

Royal Caribbean and Carnival Corporation Will Appeal

Carnival Corporation and Royal Caribbean have announced plans to appeal a Florida Judge’s decision to award the Havana Docks Corporation $440 million in damages.

Judge Beth Bloom in Miami ruled that the use of the Havana Cruise Port Terminal constituted trafficking in confiscated property belonging to the plaintiff a Delaware-registered company owned by two individuals who claim to be direct descendants of the original owners of the docks in Havana Cuba.

The court’s decision marks a significant victory for Cuban Americans seeking compensation for seizing their assets during the Cold War. The plaintiff was awarded a total of $109671180.90 in damages from Carnival Corporation and an additional $109848747.87 from Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Royal Caribbean Group and MSC Cruises.

In a statement to Reuters Royal Caribbean Group expressed its disagreement with the ruling. The company stated that it would be appealing the decision as well as Carnival Corporation which also “strongly disagreed” with the verdict and emphasized that it had engaged in “lawful travel.”

Meanwhile Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings declined to comment on the matter while MSC Cruises did not respond to a request for comment.

What Did The Cruise Companies do Wrong?

The lawsuit brought under the Helms-Burton Act allows U.S. nationals to sue over the use of property seized in Cuba after 1959. Havana Docks accused the cruise companies of using a confiscated dock in Cuba and collecting over $1.2 billion in revenue from their cruises without paying anything to Havana Docks or the Cuban people.

Roberto Martinez the attorney for Havana Docks commented on the ruling saying “This is a very important ruling by Judge Bloom. The commercial use of confiscated property in Cuba in violation of U.S. law carries clearly detailed and well-known and publicized legal consequences.”

Carnival Cruise Ship in Cuba

Under the rules and regulations that the Obama administration had set out the cruise lines were allowed to engage in people-to-people activities but not tourism-related activities.

In March the cruise lines stated their actions were entirely legal in Cuba and sanctioned under licenses issued by US government organizations. However Judge Bloom noted that cruise companies had simply interpreted the rules and regulations as they saw fit.

Micky Arison Chairman at Carnival Corporation knew already in 2019 that Carnival would be liable for damages as he said in a letter sent to then-President Trump:

“President Trump I wanted to follow up on our discussion regarding Cuba. The news is reporting that Title III of Helms-Burton the Cuba lawsuit ban will be fully lifted today. If there are no exceptions or clarifications we would be subject to significant legal liability for our use Of the Ports.”

“We do not own the ports or even manage them but because we use them we could be deemed as “trafficking” in confiscated property and the penalty to my company alone would be over $600 million.”

The statement from Micky Arison draws doubts on whether the penalties imposed by Judge Bloom will be withdrawn by any judge seeing as the cruise companies knew full well they were in the wrong."

While the Dow Jones Industrial Average performed stronger than the S&P 500 in 2022 it also closed the year in the red with a return of negative 6.9%. Meanwhile the smaller-cap-focused Russell 2000 finished the year with a total return of negative 20.4%.

2022 proved challenging for many U.S. companies as inflation soared peaking at 9.1% year over year in June and the Federal Reserve rapidly increased interest rates in an effort to combat high prices.

Sector performance

Despite the S&P 500 logging one of its worst years in recent history the energy sector performed well in 2022.

The S&P 500 Energy index generated a return of 65.7% during the year the highest of any sector by a significant margin.

The S&P 500 Utilities index was the only other sector to close 2022 with a positive return at 1.6%.

Largest gains drops in 2022

Energy-focused companies were the top-performing S&P 500 constituents in 2022. Occidental Petroleum Corp. generated the highest return for 2022 at 119.1%.

Constellation Energy Corp. and Hess Corp. followed with returns of 107.1% and 94.1% respectively.

Dating-service-oriented Match Group Inc. and Align Technology Inc. which sells Invisalign clear aligners and iTero intraoral scanners followed with returns of negative 68.6% and negative 67.9% respectively.

Semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices Inc. was the most-traded S&P 500 stock in 2022 with an average daily volume of over 91 million shares or roughly 5.7% of its common shares outstanding. Other highly traded stocks included airline companies American Airlines Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. as well as cruise-oriented Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. and Carnival Corp. & PLC.

December performance

In just December the top performers largely stemmed from the healthcare sector with Universal Health Services Inc. logging the highest return for the month at 7.7%. Organon & Co. and Align Technology Inc. placed second and third with returns of 7.3% and 7.2% respectively.

Electric car manufacturer Tesla Inc. saw the largest drop in December with a return of negative 36.7%.

We’re always sharing different ways to do that but I thought it would be useful to collate a list of all the different ways in which you can earn free miles. In addition to sharing ways to earn miles without flying this post also shares how to earn hotel points without staying.

Many of these you’ll likely be familiar with but I’d be willing to bet there are quite partnerships that hotel and airline loyalty programs have which have flown under the radar. That was certainly the case for me anyway. For example when doing research for this resource I discovered that you can redeem Safeway Just For U rewards for Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan miles even if you don’t live in Alaska. I hadn’t realized there are several energy companies offering bonus miles with airline programs nor that taking the Heathrow Express train into London can earn you Avios points. You can find details about all those partnerships – and more than 60 others – below.

If you’d like to continue learning how to earn miles without flying be sure to subscribe to our free daily email newsletter which will send you an update every morning with all the new information resources and deals that we share.

1) Signup Bonuses

This is one of the easiest ways to earn a substantial number of points. When applying for a new credit card you can often earn 50000+ miles or points in return for spending $xxxx within 3 months.

We maintain a list of the highest offers available on all credit cards on our Best Offers page.

2) Credit Card Spend

In addition to earning points and miles through signup bonuses you can earn miles and points through putting spend on those cards.

Most cards offer bonus categories of some kind (e.g. the Amex Gold card offers 4x Membership Rewards on grocery and restaurant spending) so those can help you rack up points even more quickly.

3) Shopping Portals

When buying items online you should always click through to a retailer from a shopping portal otherwise you’re leaving points miles or cashback on the table. The best way to compare rates across shopping portals is to use Cashback Monitor.

4) Shopping Portal Bonuses

Not only do shopping portals offer rewards as standard for your shopping but many airline shopping portals frequently offer bonus miles/points when hitting certain spending thresholds (e.g. Earn 2500 bonus miles when spending $500) or by installing their browser button (e.g. Install browser button & use it to spend $25 to earn 1000 bonus miles).

5) Card-Linked Portal Features



There are several shopping portals that in addition to their online offerings have a card-linked feature for in-store purchases. The way those work is that you link your payment card(s) on the portal’s website activate offers (where applicable) and then use your payment card(s) to pay for items. They’re usually only valid for in-store purchases but there are some occasional online options depending on the portal. Those payments are tracked by the portal and you earn points/miles accordingly.

One of the particularly useful features when it comes to the Alaska and United shopping portals is that in-store spending counts towards spending thresholds when those portals are offering bonus miles for spending $x amount.

Here are links to all of the portals offering card-linked features:

6) SimplyMiles

While the programs listed above are a hybrid of an online shopping portal with a card-linked feature there’s a different program called SimplyMiles which only has card-linked offers.

SimplyMiles earns American Airlines AAdvantage miles which can be redeemed for award flights as well as Loyalty Points towards American Airlines status. You can only enroll Mastercards with SimplyMiles – Visa American Express and Discover cards aren’t eligible – which limits the usefulness of the program to an extent. However you can stack SimplyMiles offers with Citi Offers and Chase Offers that are loaded to Mastercard credit cards.

Many SimplyMiles offers are valid for both online purchases as well as in-store so those can stack nicely with shopping portals.

7) Dining Programs

Most airline and hotel loyalty programs have a dining program run by Rewards Network. This is another card-linked offer program where you link payment card(s) and earn points/miles when using those cards to pay for meals at participating restaurants.

These programs normally offer bonus miles/points for your first transaction (often with the requirement that you spend $25+ and write a short review afterwards). You then earn an increasing number of points per dollar the more frequently you pay with a linked card.

Seeing as the dining programs are all run by Rewards Network you can only earn rewards with one program at a time. If you link a credit card with one program and then add it to another program it’ll be removed as a payment card from that initial program.

Here’s a list of all the different dining programs:

8) e-Rewards

e-Rewards is a company that offers points when you complete surveys. Those points can be redeemed for rewards including gift cards magazine subscriptions and more pertinently for this post points and miles for most major airlines and hotel loyalty programs.

e-Rewards doesn’t always accept proactive applications for their program so keep an eye on your emails because loyalty programs will sometimes send invitations to join e-Rewards which often include an opportunity to earn bonus miles/points after completing your first survey. If you join e-Rewards after receiving an invitation from an airline or hotel company you’re not stuck redeeming your survey rewards with them – you can still use your rewards for any redemption option.

9) MileagePlus X (MPX)

MileagePlus X (also known as MPX) is an app owned by United Airlines. It has a number of features including links to their shopping portal and dining programs. A unique feature of the app is that you can buy gift cards for a wide range of retailers and restaurants earning MileagePlus miles in return.

Another interesting element to their gift card-buying feature is that coding for the retailer/restaurant is often passed on. That means that if for example you buy a Domino’s gift card in the MPX app you can earn bonus points by paying with a card that earns more for dining purchases.

While it can be nice earning miles on these purchases you might do better buying gift cards at a discount elsewhere such as from grocery stores when they’re running promotions Raise etc. Using that Domino’s example at the time of creating this post MPX is offering 10x miles per dollar for Domino’s gift cards. However Domino’s gift cards are frequently available for 20% off (e.g. Raise Costco and more) so giving up a 20% discount to earn 10x means you’d effectively be buying MileagePlus miles for 2cpp (cents per point).

10) Car Rentals

Most airline and hotel loyalty programs have partnerships with car rental companies that offer bonus points/miles when renting a car.

11) Airbnb Stays

Airbnb sadly isn’t available on shopping portals but they do have a partnership with a few airline loyalty programs which allows you to earn bonus miles when making Airbnb reservations:

12) Airbnb Experiences

In addition to the ability to earn Avios points when booking Airbnb stays you can also earn Avios when booking Airbnb Experiences.

13) VRBO

Airbnb isn’t the only vacation rental company with whom you can earn airline miles. VRBO is another as they have a partnerships with United; they used to also have a partnership with British Airways but that appears to have ended.

14) Ticketmaster

If you ever buy concert tickets from Ticketmaster one option you have is to earn cashback by clicking through from a shopping portal. That includes Rakuten where you can earn American Express Membership Rewards instead of cashback which can in turn be transferred to select airline and hotel programs.

Although there aren’t any airline shopping portals that include Ticketmaster Delta has a separate partnership that allows you to earn SkyMiles when buying tickets on Ticketmaster.

15) Lyft

Lyft has partnerships with Alaska Airlines Delta and Hilton which allow you to earn miles or points on every ride with them. It’s sadly no longer possible to stack earnings so you have to pick one earning partner rather than being able to earn with all three.

16) Uber

If you prefer riding with Uber rather than Lyft you can earn Marriott Bonvoy points on every ride with Uber Premium rides in the US. That includes Uber XL Uber Black Uber SUV and Uber Comfort.

17) Uber Eats

That Marriott partnership extends to Uber Eats orders too. You can earn 2x points on all Uber Eats orders and 6x points on Uber Eats orders when staying at Marriott properties.

18) Grubhub

Uber Eats has Marriott while Grubhub has IHG – to an extent. You can earn IHG One Rewards points when ordering from Grubhub but sadly your earnings are limited to when you’re staying at IHG properties.

19) Rover

Rover is a site where you can book pet sitters dog walkers etc. There are often Amex Offers and Citi Offers that can save you money when paying for services on Rover plus SimplyMiles sometimes has a card-linked offer.

In addition to those savings and earning opportunities both American Airlines and Alaska Airlines have partnerships with Rover that earn you bonus miles when making bookings.

20) Shell Fuel Rewards

Fuel Rewards is Shell’s loyalty program which can provide savings when filling up with gas. As an alternative to getting savings on gas you can instead earn American Airlines AAdvantage miles and Loyalty Points when filling up.

21) Marathon/Arco

If you ever fill up with gas at Marathon and/or Arco gas stations be sure to register with their Make It Count Rewards loyalty program and link your account with either Southwest or Wyndham.

22) American Airlines / Hyatt

A few years ago American Airlines and Hyatt partnered with each other to offer reciprocal benefits and earning opportunities when linking your accounts.

On the earning side of things American Airlines AAdvantage members can earn miles and Loyalty Points when staying at Hyatt properties. World of Hyatt members with elite status can also earn bonus points when flying with American Airlines.

23) Marriott / Emirates

Similar to the American Airlines/Hyatt partnership Marriott and Emirates have teamed up to offer reciprocal earnings. Marriott Bonvoy members with Platinum Titanium or Ambassador status can earn bonus points when flying with Emirates while Emirates Skywards members with Silver Gold or Platinum status earn bonus miles when staying with Marriott.

24) Ordering Flowers

Flower delivery services are all available on shopping portals but many airline and hotel loyalty programs have additional partnerships with companies like 1-800 Flowers and FTD that can earn you even higher returns by using a specific promo code.

For example Southwest and Alaska Airlines partner with 1-800 Flowers United partners with 1-800 Flowers FTD and Teleflora Delta partners with FTD and Best Western partners with Teleflora.

25) Buy Points/Miles

Airline and hotel loyalty programs sell miles/points year-round usually via Points.com. Then every month or two they offer a discount or bonus when buying them which depending on the airline or hotel chain can represent good value. This can be useful for paying for flights/stays outright or to just top up your balances if you have a specific award redemption in mind.

26) Turo

At the start of 2022 Delta announced that it was partnering with Turo which allows you to earn SkyMiles. If you’re not familiar with Turo it’s like Airbnb for cars and has the potential to be a win-win for both sides. Car owners rent out their vehicles which earns them money and the renters get a rental car which can be cheaper than renting via traditional car rental companies.

Another benefit to Turo is that you know exactly what car you’re getting which is great if there’s a specific make and/or model you’re looking to rent.

When paying for Turo rentals keep an eye out for Amex Offers as they sometimes run deals like ‘Spend $150 on Turo & get $30 back’.

27) Viator

Viator is a site where you can book activities all around the world. It’s available on most shopping portals with rates often being as high as 12%-20%.

For occasions when portal rates aren’t as high there are a couple of other booking options that are worth being aware of. Wyndham has an activities and experiences section on their website where you can earn 10x Wyndham Rewards points when booking activities and that’s powered by Viator.

IHG has a similar feature giving 1000 bonus points when booking activities also powered by Viator. IHG can therefore be a good option when booking activities that are particularly cheap.

28) New Member Bonus

Loyalty programs often give bonus miles/points when joining their program for the first time. The bonuses aren’t particularly substantial but can provide a nice boost to your balance when you’re just starting out with a program. The bonuses are sometimes awarded just for registering while others award bonus miles/points on your first flight/stay.

Programs that sometimes or always offer these new member bonuses include Marriott Hilton Emirates Aegean IHG Choice Sonesta and more.

29) Transfer Bonuses

If you’ve earned miles without flying by collecting transferable points like American Express Membership Rewards Chase Ultimate Rewards Citi ThankYou points Capital One miles etc. you can sometimes boost those balances when transferring those points to travel partners thanks to occasional transfer bonuses.

These transferable currencies tend to offer 1-3 transfer bonuses each month rotating the eligible loyalty programs and percentage bonuses. You might see a 30% transfer bonus to Virgin Atlantic one month 40% to British Airways Avios the next 40% to Hilton and 25% to Avianca LifeMiles the following month etc. We always publish posts about new transfer bonuses plus you can always find a list of current transfer bonuses on this page.

30) Amex Offers

When logged in to your American Express account scroll down and you’ll see a section with many Amex Offers available. These are offers that can reward you in a couple of different ways when spending at participating retailers. One offer type is a statement credit (e.g. Spend $250 at Lowe’s & get $50 back) while the other awards bonus points for similar spending (e.g. Spend $250 at Lowe’s & get 5000 Membership Rewards). There are also sometimes big spending bonus opportunities available that are valid for spending anywhere (e.g. Spend $7500 & earn 15000 bonus points) that are separate to signup bonuses.

Most Amex Offers awarding large chunks of bonus points can be found on Membership Rewards-earning cards but you’ll sometimes find these earning opportunities on co-branded cards like Marriott Hilton and Delta.

31) Milestone Rewards

In recent years we’ve seen several hotel and airline loyalty programs introduce some form of Milestone Rewards – benefits perks and awards that you receive when earning enough elite night credits or status points.

In some cases – such as with Hilton Honors and IHG One Rewards – those rewards can only be earned when actually staying with them. However there are some exceptions where you can earn Milestone Rewards without flying or staying.

A primary example is Hyatt. They offer Milestone Rewards for every 10 elite night credits you earn starting from 20 nights. Those rewards include free night certificates bonus points a $100 gift card suite upgrade awards and more. While the most common way to earn those Milestone Rewards is to stay at Hyatt properties you can potentially earn all of those without ever stepping foot in a Hyatt property.

That’s thanks to the ability to earn elite night credits through putting spend on Hyatt credit cards. The personal World of Hyatt credit card offers 5 elite night credits as standard every year then 2 elite night credits for every $5000 spent on the card. The business version of the card meanwhile offers 5 elite night credits for every $10000 spent on the card.

The American Airlines AAdvantage program is also offering something similar with Loyalty Points. Different benefits can be earned at certain thresholds with bonus miles being an option for one of the higher tiers and the ability to earn those Loyalty Points through all kinds of non-flight activity.

Delta offers something similar with their Choice Benefits that can be earned through credit card spending.

32) Free Night Certificates

Numerous hotel credit cards offer some kind of free night certificate at renewal each year. Some can be used at any property others can be used at properties in certain categories while others can be redeemed for a night at a property costing up to a certain number of points with some of those allowing you to top them up with points for more expensive stays.

It’s sometimes possible to earn free night certificates when applying for a credit card too. One option that’s always available is the Hilton Aspire card which comes with a free night certificate valid at any property worldwide both at application and renewal. We also sometimes see Hyatt Marriott and IHG credit cards giving one or more free night certificates as part of their welcome offers.

33) Big Spend Bonuses

I already mentioned that some Milestone Rewards can be earned through putting a lot of spend on eligible credit cards. There are other big spend bonuses that can earn you rewards that aren’t specifically Milestone Rewards.

For example the Hilton Surpass Aspire and Business cards all offer the opportunity to earn a free night certificate when hitting certain spending thresholds on those cards. The IHG One Rewards Premier Business card offers a free night certificate with enough spend while the personal version of that card offers bonus points with enough spend.

34) Credit Card Referrals

Several banks offer rewards when referring friends and family to credit cards. This can earn you a substantial number of points/miles for even just one referral. For example American Express might offer you 30000 Membership Rewards when referring someone which is enough for a one-way business class ticket to Europe booked via Iberia when there’s an Avios transfer bonus from Amex. Chase meanwhile might offer 20000 Ultimate Rewards for referring somebody which is enough points for up to five free nights when transferred to Hyatt (off-peak category 1 award).

35) MyPoints Signup Bonus

The MyPoints shopping portal offers a range of bonuses when joining. One of those options is the ability to earn up to 1750 United MileagePlus miles – 250 miles just for signing up and then an additional 1500 miles when spending $50 via the portal in your first 30 days.

36) MyPoints Redemption

Although it’s primarily a shopping portal MyPoints offers other earning opportunities like receipt scanning survey completing game playing and more.

Those points can be redeemed in a number of ways. You can cash out via PayPal and redeem for Mastercard and third party gift cards (including Delta and American Airlines gift cards). Another option you have is that you can redeem MyPoints for United MileagePlus miles.

37) Instacart



There are a number of ways to save on Instacart orders from having Instacart+ (a benefit you can receive for free for a limited time via some credit cards and airline partnerships) to statement credits on Instacart purchases to discounted Instacart gift cards to shopping portal earnings and more.

In addition to all that Instacart has a partnership with Delta which offers bonus SkyMiles on all your purchases.

38) Starbucks

Delta has a number of partnerships with other companies we’ve already covered above from Airbnb to Ticketmaster to Lyft to Instacart. Another of their partners is Starbucks which began in 2022.

You can earn double Stars on days you fly with Delta and earn SkyMiles on all your Starbucks purchases after linking your accounts.

39) Rent

Although some landlords accept payment by credit card those that do usually charge a credit card fee that makes it not worth paying with a card unless you’re working on the minimum spend requirement of a new credit card’s welcome offer.

An exception is the Bilt credit card which allows you to pay your rent with no fee while simultaneously earning points that can be transferred to travel partners including Hyatt and American Airlines.

40) Bask Bank

Bask Bank has a savings account that doesn’t pay interest on your money. Instead you earn American Airlines AAdvantage miles.

Something important to note is that even though you often earn a corresponding number of Loyalty Points as miles with American Airlines retail partners that’s not the case with the Bask Bank Mileage Savings Account. You don’t earn any Loyalty Points at all with Bask Bank other than occasional promotions where they offer Loyalty Points as an incentive for opening an account.

41) Rocketmiles

Rocketmiles is a hotel-booking site that has among others more than 30 different travel partners. When booking a hotel stay you earn miles/points in your chosen program with Rocketmiles often running promotions giving 10000 bonus miles/points for your first reservation.

It’s worth noting that Rocketmiles works as an OTA (Online Travel Agency) which means that booking hotel stays through them won’t earn you points with the hotel’s loyalty program. It also means you won’t be eligible for status benefits receive elite night credits etc. so you’ll need to weigh up whether the bonus miles/points on offer are worth forgoing the benefits from booking directly with the hotel chain.

42) Bakkt

Bakkt is an app that can help you manage crypto and loyalty programs. While I don’t find any use for it I do have an account with them because in the past they’ve offered – and continue to offer – promotions for linking your Choice Privileges and Wyndham Rewards accounts.

43) Rocket Mortgage

Are you applying for a new mortgage or refinancing? The most important thing is to get the best rate when including fees. If Rocket Mortgage happens to be your best option or close to it you can earn bonus United miles or Spirit points.

44) Guaranteed Rate

In addition to partnering with Rocket Mortgage United also has a relationship with Guaranteed Rate that offers bonus United miles when applying for a new mortgage or refinancing.

45) Carrs/Safeway

Carrs and Safeway are two grocery store chains owned by Albertsons which use the Just For U program. Members of Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan can link their accounts in order to redeem Just For U Rewards for Mileage Plan miles rather than for savings on gas or groceries.

This is meant to be for people who shop at Carrs and Safeway stores in Alaska but it’s available for anyone. See this guide for more details about how to convert your Just For U Rewards to Alaska miles.

46) Citi Checking Accounts



Citi sometimes offers customers the ability to earn bonus American Airlines AAdvantage miles when opening a checking account and completing required activities.

This can be a great way to earn a large chunk of AA miles but be aware that with these checking bonuses you’ll receive a 1099 which you don’t get with credit card welcome offers.

47) Villas of Distinction

United has a partnership with Villas of Distinction which awards 3 miles per dollar spent on stays.

48) Cruises

Many airlines and hotel programs have a white-labeled portal where you can book cruises and earn miles/points. As always with these kinds of things it’s worth comparing prices with other travel sites as you might be able to get the same cruise at a cheaper price elsewhere while also earning cashback/rewards via a shopping portal.

Here’s a list of the various different airline and hotel cruise sites:

49) Norton LifeLock

United partners with Norton LifeLock to offer bonus miles when signing up for their service. The return isn’t great though compared to other options. For example Rakuten frequently offers 90% cashback or 90x Membership Rewards for LifeLock so that’s a significantly better deal. You can check current LifeLock shopping portal rates here.

50) Jaguar

United has a number of unique partnerships one of which is the ability to earn bonus MileagePlus miles when buying or leasing a car from Jaguar.

51) Energy Companies



Several airlines partner with energy companies around the country to offer bonus miles when switching to their energy company. While the bonus mile offers might be enticing be sure to do the math to make sure you’re not paying for those extra miles in the form of higher energy rates.

Here are the different options you have:

52) Surveys

I mentioned e-Rewards earlier which is a company for whom you can complete surveys and earn points that can be converted to miles and points for many airline and hotel loyalty programs.

There are also numerous white-labeled survey programs where you can earn miles or points with individual loyalty programs. Here’s a list of all of them:

53) Stand Up To Cancer

If you’d like to donate to Stand Up To Cancer American Airlines is offering an incentive of 10x Advantage miles when donating $25+.

54) Vinesse Wine

There are many wine delivery companies out there many of which appear on shopping portals. In addition to appearing on portals Vinesse has a number of individual partnerships with airlines and hotel chains outside of their portals.

55) Laithwaites Wine

Vinesse isn’t the only wine company that partners with airlines. Laithwaites has a similar setup with both Alaska Airlines and Southwest. As with Vinesse compare the bonuses offered below with those offered via shopping portals.

56) GCI (TV phone internet etc.)

GCI is a communications company serving residents of Alaska. They have a partnership with Alaska Airlines which offers bonus Mileage Plan miles for every dollar you spend on their services.

At the time of publishing this you can also earn 5000 bonus miles when referring friends and family to GCI.

57) GetYourGuide

GetYourGuide is a site that seems to be similar to Viator where you can book activities around the world with a focus being placed on tours. They have a landing page for a partnership with Alaska Airlines which gives bonus miles when booking tours.

GetYourGuide does appear on a few shopping portals so be sure to compare rates to ensure you’re getting the best return. Also keep an eye on your Amex Offers because there was recently an offer giving a discount or statement credit on GetYourGuide bookings although I don’t know if that was stackable with this Alaska partnership or shopping portal earnings.

58) SoFi Loans



Do you need to take out a student loan or refinance an existing one? Finding the best rate is the most important factor but if SoFi happens to offer a competitive rate then take advantage of the fact that you can earn 1 Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan mile for every $2 of your funded loan amount.

59) Harry & David

Here’s another individual partnership where you might get a better deal via a shopping portal although that depends on how much you’re spending.

When ordering from Harry & David shopping portals tend to offer cashback miles or points based on how much you spend (e.g. 3x 5% etc.). Southwest’s partnership works differently by offering 1000 bonus Rapid Rewards points on every order when using a promo code. For cheaper orders getting a lump sum of 1000 bonus points works out to be a better return; for more expensive orders you might do better clicking through from a shopping portal.

60) Home Chef

The individual partnerships versus portal options continue. Home Chef appears on quite a few shopping portals but a few airlines and hotel programs offer bonus miles or points by shopping via dedicated landing pages.

These can stack with Amex Offers and Chase Offers for Home Chef as well as discounted Home Chef gift cards.

61) Emergency Assistance Plus



Emergency Assistance Plus is a company that offers plans covering emergency medical evacuation among other services. They partner with a couple of airlines giving bonus points when enrolling then more bonus points at renewal.

The great thing about this service is that there are a couple of potential stacking elements although both are targeted. There’s sometimes an Emergency Assistance Plus Citi Offer giving a $65 statement credit back when spending $179+ while there’s also sometimes a SimplyMiles card-linked offer giving 1200 bonus Advantage miles when spending $169+.

n.b. The landing pages for these offers don’t display the bonus points on offer very clearly. There are a number of scrolling images at the top of the page; one of those images shows how many bonus points you’ll earn.

62) ParkVia Airport Parking

This might have limited appeal as the US-based options I looked at had no availability but ParkVia offers British Airways Avios when booking airport parking or airport hotel parking options around the world.

63) Heathrow Express

The Heathrow Express is arguably the best way to get from Heathrow Airport into the center of London. I’ve never actually taken this train myself because when flying back to the UK we either rent a car or my parents pick me up as they live relatively close by. However we met up with friends in London this past summer and they took the Heathrow Express with their two teen children. It was reasonably priced quick and gets you to London Paddington which then offers good connections to where you might need to get to next.

British Airways offers 5 Avios per £ when buying Heathrow Express tickets so that’s a way to get rewarded when purchasing them. As the British grocery store Tesco would say every little helps.

64) Do Good Points

Sun Country is based in Minnesota and they offer 250 points when making your first donation through Do Good Points.

65) Open Table



If you ever use Open Table to make restaurant reservations you might as well do that via IHG’s website in order to earn up to 500 IHG One Rewards points.

66) Meetings Events Weddings etc.

Most hotel chains offer bonus points to meeting planners event organizers wedding planners etc. when booking meeting rooms at their hotels and/or rooms for attendees. Here are links to what’s offered by the different programs; I’ve included what the earnings are at the time of publishing this post but be sure to check the pages linked to below in case those earning rates change over time or if the hotel chains run promotions offering bonus points:

Hyatt – 1x per dollar + ability to earn status with enough qualifying meetings/events

Marriott – 2x per dollar + 1 elite night credit for every 20 rooms booked

Hilton – 1x per dollar

IHG – 3x per dollar

Wyndham – 1x per dollar

Choice – 3x per dollar

Radisson – 5x per dollar

Best Western – 2x per dollar

Sonesta – Earning rate unknown

Accor – 2x per Euro

67) FIND Experiences

Suspended for a couple of years due to the pandemic Hyatt’s FIND Experiences have since made a return. You can pay for FIND Experiences with either cash or World of Hyatt points; if paying for them with cash you’ll earn 10x points per dollar as well as tier bonuses if you have status with Hyatt.

68) Lindblad Expeditions

A few years ago Hyatt partnered with Lindblad Expeditions which runs luxury cruises around the world including Antarctica the Amazon Galapagos and more. Their cruises can be pricey so if you plan on booking with them it’d be worth doing so via their partnership with Hyatt. That way you can earn 5x points per dollar elite night credits and a $250 onboard credit.

69) Better Mortgage

American Express has a partnership with Better Mortgage that can get you statement credits worth thousands of dollars when taking out a mortgage. As with other mortgage options you’ll want to ensure you get the best rate otherwise the extra amount you pay might exceed the statement credits you earn.

Thanks to Dina in the comments below for this suggestion.

70) RBN (Home Buying)

If everything goes well this looks like it’s a great way to rack up points. When buying or selling a home you can use RBN as your agent and earn American Express Membership Rewards. You earn 1 Membership Rewards point per dollar on both purchase and selling transactions. For example if you use RBN as your agent when buying a $250000 house you’ll earn 250000 Membership Rewards.

Thanks to Lee in the comments for sharing this option although they do note that their friend used RBN and it didn’t work out so buyer (or seller) beware.

71) Audience Rewards

Audience Rewards is the Official Rewards Program of Broadway and the Arts. Their partnership with United enables you to earn bonus MileagePlus miles when booking theatre tickets to shows on Broadway.

72) 12Status

Residents of Washington State can register for free on 12Status.com. You’ll then earn 1 Delta SkyMile for every passing yard the Seahawks make during both the regular and post season. You’ll also get Main Cabin 1 boarding status from the start to the end of the Seahawks season.

Thanks to J S for the reminder about this opportunity.

73) Amazon

OK so this entry can only be done while flying but I feel it counts anyway as the points you earn aren’t as a result of flying itself.

When flying on JetBlue you can earn 3x JetBlue points for every dollar spent at Amazon. You have to connect to Fly-Fi using your TrueBlue account login details and click on the Amazon banner ad to start shopping.

Thanks to EW for the reminder about this partnership.

Your Suggestions

Those are 65+ ways to earn miles without flying but I’m sure there are even more earning opportunities out there not listed here. Do you know of any? If so we’d love to hear them in the comments below.",,,,,,

Nucor Steel Brandenburg will focus on the final commissioning of the mill in the first quarter of 2023 and will ship the first tons to customers during the quarter.

“Congratulations to our more than 400 teammates for achieving this important milestone and executing one of the safest mill start-ups in Nucor history while also delivering the project on time and on budget” said Leon Topalian Chair President and Chief Executive Officer of Nucor Corporation. “We look forward to supplying the highest quality steel and the most sustainable plate products in the world for our nation’s military infrastructure heavy equipment offshore wind and other markets.”

Nucor Steel Brandenburg will be among only a few mills globally – and the only mill in the United States – capable of manufacturing the heavy gauge plate used in monopile foundations for offshore wind towers at scale. As a result it will be a critical part of the supply chain for the continued development of our nation’s offshore wind power infrastructure. The recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act which included $300 billion for clean energy development and climate programs supports the Biden Administration’s announced goal to build 30 gigawatts offshore wind power by 2030. This could result in approximately 7.5 million tons of additional steel demand.

The Nucor Steel Brandenburg plate mill is a $1.7 billion capital investment in specialized capabilities that can produce 1.2 million tons annually. The new mill is located in the middle of the largest steel plate-consuming region in the country and will be able to produce 97% of plate products consumed domestically. It is also the first steel mill in the world to pursue certification under LEED v4 (“Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design”) which is more stringent than previous LEED rating systems and provides a globally recognized framework for sustainability achievement.

“We would like to thank the Governor’s Office officials with the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development and local officials in Brandenburg and Meade County for their incredible support of this project from start to finish” said Johnny Jacobs Vice President and General Manager of Nucor Steel Brandenburg. “We are proud to bring high-quality manufacturing jobs to the Commonwealth of Kentucky and look forward to being part of the Brandenburg community for many decades.”

The GeForce NOW Ultimate membership raises the bar on cloud gaming bringing it closer than ever to a local gaming experience. With GeForce RTX 4080 performance Ultimate members will be the first to experience true PC gaming — streaming at up to 240 frames per second from the cloud with full ray tracing and DLSS 3  in hit games like Portal With RTX. With the addition of NVIDIA Reflex  GeForce NOW achieves click-to-pixel latency below 40 milliseconds — another first in cloud gaming.

“NVIDIA’s Ada architecture is a big leap in graphics quality and through GeForce NOW we’re streaming an RTX 4080 experience to more devices and more gamers than ever” said Jeff Fisher senior vice president of GeForce at NVIDIA. “GeForce NOW Ultimate members will have the technology and the performance to experience even the most demanding games in their full ray-traced glory.”

Current GeForce NOW RTX 3080 members will be upgraded immediately to Ultimate memberships and be among the first to experience the full benefits of GeForce RTX 4080 performance in the cloud when the servers start rolling out later this month.

RTX Technologies to the Cloud

NVIDIA RTX technologies introduced with the Ultimate membership are lifting cloud gaming to new heights. NVIDIA Reflex 240-fps mode brings frame-pacing technology to the cloud which helps streamline the execution of game simulation rendering and encoding on the server. When paired with an NVIDIA G-SYNC® monitor GeForce NOW will vary the streaming rate to the client for the first time delivering smooth and instantaneous frame updates to client screens on Reflex-enabled games — further driving down total latency.

Next-generation RTX technologies coming to GeForce NOW include full ray tracing and DLSS 3 — introduced with the GeForce RTX 40 Series launch. They deliver beautiful cinematic-quality graphics and use AI to keep frame rates smooth.

The Ultimate Benefits

GeForce NOW Ultimate members are set to receive three major streaming upgrades. The new SuperPODs are capable of rendering and streaming at up to 240 fps. Paired with NVIDIA Reflex members’ game play will feel as if it is on a desktop PC.

4K gaming goes from fast to beyond fast with an upgrade from 60 fps to 120 fps while ultrawide monitors will be supported for the first time at up to 3840 x 1600 resolution including many popular variants such as 3440 x 1440 and 2560 x 1080.

Ultimate members can enjoy longer streaming sessions fastest access to the highest-performance cloud gaming servers and game settings that persist from session to session.

It’s Time to Play the Game

GeForce NOW recently eclipsed the 1500 game milestone — with mega-hits from top publishers like Electronic Arts and Ubisoft popular PC indie titles like Valheim and Rust and over 100 of the biggest free-to-play games like Fortnite and Genshin Impact. New games are released every GFN Thursday  and new features like Ubisoft account syncing bring members into their games instantly. Games are available from the biggest PC game stores including Steam Epic Ubisoft and Electronic Arts.

Members will be able to stream some of the biggest upcoming PC game launches on the service starting with Portal With RTX later this week. Relive the critically acclaimed and award-winning Portal reimagined with full ray tracing and higher frame rates with DLSS 3 streaming from the cloud.

Ultimate members will see performance multiply with DLSS 3 for Atomic Heart from Mundfish and Focus Entertainment. FNTASTIC and MyTona’s The Day Before launches later this year accelerated by DLSS 3 and with a detailed world enhanced with ray-traced reflections. Stream with or against friends with the realistic physics engine in Party Animals from Recreate Games and Source Technology.

The GeForce NOW catalog features many of the most popular PC games including recent day-and-date releases of Marvel’s Midnight Suns Warhammer 40000: Darktide and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Next-Gen Update as well as massive free-to-play titles like Destiny 2 Lost Ark and Apex Legends.

Rumors have been pretty accurate to date with the releases of the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 in October and November 2022 respectively while the RTX 4070 Ti was announced and launched in January this year at CES 2023.

The next generation is codenamed 'Lovelace' after British mathematician Ada Lovelace (who is considered to be the first computer programmer) but they're better known as the GeForce RTX 40 series.

With the Nvidia hack earlier this year we had more leaks and rumors than we anticipated so we had a pretty good idea of what to expect from Nvidia's Ada architecture and when to expect it. Now three of the desktop cards are on sale with five mobile GPUs coming to gaming laptops in 2023.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 4000 Lovelace: Cut to the chase

What is it? Nvidia's next-generation GPU architecture

Nvidia's next-generation GPU architecture When will it be available? RTX 4090 4080 and 4070 Ti are all available now more to come

RTX 4090 4080 and 4070 Ti are all available now more to come What will it cost? The RTX 4090 is priced at $1599 the RTX 4080 at $1199 and the RTX 4070 Ti at $799

The release date for Lovelace has been and gone with the RTX 4090 launching first in October 2022. The RTX 4080 followed shortly after in November after the awkward cancelation of the RTX 4080 12GB model - as of January 5 this has now been rebranded and relaunched (with a small price cut) as the RTX 4070 Ti.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 4000 Lovelace: price

An alleged image of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Ti (Image credit: Nvidia)

We now have official pricing for the RTX 4090 as well as the 4080 and 4070 Ti. The 4090 has an MSRP of $1599 (around £1400 / AU$2400) for its 24GB GDDR6X.

Meanwhile the GeForce RTX 4080 was supposed to have two models a 12GB version and the 16GB version. The former would have had an MSRP of $899 (£849 / AU$1340) but it was 'unlaunched' and rebranded to the $799 RTX 4070 Ti. Meanwhile the actual RTX 4080 is priced at $1199 (around £1050 / AU$1790). It seems that rumors thinking these chips would be even pricier than the previous gen chips were right on the money.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 officially has an MSRP of $699 (£649 about AU$975) while the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 officially comes in at just $499 (£469 about AU$680). The flagship of the family at that time before the RTX 3090 Ti was introduced the RTX 3090 was priced at $1499 (£1399 AU$2100).

The chip shortage unfortunately ensured many of these GPUs were artificially inflated so many of us were unable to purchase a card at this price unless you were lucky enough to nab a founders edition directly from Nvidia at launch.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 4000 Lovelace: specifications

People in line to buy the RTX 3080 Ti in New York City (Image credit: Nvidia)

It's been confirmed by the Nvidia event that the Lovelace series uses 76 billion transistors as well as the new 5nm production process. It's also using next-generation Ray Tracing cores an updated version of a feature that has been present on all RTX-branded GPUs from Nvidia.

We also found out that they'll be using Shader Execution Reordering (SER) which makes native ray tracing possible without DLSS. Thanks to new frame-generation technology there's a massive increase in framerate with DLSS 3 over native rendering so DLSS will be even more impressive in its third-generation iteration.

We won't dig too deep into the specs of the individual cards here but we will advise that you'll likely need to upgrade your power supply if you're planning to get either the RTX 4090 or 4080 - both are power-hungry cards.

Although Nvidia confirmed multiple laptop GPUs for release in 2023 - the RTX 4090 and 4080 mobile along with compact Max-Q variants of the RTX 4070 4060 and 4050 - we still don't have any news on more affordable desktop cards. The RTX 4060 Ti (if such a thing exists) will probably be the best mainstream GPU of this generation so keep your eyes peeled for a reveal further down the line."

The projects are in every stage of completion at this point. Dollar General has submitted plans but has not begun to build on a lot near O’Reilly Auto Parts on Riverside Avenue South. Chipotle opened in December as did T-Mobile. Starbucks’ newest location still has to pass state inspection.

Some of the developments are larger than a café or restaurant. Solutions Behavioral Healthcare is expected to finish a 12000-square-foot facility this year. Prominent local businesses are also included like Scooter’s Coffee and K Power Yoga.

Sartell administration says that is just the tip of the iceberg. The former paper mill site will soon be closed on by a developer. It was expected on November 30th 2022 but now should occur in the first half of this month.

Sartell says Stearns has committed to turning County Road 133 into a through road. There are still several options on the table that will be examined further.

The procedure was the removal of a patient’s gallbladder and gallstones known as a cholecystectomy.

“The procedure was difficult but I was able to do it safely and efficiently in about 15 minutes without any complications” Dr. Jandali reported following the surgery.

Dr. Jandali is a Froedtert South general surgeon who has been performing surgical procedures with the assistance of da Vinci robots since 2015.

Earlier this autumn he had reached the benchmark of 2700 surgical procedures with the robots.

Most of Dr. Jandali’s surgeries are to the abdominal cavity for hernia repair colon cancer or polyps rectal cancer and gall bladder surgeries. “I also perform many bariatric surgeries to reduce the size of a patient’s stomach promoting weight loss” he said.

Although the robotic platform has not changed much in the past few years use of the technology has increased as surgeons have mastered it says Dr. Jandali.

Today “all minimally invasive general surgery at Froedtert South is done utilizing the robotic platform” Dr. Jandali said. “The staff is well trained and we can use it 24/7 including weekends nights and holidays.”

Dr. Jandali’s success with surgical robotic technology has convinced him the surgical robot is an integral tool of the surgical trade. “I consistently see the tremendous benefits of robotic assisted surgery for my patients” he said.

The advantages of the technology include the ability of a surgeon to address more complex medical procedures and for patients to experience reduced pain following surgery he notes.

Dr. Jandali’s achievement of his 3000th robotically assisted surgery was marked with a cake presented by Alex Wantoch a representative of Intuitive the manufacturer of the da Vinci robot used in these procedures.

According to Wantoch there are fewer than 50 surgeons nationwide that have performed this number of robotic surgeries.

“Dr. Jandali performs more cases in one month than most surgeons achieve in five or six months” Wantoch said.

To achieve these numbers within this timeframe means that Dr. Jandali’s caseload is much higher than many other surgeons noted a Froedtert South administrator.

“Reaching the 3000th robotic procedure makes me very happy that I was able to introduce and implement the state-of-the-art surgical care for my patients and our community” he said.

Froedtert South has been committed to robotic assisted surgery for over a decade. It is one of just five surgical centers in Wisconsin with three or more surgical robots. The robotic assisted surgical center is also one of 30 nationwide that brings general surgeons from across the country to observe Froedtert South surgeons perform robotic assisted surgeries.

“I am among the 25 busiest robotic assisted general surgeons in the country using the state of-the-art da Vinci Xi surgical robots” notes Dr. Jandali. “The commitment of administration and operating room staff as well as my belief in using technology as a way of improving surgical outcomes is the reason for the high volume I do at Froedtert South.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmMxNS5jb20vdHJhZmZpYy9kcml2ZXItcnVucy1mcm9tLXNjZW5lLWFmdGVyLWhpdHRpbmctbW90b3JjeWNsaXN0LW5lYXItMzV0aC1hdmVudWUtYW5kLWJldGhhbnktaG9tZS1yb2FkLXBvbGljZS1zYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PHX PD looking for driver who ran from crash scene after hitting motorcyclist,"PHOENIX — A motorcyclist is in critical condition after a hit-and-run crash near 35th Avenue and Bethany Home Road Wednesday morning.

The incident occurred between a passenger car and motorcycle at the intersection around 3 a.m. Phoenix police say.

The driver reportedly got out of the car after the crash and ran from the scene.

The motorcyclist suffered critical injuries and was taken to the hospital for treatment.

Police say they are still looking for the driver who left the scene. Officials did not provide a suspect description.

“I feel bad for the gentleman that got hurt” said employee Katrina Mooney while working the counter at the Circle K gas station located at the intersection.

It’s a tragic scene she has seen play out before.

“There’s lots of accidents out here. I’ve seen people die out here. It’s not a good intersection at all” Mooney said.

Police say the driver of the car involved abandoned the vehicle and ran from the scene before police arrived.

“I saw the aftermath of it when I got into work” said Take 5 Oil Change worker Joseph Petrelli

Petrelli says he sees a lot of crashes at the intersection but this one was particularly bad especially upon hearing it was a hit-and-run.

“One of the officers told me the dude took off running. He was probably drunk” Petrelli speculated.

According to the Maricopa Association of Governments 35th Avenue and Bethany Home Road ranks 14th on the list of most dangerous intersections in the county.

“The intersection is pretty bad. You see an accident probably twice a month. It’s pretty bad” said Francisco Mojica Manager at the O’Reilly Auto Parts store.

Blake Gonzalez was one of 19 women recognized “who have been successful in their businesses and careers contribute to the community and serve as an example to others” the publication wrote. “Our hope is this recognition will spur them on to even greater things.”

Blake Gonzalez oversees day-to-day operations at the Dragas Center including business operations new project development personnel management and graduate student support.

“I wear as many hats as necessary to get the job done” she told Inside Business.

She has been a contributing author to the center’s highly regarded State of the Region and State of the Commonwealth reports since 2015. Her research interests include the economics of social issues (including the economics of opioids) the women’s leadership gap and the future of higher education.

She has also been active in the community serving in volunteer roles with the Norfolk Tourism Foundation ForKids Inc. LEAD Hampton Roads Norfolk Public Schools the Girl Scouts of the Colonial Coast Council and local “Shark Tank” pitch and grant competitions.

When asked by Inside Business what gets under her skin Blake Gonzalez replied: “The lack of gender diversity in the C-suite.”

In that vein ODU News asked Blake Gonzalez several questions about the state of today’s workplace especially for women.

ODU News: What do you wish you had known when you entered the business world?

Blake Gonzalez: I didn’t see women in leadership roles when I started out as a first-generation college student. Most of the faculty in my undergraduate business college were men and I didn’t have a lot of role models. Early in my career I wish I would have had someone to remind me that I wasn’t one of the few women at the table due to chance or luck – I was there because I was qualified (and) an asset to the organization – and that diverse employees enrich the value of the company. This is the message that I share with women in Hampton Roads especially those who are also the first in their families to attend college. Through my participation in ODU’s F1rst-gen Mentoring program I explain the business case for diversity. Several large studies assert gender-diverse businesses are more profitable. Women belong!

ODU News: In the 2019 State of the Region report you talked about the women’s leadership gap in Hampton Roads. Has there been any progress in this area and if not what steps should be taken?

Blake Gonzalez: COVID-19 changed everything didn’t it? Before the pandemic awareness of the women's wage and leadership gap was improving and leading to real discussions about ""pink collar"" employment and the lack of women in top leadership positions. However the impact of COVID-19 was truly a devastating blow to the women who are overrepresented in the service industry and caretaking occupations.

Many women are caregivers of children and/or parents. Working the first and second shift (the job for income and the custodial job at home) is an overwhelming burden. Child/elder care assistance and flexible schedules combined with pay parity continue to be the big asks here and around the nation.

ODU News: If you could draw attention to one area of your research what would that be?

Blake Gonzalez: The lack of awareness and discussion surrounding opioids in the workforce is a real need in our community. While researchers health professionals and policy makers search for answers to combat the scourge of opioids I believe dedicated campaigns at the national state and regional levels to educate and destigmatize addiction are needed to win the battle. The fact is anyone regardless of race gender or socioeconomic status could become addicted to opioids. Employees are desperately worried about being terminated if their dependency were made public. Families speak in whispers if a loved one overdoses. Not only is it a horrible way to live but the costs to individuals families and our communities are outrageous. Commonwealth estimates released this year put the total costs of the opioid burden in Virginia at $3.5 billion in 2020.

ODU News: What questions are you being asked most often about women in the workplace and what questions should be asked?

Blake Gonzalez: People are quick to ask “Why aren’t women advancing as rapidly as men in the workplace?” Notice how this question is framed. It’s vague and it doesn’t lead anyone to the everyday or systemic issues that cause the problem in the first place. A more productive question to ask is “What can we do to help women advance as quickly as men in the workplace?” It lends itself to collective responsibility. When someone reads an article about professional women they should be thinking about it personally. The professional women in the workplace are your friends your mentors your sisters your mothers. If these women are exiting the workforce because of low wages and/or few advancement opportunities it should be a concern for us all. Everyone should have an investment in making life better for the people around them.

Old Dominion find a happy place to visit again and again in their newly released song “Memory Lane.” It’s the CMA-winning country group’s latest single and first release since their August collaboration with Kenny Chesney on “Beer With My Friends.”

As its title suggests “Memory Lane” is heavy on nostalgia but the kind that’s tinged with sadness. The shuffling beat and acoustic guitar propel the tune along at a nice clip while singer Matthew Ramsey drifts back to a better day with someone he loved. “Thinkin’ bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights/Those tangled up mornings lost in paradise” he sings as the music rushes forward with an EDM-style build. Instead of a big bass drop it retreats to a quiet-but-quick pattern that matches the song’s mood.

“Sometimes when I’m feeling overwhelmed or missing someone or maybe just feel a little nostalgic there are places in my mind I can go that are full of memories of simpler times. It’s a location or a person or a feeling that will always live in my memories and I can close my eyes and transport myself there anytime I want and experience it all again” said Ramsey who wrote the song with bandmates Trevor Rosen and Brad Tursi alongside Jessie Jo Dillon.

“Memory Lane” was written by Ramsey and bandmates Trevor Rosen and Brad Tursi with Grammy-nominated songwriter Jessie Jo Dillon. “Sometimes when I’m feeling overwhelmed or missing someone or maybe just feel a little nostalgic there are places in my mind I can go that are full of memories of simpler times” Ramsey explains in a statement. “It’s a location or a person or a feeling that will always live in my memories and I can close my eyes and transport myself there anytime I want and experience it all again. I think we all have that time in our life that will remain forever perfect in our hearts. Sometimes we wish we could just stay there and never leave.”

This marks OD’s first new single since their top 15 hit “No Hard Feelings” the second single off their 2021 album Time Tequila & Therapy. In summer 2022 they teamed up with then-tourmate Kenny Chesney on “Beer With Friends” which reached the top 30 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart.

“Memory Lane” will be officially released on January 5. Days later the band will embark on the No Bad Vibes Tour launching on January 19 in Evansville Indiana and continuing until June 30 when it wraps in Lake Tahoe.

Sport marketing researcher Lamar Reams knows his way around the ring – not to mention the octagon the gridiron the diamond and the basketball court. An expert in what drives the behavior of sports consumers Reams is an Old Dominion University administrator and faculty member.

He’s also now been elected president of the Sport Marketing Association (SMA). That’s an organization of more than 350 members most of whom are university professors of sports marketing and management. Founded in 2002 the SMA has led the effort to expand the body of knowledge in sport marketing by providing forums for professional interaction among practitioners academics and students.

“I’ve been a member of the SMA for quite some time and I look forward to the organization’s continued work to support sport marketing research and principles” said Reams associate dean for professional studies and research in the Darden College of Education and Professional Studies. “SMA has been vital to the success of my career.”

Reams’ research focuses on the psychosocial and behavioral aspects of consumption related to professional intercollegiate and amateur sports. His main area of expertise lies in combat sports namely mixed martial arts (MMA) and boxing.

He has published empirical studies on a multitude of sport marketing areas including the impact of fighter rivalries on mediated sport consumer behavior the influence of fighters’ star power on pay-per-view demand and the avidity levels of MMA fans and how that measure contributes to where and how they choose to watch the sport (sports bars electronic devices unauthorized internet streaming).

“One of the most interesting projects was in relation to the star power of fighters and how that drives demand for pay-per-view events” Reams said.

In that study the researchers looked at data that captured the star fighter’s social media popularity performance record and appearances in general media along with the sense of rivalry that may exist between the fighter and his or her top opponent.

“We found that those are pretty significant factors that contribute to why people are willing to pay that extra $70 $80 – and in some cases over $100 for a major pay-per-view event.”

In that same paper the authors suggested that based on their findings a potential championship bout between Conor McGregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov could be a blockbuster event on pay per view.

“And lo and behold months after that paper was published that fight actually came to fruition and it still stands as the most watched UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) pay-per-view event of all time” Reams said. “So that was a fun aspect of that research.”

Reams an associate professor of sport management also researches sport sponsorship an area of expertise he incorporated into his teaching. As associate dean he no longer teaches as regularly as he once did.

Reams has been a member of the SMA executive board since 2019. In this role he developed an initiative to boost the demographic diversity of the organization through partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities managed SMA’s research grants and professional awards and organized symposiums. He has been published in SMA’s partner journal Sport Marketing Quarterly.

Reams was elected SMA president in October at the group’s 2022 conference in Charlotte.

“It feels great to know that I was elected by my peers in my professional organization” he said. “It’s just very reassuring that I’ve done good work and the organization and its members have the confidence in me to lead the organization forward.”"

Discovery Strikes Measurement Deal With VideoAmp 01/03/2023,"by Wayne Friedman  January 3 2023

In a move that further extends the use of alternative measurement platforms Warner Bros. Discovery has struck an agreement with VideoAmp to measure cross-screen campaigns across all its networks and media platforms.

The company says it will use VideoAmp “to better represent its audiences for advertisers looking to transact on linear streaming video and large digital and social media services through a unified cross-platform currency.”

Using VideoAmp’s data platform which combines set-top-box and smart TV data Warner Bros. Discovery in a recent analysis said brands using advertising on its platforms achieved reach per spot that was 1.2 times greater. Among more affluent audiences the reach was even higher -- at 2.3 times per spot in households with household income over $100000.

VideoAmp uses smart TV automatic content recognition (ACR) data to deduplicate audience reach and frequency across streaming and linear channels.

The funding was included as part of the fiscal year 2023 omnibus funding package comprising the 12 annual appropriations bills which will fund the government and its various agencies.

Semiconductor research and development underpins newer technologies such as artificial intelligence quantum computing biomedical sensors and integrated photonics. These technologies will enable advances in smart systems for healthcare transportation manufacturing defense and security among others. New York state’s Federal delegation led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hailed the funding as foundational to re-invigorate domestic microelectronics manufacturing and help drive the digital revolution.

“As Majority Leader I have made it my priority to bolster U.S. semiconductor manufacturing to grow jobs Upstate ensure our competitiveness worldwide and protect our national security"" said U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer. “I’m proud to secure this funding for RIT so they can continue to contribute cutting-edge research to the industry while also developing our nation’s next generation of high-quality engineering talent right here in Rochester.”

“With the demand for computer chips outpacing the supply in the U.S. we must have the laboratory facilities that will produce the skilled graduates needed to fuel this critical industry” said RIT President David C. Munson Jr. “Upgrading our teaching facility will further strengthen New York’s position as a national leader in the semiconductor manufacturing industry.”

“I was proud to fight for funding for new semiconductor research equipment and instrumentation for the Rochester Institute of Technology” said U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. “This $2 million investment will help expand the already-growing microchip economy in Upstate New York while training the next generation of leaders across our country and globe. I will keep fighting to help build this growing technology economy and for workers in New York and beyond.”

“RIT has long been a leader in semiconductor fabrication and emerging microelectronics technologies. I’m proud to have worked alongside senators Schumer and Gillibrand to secure this significant funding to further expand RIT’s capabilities helping them lead globally in this critical sphere” said Congressman Joe Morelle. “This will create jobs and grow our economy here in Rochester and strengthen American competitiveness on the world stage. I congratulate RIT on this award and look forward to our continued work together to further cement Rochester’s place at the forefront of high-tech advancement.”

“I want to thank Majority Leader Chuck Schumer Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Congressman Joe Morelle who fought tirelessly for this Congressionally Directed Funding to be included in the final bill” said Vanessa J. Herman vice president for Government and Community Relations at RIT. “Their unwavering support is critical to our success as a nation as we work collaboratively to boost domestic research and semiconductor manufacturing here in the United States.”

RIT researchers use the facility for research in photonics quantum chip development microfluidic devices LEDs solar cells and nanomembranes. The cleanroom will continue supporting coursework in fabrication techniques such as CMOS processing—a chip fabrication process widely used in industry—and in preparing students for careers in the semiconductor industry. In addition early-stage companies will use the facility to develop new products.

The current RIT cleanroom was built in the mid-1980s to support the microelectronic engineering degree program which began in 1982. The first of its kind at the time the microelectronic engineering program led the way to train engineers in what would become a powerful global industry.

Today the cleanroom serves as a teaching and research lab a testing facility for corporate partners and a resource for multiple levels of workforce development training. In October Micron Corp. an international computer chip manufacturing company stated it would invest heavily in the state building a new computer memory fab in Central New York.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVldGltZXMuZXUvZXVyb3BlLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItdGFsZW50LWdhcC13aWRlbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Europe's Semiconductor Talent Gap Widens,"Chip manufacturers continue to plan new fab openings across Europe. Yet a serious challenge could get in the way: a shortage of skilled workers. The talent gap has widened in the European semiconductor industry over the past two years according to the MicroElectronics Training Industry and Skills (METIS) consortium.

With the Chips Act the European Union aims to strengthen its competitiveness and double its current semiconductor market share to 20% by 2030. However achieving such ambitions will be possible only if the talent shortage is addressed. The European microelectronics sector directly accounts for 200000 and indirectly for 1 million highly skilled jobs and the demand for new skills is relentless.

Launched in November 2019 the four-year METIS project aims to bridge the skill gap in microelectronics for “a more competitive Europe.” METIS coordinated by SEMI Europe connects microelectronics startups SMEs and large firms with national and EU industry associations formal educational providers and regulatory bodies in the field of accreditation and certification.

The METIS consortium has released the 2022 update of its “METIS Skills Strategy” report. It details the skill needs of the European microelectronics industry from the beginning of 2021 through 2022 and describes the new job profiles and skills that emerged during this period.

Most critical job profiles

As explained in the 36-page report the most critical job profiles are the profiles that are the most sought after by the industry and the most difficult to fill.

In 2022 as in 2020 the most sought-after job profiles in the European microelectronics industry were software and design engineers — system design engineers digital design engineers and analog design engineers. However the demand for and shortage of software engineers data scientists cybersecurity experts and application engineers has risen sharply in two years.

The global chip shortage had a direct impact on the recruitment process as there was an urgent need for profiles in production and maintenance (i.e. process engineers maintenance technicians process technicians).

To weather the chip shortage companies often had to be agile and design engineers were asked to adapt the design to the shortage through design for availability. Design for availability is about redesigning chips to get around the shortage of some parts of the value chain the report notes.

There was also a severe shortage of senior profiles especially advanced systems architecture designers senior analog designers with strong programming skills and engineering experts in specific applications fields.

Most critical skills

The METIS report provides a detailed description of the skill needs of the European microelectronics industry from the beginning of 2021 until 2022 based on respondents’ answers.

When asked what skill needs were developing respondents cited: machine learning and AI; data analysis; systems design and system architectures (SoC SiP SoP complex ASIC); digital skills and software skills (especially embedded software programming); and knowledge of new materials.

Other skills mentioned as gaining ground were: analog design edge computing environmental knowledge for product development engineers export control know-how linked to value chain restrictions MEMS design for high temperatures and high performance MEMS processing/manufacturing product marketing programming for automatic circuit generation and low-power design.

In 2022 the most critical soft skills were teamwork and communication as well as creativity.

Recommendations

Given the geopolitical tensions and bottlenecks along the semiconductor value chain respondents were faced with unprecedented challenges. They largely recommended developing a sustainable workforce and expanding collaboration.

Favor intra- and extra-EU mobility. Build an EU chip academy to help companies students and workers find their way around and find the formation that best fits their needs. Enhance lifelong learning programs and increase the involvement of the microelectronics industry in the education process. Develop clusters and networks favoring dialog between industry and education representatives. Create communication campaigns to improve the image of the sector. Develop joint degrees in microelectronics.

As part of the METIS project SEMI Europe expects to publish a detailed list of actionable recommendations in the first quarter of 2023.

“We are fully committed to building on the momentum created with the METIS Erasmus+ collaborative project and to mobilizing our industry and education partners for a successful Pact for Skills in microelectronics launched in November 2020” Laith Altimime president of SEMI Europe told EE Times Europe in an interview last year. “The launch is a significant step forward with a focus on reskilling and upskilling for Europe that will help ensure the continent’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and bolster its digital and green transitions.”

Altimime continued: “Microelectronics provides the foundation for digital infrastructure and while the industry’s strategic importance is recognized worldwide a future diverse talent shortage could limit the industry’s growth. The Pact for Skills for microelectronics offers opportunities for the future and is essential for enabling sustainable growth and a more resilient European supply chain.”

The global semiconductor industry currently indispensable to everything from security to social and economic management is in upheaval. Much of the supply capabilities are concentrated in Asia particularly in Taiwan and South Korea so escalating tensions between Taiwan and China are a cause for global concern.

From National Security to Decarbonization and Medicine

The world’s largest semiconductor foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company leads the industry from Taiwan. Now after the Party Congress in China it is clear just how much power is consolidated in Chinese President Xi Jinping who has expressed a strong desire to “reunify with Taiwan.” There is an increasing risk of a military invasion of the island.

Amid all of this the United States has begun efforts to boost its own semiconductor industry though major support measures. Japan’s semiconductor and related companies must further enhance their existing strengths and reinforce relationships with counterparts overseas including in the United States and Taiwan. Making that choice will be vital for our semiconductor industry’s survival.

The current decline in demand for smartphones and PCs has caused prices of core digital devices components like logic and memory semiconductors to fall and inventory adjustments are underway. There is a temporary slowdown in global semiconductor industry growth but from a somewhat long-term perspective semiconductor demand is set to increase in every region globally.

To begin with semiconductors are now having an unprecedented impact on countries’ national security. Japan the United States Australia and India are strengthening coordination for their Free and Open Indo-Pacific plans to counter growing external pressure from China. For major developed nations to strengthen their security measures around this four-nation framework they must first collaborate to ensure a stable supply of reliably high-quality chips at all times to guarantee rock-solid information security.

In finance the world is seeing accelerating digital transformation. More and more diverse chips will be used in areas and products where they have not conventionally seen much use. The global internet environment is also shifting from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. This will lead to individuals and organizations both having to actively manage more data than ever. It is essential then to enhance cloud services and improve data-center processing capabilities.

On top of that next-generation ultra-high-speed communication technology—such as 6G—is going to become more common. The movement toward “connected autonomous shared and electric” or CASE vehicles is also accelerating. As the world moves toward more efficient use of renewable energy to address decarbonization the demand for power management through storage batteries will also increase rapidly. More semiconductors are going to be used in areas like medicine and social infrastructure maintenance and inspection.

It is no exaggeration to say that the ability to enhance semiconductor supply capacity as a strategic resource and to develop companies with a global market share is the most important industrial policy issue in countries around the globe.

Growing Conflict

However a significant portion of the world’s semiconductor supply is unevenly concentrated in Asia. According to semiconductor market research firm TrendForce the 2021 foundry share by country and region is 64% for Taiwan 18% for Korea and 7% for China. TSMC’s share alone is 53%.

That is worrisome as tensions around Taiwan grow ever stronger. For example the United States procures military-grade chips for its state-of-the-art F35 fighter jets from TSMC. It is likely that pressure Taiwan from Xi Jinping’s administration will keep growing constituting a threat to the security structure of the United States which is itself a global security keystone.

Thus establishing a stable semiconductor supply system while avoiding negative impacts from escalating tensions over the Taiwan issue is an urgent issue for the world’s leading developed economies. More and more companies are already moving operations from China to Vietnam India and elsewhere in response to rising geopolitical risks in the area. Taiwanese companies like TSMC and Hon Hai Precision Industry which produces devices like iPhones on contract will quite likely find it increasingly difficult to expand their business in China.

Amid all of this the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States showed rare unity in efforts to bring the nation’s semiconductor industry back. The administration of President Joe Biden passed the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 to provide stronger support for the domestic semiconductor industry’s manufacturing capacity and research and development. Then on October 7 the government additionally tightened restrictions on semiconductor-related exports to China.

The United States may further strengthen sanctions against China in advanced fields to take the lead in the ever more vital semiconductor industry. If sanctions are tightened it may take longer for China to raise its semiconductor self-sufficiency than the Communist regime has envisioned. In fact China is already behind the goal of 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency it stated in the Made in China 2025 policy that the Xi administration put forward in 2015.

In the future the Communist Party will tighten its grip on China as a result reducing the priority of economic policy there. The policy skills of Li Qiang who is now leading Beijing’s economic policy remain untried. And for now China still relies on the United States and other countries for intellectual property and technology for its semiconductor manufacturing. China’s manufacturing capabilities in the field will gradually increase but it is likely to take longer than the ruling party expects.

And while China lags the United States has stepped up support measures for its own semiconductor industry. In response TSMC Samsung Electronics and Intel are making capital investments on American soil. The European Commission has also launched support measures to attract major semiconductor companies but without the success seen to date in the United States.

How Can Japan Survive?

The global semiconductor industry is going to see increasingly fierce shifts. Japanese firms in related industries are going to have to strengthen their strategies if they wish to survive. Japan has lost its competitiveness in the field ever since the mid-1980s. Contributing factors include friction with the United States in the field the accelerating international outsourcing of labor and Japan’s prolonged economic stagnation after the bursting of the bubble economy.

Some sectors of our semiconductor industry do remain globally competitive though. These include chips for automotive and power management applications produced using older production lines semiconductor manufacturing and inspection equipment and ultrapure semiconductor-related materials like hydrogen fluoride resist and silicon wafers.

What each company must do is refine its own inimitable manufacturing technology to improve competitiveness in global demand. That will increase the necessity of cost cutting measures and will also require companies to reallocate more management resources more quickly to developing new manufacturing technologies.

The US Federal Reserve is bound to further tighten American monetary policy to quell inflation. Consumer spending in the United States a fundamental support for the global economy is in decline and thus increasing the likelihood of a global recession. In the short term the semiconductor market will deteriorate. The business environment for Japanese companies will become even more harsh. Japanese firms will see their management resolve tested as they determine whether they can invest in strengthening R&D and coordination with overseas semiconductor manufacturers for their long-term survival.

The government must also provide stronger support for risk-taking by companies in advanced sectors. Prime Minister Kishida Fumio’s October 28 announcement of Comprehensive Economic Measures to Overcome High Prices and Realize Economic Revival included a ¥1.3 trillion package of measures to support the semiconductor industry. That is an essential step.

However Japan’s semiconductor support measures remain inferior in scale to those in the United States and elsewhere. The Kishida administration must quickly compile specific support details and present a more aggressive industrial development strategy so that Japan’s semiconductor industry can better demonstrate its strengths. That will have a decisive impact on the medium- to long-term survival of the Japanese semiconductor industry and the strength of our economy.

Brattain of Bell Labs in 1947. Original exhibited in Bell Laboratories. Credit: Unitronic/Wikimedia Commons CC BY-SA

The transistor the basic building block of electronic systems was invented on December 16 1947 at Bell Labs. In 2022 we celebrate the 75th anniversary of this powerful little device. Having been called one of the most important inventions of the 20th century transistors are pervasive in modern technology including billions used on silicon chips which are used in telecommunications aviation data communications audio and video recording equipment and much more. As the world continue to advance in manufacturing and microelectronics design transistors will have an even greater impact in the 21st century.

Today the field of electronics is in a state of transition much like it was in the 1960s when progressing from vacuum tubes to transistors. As identified in the ASA-SEMI vision paper there is an urgent need to update and modernize the semiconductor curriculum. This is where the new book Transistors!—written by Mark Lundstrom and published by World Scientific—fills out a needed niche. It is the first among many in the new lecture notes series New Era Electronics aiming to advance electronics by providing crucial foundational knowledge.

This book and its corresponding series are intended for undergraduates graduates and semiconductor industry professionals who are working actively to advance electronics in new directions. A wide range of topics is addressed from Statistical Data Analysis Design of Experiments and Machine Learning to Probabilistic Computing Quantum Networks and Sensors Embedded Systems and the Internet of Things Fiber Optic Communications and R.F. Design.

Even while the initial authors of the series are from Purdue University academics and industry professionals are invited to contribute as well. Said Purdue University's President-elect Mung Chiang at the book series launch ""This series is an example of how innovative solutions can lower the barriers and democratize quality semiconductor education. The New Era Electronics Lecture Notes series aims to engage faculty everywhere both as authors and as teachers bringing the most modern and up-to date content to students.""

Mark Lundstrom author of the inaugural volume of the series added ""This new series will help prepare students and working engineers to contribute to the second half of the silicon century which promises to be even more exciting and impactful than the first half.""

""We are proud to partner with the Purdue University College of Engineering and the ASA Initiative to publish this book series and further innovation in the semiconductor industry"" said Max Phua managing director of World Scientific Publishing. ""Through these ready-to-use accessible teaching materials students and professionals everywhere will be better equipped for the ever-evolving future of electronics.""

Yang Hyang-ja helped shape the 84-year-old conglomerate’s present dominance in global memory chipmaking. Now she’s taking on a far broader challenge: ensuring Korea remains relevant as the U.S. and China fight over semiconductors.

Yang who rose from a researcher’s assistant at the storied company before heading the key memory chip development division is the lead architect of a nationwide effort to fund and galvanize its domestic chip industry. Her mission is surging in importance as the U.S. China and Japan pour billions into building up their own chip supply chains clouding Korea’s future role in semiconductors she told Bloomberg Television.

It’s a matter of national security she said echoing the views of those in Washington and Beijing who’re funneling talent money and policy support into the development of the slivers of silicon powering future technologies from artificial intelligence and the metaverse to next-generation computing and—notably—military capability.

“We’re in a chip war” Yang said in a December interview. “Technology supremacy is a way that our country can take the lead in any security-related agenda such as diplomatic and defense issues without being swayed by other nations.”

Yang who leads a 13-member special committee President Yoon Suk Yeol’s ruling party formed this year to brainstorm a solution has argued that only through strong and direct intervention can Seoul expand its position in the $550 billion global semiconductor industry. She’s one of a growing number of global policy makers who have embraced tech protectionism after pandemic-driven logistics snarls highlighted countries’ dependence on one another for key electronic components. She’s won an ally in Yoon who has joined Yang’s calls for more policies to help the country’s homegrown chip sector which includes SK Hynix Inc. as well as Samsung.

Her efforts may be starting to bear fruit. Last month parliament passed Korea’s version of the U.S. Chips Act. Spearheaded by Yang the move expedites the approval process to build factories in the metropolitan area while increasing the number of tech-specialized schools. Separately parliament passed an initial bill offering a tax credit of 8% to big firms investing in semiconductor manufacturing far smaller than Yang’s proposal of 20% to 25%.

Those gestures are a far cry from the billions of dollars in subsidies that other countries are committing to chip production said Yang adding that short-term political interests are blinding fellow lawmakers at the National Assembly. Some of her peers have argued in turn that overly generous incentives threaten government finances and would only benefit big companies.

On Tuesday the finance ministry announced a plan to increase the tax break on big companies’ capex to as much as 25%. It’s unusual for an administration to propose substantive changes so soon after lawmakers pass a bill.

Unless the government steps up its incentives more Korean companies could move their major production facilities to the U.S. and take their best engineers with them Yang said. Samsung plans to build a $17 billion semiconductor plant in Texas and has floated the possibility of spending almost $200 billion on a series of plants in Austin and Taylor.

Korea has a unique opportunity to counter this trend Yang said. Taiwan—where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is based—produces the majority of leading-edge chips controlling the newest iPhones servers and supercomputers. That’s triggered calls worldwide to diversify production away from an island that China claims and has threatened to invade.

“Samsung is the only company in the world that can fill in for TSMC” said Yang.

Yang who first joined politics in 2016 at the encouragement of former President Moon Jae-in is an independent lawmaker who left the Democratic Party in 2021 amid criticism about her response to a sexual assault case against one of her aides who was also a relative. Yang later apologized. A police investigation yielded no charges against the lawmaker.

Chip policy takes up her time now. Escalating sanctions on advanced technology are putting increased pressure on the country to choose between the U.S. its security ally and China its biggest trade partner. Both have asked South Korea to expand chip production partnerships.

But Seoul has sidestepped explicit comments regarding its commitment to the Biden administration’s sanctions on exports of U.S.-affiliated knowhow to China.

That delicate situation highlights the need for Korea to build its own domestic technological capabilities—or risk growing ever more beholden to foreign powers Yang said.

This is the time to offer Korean companies more incentives to build production capacity at home rather than abroad Yang said. The country needs to do more to keep young talent she said.

“How else would our country survive?” she said. “It’d become a new technological colony.”"

The stock fell as much as 5.7% on Wednesday its biggest intraday decline since October. The tumble follows a 29% slide in 2022 the steepest annual slump for the software giant since 2008 as the Federal Reserve ramped up borrowing costs to combat soaring inflation.

UBS wrote that Azure the cloud computing business it described as the company’s growth engine “is entering a steep growth deceleration that could prove to be worse in FY23/FY24 than investors are modeling.” The business “may be slowing due to maturation not just a tough macro” the bank wrote.

In Microsoft’s most recent quarterly results released in October the company gave a lackluster forecast for Azure sales growth and analysts have been scaling back expectations. The consensus for adjusted 2023 earnings per share has dropped 5.6% in the past three months while the view for revenue is down 3.7% data compiled by Bloomberg show.

‘Fair Not Cheap’

The stock trades at 21.8 times estimated earnings a slight discount to its 10-year average of 22. In UBS’s view the valuation “feels fair not cheap” and it lowered its price target to $250 from $300. The Nasdaq 100 Index has a multiple of 19.9.

Tech stocks came under broad pressure last year as the Fed’s policy tightening weighed on multiples. Now the growing threat of a recession is underscoring concern about a slowdown in business spending.

Also on Wednesday enterprise software company Salesforce Inc. said it would cut about 8000 jobs and shrink its real estate footprint as its corporate customers have become more cautious with spending.

Microsoft and Salesforce are among businesses that pivoted to remote work during the pandemic spurring a boom in demand for PCs and cloud applications like collaboration software. But the pace of that growth has proven impossible to maintain as economic growth has slowed.

Despite such concerns Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street as more than 90% of analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock and none have a sell rating.

In 2019 Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (Cognizant) agreed to pay US$25m to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to settle violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Two former high-ranking officials of Cognizant were also individually charged with authorising US$2.5m in bribe payments to an Indian government official.

The Cognizant case is far from the sole instance of US-based enforcement action arising from a company’s business interests in India. In fact as recently as September 2022 Oracle Corporation settled charges with the SEC of violating the FCPA when its Indian subsidiary created and used slush funds to bribe government officials in return for business. A historic review demonstrates that enforcement actions and penalties under the FCPA and its UK equivalent the UK Bribery Act (UKBA) have largely been directed against corporations. However it is critical to recognise that both the FCPA and UKBA specifically contemplate individual liability and the Cognizant incident is testament to the fact that the authorities will not hold back from giving full effect to anti-bribery and corruption law against individual officers where relevant. The question is therefore how culpable must an officer of a company be for personal enforcement to take place?

Officers and directors are particularly vulnerable to enforcement action when it comes to operations in sectors that are licensed and/or heavily regulated (such as alcohol and defence) industries with regular interface with government officials (land and infrastructure) and heavy reliance on third parties as indirect bribes are penalised even in the absence of actual knowledge of the corrupt payment.

It is often extremely difficult if not impossible for officers at a senior level (whether based in India or abroad) to verify every accounting entry and check actual expenses against paperwork produced on the ground. Bribes and facilitation payments are very often disguised in accounting records as legitimate payments such as fees or commissions to consultants. In Cognizant’s case sham change order requests were allegedly used to conceal payments which were made to reimburse a construction firm for bribes given to government officials in a construction project in India. These sham payments were apparently authorised by certain Cognizant officers.

Other covers for bribes that we have come across while conducting anti-bribery and corruption investigations have included payments under consultancy or agency agreements payments to vendors and sub-vendors purchase orders marketing services payments HR events and even team offsite budgets.

Where senior officers must rely on paperwork to sign off on payments enforcement action will consider whether they exercised sufficient diligence while approving these payments and whether adequate processes were put in place to verify and cross-check expenses while appropriating individual responsibility.

Another important element to be mindful of is whether investigations in the US or UK under the FCPA and UKBA respectively would trigger investigations or reporting requirements under local regulations such as India’s Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 (POCA). Unlike the FCPA and UKBA the focus of POCA is to fix individual liability via criminal prosecution. Monetary settlements equivalent to those under the FCPA or UKBA are not available under POCA and prosecution tends to be a long and painful process for all involved encompassing multiple enforcement agencies without reaching conclusions in many instances.

These risks are not endemic to one country. As many high-profile prosecutions have demonstrated infractions tend to be spread across many jurisdictions with the participation (tacit or explicit) of various individuals and a general breakdown of compliance and governance mechanisms.

Baseline precautionary measures to mitigate risks to officers and directors cover three major aspects:

Being aware that ‘knowledge’ of a corrupt practice can be attributed in many different ways across various regulations. Therefore meaningful mechanisms which alert officers to red flags (such as whistleblower lines reporting mechanisms via HR or factory managers third party audits etc) should be in place. Once red flags are prompted the next threshold requirement when assessing culpability is typically how the officer concerned reacted to the alert and what was done to get to the root of the matter. Aspects such as whether enquiries were conducted with due promptness and gravity whether suitable actions were pursued to remedy gaps whether appropriate disciplinary measures were taken etc become critical questions. The answers to these questions should stand the test of diligence and due process in hindsight as these are always called to question post facto. Finally the officer’s behaviour and reaction to law enforcement or government investigations and any disclosures made in good faith become critical to determine final liability.

In an ideal scenario all three of the above aspects would play out seamlessly with the officers able to justify their actions (or lack thereof) and demonstrate that they have at each stage acted to comply with anti-corruption law and company policy to the best of their ability.

Nevertheless from a practical perspective we have seen time and again that there is no perfect set of facts that can be presented in the course of an investigation particularly given that acts (or omissions) are scrutinised in hindsight. As such the goal of compliance and governance mechanisms should be to put procedures in place which make it difficult for any investigation to attribute culpability individually by equipping officers with the tools described above to be able to resist liability robustly and sufficiently."

This however hasn't been easy with all the changes advances disruptions and supply shortages in the last few years.

“It’s definitely a very dynamic market that we’re living in right now” noted Nick Clinkenbeard product manager of dry and refrigerated vans at trailer manufacturer Wabash. “And if you had a good way to predict where it’s going in the future that’s a crystal ball that I think a lot of people would pay a lot of money for.”

Since the spring of 2020 trucks trailers and tires have all been more difficult to come by. Raw materials and components such as semiconductors became harder to obtain and plants shut down to stop the spread of the pandemic. This led to mounting backlogs and trucks waiting for repair parts.

For the foreseeable future however manufacturers are feeling a bit of relief. “The long delays are pretty much behind us” Clinkenbeard said on behalf of Wabash.

But what about the rest of the heavy-duty trucking industry? One way to better predict where the industry is headed is by looking at the overall economy. Inflation was at record highs until recently and the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to 4% in November the sixth straight increase.

“I just don’t see how we avoid a recession” pondered Bob Costello American Trucking Associations’ chief economist at Isaac Instruments’ 2022 User Conference. On the bright side he did add that the recession “should be relatively short; it should be relatively mild.”

Truck outlook

So how will the amount of new Class 8 trucks on the road in 2023 be impacted by the current economic situation? After non-vocational Class 8 truck sales rebounded from 168600 in 2021 to 198800 in 2022 next year they will dip 12.4% to 174000 according to ACT Research’s market data.

“For now business activity in the truck industry rolls on seemingly unfazed by higher interest rates” said Eric Crawford VP and senior analyst at ACT Research. “That said we expect this dynamic to shift in [the first half of FY 2023] as the Fed continues its aggressive push to subdue inflation. Cracks in the economy are becoming more evident: The impact of higher rates has begun to slow activity in the housing sector and large layoffs have started in the tech sector.”

He recommended customers select “ever more aggressive—or lower—rear axle ratios which keep engine rpms lower requiring less fuel to do the same work.”

Daimler Truck North America which makes the market leader Freightliner (40% share) noted several external forces will impact the market.

According to the company:

“The company’s outlook is especially subject to the further developments in the Russia-Ukraine war and its impact on the global economy as well as the development of the very high inflationary pressure and the associated central-bank increases in interest rates.The further macroeconomic geopolitical as well as the COVID-19 pandemic development and ongoing supply bottlenecks also harbor an exceptional degree of uncertainty. However Daimler Truck assumes no major production downtimes due to missing parts or due to the unavailability of gas.”

Fuel may be available but it is expensive.

“Likely due to fuel prices on-highway customers are gravitating toward down-speeding through integrated drivetrains at an accelerated rate” offered Len Copeland product marketing manager for DTNA’s Detroit brand.

Copeland noted hardware such as Detroit’s Axle Lube Management can “offer immediate fuel savings with no driver interaction whatsoever.”

Over at Volvo Trucks North America the order board is “healthy” with sales at market level explained Johan Agebrand director of product marketing. Agebrand also reported “seeing significant improvements in the semiconductor and transport restrictions that we—from a global perspective—ran into in the economic recovery from the COVID pandemic. The current situation we are seeing is now more in relation to labor and capacity restrictions since the economic environment has recovered.”

On the trends front fuel efficiency has been more of a focus to Volvo customers Agebrand said because of fixed contract rates and decreasing spot rates.

“When the spot rates were increasing due to a shortage of transport capacity the increase in fuel price in some sense was lost in the increase in transport rates” he explained.

Volvo customers who spec a turbo-compound engine and I-Torque powertrain combination will have the flexibility to adjust to speed or fuel efficiency needs “without sacrificing overall fuel economy” Agebrand said.

Overall a fleet that keeps up with regular maintenance according to OEM recommendations will prevent unexpected downtime and keep trucks moving and generating revenue Agebrand said. Investing more time into training drivers will also yield a good return.

“The driver and how they utilize the truck is the biggest operating cost impact for any fleet” he said. “Good drivers versus bad drivers can easily have a 10% operating cost difference.”

Navistar's International experienced a healthy 2022 and expects continued momentum into 2023 while navigating various component shortages and production challenges reported Chet Ciesielski VP of on-highway heavy-duty truck business. “Our strong order intake has created a very strong backlog” he added.

The company has seen supply chain improvement but does “continue to work through challenges” Ciesielski ceded.

The International S13 Integrated Powertrain  which starts production in 2023 will provide customers with some relief. With the S13 the latest International LT Series will have 15% better fuel efficiency than one with a first-generation International A26 engine. CEO Mathias Carlbaum said this will be the final new internal combustion engine developed by International.",,,

The organization has launched the Home-Compostable Polybag Project a six-month pilot program in partnership with Levi Strauss & Co. (LS&Co.) and German retailer C&A that will test alternatives to conventional single-use plastic bags that are used to protect and ship merchandise in the apparel and footwear sectors.

An estimated 180 billion are produced each year according to Fashion for Good. Virgin polybags usually use fossil fuel to produced their plastic have a high carbon footprint and are rarely recycled and usually landfilled.

The new initiative will see LS&Co. and C&A use bags made from bio-based material and can be composted at home or in community compost piles. TIPA Corp. and Greenhope two sustainably minded packaging companies helped create the bags.

TIPA Corp. is certified by TÜV Austria OK Compost Home and Greenhope is undergoing certification for DIN CERTCO Home Compostable. These certifications are according to both the French standard NFT 51-800 and the Australian standard AS 5810.

The newly launched bags’ bio-based polymers are generated from biological feedstock such as food crops organic waste and wood pulp. The final compostable plastic blends are generally derived from a mix of bio-based materials and petroleum feedstocks. The polybags used in the project contain 23-25 percent bio-based content.

“The Home-Compostable Polybag Project with Fashion for Good is an exciting opportunity to pilot a solution for an ecommerce element our customers are all too familiar with—the polybag” said Jeffrey Hogue chief sustainability officer at Levi Strauss & Co. “This pilot not only moves us toward achieving our goal of eliminating single-use plastic in consumer-facing packaging by 2030 it also puts into practice the industry collaboration required to solve these ubiquitous challenges in hopes of reducing harmful elements within the apparel supply chain.”

This pilot­—the third Fashion for Good polybag project following the Circular Polybag Pilot (completed in 2020) and Reusable Packaging (completed 2021) projects—will benchmark these innovative new bags against conventional plastics in supply chains and measure the overall impact and associated costs of the materials.

“Plastic waste pollution is a massive systemic issue and this collaborative platform approach is one of the most effective ways to quickly arrive at credible scaled solutions” added Tommy Tjiptadjaja CEO and co-founder of Greenhope. “Through our technology Greenhope is ready willing and able to support this all the way to its positive conclusion: linking sustainable consumption and production of global brands with positive social impact among developing countries’ farmer coops who provide the bio-based raw materials.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRob21hc25ldC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvdG9wLXN1cHBsaWVycy9ib3R0bGluZy1jb21wYW5pZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top Bottling Companies in the USA,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thomasnet.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/top-suppliers/bottling-companies/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E4C66FB0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRob21hc25ldC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvdG9wLXN1cHBsaWVycy9ib3R0bGluZy1jb21wYW5pZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

And there is of course plenty going on outside the North American market too as the global need for energy storage is becoming widely recognised.

It’s fair to say our three interviewees come from companies at quite different stages of their journey into that global market.

Mitsubishi Power Americas is involved in major large-scale battery storage projects with recent project contract awards in regions including the south-eastern US and Chile.

The company’s battery storage solution called Emerald is based on lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology but Mitsubishi Power Americas is involved with a broad range of other technologies including working on what could be the largest green hydrogen storage facility in the US the ACES project in Utah.

LS Energy Solutions backed by South Korean conglomerate LS Group began deliveries of its first containerised battery energy storage system (BESS) units last year after LS Group acquired the grid-tied energy storage division of inverter maker Parker Hannifin in 2018.

IHI Terrasun is a system integrator working on some of the largest solar-plus-storage projects in the US such as developer Primergy Solar’s US$1.9 billion Gemini Solar-plus-Storage plant in Nevada. Gemini will include 1.4GWh of batteries with cells to be supplied by CATL alongside 690MWac/966MWdc of solar PV.

What did 2022 mean for your energy storage business and how did it compare with the year before that?

2022 exceeded our expectations in many ways. We went through a wave of commissioning 1.5GWh of projects in California and Texas which are historically robust markets for battery storage. The year has also seen a transition to other markets in the Eastern US and emerging market opportunities in Canada Latin America and Western Europe.

We started the year mostly focused on US-based project opportunities and the anticipation of a US$3 billion to US$4 billion market. That has quickly evolved into a more global view of opportunities across Canada Western Europe Latin America and the US with an estimated US$9 billion market outlook over the next two years.

Overall it was a strong year not only for Mitsubishi Power but the energy storage industry as a whole.

Tom Cornell Senior VP of energy storage Mitsubishi Power Americas

For LS Energy Solutions (LS-ES) 2022 was the year of product fine-tuning and getting into the big league of energy storage system integration.

LS-ES launched its all-in-one (AiON) energy storage solution in the fall of 2021 and spent 2022 certifying our AiON energy and power series as well as taking the all-in-one concept to our customers. We ended the year with six awarded projects and installation underway on three of them.

Ravi Manghani director of strategy and analytics LS Energy Solutions

2022 has been a year of tremendous growth both for the industry and IHI Terrasun. With the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) the need for storage has skyrocketed and that is amplifying an already increasing and expanding market. This hot market keeps getting hotter.

The war in Ukraine has further illustrated that energy independence – both regional and national – is essential for a stable and sustainable economy. And that has also increased the need for energy storage worldwide.

We’re seeing increases both in the size of projects – to the orders of magnitude to what we saw only two years ago but also the frequency of new projects being developed. This year has seen a notable increase in the speed of the energy transition with the strong boost to climate and energy funding provided by the IRA.

Ray Saka VP sales product management and services IHI Terrasun

What were some of the biggest gains and steps forward made by the industry including your company during the last 12 months?

One of the biggest steps forward we have seen as an industry is the increased confidence and adoption in battery energy storage outside of the mature markets in the United States including California and Texas. Mitsubishi Power is seeing this within our business with the projects awarded in the Southeast United States and Chile.

As more battery energy storage assets are successfully commissioned and continue to meet customer expectations it is resulting in more confidence and understanding of the many roles battery energy storage has in the energy landscape as a generation and transmission asset.

The passing of the Inflation Reduction Act in the US will be the next catalyst for energy storage and propel the market forward.

Tom Cornell Senior VP of energy storage Mitsubishi Power Americas

Any mention of 2022 has to include the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. For the first time standalone energy storage will enjoy tax credit incentives similar to other renewable technologies. The industry deserved a pat on the back for never stopping to advocate for [the] storage ITC.

The timing couldn’t have been better as there’s a massive opportunity in front of us to decarbonise the power grid and storage will have a key role to play in getting there.

Another big gain which truly still has to materialise is the recognition that for the US energy storage market to prosper the country will also need to advance as a manufacturing hub for strategic energy storage components such as batteries and inverters.

On the topic of manufacturing incentives LS Energy Solutions supports the inclusion of inverters for advanced manufacturing credits and has requested the Treasury to go one step further to explicitly include storage inverters for those benefits.

Outside of IRA becoming law other noteworthy gains and steps have been in the area of interconnection reform as FERC as well as a few ISOs under its jurisdiction have started on the path of streamlining of interconnection rules that will enable deployment of the massive backlog of solar wind and storage assets.

Ravi Manghani director of strategy and analytics LS Energy Solutions

This year IHI Terrasun launched our next generation power plant software for control advanced diagnostic and monitoring of storage and solar-plus-storage systems. This solution allows for vendor-agnostic integration as well as augmentation and long-term power plant maintenance. We’ve built an analytical system for monitoring and diagnostic of assets so we’re able to provide bankable 10- and 20-year long-term service agreements (LTSAs) and at times even longer such as the work we’ll be doing for the Gemini Solar and Storage project in Nevada.

The biggest step forward for the industry and one that is long overdue is the development of diversified supply chains for batteries. The world will have so much demand as we electrify everything from cars to mobile phones all of which will need batteries.

So far battery production has been centred in China with very few limited options outside. With the IRA there is now ample incentive for US-based manufacturing of batteries and we hope to see those incentives adopted around the world to create a truly diverse supply chain.

The industry faced some well-documented challenges during the year with the highest profile being supply chain constraints. How have those challenges affected the industry and how should they be confronted?

The challenges affecting battery storage and solar projects have been a huge topic this year. These challenges affected not only the supply but also costs related to projects forcing our independent power customers to renegotiate their power purchase agreements (PPAs). Despite the challenges the impacts have mostly resulted in project delays instead of outright projects being cancelled.

The height of the supply chain challenges will be an inflection point in our industry along with the IRA as we evaluate our supply models and as the industry looks to diversify the supply chain across multiple continents.

Tom Cornell Senior VP of energy storage Mitsubishi Power Americas

For the US to truly see the fruits of accelerated renewable deployments including storage a lot of manufacturing will have to be onshored and re-shored.

Without a clear roadmap for such the industry is destined to face the pains of extended delivery times higher costs and trade policy-related uncertainties. For instance we saw lead times of 60-70 weeks on transformers and lead times of similar scale on other components needed to integrate storage solutions.

In addition to these delays the industry has also had to open to alternate suppliers and in general expand the universe of suppliers to mitigate availability constraints. While a diversity of suppliers is generally good for competition it has also opened up the need for robust quality control.

Ravi Manghani director of strategy and analytics LS Energy Solutions

Source diversification is the best solution to bottlenecks and constraints. Right now China is effectively the only lithium refiner in the world. That must change if we are to succeed in creating a robust supply chain and enable worldwide manufacturing of Lithium-ion-based batteries.

We have also seen promising development of non-lithium technologies such as sodium and zinc-based energy storage systems which also hold promise in diversifying the supply chain.

Another important topic that does not get enough attention is the shortage of skilled labour in the electrical fields from master electricians to electrical engineers who are going to be needed over the next 30 years to achieve the transition to renewable energy.

More skilled workers retire every year than enter the profession so there is already a shortage. Add to that the growing demand of renewable energy transition and the country will be unable to meet our climate targets in 2030.

This is a great opportunity to train and invest in our young adults who could secure well-paying jobs for decades to come. To meet the need we must invest in outreach workforce training and retraining and mentoring. Plenty of great work is already being done to address this problem but it will need to be significantly scaled if we want to build the solar wind and storage installations that will power our lives in 2030 2040 and beyond.

Ray Saka VP sales product management and services IHI Terrasun

Which technology and industry trends would you recommend our readers keep a close eye on in 2023?

There are several trends around energy storage people should keep a close eye on in 2023:

The improvement in lithium-Ion cell technology that currently exists. We are typically deploying 280 amp hour (Ah) cells and are moving toward over 300Ah cells which will improve Lithium Ion’s density and more cost effective.

Developments in other cell chemistries including Sodium-ion as more R&D investment is placed in it

Longer duration storage in the 8-hour and above range through some demonstration projects using flow and nickel hydrogen-based technologies

Tom Cornell Senior VP of energy storage Mitsubishi Power Americas

At the risk of sounding a pessimist 2023 in many ways will look a lot like 2022 in terms of battery costs and supply tightness. 2022 is primed to end with lithium carbonate prices at an all-time high and while the larger economy is slowing down after a year of high inflation I suspect that the prices in 2023 will be a bit stickier in the energy storage world. There are certainly some promising trends to look out for such as higher energy density products from several LFP suppliers and further commercial advancement from a few non-lithium technologies.

Ravi Manghani director of strategy and analytics LS Energy Solutions

2022 has been a big year for many companies and consortiums to announce giga-sized battery factory plants in the US.

While it takes years to build a factory in 2023 we will begin to see whether these plans materialise into ground-breaking ceremonies which will determine the trajectory of the rest of the ‘20s decade. If we see factories being built we can expect an ease in the constriction of the battery supply in three to four years. If we don’t batteries will continue to stay a prime commodity.

Ray Saka VP sales product management and services IHI Terrasun

LS Energy Solutions’ AiON ESS made its debut in the field this year. Image: LS Energy Solutions.

What are the biggest priorities for your company and for the wider industry in 2023 and beyond?

Managing growth. With the rapid industry growth and expanding market opportunities we are expanding our team to double its current size in the next 12 months while balancing the need for capital investment into people and R&D efforts supporting product development.

Successful Implementation of 2GWh of projects. We will always prioritise the commitments made to our customers to deliver projects in a safe and reliable way.

Understanding and leveraging the effects of the IRA. When the treasury department guidance is out this will shape our strategy going forward with domestic content.

We will also be keeping an eye on what happens with Canada’s version of the IRA over the next year as well.

Tom Cornell Senior VP of energy storage Mitsubishi Power Americas

Our priority for 2023 is to start delivering 100+ MWh project orders and we’re extremely proud of what we’ve accomplished with the AiON product in such a short amount of time.

Additionally we will be adding more product options for our customers in terms of capacity and technology options. We want our customers to able to have a variety of solutions to choose from all standardised and factory assembled to provide ease of onsite installation and reliable operation.

This pretty much dovetails into the biggest priorities for the industry – scale standardisation and certainty. Scale is a well-understood requirement and doesn’t need elaboration.

For the industry to become more robust and yes profitable we need to move away from selling projects to selling products and for our developer customers to be able to operate portfolios of assets. That’s how we grow and do so taking on proportionate levels of risk.

Ravi Manghani director of strategy and analytics LS Energy Solutions

Creating a diversified supply for batteries and power conversion systems (PCS) is top of mind. Going further we will be looking at ways to offer more functionality (application stacking) from energy storage systems.

Right now most installations are used to perform only one to three applications usually storing electricity that would otherwise be curtailed but storage can offer so much more for the electricity grid with correct system design and the right power plant controller.

For any industry having a single source of any product is risky so diversification will be essential across the board next year and beyond.

Demand for energy storage is already heating up and with the IRA and the energy crisis in Europe and around the world the push for additional energy storage resources will continue to accelerate. In 2023 we will see whether the supply constraints begin to ease up so the demand can be met with supply.

The two prominent comedians are currently scheduled to peform five dates through late January in cities across Oklahoma Missouri Tennessee Alabama and South Carolina. The tour will kick off at Oklahoma City's Paycom Center and tickets go on sale 10 a.m. Friday at ticketmaster.com.

The duo previously had headlined a joint tour in December 2022 where they made crowds laugh in San Diego San Francisco and Phoenix. They also toured the U.K in September.

Rock and Chappelle rose to fame in past decades for their comic routines and sketches humorously exposing diagnosing and lampooning political hypocrisy racial identity and cultural issues building on the foundation of predecessors such as Richard Pryor and George Carlin.

In 2022 however both men were in the headlines after various controversies.

Last March Rock was the victim of ""the slap heard 'round world"" when actor Will Smith walked onstage during the Academy Awards and smacked the comedian across the face in response to a joke Rock made about Smith's wife actress Jada Pinkett Smith.

Meanwhile Chappelle placed himself within a media firestorm attracting criticism for jokes on ""Saturday Night Live"" in his Netflix special ""The Closer"" and on other stages that some people condemned as antisemitic and transphobic. Chappelle also was the victim of an assault at the Hollywood Bowl in May by a man who claimed his jokes about the LGBTQ community and homelessness were ""triggering"" and stormed the stage lunging at Chappelle and tackling the comedian to the ground before security detained him.

According to the venue's website the Jan. 20 event at Paycom Center is being advertised as a ""phone-free experience"" where the use of mobile phones smart watches and other accessories will be prohibited in the performance space.

Once guests arrive at the venue all mobile devices and accessories are to be secured in individual Yondr pouches that they will be allowed to hold on to throughout the show and then reopen at the end of the event. Guests will only be allowed to access their devices in a designated Phone Use Area at the venue and must re-secure them in the Yondr pouches before returning to the performance area.

""Anyone seen using a device (phone smart watch or accessories) during the performance will be escorted out of the venue by security"" the notice reads. ""We appreciate your cooperation in creating a phone-free experience.""

Hospira which is owned by Pfizer recalled one lot of its vancomycin hydrochloride injection vials at the 1.5-gram dose because of glass particles in the vials.

Accord for its part pulled a lot of 500-mg daptomycin after receiving a complaint from a hospital pharmacy about mislabeled cartons.

In the lot of Hospira injections one vial was observed with two visible glass particles in it the FDA said in a recall announcement in late December. Pfizer has not received reports of adverse events related to the recall the agency added. The lot contained 100 vials and was distributed nationwide in the U.S. and Puerto Rico from June 23 through Sept. 19.

As for Accord its 500 mg daptomycin injections have been pulled for being incorrectly labeled as another dosage strength.

Both companies and the FDA ask that wholesalers distributors doctors and institutions with discontinue use of the lots and stop distribution.

Daptomycin is used to treat complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by certain bacteria. Vancomycin hydrochloride meanwhile is an antibiotic approved to treat serious or severe infections caused by certain strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococci which is known as a superbug that can cause difficult to treat staph infections. The antibiotic can also treat septicemia bone infections lower respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections.

This wasn't Hospira’s first recall of 2022. In June the company kicked off a similar recall after an internal inspection found visible particles in two vials of its 100-mL propofol injectable emulsion.

Faced with the possibility of going into the luxury tax next season the New Orleans Pelicans could going into the offseason trying to cut payroll with several trade candidates on their roster.

Michael Scotto said on the latest episode of the HoopsHype podcast that CJ McCollum is ""not untouchable"" in trade talks but he's considered a ""grown-up in the room for a young Pelicans squad providing stability on the court and a good locker room presence for the team.""

The Pelicans currently have $167.4 million in salary on their books for next season. That total doesn't include cap holds that bring their total up to $199.7 million which is nearly $10 million over the projected second tax apron.

Jonas Valančiūnas who has a $23.2 million cap hold is the biggest question mark for the Pelicans among their potential free agents.

ESPN's Bobby Marks noted the Pelicans have never paid the luxury tax in franchise history and the front office's decision regarding Valančiūnas and Naji Marshall who is also a free agent will determine if the club has the full nontaxpayer mid-level exception of $12.9 million or the taxpayer mid-level of $5.1 million available.

Of the potential trade candidates for the Pelicans Brandon Ingram has been the most-talked about thus far. The 26-year-old will be playing on a $36 million expiring contract next season but his deal includes a 15 percent trade kicker that could complicate any potential deal.

ESPN's Brian Windhorst has cited the Philadelphia 76ers as a potential landing spot for Ingram this summer. Scotto noted rival executives consider him to be the ""most likely"" Pelicans player to be moved because the fit on the court ""isn't ideal"" with Zion Williamson.

Next season will mark the first year of McCollum's two-year $64 million deal he signed in September 2022. The contract has descending salaries of $33.3 million in 2024-25 and $30.7 million in 2025-26 that could make it easier to trade.

The Pelicans have invested a lot of money in this core that hasn't produced great results. They have made the playoffs in two of the past three years but lost in the first round both times. They were swept by the Oklahoma City Thunder this year with Williamson unavailable due to a hamstring injury he suffered in the play-in tournament loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi2AFodHRwczovL25ld3MucGcuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvbmV3cy1kZXRhaWxzLzIwMjQvUHJvY3Rlci0tR2FtYmxlLVJlY2FsbHMtOC4yLU1pbGxpb24tRGVmZWN0aXZlLUJhZ3Mtb2YtVGlkZS1HYWluLUFjZS1hbmQtQXJpZWwtTGF1bmRyeS1EZXRlcmdlbnQtUGFja2V0cy1EaXN0cmlidXRlZC1pbi1VUy1EdWUtdG8tUmlzay1vZi1TZXJpb3VzLUluanVyeS9kZWZhdWx0LmFzcHjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Procter & Gamble Recalls 8.2 Million Defective Bags of Tide Gain Ace and Ariel Laundry Detergent Packets ...,"Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) today announced a voluntary packaging recall of Tide Pods Gain Flings Ace Pods and Ariel Pods liquid laundry detergent packets packaged in flexible film bags.

For information about the voluntary packaging recall visit www.pg.com/bags. (Photo: Business Wire)

The outer packaging meant to prevent access to the contents can split open near the zipper track posing a risk of serious injury to children and other vulnerable populations if the contents of the laundry detergent packets are ingested as well as posing a risk of skin or eye injuries. Ingestion of a large quantity of any surfactant-containing household cleaning products can cause death among individuals with underlying health issues.

P&G will Refund and Replace Affected Product Packages

Consumers should immediately secure the recalled bags out of sight and reach of children and contact Procter & Gamble for a full refund and a free replacement child resistant bag to store the product. Consumers can also receive a cabinet lock for securing laundry materials.

Consumers should check to see if their bag is part of the recall by checking the lot code on their bag. Recalled lot codes will be listed at www.pg.com/bags and can be found on the bottom of the bag package. Consumers with recalled bags can submit a photo of the recalled product showing the lot code to participate in the recall.

Consumer Contact Information

Consumers can contact Procter & Gamble toll-free at 833-347-5764 from Monday through Friday 9 AM ET to 6 PM ET Saturday 9 AM ET to 5:30 PM ET or online at www.pg.com/bags.

Recall Details

This recall involves about 8.2 million units sold in the U.S. and about 56741 sold in Canada of certain lot codes of Tide Pods Gain Flings Ace Pods and Ariel Pods liquid laundry detergent packets packaged in flexible film bags that were manufactured between September 2023 and February 2024.

There have been no confirmed cases of incidents or injuries directly relating to this packaging defect. P&G has received four reports of children in the United States accessing the liquid laundry packets three of which reported ingestion during the time period that the recalled lots were sold but it is not known if these laundry packets came from recalled bags.

Affected packages were sold at Big Lots CVS Family Dollar Home Depot Sam’s Club Target Walmart and other major stores nationwide and online at Amazon.com and other websites from September 2023 through present for between $5 (one 12 ct. bag) and $30 (four 39 ct. bags in a box).

Star fund manager Terry Smith has sold online payments firm PayPal and accounting software group Intuit from his £22.5 billion Fundsmith Equity fund.

The US companies began 2022 in his top 10 positions but a dreadful year for expensive technology stocks meant they slipped off the factsheet before Smith ditched them in December.

“We sold our stakes in Intuit and PayPal during the month” Smith wrote in his December 2022 update to investors. He did not shed further light on why the two firms had been sold.

Intuit shares fell 36% last year while PayPal’s dropped 63%. The accounting group moved from a price-to-earnings (p/e) ratio of 84 at the start of the year to 56 today as investors punished expensive shares as interest rates rose. PayPal’s valuation has also been hit dropping from a p/e of 45 to 36 over the past year according to data from Morningstar.

PayPal’s decline was more extreme due to disappointing revenue growth last year as e-commerce growth slowed following rapid expansion in 2020 and 2021.

PayPal has also caused a headache for other well-known fund managers. Blue Whale Growth fund manager Stephen Yiu sold the company in February 2022 but Nick Train’s Lindsell Train Global Equity still holds it.

In November we reported that Smith had dumped 4040576 shares of PayPal or around 40% of his investment and 674761 shares of Intuit around 30% of his position.

Smith’s allocation to tech stocks has fallen even as he has continued to buy shares in the sector adding Alphabet Amazon Adobe and Apple over the past two years.

His largest bet is consumer staples at 33.8% of the fund followed by healthcare at 26% and then technology at 20.7%. Consumer staples and healthcare have been among the top sectors over the past 12 months as investors have put a premium on steady earnings that are resistant to economic slowdowns.

Fundsmith Equity recorded its first ever annual loss last year of -13.8%. Since launch in 2010 it has compounded at 15.5% annually returning 478% compared with 258% for the MSCI World index.

In December the top five contributors in the month were Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) Novo Nordisk A/S ADR (NYSE:NVO) Stryker Corp (NYSE:SYK) Nike(NYSE:NKE) and Philip Morris (NYSE:PM). The top five detractors were Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF.A) Amazon Alphabet and Diageo (LSE:DGE)."

For many swimming in college is a lifelong dream that is pursued with dedication and determination. Fitter and Faster is proud to honor these athletes and those who supported them on their journey.

Brasen Walker  a 6’2” 200-pound breaststroker from Angier North Carolina announced in November his verbal commitment to North Carolina State University for the 2024-25 school year and beyond.

“NC State has been my dream school since I started swimming. They have a phenomenal swim team and I am from North Carolina. I look forward to helping NC State bring a National Championship home to the state of North Carolina!!”

Walker is in the class of 2024 at the online Citizens High School; he swims year-round with Raleigh Swim Association and is a Summer Nationals qualifier in the 100 breast and a U.S. Open qualifier in the 200 breast. He was an A-finalist in both events at 2022 Winter Juniors East where he placed third in the 100 (54.00) and eighth in the 200 (1:58.87). His slightly faster times in prelims were PBs in both distances (53.74/1:58.03). Last summer he competed at Speedo Junior Nationals in the same two events clocking PBs of 1:02.74/2:20.03 and placing eighth in the 100 breast. Those were significant improvements on his previous best times which he had swum two weeks earlier at the North Carolina LSC Long Course State Championships. There he won the 100 breast (1:03.70) and came in third in the 200 breast (2:22.55).

Walker will be a great addition to the Wolfpack’s class of 2028 –which has also received verbals from #11 Nolan Dunkel #12 Matt Marsteiner and Simon Bermudez– with breaststroke times that would already make C finals at the ACC Championships. He still has a good year-and-a-half to develop his third event and he competed in the 50/100 free 100 back 100 fly and 200 IM at various meets throughout the summer.

Best SCY times:

100 breast – 53.74

200 breast – 1:58.03

Muncrief methodically but rapidly built up WPX Energy Inc. through West Texas and New Mexico’s liquids-rich Delaware Basin after he took over in 2014. Now he remains focused on the Delaware as the jewel of a multibasin portfolio after WPX combined with Oklahoma City rival Devon Energy Corp. in a $5.75 billion so-called merger of equals.

""It’s driven by the geology and the amount of raw resources in the Delaware” Muncrief told Hart Energy. “The Permian is a place we’re very very comfortable with and very very proud of.""

Muncrief promotes a bold and decisive acquisition approach while still holding dear to strategic and conservative fiscal values. He positioned WPX in the Delaware—while divesting in gassy noncore areas—and is now further diversifying the merged Devon Energy he took over in the Williston and Eagle Ford shale plays through the recent acquisitions of RimRock Oil & Gas and Validus Energy respectively.

That intrepid attitude proved imperative in 2020 when Devon and WPX took action in an industry that initially halted all dealmaking during the pandemic.

“During the pandemic we felt like everyone was on their back heels. They were afraid to make a move” Muncrief said. “At Devon and WPX we felt like there were things that each of us needed. For WPX we needed a little more scale and inventory. Devon was concerned about a lot of exposure to federal lands. At WPX we didn’t have as much. That’s where it was truly a win-win.”

“The Permian is a place we’re very very comfortable with and very very proud of.” - Rick Muncrief Devon Energy

Now the combined Devon estimates its fourth-quarter production at about 650000 boe/d with roughly 65% of the volumes hailing from the Delaware. But the barrels were well more than 70% weighted toward the Delaware before the recent RimRock and Validus deals.

Gabriele Sorbara managing director of equity research at Siebert Williams Shank & Co. said acquisitions are not the red flags for investors that they were just before and during the pandemic. Companies need to build drilling inventory and they should if they have strong free cash flow like Devon.

“M&A isn’t the risk it used to be. M&A is good if you’ve got the cash and you can get the deal done” Sorbara said. “If there’s an opportunity Devon is taking it. It’s really important to have scale and use that cash in a productive way. We’re going to continue to see consolidation across the basins.”

Permian birthright

Born in Ardmore Okla. Muncrief moved to Odessa Texas in 1958—before he was old enough to remember—after his father started working in the Permian for El Paso Natural Gas.

They would later live in the Delaware Basin in Hobbs and Jal N.M.

At the time U.S. oil production remained on a steady rise. But at a domestic total of 7.1 MMbbl/d in 1957 the Permian still did not come near today’s record high of 5.5 MMbbl/d which is 45% of the nation’s daily production.

“It’s been a foundational basin for the U.S. energy picture” Muncrief said of the Permian.

And he is thrilled his father is still alive to see the growth today.

“He can’t believe the size of the facilities being built and the amount of gas and crude oil coming out of the Permian. The activity levels and efficiencies are what you really point to” Muncrief said. “I took him out to a field three or four years ago and he was just amazed. There’s a lot of the same country but just a lot more activity.”

Stationed at Devon’s headquarters in Oklahoma City today Muncrief left the Permian to graduate from high school in Oklahoma and to attend Oklahoma State University where he naturally majored in petroleum engineering technology.

Among other stops Muncrief loosely followed his father’s legacy working his way up at El Paso its acquirer Burlington and then ConocoPhillips Co. which ultimately swallowed up Burlington. In 2009 he eventually took over as senior vice president of operations and resource development at Harold Hamm’s Continental Resources Inc.

And then his big break came in 2014 when a struggling WPX Energy appointed him CEO.

Aiming for the Delaware

WPX spun off from midstream operator Williams Cos. at the end of 2011 so it could concentrate on exploration and production.

The company promptly struggled with a lack of crude oil exposure and challenging natural gas prices.

At the time WPX’s gas-weighted portfolio was only 20% liquids. Muncrief was hired to transform the company.

“We were in seven different basins at that time. The Permian was not one of those” Muncrief said dryly.

In mid-2015 after oil prices had plunged WPX made its first move to buy privately held RKI Exploration & Production for $2.35 billion because of its 92000 acres in the Delaware in Texas’ Loving County and New Mexico’s Eddy County.

“At that point in time the Delaware was really struggling. It was much more of a challenging area to drill and operate in than say the Midland side of the Permian” Muncrief said. “I think for us we went to the geology. That’s the thing that really took us to the Delaware Basin. There was a fair amount of development going on but we felt there were at least another two or three levels of efficiencies and capabilities that we would see in the Delaware.”

Five years later it turned out that the RKI deal made the Devon merger more practical. Much of RKI’s acreage bordered Devon’s position.

“That’s why ultimately down the road the merger made so much sense with the adjacency to the two companies’ acreage positions” Muncrief said.

But Muncrief and WPX did not stop there.

In a recovering but still-struggling industry in early 2017 WPX scooped up the Delaware assets of Panther Energy and Carrier Energy.

Then in late 2019 just prior to the pandemic WPX paid $2.5 billion to buy out privately held Felix Energy and its large Delaware position.

Eventually WPX’s seven basins—without a Permian footprint—turned into two with a big Delaware position and a solid Williston play.

As WPX was growing in the Delaware Neal Dingmann Truist Securities energy analyst said Muncrief was able to successfully pivot WPX to become a leader in shareholder returns at a time when investors were finally forcing producers to practice discipline.

“He’s a very disciplined CEO” Dingmann said. “The top leaders are great operators and they understand Wall Street—that’s a tough combination. Rick kind of checks all those boxes.”

Devon was not as analytical with its strategies before Muncrief took over sometimes following the trends set by its peers.

And in the years that WPX was growing in the Delaware Devon was mostly focused on divesting with some big buys mixed in between sales.

In Devon’s world

After making a big expensive buy in the Eagle Ford Shale i n 2013 amid high crude prices Devon largely focused on asset sales with some notable exceptions.

In 2014 Devon sold its noncore portfolio to now-defunct Linn Energy and used the proceeds to buy Oklahoma STACK acreage from Felix.

Then over three years Devon sold its Canadian upstream and midstream assets and its noncore Midland Basin acreage.

In 2020 and shortly before the WPX deal Devon sold its shale pioneering Barnett Shale gas assets to BKV Corp. which is now planning to go public under the strength of those gassy acres and natural gas prices.

Muncrief joked that he asked the Devon team why they made the Barnett deal before he took over. But then he responded seriously.

“I’ve asked myself that same thing of some of the things WPX sold. But here’s the thing” he said. “Those assets were sold at an attractive price but more importantly got you focused on and gave you cash to operate on some of your higher-margin and more profitable areas like the Delaware. There’s no regrets. You make those calls and take the proceeds and move on and reinvest them.”

Now apart from the Delaware Devon is positioned in the Anadarko Basin the Williston the Eagle Ford and the Powder River Basin. Those positions include newly acquired acreage from RimRock for $865 million cash in July and from Validus for $1.8 billion in cash in September.

“A multibasin multicommodity business is the one that’s going to be successful over the long haul” Muncrief said. “We all recognize the strength of our Delaware position but there’s also opportunities in other basins especially when you’re in the core of these basins like we are.”

And as long as prices and free cash flows remain healthy Devon will continue to eye potential growth moves. “We’ve always had a high bar” he said. “We’ve been real disciplined in our moves and I don’t think that’s going to change.”

Those types of bolt-on deals like RimRock and Validus in non-Delaware basins are critical for future growth said David Harris Devon’s executive vice president and chief corporate development officer in an interview with Hart Energy. He noted that both deals bring oil-weighted acreage positions close to Devon’s existing footprints.

“Scale matters as we’ve moved into this new era of unconventional development and we believe having really high-quality low-breakeven assets in the premiere basins around the country is an important part of that” Harris said. “We think being able to evaluate opportunities and places outside the Permian has given us the opportunity to find some unique value creation for our shareholders.”

Gabriele Sorbara said the Wall Street focus on single-basin companies is not as strong as before especially since it is so hard to still buy into the heart of the Permian.

“I think we’re in a different world today. Back in the day people wanted that pure-play focus. But I think multibasin is an advantage in this day and age” Sorbara said. “I think about who’s got the ability to sustain and thrive longer term. Devon is there.”

Forward financial focus

Muncrief took over as CEO of the combined Devon in early 2021 and quickly made waves in early May by announcing a pioneering dividend strategy—a fixed-plus-variable dividend—that was quickly followed by others making similar moves such as Pioneer Natural Resources Co. and ConocoPhillips.

The idea was to reward shareholders with a predictable fixed dividend and return more to investors on a quarterly basis when commodities prices are stronger—as has been the case through most of 2022.

“One of the things we heard from investors for a number of years is what do you do with those cash flows when they’re real strong” Muncrief said. “We had a history of putting it to work at the drill bit. We saw an opportunity to change that model. That’s where Devon landed with the ability to pay a really nice fixed dividend and the stronger cash flows allow for the variable dividend returning a substantial portion back to shareholders.”

When oil prices dipped in the fall so did the third-quarter dividend—albeit predictably. But analysts and investors also saw rising capital spending which is largely from inflation on services and lower-than-expected production guidance. So the stock price fell a bit in November from recent highs.

“We’ve been real disciplined in our moves and I don’t think that’s going to change.” - Rick Muncrief Devon Energy

But the longer-term optimism remains strong Sorbara said. “The guidance was a bit lower than expected and it raised some flags with investors. But Rick is a great leader. The assets are top notch. The whole industry has evolved and they’re pioneers. At some point the industry will pivot toward growth and Devon is perfectly situated.”

Looking forward Muncrief sees a company with strong productivity free cash flow and shareholder returns. But the overall industry challenges of inflation and well productivity will remain. He sees production volumes relatively flat in 2023 with some modest upside while running close to 25 rigs.

“I think we’re doing a good job of fighting the impacts of inflation. You’re still going to see those capital numbers go up across the board” he said. “I think we just need to stick to our guns. I think everyone is going to try to keep their volumes flat.”

Inflation is pushing the cost of wells up but Devon is saving time and money through efficiencies by cutting down on the amount of days to drill and complete wells. “You’re saving 10% on time by doing it more quickly and efficiently” he said. “We’ll see how it all plays out.”

Well productivity degradation is a real issue across the industry with companies drilling their best opportunities first he said but improving efficiencies and new exploration will help offset the weaknesses. That is the booming market scenario for the services sector with flat production requiring more activity he said.

But do not confuse that realism for a lack of optimism. There is a reason Devon is only hedging 20% to 30% on crude production and even less on natural gas he said. The global supply-and-demand outlook remains in Devon’s favor for some time he said. And that brings him back to his emphasis on discipline.

“We just need to be disciplined and patient and keep the market supplied” Muncrief said. “We do think there’s a supply tightness on the horizon. The U.S. SPR [Strategic Petroleum Reserve[ releases are just about over and we don’t even have China really reopened yet. So we see bullish indicators.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzAxLzAzLzIzLXRvcC1kaXZpZGVuZC1zdG9ja3MtdG8tYnV5LWFuZC1ob2xkLWluLTIwMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,23 Top Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2023,"These dividend stocks could reward investors in the new year and beyond.

No one knows for sure what the new year will bring for investors. However it's a good bet that quite a few solid companies will continue paying dividends quarter after quarter.

Some of them could also have significant upside potential over the next 12 months. Here are 23 top dividend stocks to buy and hold in 2023.

Energy

Energy stocks led the S&P 500 in 2022 and could very well soar again in the new year. Many of them offer especially juicy dividends to boot.

Stock Business Summary Dividend Yield 1. Brookfield Renewable Corporation BEPC 2.08% ) Renewable energy provider 4.6% 2. Brookfield Renewable Partners BEP 1.34% ) Renewable energy provider 5.2% 3. Chevron Integrated energy and chemicals producer 3.2% 4. Devon Energy DVN -1.44% ) Oil and gas producer 8.9% 5. Enterprise Products Partners Midstream energy services provider 7.8% 6. ONEOK Midstream energy services provider 5.7% 7. Pioneer Natural Resources PXD) Oil and gas producer 11.2%

Note that the first two stocks on the list share the same underlying business. Brookfield Renewable Partners is a limited partnership (LP). The company created a separate stock organized as a corporation (Brookfield Renewable Corporation) to enable investors to avoid some of the tax hassles associated with LPs.

Also the two stocks with the highest dividend yields -- Pioneer Natural Resources and Devon Energy -- pay a fixed-plus-variable dividend. The variable portion depends on the companies' excess free cash flow. Although there's no guarantee that Pioneer and Devon will be able to generate as much free cash flow in 2023 as they did last year their chances appear to be pretty good.

Healthcare

Big pharma companies often pay solid dividends. These three definitely qualify -- and they each handily beat the market in 2022.

Stock Business Summary Dividend Yield 8. AbbVie ABBV 0.22% ) Biopharmaceutical company 3.7% 9. Bristol Myers Squibb Biopharmaceutical company 3.2% 10. Johnson & Johnson JNJ 0.04% ) Biopharmaceutical consumer health and medical devices company 2.6%

AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson could be especially appealing to income investors because they're both Dividend Kings with at least 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. The new year will be one of big changes for the two companies.

AbbVie faces declining sales for its top-selling drug Humira due to biosimilar competition in the U.S. J&J plans to spin off its consumer-health unit in 2023. However both stocks should continue to be winners for investors over the long term.

Real estate

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are known for their high dividend yields. Below are some of the best REITs on the market.

Stock Business Summary Dividend Yield 11. Digital Realty Trust DLR -1.45% ) REIT focusing on data centers 4.8% 12. Easterly Government Properties DEA) REIT focusing on government properties 7.4% 13. Medical Properties Trust MPW 1.92% ) REIT focusing on hospitals 10.3% 14. Realty Income O 0.70% ) REIT focusing primarily on the retail market 4.7% 15. Rithm Capital RITM 0.53% ) REIT focusing on providing capital to financial services and real estate sectors 12.1% 16. W.P. Carey WPC 0.93% ) REIT focusing on multiple industries. 5.4%

All of these REIT stocks fell in 2022 with some declining sharply. However if the Federal Reserve stabilizes interest rates later this year the stocks could enjoy nice rebounds.

Technology/telecommunications

Most tech stocks don't pay dividends. The ones that do tend to offer relatively low dividend yields.

Telecom stocks on the other hand often have attractive yields. The following stocks illustrate both points.

Stock Business Summary Dividend Yield 17. Apple AAPL -0.69% ) Consumer technology company 0.73% 18. Microsoft MSFT 0.59% ) Software and devices maker 1.2% 19. Verizon Communications VZ 1.53% ) Telecommunications provider 6.7%

You probably won't buy Apple or Microsoft for their dividends. However these two beaten-down tech stocks could roar back in 2023.

Verizon likely won't deliver the long-term growth that these tech giants will over the long term. However it comes with a high dividend yield that income investors shouldn't ignore.

Other

The final members of our list of dividend stocks to buy and hold in 2023 span multiple sectors. All of them offer great dividends and solid long-term growth prospects.

Stock Business Summary Dividend Yield 20. Ares Capital ARCC 0.86% ) Business development company 10.3% 21. Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation BIPC -0.69% ) Infrastructure assets operator 3.7% 22. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners BIP 0.23% ) Infrastructure assets operator 4.6% 23. United Parcel Service Package delivery and logistics services provider 3.5%

Note that Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation and Brookfield Infrastructure Partners share the same underlying business (in a similar way that we saw earlier with the two Brookfield Renewable stocks). Investing in Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation doesn't have the tax complications of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners which is a limited partnership.

Ares Capital ranks among the smallest on the list of 23 dividend stocks with a market cap of under $10 billion. However it also pays one of the highest dividend yields.

“We are thrilled to build upon our partnership with PNC Bank to continue to support local artists and to highlight the importance of the arts in our communities” said Jennifer Grondahl Orioles Senior Vice President Community Development & Communications.

“PNC Bank is again honored to sponsor these important works for the benefit of all Oriole baseball fans and the Baltimore community in general” said Laura Gamble PNC Regional President for Greater Maryland. “These murals are a window to Baltimore’s celebrated past and shine a light on the future of our great city.”

The Oriole Park mural which is located near Legends Park and the Bullpen Picnic Area was created by globally renowned artist Logan Hicks. The mural depicts a bustling Eutaw Street celebrating the more than 72 million fans and visitors Oriole Park has brought to downtown Baltimore since the ballpark opened in 1992."

A uniform renewable energy tariff is expected to encourage distribution companies (DISCOM) to sign power purchase agreements (PPAs) and promote the development of the renewable energy sector. Currently DISCOMs often delay entering PPAs or force developers to renegotiate tariffs due to discovered tariffs being higher or lower than previous PPAs.

The uniform tariff will also help catalyze the wind sector which is experiencing a slowdown due to low tariffs discovered in reverse auctions.

The implementation of the central pooling mechanism will necessitate the upgrade of transmission infrastructure to increase the capacity of transmission corridors which will facilitate the development of more renewable energy ISTS projects.

Tariff calculation

The uniform renewable energy tariff will be determined by dividing the total amount to be paid under the power supply agreement for a given month by the total amount of electricity supplied.

However intermediary procurers which is likely to be Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) would be allowed to sell any unsold power to open access consumers at a price that is at least equal to the uniform renewable energy tariff. Any additional profits made from these sales above the uniform tariff must be adjusted for in the uniform renewable energy tariff for distribution licensees.

This could hint at the entry of SECI into the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment as the agency could don the role of both intermediary and implementing agency for central pooling.

During a panel discussion at Mercom India’s C&I Clean Energy Meet in Ahmedabad Ajay Kumar Sinha Additional General Manager of SECI said that SECI had held discussions with large businesses to assess the C&I market.",,,,,,

ESG columnist John Peiserich offers his take on the nuances of the rule and the ripple effects it might have.

The rule formally titled “Listing Standards for Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation Final Rule” requires clawing back incentive-based executive compensation that was awarded based on a company reaching certain financial targets if it is later discovered that those financials were inaccurately reported. It applies even if the executive cannot be found to be at fault for the error and would apply for both current and former executives.

However the final rule’s text includes language that wasn’t anticipated. It provides that executives can be made to disgorge the compensation even if the financial report reissue was to correct a nonmaterial error that may become material if left uncorrected — a “little r” restatement. Of course “big R” restatements those corrections that are issued because a financial statement was in error at the time of issuance can also trigger reimbursement.

The rule specifies the executives that are subject to clawback and defines an executive officer as “The issuer’s president principal financial officer principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer the controller) any vice-president of the issuer in charge of a principal business unit division or function (such as sales administration or finance) any other officer who performs a policy-making function or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the issuer. Executive officers of the issuer’s parent(s) or subsidiaries are deemed executive officers of the issuer if they perform such policy making functions for the issuer. In addition when the issuer is a limited partnership officers or employees of the general partner(s) who perform policy-making functions for the limited partnership are deemed officers of the limited partnership. When the issuer is a trust officers or employees of the trustee(s) who perform policy-making functions for the trust are deemed officers of the trust. Policy-making function is not intended to include policy-making functions that are not significant.”

The definition is broad and the inclusion of “any other officer who performs a policy-making function” seems to open the door to ESG policy-making officers like chief sustainability officers.

Defining materiality

Materiality in the ESG realm may be defined as information that is relevant and important to the effectiveness and financial significance of a specific effort that is part of a company’s ESG strategy. To be material the effort would be deemed fundamental to the long-term success of the company’s ESG strategy. However because different organizations issue ESG standards there may be different definitions of materiality viewed from the perspective of the company or from the perspective of an investor. This leads to potential confusion for both companies and investors at least until the SEC provides a definition of ESG materiality. Of course there is the existing obligation to report any material issue as part of the overall SEC requirements and a reported/reportable issue maybe ESG-related.

As for materiality from a financial reporting perspective my colleague Jean Chow-Callam a forensic accountant with over 25 years’ experience says companies need to look at issues both quantitatively and qualitatively. Until new rules or guidance or clarifications are provided on materiality on ESG impact by the SEC or other authorities materiality is that gray area and where impact to clients will differ depending on their specific circumstances.

Risks created by the final rule

The new final rule creates a risk related to ESG reporting for executives including those who are tasked with sustainability policy. Also executive risk is higher because of lack of certainty and specificity surrounding ESG reporting. This type of risk may not have been apparent to the C-suite when the push toward ESG report first began and has since gained momentum.

Jean agrees on the risk management perspective; in addition her big takeaway is that if it is established that there is or there needs to be a “restatement” then a company would most likely need to or want to conduct a corporate internal investigation to know the impact. What would be the clawback and how/why did it happen (regardless of a big or small “r”)?

From Jean’s perspective one component of the new requirement has significant impact and says “Further the final rules require specific disclosure of the listed issuer’s policy on recovery of incentive-based compensation and information about actions taken pursuant to such recovery policy. The amendments also require all listed issuers to: (i) file their written recovery policies as exhibits to their annual reports; (ii) indicate by check boxes on their annual reports whether the financial statements included in the filings reflect correction of an error to previously issued financial statements and whether any of those error corrections are restatements that required a recovery analysis; and (iii) disclose any actions they have taken pursuant to such recovery policies.”

When asked for her thoughts on whether the new rule creates higher executive risk Jean said that the short answer is “yes” but the real answer is more likely “it depends.” Considering her significant experience in compliance internal controls governance forensic accounting auditing fraud investigations and financial statement related matters if she says “it depends” it is most certainly a complicated issue.

Why ESG Programs Should Make Internal Audit an Ally Recent research shows internal audit functions are rarely involved in setting strategy for ESG or even in reviewing how goals are tracked and monitored. EY’s Kapish Vanvaria argues that ESG leaders should make friends with their internal audit colleagues — for everyone’s sake.

Conclusion

The new final rule is an interesting issue. The pending climate change disclosure rule from SEC which seems to have trouble getting out of the development stage will have an additive impact to the new final rule. The intersection of the new final rule and climate change disclosures create confusion and risk for the C-suite.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure."

Whether it’s meeting a new young homeowner for the first time or riding in an elevator with them Dr. Rick has quite the challenge in both 30-second spots.

In 'First Contact' a young homeowner calls in Dr. Rick to pay a visit to her husband who has fallen deep into Parentamorphosis. They spot him out the window pristinely cleaning his trash cans which are labeled with too many details like his name and address. You can never be too safe even with trash right? And don’t even get him started on the hedges...

With 'Elevator' Dr. Rick uses the experience of riding in a crowded elevator as a learning opportunity. Avoiding small talk and facing the doors with the rest of the crowd may seem like simple tasks but they can be especially hard for young homeowners. Luckily Dr. Rick is up for the challenge.

Sean McBride Arnold chief creative officer said: “The executions in this campaign that really demolish are the ones that manage to be universal and totally unexpected. These two new spots are perfect examples. Before I read the elevator script I’d never considered for a moment how a parent behaves in an elevator. But by the time I got to the second joke I’m nodding and laughing.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmVncm9jZXIuY29tL21lYWwtZGVsaXZlcnktY29tcGFueS1mcmVzaGx5LWNlYXNlcy1vcGVyYXRpb25z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meal Delivery Company Freshly Ceases Operations,"Freshly has revealed that it is ceasing its direct-to-consumer meal delivery service. The company updated its website in late December with the news.

The fresh-prepared meal delivery provider was founded in New York in 2015 and was acquired by Nestlé in late October 2020. The deal valued Freshly at $950 million with potential earnouts up to $550 million contingent to the successful growth of the business.

The following year as the company was riding the COVID-19 meal delivery wave Freshly revealed that it would open additional facilities in New Jersey and Georgia in 2022 to increase production and order fulfillment capacity. During the time the company was shipping more than 1 million meals per week to customers in 48 states.

However since then the nation has been hit with record high inflation. Consumers are analyzing their spending habits and luxuries like meal kit delivery are no longer deemed a necessity for cash-strapped shoppers.

Signs of the demise of Freshly’s consumer business appeared in November 2022. Nestlé and finance company L Catterton partnered to combine Freshly and Kettle Cuisine a manufacturer of fresh artisanal foods for retail and foodservice customers and gave L Catterton a majority stake in Freshly. The combined company is focused on offering a wide assortment of fresh food products to customers across geographies and a variety of channels.

Following this news Freshly shut down facilities and reduced its staff by hundreds across the country according to PYMNTS. A notice filed with the New York State Department of Labor in early December revealed that the company was laying off 138 employees in relation to a plant closure. Additionally a similar notice filed in Phoenix added another 329 employees to that total and another notice as reported by ABC15 Arizona showed that the company was laying off 454 workers in Maryland.

Other meal delivery companies are also strategizing to stay afloat amid the drop in pandemic-related demand for meal kits. For example as part of its cost-cutting plans New York-based Blue Apron said in early December that it was downsizing its corporate workforce by 10%. The news followed a disappointing third quarter as the number of Blue Apron customers fell by 7.7%.

Berlin-based HelloFresh released plans in October to shut down its Bay Area production facility in San Francisco. A letter to the California Employment Development Department dated Oct. 10 relayed the company’s decision to permanently close the plant on Dec. 11 resulting in the termination of 611 employees according to reports from MarketWatch.

HelloFresh’s third-quarter performance came in slightly below analyst expectations with the adjusted EBITDA measure of core profit falling 10% to nearly $72.3 million in U.S. dollars. High marketing costs contributed to the decline.

Meanwhile according to Freshly’s website consumers can continue to place orders through Jan. 17 2023. The final date of shipping will be Jan. 21 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53Z2x0Lm9yZy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjMtMDEtMDQvYW5hbHlzdC1zYXlzLWEtdm9sYXRpbGUteWVhci1mb3ItaW5zdXJhbmNlLW1heS1kZWxheS1zdGF0ZS1mYXJtcy1mYWxsLWFzLXRoZS1uYXRpb25zLXRvcC1hdXRvLWluc3VyZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Analyst: A volatile year may delay State Farm losing title of nation's top auto insurer,"An insurance analyst projects State Farm will fall behind Geico and Progressive as the nation's top auto insurer.

Jim Auden Fitch Ratings' head of property and casualty insurance had projected the takeover this year but now says that will likely be delayed after a difficult year for all auto insurers.

“Inevitably Geico and Progressive will pass them up probably not in ’23 based on this recent shift and trend but those companies continue to (succeed) in their chosen business” Auden said on WGLT's Sound Ideas.

Andrew Collings/Andrew Collings/Andrew Collings Photography Fitch Ratings: Jim Auden

Auden said Geico and Progressive are well positioned to challenge State Farm effectively using risk selection and sophisticated pricing to maximize profits.

State Farm has a 16.4% share of the U.S. auto insurance market according to Fitch. Geico is second at 14.7%. Progressive is third at 14.1%.

Auden said auto insurers enjoyed record profits in 2020 when people started driving less. He said claims rose dramatically over the last two years along with higher costs for replacement parts and more litigation to challenge the costlier claims.

State Farm posted a net underwriting loss of $4.57 billion in the third quarter of 2022 in auto claims according to S&P Global. The loss was reportedly $1 billion larger than State Farm’s worst quarter in 21 years.

Auden noted State Farm saw a 10% gain in auto premium value through the first nine months of 2022 outpacing Geico and Progressive — though he said that gain is likely due in part to rate increases.

“They are raising rates too” Auden said of Geico and Progressive “but their policy count growth has not gone up as much.”

Auden said even if State Farm is supplanted as the auto insurance leader it should not be any cause for concern about the company’s strength.

“Maybe it’s bragging rights mostly” Auden said. “I would think State Farm has a very large number of employees and they will continue to in the future.”

In response to this story a spokesperson for State Farm said the insurer is on pace for another record year of auto growth.

“We are proud to insure more personal autos than any other insurer and will continue to relentlessly focus on serving our customers” State Farm public affairs specialist Gina Morss-Fischer said in a statement.



Are agents needed?

The rise of online insurance companies could prompt traditional insurers such as State Farm to reduce its number of agents over time Auden said but he stressed brick-and-mortar insurance firms will probably always keep some local agents.

“I can see that the share of local agents continuing to decline but not entirely going away” Auden said.

Recent surveys show State Farm scores better in customer loyaltythan Geico and Progressive.

State Farm is far and away the leading home insurer with 21% of all policies in the U.S. Allstate is second at 9%.

Auden said he doesn't expect State Farm’s top ranking in property to change anytime soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzcmVjb3JkLmNvbS9raW1iZXJsZXktZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtbGF1bmNoZXMtbmV3LWFmZm9yZGFibGUtbGluZS1vZi1ob3VzaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kimberley Development launches new affordable line of housing,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.businessrecord.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /kimberley-development-launches-new-affordable-line-of-housing/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E26D7A90>, 'Connection to www.businessrecord.com timed out.

The research arm of warehouse developer Prologis is fresh out with seven major predictions for 2023 – let’s take a look. Supply Chain Digest Says... Build-to-suit rents will reach new levels in the U.S. and EU as market rents are capitalized at 5% despite falling land and construction costs. What do you say? Click here to send us your comments Click here to see reader feedback Prediction #1: U.S. warehouse development starts will drop to a 7-year low even as rent growth exceeds 10%. Key factors: • Driven by a rapid rise in the cost of capital development starts will decline by 60% to less than 175 million square feet in 2023. We’ve already seen quarterly starts fall 30% from their peak in Europe and expect a similar pattern in the U.S. • A pullback of this magnitude would create a shortage of space in 2024. The pipeline will drop from over 500 million square feet in Q3 2022 to 275 by year-end 2023. • Low vacancy rates will produce another year of double-digit rent growth. Even if new demand fell to zero the national vacancy rate would increase by just 260 bps to 5.9% well below the long-term average. Prediction #2: After leading for 25-plus years California’s barriers to development will permanently constrain logistics demand allowing Texas to become the #1 state for net absorption.

Key factors: • California is short on developable land and barriers to supply are rising. By November 2022 for example one-third of the buildings under construction in the Inland Empire were in municipalities that had proposed or enacted local moratoriums on industrial development. Limits on future development in these areas would increase the value of existing properties and creates challenges for customers looking to grow. • Texas demand drivers are accelerating. Population growth is expected to continue and regionalizing supply chains will send more goods through Mexico and Texas Prediction #3: Mexico demand will hit a new annual record as nearshoring drives expansion along the border. Key factors: • Nearshoring-related expansions made up half of new leasing in 2022. Monterrey Juarez and Tijuana were the primary beneficiaries. • Increased deliveries in 2023 will allow for more absorption because the vacancy rate is at an all-time low. The under-construction pipeline rose to a record 25 million square feet in Q3 while vacancy fell to 1.4%. Prediction #4: India will rise to the third-most-active country for development starts behind the U.S. and China.

Key factors: • India is becoming more investable as demand drivers evolve. The combination of strong demographics increasing exports favorable regulatory and tax policy changes and improving infrastructure have attracted capital to India producing dry powder for logistics development. • India was fourth in 2022 more than doubling the volume of development starts in only five years and overtaking Europe’s most active development markets.

(See More Below)



CATEGORY SPONSOR: SOFTEON Prediction #5: Build-to-suit rents will reach new levels in the U.S. and EU as market rents are capitalized at 5% despite falling land and construction costs. Key factors: • Financial market volatility has led to markedly higher costs of capital. Lending costs have risen substantially as central banks increased rates with the 10-year T-bond hovering between 3.7 to 4.1% in November 2022. • Construction cost softness lags economic cycles. Costs may respond eventually to the overall economic landscape but they haven’t yet. We estimate 10-15% decline in construction costs by year-end 2023 back-loaded in the second half of the year.

Prologis Predicts New Warehouse Construction will Drop Sharply in 2023 Prediction #6: Ecommerce leasing will bounce back to become the second-most-active year record (after 2021). Key factors: • Ecommerce sales are re-accelerating as the outsized desire for in-person experiences diminishes and the e-commerce value proposition for consumers remains intact. We maintain our prediction that >25% of retail goods will be sold through online channels by 2025 up from 15% in 2019. • Leasing activity is re-accelerating. Prologis’s proportion of new leases signed by e-commerce customers rose to more than 17% in Q3 from a trough of 13% in Q1 2022 lifted by a record diversity of customers as parcel networks expand mid-size retailers improve service levels and new concepts emerge. • Parcel delivery costs remain high. Online retailers will look to network design to achieve both cost savings and sustainability goals. Specifically adding an urban hub to the end of e-fulfillment supply chains can yield cost and environmental efficiencies of 50% on average by shortening the final mile. Prediction #7: Demand for sustainable warehouses will grow rapidly. Installed warehouse rooftop solar capacity will double and EV truck charging capacity will exceed 10 megawatts. Supporting facts: • Building future-proof facilities can shield logistics companies from future operational risks including changing regulations community resistance and volatile fossil fuel-based energy pricing. Costs for sustainable building and operations are dropping. Government incentive programs and the European energy crisis have the power to turbocharge these longer-term trends. • In California a commission found that 157000 rapid chargers will be needed by 2030 to support fleet electrification and achieve the state’s carbon reduction goals. (Prologis which already invests in commercial EV infrastructure has committed to installing 1 gigawatt of solar by 2025.) • In Europe cities with low-emission transportation zones comprise more than 60% of logistics markets as of 2022 up from less than 25% in 2015. So there you have it - seven predictions on the marketor waehouse space in 2023from Prologis. The company says it got almost all its 2022 predictions right by the way.

The Prudential (LSE:PRU) share price fell 12% over the course of 2022. But the life insurer bounced back in the final months of the year on hopes of improving profits in China.

The overwhelming view among City brokers is that now is a good time to buy the FTSE 100 company too. Of the 19 analysts with ratings on Prudential shares a whopping 17 rate the company as a ‘buy’. One person is neutral on the business while one has placed a ‘sell’ on it. That’s according to stock screener Digital Look.

Will the Prudential share price continue to rebound? And should I buy the Asia-focussed business for my portfolio in 2023?

3 reasons to buy

The ongoing battle against Covid-19 in China weighed on investor appetite for ‘The Pru’ last year. But news from the company’s flagship marketplace has been much more encouraging in recent months.

Beijing has now dropped its zero tolerance approach to infections and ended lockdowns. There are rumours too that lawmakers may reopen the border between the mainland and Hong Kong possibly as soon as next week.

Improving economic conditions in China and South-East Asia are critical for Prudential. It’s bet big on Asia and hived off its UK and US operations to concentrate on this underexploited territory. It’s a strategy that could pay off handsomely as wealth levels in these emerging markets steadily grow.

Analysts at GlobalData reckon life insurance written premiums in Asia Pacific will rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5% between 2021 and 2026.

I think Prudential’s exceptional brand power gives it an edge in this fast-growing market as well. Brand recognition is a particularly potent weapon when it comes to financial services. And the business has spent 175 years building its reputation as one of the most trusted life insurance providers out there.

2 reasons to avoid

The story of Prudential’s share price in 2023 will be dominated by the coronavirus crisis in China. And while things are moving in the right direction a fresh explosion in infection numbers could see mass lockdowns reintroduced.

The subsequent hit to life insurance demand could pull the company’s share price lower again. It could also affect the level of dividends the company pays out if profits tank.

It’s also important to consider that other financial services companies are also aggressively investing in Asia. Prudential may have a difficult time trying to grow earnings as major rivals like Allianz and Ping An expand.

The verdict

On balance however I think the life insurer is a great stock to own for for the long term. It’s why I continue to hold the shares I first bought two years ago.

City analysts think Prudential’s earnings will rebound 80% in 2023. This leaves the company trading on a forward price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio of just 0.2 well below the bargain benchmark of 1. At these prices I’m considering buying more shares this January.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIzMDEwMzAwNTYwMS9lbi9Hcm93dGgtSW52ZXN0aW5nLVBpb25lZXItYW5kLUplbm5pc29uLUFzc29jaWF0ZXMtRm91bmRlci1TcGlyb3MtJUUyJTgwJTk4U2lnJUUyJTgwJTk5LVNlZ2FsYXMtSGFzLVBhc3NlZC1Bd2F50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Growth Investing Pioneer and Jennison Associates Founder Spiros 'Sig' Segalas Has Passed Away,"NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jennison Associates announced with great sadness the death of Spiros “Sig” Segalas co-founder and long-time Large Cap Growth portfolio manager. Segalas was a pioneer in growth equity investing and built one of the industry’s longest growth equity track records.

Segalas founded Jennison Associates in 1969 along with six co-founders and managed Jennison client portfolios for more than five decades. He was instrumental in building Jennison from its beginnings as a large cap growth specialist manager to becoming a preeminent institutional investment management firm with world-class equity and fixed income capabilities and clients around the world. Over his career Segalas earned industry accolades including Institutional Investor’s Money Manager of the Year and U.S. Investment Management Awards.

Segalas served as an officer in the U.S. Navy before starting his investment career. Beginning as a bank research analyst he learned the value of independent research and long-term investment thinking which remain at the core of Jennison’s investment philosophy today. The firm’s investment approach across teams continues to be driven by proprietary fundamental investment research dedicated to building deep knowledge of industries and companies. This approach has served clients well for more than 50 years.

Segalas built a firm steeped in values which are foundational to Jennison’s culture to this day. He understood the importance of inclusion long before it took the meaning it has today hiring some of the first women investors in the industry in the 1970s. Independent thinking diversity of perspectives and experiences and talent development remain essential to Jennison’s culture and hiring and promotion practices.

Segalas remained an active contributor and Large Cap Growth portfolio manager until his death at age 89. Jennison has always had robust succession plans in place to ensure seamless oversight of the investment teams and client portfolios. Kathleen McCarragher will continue to lead the Large Cap Growth team alongside Blair Boyer who together have more than 50 years’ experience with the firm. McCarragher has led the Large Cap Growth team for nearly 20 years with Boyer as co-head since 2019. They along with Jennison portfolio managers and analysts who average 20 years at the firm have continued to practice the team-oriented approach in which Segalas so firmly believed. CEO Jeffrey Becker who joined Jennison in 2016 will continue to lead the firm. There will be no change to the investment process and no impact to the daily management of client portfolios.

Becker said “I have deep respect and admiration for Sig and the legacy he has left at Jennison and across the industry. He will be greatly missed by all of us at Jennison. Our team feels a deep responsibility to live up to the values and commitment to excellence he embodied.”

Jennison expresses deepest condolences to Segalas’ family friends and colleagues.

The tests in Martin and St. Luicie counties along an 11-mile stretch of the 129-mile segment of Florida East Coast Railway main line between Cocoa and West Palm Beach will see passenger trains operating up to that speed as soon as all Federal Railroad Administration-mandated test results are validated and remaining infrastructure improvements are completed.

Meanwhile the FRA has released Brightline’s plan for the sealed corridor west of Cocoa to Orlando International Airport. Unlike FECRs recently double-tracked north-south route which contains 156 highway and pedestrian crossings the 39-mile east-west trackage is crossing-free and engineered for 125-mph operation.

Overall construction is 87% complete and involved 6.6 million employee-hours of work through the end of 2022.

South of Cocoa work continues around the new double-track fixed spans at Crane Creek Turkey Creek and the Sebastian River. Rehabilitation of the single-track St. Lucie River drawbridge at Stuart Fla. will include replacing key structural components upgrading mechanical drive and electrical control systems and installing a bridge monitor countdown clock and a bridge app for mariners similar to the one the company uses at the Fort Lauderdale bridge.

Dual ATC/PTC system planned for 125-mph corridor

In December Brightline requested FRA approval to field test its Interoperable Electronic Train Management System (I-ETMS) between Cocoa and Orlando.

The request includes a description of the company’s “Concept of Operations” and specific test procedures. The proposed plans are available through the federal register website which has links to Docket FRA-2022-0098. The FRA will consider public comments submitted through Feb. 21 2023.

The downloadable documents consist of a 54-page test plan and appendices totaling 536 pages including Brightline and FECR operating rules and track charts of the Orlando extension. For this 39-mile segment the company’ proposes an Automatic Train Control and cab signal add-on “that supplements the Centralized Traffic Control system of blocks. In positive train control territory the I-ETMS PTC system will “supplement the ATC system to include enforcement of permanent and temporary speed restrictions and mandatory directives.” On the extension the ATC and I-ETMS PTC systems are to work in tandem utilizing a serial communication interface.

“The PTC system will send a message to the ATC system requesting it to enter ‘Higher Speed Mode’ and in this mode” the plan explains “ATC will permit operation at speeds up to 125 mph.”

The proposal says the PTC system “allows and enforces the proper aspect speed limit based on route data while ATC displays cab signal aspects and enforces lower speed restrictions such as ‘stop’ and ‘restricting’ to preserve core signal system functions. It will also warn and enforce the maximum territory speed of 125 mph.”

The document also notes that only passenger locomotives will be equipped with the ATC/PTC serial interface on the Orlando extension; the systems will separately govern work trains and no overhead freight traffic is anticipated.

Track charts show 29 miles of single track between the Orlando West interlocking 7 miles west of the airport and “Cocoa Junction.” There are about 23 miles with a 125-mph maximum speed limit on the segment and 21 block signals in each direction over that route.

New 110-mph system where crossings are present

Since October double track sections have hosted friction braking acceleration and systems testing south of Cocoa where all highway crossing warning devices crossovers and signals have been installed.

Dan Whitaker Brightline’s vice president rail systems tells Trains News Wire that the company “has worked with the FRA to identify modifications to Wabtec’s existing I-ETMS positive train control mixed system overlay south of West Palm Beach (to) satisfy additional requirements for certification at speeds up to 125 mph. If roads cross at grade speeds will be limited to the FRA-regulated maximum of 110 mph.”

The key I-ETMS add-on is a wireless crossing activation system to ensure consistent warning times are provided with train moves that exceed 79 mph.

Whitaker says “A complex algorithm is used by the train management computer to determine when the train will arrive at the crossing.” This system is used in conjunction with conventional track circuits which activate warning devices at speeds up to 79 mph.

“The enhancements which include Wabtec’s Precision Navigation Module Smart Direction of travel and automatic track selection allow the system to differentiate between trains traveling at different speeds and ensures that warning times are consistent regardless of train speeds” he adds.

Where higher speeds are permitted crossings are either equipped with quad gates or wide roadway-separated medians.

Both the north-south and east-west segments include deployment of ground-breaking technology components that must be verified by FRA staff engineers. Brightline’s Orlando Extension testing document says a “Revenue Service Demonstration” plan for that segment will be submitted to the agency in “Second Quarter 2023” but the company expects 125-mph trains to begin testing before then.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbWVkdGVjaGludGVsbGlnZW5jZS5jb20vbmV3c19hcnRpY2xlL3B0Yy10by1hY3F1aXJlLXNhYXMtZmllbGQtc2VydmljZS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXByb3ZpZGVyLXNlcnZpY2VtYXgv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9tZWR0ZWNoaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLmNvbS9uZXdzX2FydGljbGUvcHRjLXRvLWFjcXVpcmUtc2Fhcy1maWVsZC1zZXJ2aWNlLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtcHJvdmlkZXItc2VydmljZW1heC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PTC to Acquire SaaS Field Service Management Provider ServiceMax,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='medtechintelligence.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news_article/ptc-to-acquire-saas-field-service-management-provider-servicemax/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E35948E0>, 'Connection to medtechintelligence.com timed out.

Firefighters worked to put out the fire at a Public Storage near 8th Avenue and Country Club Drive on Dec. 10 and first responders were at the scene for hours to get it under control.

""Due to the large amount of fire and poor access due to all the locked units and potential collapse the decision was made to go defensive"" officials said.

Dozens of firefighters from Mesa Gilbert and Tempe responded. It's still unknown what caused the fire and no injuries have been reported.

On Jan. 4 2023 we learned that fire investigators believe the fire was likely human caused.

Nature of business created obstacles fire officials said

Mesa Fire Capt. Josh Blum says the nature of the business created obstacles for crews because ""you never know what’s inside there. It could be anything.""

He added ""We had a heavy fire load and with all the locked storage units in there we had a difficult time making forward progress.""

Crews attempted to douse the flames from below as those in cranes were hidden under an intense cloud of smoke.

Once the flames were out investigators combed through the rubble and tried to piece a story together of what could've happened.

‘Completely devastated’

Kevin Krusemark who’s lived in the area for about 25 years says his heart goes out to all impacted.

""… it’s right around Christmastime. A lot of people are having a hard time as it is and now they got to deal with this"" he said.

""My son’s toys were all in there and now I feel obligated that I replace that all for him"" said Donteya McDaniels. A reminder she says of the impact this has on dozens of families.

Hope is scarce for Miranda Lukey who also rented out a unit.

""It’s probably all gone"" she said. While she has insurance there were things inside that money can’t buy.

""My daughter is completely devastated. Her baby blanket is in there a doll cradle my grandpa made"" she said.

The fire was a particular blow to Jessica Moore.

""We see this big cloud of smoke going across the sky"" Moore recounted. ""I say ‘Look Killian’ ‘cause he likes firefighters. ’Look buddy. There’s smoke.' He’s like ‘what’s burning mommy?' I didn’t realize it was my hopes and dreams.""

Moore is an artist and she was storing her supplies artwork childhood memories and even a quilt from her grandmother at the facility. She also taught her craft to others but when she lost her business during the Pandemic all those items went into the unit as well.

""There were hundreds of canvasses in there"" said Moore. ""Most of them were from teaching painting classes but I put them in there because they were temperature controlled.""

The fire destroyed all of Moore's belongings. She says the storage unit's insurance company is working with her to pay her for what was lost but nothing can return her one-of-a-kind pieces like a painting she created after she suffered a miscarriage.

""How am I going to take the time to rebuild all of that and maybe start another business?"" said Moore. ""That was my future. That was my everything.""

Questions remain amid investigation into fire

Moore said this could have been avoided: she had made several complaints to the storage company weeks before the fire.

""Started to smell like smoke so I talked to the management"" said Moore. ""I talked to the other management I talked to the other management and every single time nothing was getting done. There were people. I started thinking that maybe people had been living in the units.""

We have reached out to Public Storage for comment but they have yet to respond.

(WCSC) - Fire officials say eight units were destroyed in a morning fire at a Ladson storage facility.

C&B Fire Chief Joshua Woodall says crews from six fire departments responded to Ladson Self Storage. The call came in around 7:45 a.m. Tuesday.

Arriving firefighters said five storage units were in flames when they arrived.

The response shut down a portion of Highway 78 so crews could run water lines Woodall said.

Officials said a man inside one of the units was treated for minor injuries and might have fallen down a ladder or stairs.

“Everything went well. Again no firefighter injuries” C&B Fire Department Battalion Chief Charles Evans said. “Everybody came together. There are all automatic aid partners. When they send us they send these other fire departments to assist with manpower and apparatus personnel. Everything went well.”

Units from Caromi North Charleston Goose Creek Rural and Goose Creek Fire Departments all assisted with the response along with deputies from the Berkeley and Charleston County Sheriff’s Offices. Berkeley County EMS also assisted on the scene.

Crews were working to get debris out of the units and checking for hot spots early into Tuesday afternoon.

Multi-Link Operation (MLO) also enables Wi-Fi connections to aggregate channel speeds and greatly reduce link interruption in congested environments. According to Alan Hsu MediaTek’s corporate vice president and general manager of the Intelligent Connectivity Business unit:

“Last year we gave the world’s first Wi-Fi 7 technology demonstration and we are honored to now show the significant progress we have made in building a more complete ecosystem of products. This lineup of devices many of which are powered by the CES 2023 Innovation Award-winning Filogic 880 flagship chipset illustrates our commitment to providing the best wireless connectivity.”

Following this several of MediaTek’s hardware partners lauded the new developments with praise from brands including AMD Lenovo ASUS TP-Link BUFFALO LINK Korea Telecom Hisense Skyworks Qorvo Litepoint and NI.

MediaTek’s Wi-Fi 7 solution makes use of a 6nm process responsible for a reduction in power consumption to up to 50% as well as a 25x reduction in CPU utilization and 100x lower MLO switch latency. Additionally 4T5R and penta-band mesh are also included to address a larger area of coverage and higher number of linked devices.

The company also demonstrated several of its products running on its latest Filogic chips which combine Wi-Fi 7 access point technology to broadband operators retail router channels and enterprise markets. Additionally MediaTek’s Filogic 380 chipset is designed to bring Wi-Fi 7 connectivity to all client devices including TVs smart devices and computers.

Loading...

A new report was out about the performance of members of the U.S. Congress who bought and sold stocks and options in 2022.

The report broke down unusual trading activity from members of Congress and also showed the members who beat the returns of the S&P 500.

Here are the highlights of the report.

What Happened: The year 2022 was the worst for the S&P 500 as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY since 2008.

Despite the bad returns for the overall market 26 members of Congress beat the S&P 500 with their 2022 return according to a new detailed report from Unusual Whales.

In 2022 131 members of Congress filed stock and options trading disclosures. This figure was down from 147 members in 2021. The report tracked $788 million in trades from more than 12700 transactions. The number of transactions was similar to 2021 with around $189 million less traded in 2022 than the previous year.

The report found House Republicans had more than 1000 fewer trades in 2022. House Democrats had over 1000 more trades in 2022 compared to the previous year.

Democrats saw an average return of -1.76% and Republicans saw an average return of 0.4% both beating the -18% return of the S&P 500 in 2022.

Over the past 10 years about 10% of fund managers outperformed the S&P 500 according to SPIVA data while in 2022 about 5% of total Congress outperformed.

When just comparing the Congressional members who traded — just 131 of the possible 535 — 26 beat the market. That equates to 20% a much higher rate than professional money managers over time.

Here were the top 10 members of Congress by 2022 return according to the report:

Rep. Patrick Fallon (R-Texas): +51.6%

Rep. Debbie Schultz (D-Fla.): +50.8%

Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nev.): +21.4%

Rep. David Joyce (R-Ohio): +13.6%

Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.): +11.7%

Rep. William Keating (D-Mass.): +9.6%

Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas): +8.9%

Rep Michael Guest (R-Miss.): +8.9%

Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.): +7.1%

Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.): +6.5%

Ranking just outside the top 10 was Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) in 12th place at a return of 6.2%. Greene was recently profiled by Benzinga for her losing position in Digital World Acquisition Corporation DWAC.

Rep. Dingell appeared on the list for a second straight year ranking in 10th place by return in 2021.

Ranking outside of the top 10 and also failing to beat the market was former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Well known for her stock trading disclosures between herself and her husband Pelosi had a return of -19.8% in 2022 according to the report.

The report tracked trades and returns of transactions in 2022 and unrealized returns.

Why It’s Important: Along with highlighting the top trading members of Congress the report also showed unusual trading activity and some of the most popular stocks bought and sold by members of Congress.

The most popular sectors for stock trades in 2022 were technology services electronic technology finance consumer services and health technology for Democrats. Republicans had technology services industry services finance and electronic technology as their most popular sectors in 2022.

The report also illustrated unusual trading activity including members of committees trading within sectors they represent and members of Congress buying oil and defense stocks prior to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.

Rep. Green who ranked 10th on the list bought several oil and gas stocks throughout the year including $6 million worth the night before Russia invaded Ukraine.

The report also focused on some of the most popular stocks for members of both houses of Congress. The most popular stocks that were bought in 2022 were:

Apple Inc AAPL

Alphabet Inc GOOGGOOGL

Walt Disney Co DIS

Tesla Inc TSLA

NVIDIA Corporation NVDA

The most popular stocks that were sold in 2022 were:

Visa Inc V

NVIDIA Corporation

Exxon Mobil XOM

Eli Lilly And Co LLY

Microsoft Corp MSFT

One trend highlighted in the report was fewer options trading in 2022. Pelosi had been known for many options purchases including ones in the money with long-term expiration dates.

Among the best trades of the year were two by Rep. Fallon with purchases of Twitter stock in January that saw gains of more than 40% after the transaction by Tesla CEO Elon Musk was completed.

The best trade of the year was a 140% gain by Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) from the sale of ChemoCentryx which was acquired by Amgen Inc. AMGN.

While the report centered on transactions made in 2022 it also took into account trades made in 2020 that were still being held as unrealized gains.

The five largest unrealized gains in the report are:

Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.): Apollo Endosurgery Inc APEN up 497% since Oct. 2020

Rep. Tom Malinowski: Apollo Endosurgery up 454% since Oct. 2020 (second transaction)

Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.): Quanta Services Inc PWR up 391% since April 2020

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.): ON Semiconductor Corp ON up 351% since May 2020

Rep. Dean Phillips: Mosaic Co MOS up 349% since April 2020

In 2022 only three members of Congress bought cryptocurrency or related funds in 2022 compared to eight members who bought in 2021.

The report from Unusual Whales came as there were increasing calls from the public and several members of Congress to ban the trading of stocks and options by members of Congress and their families.

What's Next: Could Nancy Pelosi And Husband Be Banned From Stock Trading?

The pressure of having enough equipment to meet industry needs has spurred an emphasis on domestic manufacturing in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Power generators have faced challenges the past few years when it comes to sourcing equipment and in some cases workers. The fallout from the coronavirus pandemic notably issues with supply chains still ripples across the industry.

Some of the logistical problems may be starting to ease. Backlogs of equipment stuck at shipping ports worldwide and certainly in the U.S. due to labor shortages and other factors have been moving in recent months. There’s been a wave of company announcements regarding domestic manufacturing reducing the need to import equipment and providing support for future deployments of power generation facilities.

“The COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call in many ways” said Anders Sjoelin president and CEO of S&C Electric Co. “When the factories flights people and systems that power our global supply chain and economy stopped our dependency on this logistical ecosystem became a vulnerability. Interruptions to this global value chain of raw-material suppliers component makers and manufacturers still reverberate today disrupting everything from home-improvement projects to critical infrastructure buildout.”

Sjoelin told POWER “Everyone expected demand to drop as the scope of the pandemic became clear. But demand kept up and in some cases increased. This created an imbalance. Now of course the hope is that expectation and demand will be more in with each other.”

“The pandemic brought increased demand for a variety of goods that would have been hard to meet under ordinary conditions but the additional labor and supply chain challenges made it even harder to meet that demand” said Paul Marushka CEO and president of Sphera a provider of environmental social and governance performance and risk management software data and consulting services. Marushka told POWER “Consumer demand continued to rise once COVID-related restrictions eased although for different types of products. This demand has put pressure on already strained supply chains that have not yet fully recovered from the pandemic.”

A.P. Moeller-Maersk is among the world’s biggest shipping companies and controls about one-sixth of the global container shipping industry. The group in a recent earnings report said there has been an “easing of supply chain congestion” though there remain “plenty of dark clouds on the horizon” that will impact “global transportation and logistics demand.”

Sourcing Raw Materials

The battery energy storage industry in particular has paid close attention to issues with its supply of raw materials. A lack of those materials means the sector can’t meet demand on many fronts including to serve the market for electric vehicles (EVs). A 2022 study by E Source a group that provides research for utilities said the cost of EVs will continue to rise over the next few years in part due to a scarcity of raw materials for both batteries and other parts of these vehicles.

The automotive market apart from EVs already has been challenged by the shortage of semiconductor chips that stalled new vehicle production and also delayed the launch of many consumer electronics. Said Sjoelin “Obviously we are still catching up with semiconductor chips as these have longer lead times. The pandemic showed us that it takes very little time to shut down capacity but starting it back up again takes much longer. That’s where we are right now.”

The shortage of semiconductors was partly addressed by the Biden administration with the signing of the CHIPS and Science Act in August of last year a measure that provides some $280 billion in funding to boost U.S.-based research and manufacturing of semiconductors. The Semiconductor Industry Association last summer noted that the U.S. share of global modern semiconductor manufacturing capacity had fallen from 37% in 1990 to 12%.

There are some materials apparently not in short supply. Josef Daniel-Ivad manager of the Zinc Battery Initiative told POWER: “While supply chain concerns abound for many critical minerals zinc is naturally plentiful with 247 million metric tons proven reserves of zinc and an estimated 63000 million metric tons of zinc available in the future from extractable global resources. In addition the zinc supply can be sourced globally with strong supply chains in North America Europe and Asia.”

Daniel-Ivad added “Another benefit is the recyclability of zinc with 34% of zinc being recycled in 2019 and the recycling rate for zinc continues to increase annually as companies work towards their sustainability targets. Thanks to a robust recycling flow and an abundant supply zinc batteries and zinc used to protect renewable wind and solar power installation will be in strong supply.”

More domestic production of energy storage equipment is on the horizon. KORE Power an Idaho-based manufacturer of high-energy-density lithium-ion pouch cells and module configurations recently announced construction of a “gigafactory” in Arizona helped with funding from Siemens Financial Services and utility contractor Quanta Services. Other investors in the project include Nidec Motor Honeywell Ventures and Trog Hawley Capital. The first output from the factory is expected in 2024 with production of as much as 12 GWh of lithium-ion battery cells to support energy storage and e-mobility.

Pandemic—and More—Stresses the System

The pandemic showed we had holes in the supply chain and caused the initial problem but there are still issues outside of COVID according to Pete Aden a partner with Wipfli who focuses on construction and real estate. Wipfli provides data analysis and industry-specific solutions to a variety of sectors including power generation. Aden told POWER “We’ve gone to ‘just in time’ and there is no wiggle room. When you have a hiccup in the system from weather to workforce the issues become exacerbated.”

“The more efficient and reliable supply chains are the better everything runs” said Marushka. “Supply chain issues impact all sectors including energy. They create problems for energy suppliers who can’t get the equipment and parts needed to maintain operations. With respect to renewable energy these problems delay the construction of renewable energy projects.”

Solar power companies decried tariffs and outright bans on imported materials which delayed project timelines in the U.S. Europe and elsewhere. Some of those issues have been resolved but they also provided an impetus for more domestic manufacturing of solar power components at least in the U.S. (Figure 1).

First Solar the largest U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer in November said it would invest about $1.1 billion in a new manufacturing facility in Alabama. The company said the Alabama plant its fourth U.S.-based factory would produce 3.5 GW of solar modules annually by 2025. Mark Widmar the company’s CEO said the Inflation Reduction Act and its incentives for domestic manufacturing of energy equipment provided the impetus for the new plant.

“The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has firmly placed America on the path to a sustainable energy future” Widmar said in a statement announcing the Alabama plant. “This facility along with its sister factories in Ohio will form part of the industrial foundation that helps ensure this [energy] transition is powered by American innovation and ingenuity.”

Other solar companies such as SolarEdge and Enphase Energy also have said they are exploring U.S.-based manufacturing after passage of the climate bill.

Reed Sellers another partner at Wipfli told POWER “Manufacturers have had the time to readjust their production so while maybe COVID was the first domino in this disruption we have moved on to new issues such as trade embargos/tariffs port management pricing trucker shortages pricing of diesel and so on.”

Specific to solar Sellers said “We saw large issues with solar modules as many were manufactured overseas. There were limited suppliers and they would sell to those who needed the highest number or would get the best price. So the smaller buyers couldn’t get the supply they wanted. Tariffs were at least temporarily suspended which seemed like it would free up the supply but new issues quickly popped up due to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act or UFLPA [which concerns how the U.S. deals with China]. Quite simply demand still outweighs supply.”

Said Sellers “So now we start talking about moving manufacturing capabilities domestically. But that doesn’t happen overnight. There are tax credits for solar that help incentivize [projects]. Buyers therefore increase demand. But those incentives are temporary and subject to change with each new administration. This puts manufacturers looking to make investments in new domestic manufacturing facilities in a bit of a tough spot. Will the demand still be there by the time facilities are up and running?”

Workforce Challenges

Sellers said more domestic manufacturing also brings other challenges. “The labor force is still an underlying issue. If there is more domestic manufacturing where does the labor force to run these factories come from? What we need to focus on is smart manufacturing and automation.” Said Wipfli’s Aden “We’d also love to push the concept of trade/technical schools and making electricians a cool career.”

The calls for workforce training are many as the energy industry evolves. Sean Silvey a product application specialist at Fluke a company that manufactures electrical test and measurement tools told POWER: “The Inflation Reduction Act further turbocharges renewable energy deployments fostering an influx of new solar technicians to a booming green workforce in 2023. These new technicians regardless of previous industry may find the instruments and processes they need to familiarize themselves with are more complex than expected. To prevent delays in solar project installations there will be a sharp increase in demand for solar installation training easy-to-use tools and access to trusted resources in 2023.”

The power generation workforce almost assuredly will need to expand both for manufacturing and project deployment. Along with solar (and wind) the energy storage market wants more U.S.-based manufacturing as well. Battery maker FREYR in November announced it would build a $1.7 billion Giga America battery manufacturing facility (Figure 2) at an industrial park in Coweta County Georgia. Executives with Piedmont Lithium a lithium miner in November said the company wants to build a mining and processing operation on 1500 acres in North Carolina about 30 miles west of Charlotte.

Tom Einar Jensen co-founder and CEO of Norway-based FREYR said the factory “underscores FREYR’s ambition to develop a very strong and near-term operational footprint in the United States. Expanding into the U.S. has been a foundational aspect of FREYR’s long-term strategy from our inception and with the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act we expect U.S. demand for ESS [energy storage systems] passenger EV and other electric mobility applications to grow rapidly over the next decade.”

Daniel-Ivad noted the strong supply of zinc and others in the energy sector said supplies of cobalt sulfate and nickel sulfate also have improved which should further help the battery storage industry. The U.S. government in November said it would provide support for a nickel and cobalt processing facility in the Philippines that would launch the Critical Mineral Supply Chains initiative a program designed to expand the production of refined nickel and cobalt in the Philippines by 20000 metric tons per year.

Wind Turbine Manufacturing

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in a recent report pointed to two companies addressing supply chain challenges in the wind power sector by developing innovative manufacturing techniques with funding support from the agency. Keystone Tower Systems a group founded by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is using a spiral-welding technique (Figure 3) in order to minimize the need for expensive steel. GE Renewable Energy has been using 3D printing to create customizable tower bases enabling GE to 3D print the bottom portion of the wind turbine towers on-site at wind farms which lowers transportation costs.

The DOE also has worked to improve the fabrication process for turbine blades with a partnership among the agency Sandia National Laboratories TPI Composites and Iowa State University. The groups have established advanced techniques that reduce the time it takes to produce a single blade saving both time and money.

Wind power equipment makers are also taking steps to improve the manufacturing process. Vestas recently signed an agreement with LM Wind Power a maker of wind turbine blades to support the wind energy supply chain. The agreement includes design and manufacturing of blades for V172-7.2-MW wind turbines of Vestas’ EnVentus platform.

“This new partnership highlights how we are increasingly collaborating with partners in a flexible setup to scale efficiently and build on the foundations we have established across our global supply chain” said Tommy Rahbek Nielsen executive vice president and chief operating officer of Vestas. “We aim to leverage LM Wind Power’s proven and extensive engineering and manufacturing capabilities coupled with their global footprint to support our customers with high-quality sustainable energy solutions meeting all Vestas standards.”

The groups said LM Wind Power will work with Vestas during blade development to optimize blade design manufacturing setup and global supply. The recent agreement is a continuation of the existing Vestas and LM Wind Power partnership to manufacture V150 blades in Brazil announced earlier in 2022.

Legislative Support

Sjoelin noted the importance of government initiatives to solve supply chain problems. “What I can tell you is this: With newly focused attention on supply-chain availability and resilience U.S. manufacturing is at an inflection point” he said. “The recently passed infrastructure bill and CHIPS Act enable direct investment of billions of dollars into the manufacturing sector responsible for critical components again to improve capacity and supply certainty.”

Sjoelin said the legislation “will help drive the onshoring of U.S. manufacturing. Localizing the supply chain will go a long way towards reducing supply chain hiccups. Additionally government could also make sure that the rules and regulations support long-term planning and investment decisions so that we don’t get caught up in the imbalance of supply and demand again.”

He continued: “In the U.S. manufacturing has long been the foundation of the country. With continued investment and collaboration to build the manufacturing industry and help us become more resilient innovative and sustainable we can address pervasive supply-chain issues provide environmental stewardship and leadership through the energy transition and provide jobs that unlock career and economic opportunities for more people.”

Typically those systems are handled by separate semiconductors. But Qualcomm believes that the Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC will be able to handle basic functions and multimedia while also serving as the core processor for any driving aids tied to vehicle sensors. In theory automakers would only have to purchase a single chip – with Qualcomm receiving their business by offering a relatively simple way for them to cut costs and reduce manufacturing complexity.





Nakul Duggal Qualcomm’s head of automotive explained the premise to Reuters – noting that the chip was already being tested out by clients and would become commercially available in 2024.





“Obviously you are reducing the number of physical boxes. So it goes down to a single box. You reduce the amount of memory that you need. The extra external components that you need those go down” Duggal said.





Qualcomm previewed the chip at this year’s CES (though it had technically been announced before) stating that it builds on the technology of the older Snapdragon Ride platform that’s currently embedded into Cadillac’s Lyriq EV. While that unit is focused on advanced driving aids the company likewise offers Snapdragon Cockpit chips that handle infotainment systems and connectivity. The Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC is supposed to offer the best of both worlds by handling all of the above independently.





This has the potential to link all vehicle controls through a single centralized computer rather than having a series of dedicated systems tied to ECUs. That likewise means automakers can get away with less wiring saving on their copper bills. Moving functionality into a centralized platform is also supposed to make it much easier to do over-the-air software updates and provide automakers with more comprehensive data about the vehicle.





Though not all of the above will appeal to you if you happen to be someone who doesn’t want their vehicle permanently connected to the internet. Do-it-yourself types will also probably not appreciate having everything integrated into one system that’s effectively controlled by the manufacturer.





Considering this was the direction much of the industry was heading anyway with companies like Nvidia working on similar chips Qualcomm seems to be positioning itself wisely and said its latest unit would be scalable to handle bigger computing jobs. Though this could require upgraded or additional chips depending on the automaker’s needs. Assuming the industry likes what it sees expect to see the first batch showing up in electric vehicles produced by BMW or Volkswagen after 2024.

Three Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitrators including one industry and two public panelists awarded the broker Mark W. Birringer $926593 in compensatory damages for deferred compensation which he had earned in the two calendar years prior to his termination according to a December 15-finalized award.

However the panel noted it did not find that Birringer had been wrongfully terminated by Morgan Stanley. It denied his request to expunge from his record the related discharge language which had cited “management discretion to end employment relationship following a third-party’s social media posting involving the employee” according to its U5 termination notice for the broker.

A friend of Birringer in 2020 had posted a photo to Facebook of a boating party that included Birringer who was shown holding a noose-like rope knot according to a previous AdvisorHub report. The caption of the later-deleted post first reported by the Herald Times Reporter in Manitowoc Wisconsin read: “It really is a garage door pull.”

The reference was an apparent allusion to a rope found in NASCAR racing champion Bubba Wallace’s team garage a few days earlier that was mistakenly thought to be a noose. Wallace is one of the few Blacks on the NASCAR circuit and the incident had prompted an FBI hate crime investigation.

Morgan Stanley’s U5 filing said that Birringer had explained to the firm that the Facebook posting “was not approved by him.”

Birringer prior to his termination from Morgan Stanley ranked 24th on Forbes’ list of best-in-state wealth advisors and had managed $1.7 billion in client assets with the firm as of January 2020 according to the publication. He joined Raymond James’ Alex. Brown unit in September 2020 after he was dismissed in July of that year by Morgan Stanley.

A Raymond James spokesperson upon the firm’s hire of Birringer noted that the broker had “immediately disavowed” the posting upon learning about it.

In his January 2021-filed statement of claim with Finra Birringer had sought among other remedies in excess of $100 million in damages–for “the revenues that [Morgan Stanley] has received and will continue to receive as a result of [Birringer’s] efforts and labor”–plus statutory interest. He had also sought damages of unspecified amounts based on his claims that Morgan Stanley by filing the U5 remarks libeled and defamed him with “employees internally” and “in the marketplace.”

Birringer’s lawyer John D. Singer of Singer Deutsch LLP downplayed the panel’s denial of the punitive damages as the broker had filed his complaint before all his clients’ accounts transferred to his new firm and underscored that Birringer was awarded 100% of the deferred compensation damages he had sought.

Singer said that Morgan Stanley “had irrefutably failed to conclude that Mr. Birringer had engaged in any wrongdoing whatsoever much less any type of racist act.” Singer also welcomed the Finra panel’s ruling because he said the arbitrators had “determined in applying equitable principles that Morgan Stanley’s craven and utilitarian decision to confiscate Mr. Birringer’s deferred compensation concomitant with his separation without cause from the company was patently unfair unwarranted and motivated solely by optics.”

Singer declined to comment on Birringer’s current book of business and the broker via Singer declined to comment separately.

A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley which in an April 2021-filed response in the arbitration had denied the allegations declined to comment.

Birringer was assessed $15750 of the $16500 in total hearing session fees according to the Finra award.

NVIDIA today announced GeForce NOW ™ is going beyond fast delivering GeForce RTX™ 4080-class gaming to billions of devices — available exclusively in the new high-performance Ultimate membership tier.

Powered by the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture upgraded GeForce NOW RTX 4080 SuperPODs will deliver over 64 teraflops of graphics horsepower to an individual user which is more than 5x that of an Xbox Series X and nearly 1.75x over the previous-generation SuperPODs.

The GeForce NOW Ultimate membership raises the bar on cloud gaming bringing it closer than ever to a local gaming experience. With GeForce RTX 4080 performance Ultimate members will be the first to experience true PC gaming — streaming at up to 240 frames per second from the cloud with full ray tracing and DLSS 3  in hit games like Portal With RTX. With the addition of NVIDIA Reflex  GeForce NOW achieves click-to-pixel latency below 40 milliseconds — another first in cloud gaming.

“NVIDIA’s Ada architecture is a big leap in graphics quality and through GeForce NOW we’re streaming an RTX 4080 experience to more devices and more gamers than ever” said Jeff Fisher senior vice president of GeForce at NVIDIA. “GeForce NOW Ultimate members will have the technology and the performance to experience even the most demanding games in their full ray-traced glory.”

Current GeForce NOW RTX 3080 members will be upgraded immediately to Ultimate memberships and be among the first to experience the full benefits of GeForce RTX 4080 performance in the cloud when the servers start rolling out later this month.

RTX Technologies to the Cloud

NVIDIA RTX technologies introduced with the Ultimate membership are lifting cloud gaming to new heights. NVIDIA Reflex 240-fps mode brings frame-pacing technology to the cloud which helps streamline the execution of game simulation rendering and encoding on the server. When paired with an NVIDIA G-SYNC® monitor GeForce NOW will vary the streaming rate to the client for the first time delivering smooth and instantaneous frame updates to client screens on Reflex-enabled games — further driving down total latency.

Next-generation RTX technologies coming to GeForce NOW include full ray tracing and DLSS 3 — introduced with the GeForce RTX 40 Series launch. They deliver beautiful cinematic-quality graphics and use AI to keep frame rates smooth.

The Ultimate Benefits

GeForce NOW Ultimate members are set to receive three major streaming upgrades. The new SuperPODs are capable of rendering and streaming at up to 240 fps. Paired with NVIDIA Reflex members’ game play will feel as if it is on a desktop PC.

4K gaming goes from fast to beyond fast with an upgrade from 60 fps to 120 fps while ultrawide monitors will be supported for the first time at up to 3840 x 1600 resolution including many popular variants such as 3440 x 1440 and 2560 x 1080.

Ultimate members can enjoy longer streaming sessions fastest access to the highest-performance cloud gaming servers and game settings that persist from session to session.

It’s Time to Play the Game

GeForce NOW recently eclipsed the 1500 game milestone — with mega-hits from top publishers like Electronic Arts and Ubisoft popular PC indie titles like Valheim and Rust and over 100 of the biggest free-to-play games like Fortnite and Genshin Impact. New games are released every GFN Thursday  and new features like Ubisoft account syncing bring members into their games instantly. Games are available from the biggest PC game stores including Steam Epic Ubisoft and Electronic Arts.

Members will be able to stream some of the biggest upcoming PC game launches on the service starting with Portal With RTX later this week. Relive the critically acclaimed and award-winning Portal reimagined with full ray tracing and higher frame rates with DLSS 3 streaming from the cloud.

Ultimate members will see performance multiply with DLSS 3 for Atomic Heart from Mundfish and Focus Entertainment. FNTASTIC and MyTona’s The Day Before launches later this year accelerated by DLSS 3 and with a detailed world enhanced with ray-traced reflections. Stream with or against friends with the realistic physics engine in Party Animals from Recreate Games and Source Technology.

The GeForce NOW catalog features many of the most popular PC games including recent day-and-date releases of Marvel’s Midnight Suns Warhammer 40000: Darktide and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Next-Gen Update as well as massive free-to-play titles like Destiny 2 Lost Ark and Apex Legends.

Pricing and Availability

The GeForce NOW Ultimate membership is available for new user sign-ups today at $19.99 per month or $99.99 for six months.

(NYSE: O) a publicly traded REIT has agreed to acquire up to 185 single-tenant retail and industrial properties from subsidiaries of CIM Real Estate Finance Trust Inc. for approximately $894 million.

The exact composition of the portfolio depends on completion of due diligence and the potential exercise of rights of first refusal related to certain properties. If the entire 185 properties are included the transaction will represent a 7.1 percent capitalization rate.

“We believe the deployment of net sales proceeds will continue to advance our program to generate sustainable and increasing dividends for our shareholders through earnings growth” says Richard Ressler president CEO and chairman of CIM Real Estate Finance Trust. “Additionally this transaction increases our flexibility as we seek to capitalize on investment opportunities resulting from the current market environment.”

The properties feature a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 9.2 years with approximately 48 percent of the portfolio’s annualized contractual rent derived from investment-grade rated clients.

The properties total 4.6 million square feet with 55 retail clients representing 95 percent of the total portfolio rent. The remaining 5 percent comes from four industrial clients.

The top two renters in the portfolio are Lowe’s Home Improvement and Walgreens which represent 11.9 percent and 7.6 percent of the total portfolio rent respectively. Other major tenants include 20 Bob Evans restaurant locations 10 CVS pharmacies five Hobby Lobby stores and five Kroger grocery stores.

The top three industries represented by projected total portfolio rent are drug stores at 12.1 percent home improvement at 12.1 percent and grocery at 11.9 percent. The top two states by projected total portfolio rent are Texas with 10.2 percent and Illinois with 9 percent.

The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023 subject to customary closing conditions approvals and completion of due diligence.

CIM Real Estate Finance Trust is a public non-listed REIT. Affiliates of CIM Group manage the company.

San Diego-based Realty Income’s stock price opened at $63.86 per share on Tuesday Jan. 3 down from $71.41 one year ago.

No one knows for sure what the new year will bring for investors. However it's a good bet that quite a few solid companies will continue paying dividends quarter after quarter.

Some of them could also have significant upside potential over the next 12 months. Here are 23 top dividend stocks to buy and hold in 2023.

Energy

Energy stocks led the S&P 500 in 2022 and could very well soar again in the new year. Many of them offer especially juicy dividends to boot.

Stock Business Summary Dividend Yield 1. Brookfield Renewable Corporation BEPC 2.08% ) Renewable energy provider 4.6% 2. Brookfield Renewable Partners BEP 1.34% ) Renewable energy provider 5.2% 3. Chevron Integrated energy and chemicals producer 3.2% 4. Devon Energy DVN -1.44% ) Oil and gas producer 8.9% 5. Enterprise Products Partners Midstream energy services provider 7.8% 6. ONEOK Midstream energy services provider 5.7% 7. Pioneer Natural Resources PXD) Oil and gas producer 11.2%

Note that the first two stocks on the list share the same underlying business. Brookfield Renewable Partners is a limited partnership (LP). The company created a separate stock organized as a corporation (Brookfield Renewable Corporation) to enable investors to avoid some of the tax hassles associated with LPs.

Also the two stocks with the highest dividend yields -- Pioneer Natural Resources and Devon Energy -- pay a fixed-plus-variable dividend. The variable portion depends on the companies' excess free cash flow. Although there's no guarantee that Pioneer and Devon will be able to generate as much free cash flow in 2023 as they did last year their chances appear to be pretty good.

Healthcare

Big pharma companies often pay solid dividends. These three definitely qualify -- and they each handily beat the market in 2022.

Stock Business Summary Dividend Yield 8. AbbVie ABBV 0.22% ) Biopharmaceutical company 3.7% 9. Bristol Myers Squibb Biopharmaceutical company 3.2% 10. Johnson & Johnson JNJ 0.04% ) Biopharmaceutical consumer health and medical devices company 2.6%

AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson could be especially appealing to income investors because they're both Dividend Kings with at least 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. The new year will be one of big changes for the two companies.

AbbVie faces declining sales for its top-selling drug Humira due to biosimilar competition in the U.S. J&J plans to spin off its consumer-health unit in 2023. However both stocks should continue to be winners for investors over the long term.

Real estate

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are known for their high dividend yields. Below are some of the best REITs on the market.

Stock Business Summary Dividend Yield 11. Digital Realty Trust DLR -1.45% ) REIT focusing on data centers 4.8% 12. Easterly Government Properties DEA) REIT focusing on government properties 7.4% 13. Medical Properties Trust MPW 1.92% ) REIT focusing on hospitals 10.3% 14. Realty Income O 0.70% ) REIT focusing primarily on the retail market 4.7% 15. Rithm Capital RITM 0.53% ) REIT focusing on providing capital to financial services and real estate sectors 12.1% 16. W.P. Carey WPC 0.93% ) REIT focusing on multiple industries. 5.4%

All of these REIT stocks fell in 2022 with some declining sharply. However if the Federal Reserve stabilizes interest rates later this year the stocks could enjoy nice rebounds.

Technology/telecommunications

Most tech stocks don't pay dividends. The ones that do tend to offer relatively low dividend yields.

Telecom stocks on the other hand often have attractive yields. The following stocks illustrate both points.

Stock Business Summary Dividend Yield 17. Apple AAPL -0.69% ) Consumer technology company 0.73% 18. Microsoft MSFT 0.59% ) Software and devices maker 1.2% 19. Verizon Communications VZ 1.53% ) Telecommunications provider 6.7%

You probably won't buy Apple or Microsoft for their dividends. However these two beaten-down tech stocks could roar back in 2023.

Verizon likely won't deliver the long-term growth that these tech giants will over the long term. However it comes with a high dividend yield that income investors shouldn't ignore.

Other

The final members of our list of dividend stocks to buy and hold in 2023 span multiple sectors. All of them offer great dividends and solid long-term growth prospects.

Stock Business Summary Dividend Yield 20. Ares Capital ARCC 0.86% ) Business development company 10.3% 21. Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation BIPC -0.69% ) Infrastructure assets operator 3.7% 22. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners BIP 0.23% ) Infrastructure assets operator 4.6% 23. United Parcel Service Package delivery and logistics services provider 3.5%

Note that Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation and Brookfield Infrastructure Partners share the same underlying business (in a similar way that we saw earlier with the two Brookfield Renewable stocks). Investing in Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation doesn't have the tax complications of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners which is a limited partnership.

Ares Capital ranks among the smallest on the list of 23 dividend stocks with a market cap of under $10 billion. However it also pays one of the highest dividend yields. The company believes it will be able to continue paying out its high dividend under multiple scenarios for the economy in 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNzQ1MDQxMDg3L2hvdGVsLXRyYW5zYWN0aW9uLXZvbHVtZS11bmRlcnNjb3Jlcy1jb250aW51ZWQtc3Ryb25nLWludmVzdG9yLWludGVyZXN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hotel Transaction Volume Underscores Continued Strong Investor Interest,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNzQ1MDQxMDg3L2hvdGVsLXRyYW5zYWN0aW9uLXZvbHVtZS11bmRlcnNjb3Jlcy1jb250aW51ZWQtc3Ryb25nLWludmVzdG9yLWludGVyZXN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3680FD0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

As part of Amgen’s case against Sanofi centered on the two companies’ PCSK9 cholesterol drugs several biopharma companies including AbbVie Bristol Myers Squibb and GSK as well as organizations like the National Association of Patent Practitioners and the Intellectual Property Professors have thrown their support behind Amgen’s appeal in separate briefs filed to the U.S. high court.

The law division of the American Chemical Society even went as far as petitioning (PDF) to participate in oral arguments to help make a case for Amgen.

A federal circuit court previously sided with Sanofi and its partner Regeneron in throwing out patents on Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor Repatha. But entities like GSK (PDF) argue that the lower court’s ruling goes against common sense and puts an unreasonable burden on the innovator to have a valid patent claim.

The legal fight dates back to 2014 when Amgen sued Regeneron and Sanofi before an official FDA approval for their PCSK9 drug Praluent. As the better seller of the two drugs Amgen’s Repatha reeled in $963 million sales in the first three quarters of 2022. Praluent only ginned up $334 million sales during the same period.

Back in 2019 a Delaware judge threw out a jury verdict and ruled against Amgen. In 2021 a federal appeals court rejected Amgen’s bid to reverse the ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court took on the case despite U.S. Solicitor General’s recommendation against a review.

The current patent law carries an “enablement” requirement which states that a patent is valid if it contains enough disclosure to allow a person with ordinary skills in a relevant trade to make the invention without undue experiments. The lower courts ruled that Repatha’s patent claims didn’t meet that standard because they could cover “millions” of antibodies and would therefore require undue experiments to determine which ones actually work.

The dispute centers on the appeals court’s interpretation that a patent description should allow skilled specialists to reach the “full scope” of the claim namely to be able to make all variations of the same innovation without substantial effort.

SCOTUS should reject the federal circuit’s “full scope” test which could “reduce valid claim breadth especially in the chemical pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors” AbbVie said in its amicus brief (PDF).

“The test has no basis in the statutory language or structure of the Patent Act chills innovation and investment and disserves fundamental congressional objectives embodied in patent law” AbbVie said.

Bavarian Nordic Biogen Bristol Myers Merck & Co. 3M material science specialist Corning and the Association of University Technology Managers banded together in a joint amicus brief (PDF) also in favor of Amgen. Calling the “full scope” rule “time-and-resource-wasting” the team argues the federal circuit’s standard “is wrong as a matter of law and harmful to the innovation process” and that it “ignores how innovators actually operate.”

Similarly the National Association of Patent Practitioners in its filing argued the federal circuit has “deviated too far” from established legal practice and that the “full scope” standard is “unworkable.” The lower court’s decision suggests inventors must lay out “all or an unreasonably large number” of species under a patent claim the organization said.

Meanwhile the Intellectual Property Law Association of Chicago asked that the high court vacate the case and return it to the court of appeals. While labeling its brief (PDF) as in support of neither party the group argued that claim enablement isn’t “a matter of whether the specification has cataloged all possible embodiments of invention.”

Amgen also filed its own brief (PDF) in December. The California biotech spent almost its entire argument on the “full scope” standard contending that it’s against the law and harms innovation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVudGlmaWNhbWVyaWNhbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9hLXZhbHVhYmxlLWNvdmlkLWRydWctZG9lc250LXdvcmstYWdhaW5zdC1uZXctdmFyaWFudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Valuable COVID Drug Doesn't Work against New Variants,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.scientificamerican.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /article/a-valuable-covid-drug-doesnt-work-against-new-variants/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2BF4220>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVudGlmaWNhbWVyaWNhbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9hLXZhbHVhYmxlLWNvdmlkLWRydWctZG9lc250LXdvcmstYWdhaW5zdC1uZXctdmFyaWFudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvbmV3cy92ZXJhLWRpcHMtZGVzcGl0ZS1wb3NpdGl2ZS1kYXRhLTE3MjAwNTA2OC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VERA Dips Despite Positive Data From IgA Nephropathy Study,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='ca.style.yahoo.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /finance/news/vera-dips-despite-positive-data-172005068.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2BF6DA0>, 'Connection to ca.style.yahoo.com timed out.

A reanalysis of data from the FOURIER trial found a higher risk of cardiovascular death associated with Amgen’s injectable cholesterol therapeutic Repatha (evolocumab) according to a study published last month.

Writing in the open access journal BMJ Open the researchers noted several “significant inconsistencies and misreporting” between the 2017 New England Journal of Medicine publication of FOURIER’s primary results and its Clinical Study Report (CSR) a technical document containing far more detailed information about the trial.

In the CSR 36 Repatha-treated patients died due to myocardial infarction. Meanwhile the 2017 paper lists only 25 such cases. Moreover there were 31 cardiac failure deaths identified in the CSR nearly twice as many as that in the NEJM report.

In contrast there were three fewer placebo deaths in the CSR than in the 2017 publication.

“The 2017 NEJM publication reported that evolocumab decreased non-fatal myocardial infarctions and strokes” the researchers wrote while also pointing out that re-adjudication of the FOURIER data flagged more cardiovascular deaths than what had previously been published.

“It would be surprising for myocardial infarctions and strokes which account for most cardiovascular deaths to decrease while cardiovascular mortality was increased by evolocumab” the researchers added.

Data from the FOURIER trial formed the basis of Repatha’s regulatory approval which was granted in 2015.

The biologic works by binding to PCKS9 a protein that helps degrade receptors for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol on the surface of liver cells. By inhibiting the action of PCKS9 Repatha promotes the clearance of LDL cholesterol from the blood.

According to the authors of the BMJ article accurate assessment of Repatha is particularly important “because evolocumab is the first in a new drug class.” The inconsistencies they found suggest “that complete restoration of all clinical outcomes from the FOURIER trial is required.”

In an email to BioSpace an Amgen spokesperson said the company disagrees with the analysis of Repatha as published in BMJ Open pointing to ""limitations to the ... analysis resulting in an incomplete assessment of the FOURIER data and a flawed conclusion.""

The company stands by the event adjudication process employed in FOURIER and asserts that this process is in line with the Standardized Data Collection for Cardiovascular Trials Initiative established by the Food and Drug Administration.

The adjudication process also drew guidance from other regulatory agencies and is consistent with that in other cardiovascular outcomes trials Amgen pointed out.

""We stand behind the robust body of evidence supporting the safety and efficacy profile of Repatha which has been used in 1.7 million patients worldwide since 2015 and has been studied in more than 51000 patients through clinical studies"" the spokesperson wrote.

Amgen Takes Repatha Patent Fight to Supreme Court

Last week Amgen filed its briefing document to the Supreme Court laying out its arguments to revive patents protecting Repatha as well as to block the sale of Praluent (alirocumab) a similar PCSK9 inhibitor developed by powerhouse partners Sanofi and Regeneron.

Amgen first filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Sanofi and Regeneron in 2014 when the partners filed for FDA approval for Praluent. Two juries ruled in Amgen’s favor finding the company’s patents to be valid and enforceable.

These decisions were eventually overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit arguing that the patents were invalid as they failed to disclose sufficient information that would allow anyone knowledgeable in the field to recreate the antibodies without undue experimentation.

Amgen appealed to the Supreme Court. A decision is expected by midyear according to a Reuters report."

And it made up part of Kyiv’s highest such payout for all of war-torn Ukraine -- to a region estimated to have suffered comparatively minimal damage.

Following reports by Schemes the investigative unit of RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service and Ukrainska Pravda that established personal ties between the trainer who co-owned this company and the regional governor Ukraine’s Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal probe into the matter in November. On December 26 the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) searched the governor’s office the company’s headquarters and other sites related to the case Schemes has learned.

Amid an uptick in such probes and prosecutions the first deputy chairperson of parliament’s anti-corruption policy committee Yaroslav Yurchyshyn asserted that Ukraine is fighting a war on corruption alongside its war against Russia which launched a large-scale invasion in February.

Yet despite prosecutors’ scrutiny the exigencies of war mean that the government contract with the company Budinvest Engineering the official reasons for Kyiv’s disbursement of record-setting funds to Dnipropetrovsk and confirmation of the contractor’s actual work remain under wraps.

'Losses Of Dnipropetrovsk...Are Not Significant'

The money for Budinvest Engineering came as part of Ukraine’s Great Reconstruction initiative – episodic disbursements of state funds often without public tenders to rebuild infrastructure devastated by the 2022 war. A September 2022 assessment by the Ukrainian government the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation estimated the total cost of “reconstruction and recovery” at $349 billion more than 1.5 times Ukraine’s 2021 gross domestic product and said that figure was expected to grow.

In July the government requested foreign assistance for the restoration of some 51200 kilometers of damaged roads.

A draft report from the National Council for the Recovery of Ukraine from the War an advisory body under President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office reported that a shortfall of nearly 74.2 billion hryvnyas ($2 billion) in public funding for roads meant that Ukraine had “virtually no funds” to pay for road construction reconstruction repair and maintenance.

But that did not appear to be the case for Dnipropetrovsk a strategic industrial hub bordered by the frontline regions of Zaporizhzhya Donetsk and Kharkiv. Between March and October 31 Dnipropetrovsk paid road contractors 2.31 billion hryvnyas ($63 million) – Ukraine’s highest rate of public spending on road work according to an analysis of data from the state procurement site E-Data.

That rate is higher than the combined total spent during the same period on road work in areas that have ranked among the Russian military’s most frequent targets: the capital Kyiv and surrounding areas; the border regions of Kharkiv and Sumy; and the vulnerable Black Sea region of Odesa.

Yet as of September less than 1 percent of the estimated $26.6 billion in war damage to Ukrainian roads had occurred in Dnipropetrovsk according to an October 2022 damage assessment compiled by the Kyiv School of Economics in association with Zelenskiy’s office and the Ministry of Infrastructure among other government bodies.

""In terms of road management the losses of Dnipropetrovsk region are not significant compared to other regions where active hostilities took place” a Kyiv School of Economics spokesperson said in October.

Dnipropetrovsk’s road repair payments however were significant -- equal to all other government transfers to Dnipropetrovsk for the same time period according to E-Data.

Sixty-five percent of this payout -- 1.5 billion hryvnyas ($41 million) -- went to Budinvest Engineering which until early November was co-owned by Yana Khlanta who media reports sources in the region and evidence gathered by Schemes indicates was the girlfriend of the governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region Valentyn Reznichenko. The financial news site Nashi Hroshi first reported in September about the regional government’s payments to this firm.

At the time Budinvest Engineering -- founded in the regional capital Dnipro in 2015 -- was equally co-owned by Khlanta an expert powerlifter employed as a trainer at the city’s Human fitness center and Pavlo Chukhno the vice president of the Dnipro professional basketball team Prometey and a business partner of entrepreneur Volodymyr Dubinskiy who is wanted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation for alleged mortgage fraud in California.

Khlanta and Chukhno each owned a 49 percent stake. The firm’s director Dmytro Litnarovych owned the remaining 2 percent stake.

Neither Khlanta nor Chukhno has any known expertise in road construction.

Information from Ukraine’s State Tax Service shows that in 2020-21 Khlanta worked for a company owned by Reznichenko Seventh Consulting Group while the State Border Guard told Schemes that she traveled abroad on the same flights as Reznichenko or on separate flights with the same destination six times during that period including on her birthday in 2021. Khlanta also traveled abroad four times by herself in a Kia Sportage car owned by Seventh Consulting Group.

Several sources within Reznichenko’s professional circle speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject told Schemes that Khlanta is the divorced governor’s girlfriend.

Following publication of the Schemes report Ukraine’s Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office a unit subordinate to the Prosecutor-General’s Office announced the start of a criminal inquiry on suspicion of abuse of power and the laundering of illegally obtained property in connection with the regional government’s payments to Budinvest Engineering.

The firm along with other Dnipropetrovsk public contractors already faced questions from the Bureau of Economic Security which investigates financial crimes about the alleged diversion of state funds to a potential front company Schemes has learned.

According to court records Budinvest Engineering has been the target of criminal investigations in the past including cases in which it was suspected of embezzlement of public funds and of substandard work.

Wait Until The War Ends

The official reasons for Dnipropetrovsk choosing Budinvest Engineering for its publicly financed road work and the locations of the actual road repairs remain unknown. Amid the Russian invasion now in its 11th month with no sign of an end government agreements with contractors are no longer public.

Schemes shared the findings of its investigation into the ties between Reznichenko and Budinvest Engineering with the office of Zelenskiy who appointed Reznichenko to his post in 2020 and the deputy head of the president’s office Kyrylo Tymoshenko who oversees infrastructure reconstruction.

Schemes asked how the central government monitors the use and allocation of state budget funds for infrastructure reconstruction. By law Ukrainian officials have one day to report to their superiors – in this case the president – about a conflict of interest in their duties.

In terms of road management the losses of Dnipropetrovsk region are not significant compared to other regions where active hostilities took place.""

But the presidential press service responded that providing information about state payments for such projects is impossible amid the ongoing war with Russia. In an e-mail a spokesperson said that Zelenskiy’s administration cannot respond to Schemes’ questions about these payments until the war ends.

Senior presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak subsequently told RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service that Zelenskiy’s administration was not refusing to comment but would wait until the criminal investigation had established whether “violations of financial discipline” or “elements of corruption” had occurred.

A Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office representative told Schemes in November that Reznichenko was not a suspect or an accused individual in its inquiry at that time.

However on December 26 NABU detectives searched Reznichenko’s office and those of the regional department that handles procurement for road work as well as other Dnipropetrovsk departments three unrelated sources from Dnipro and national law enforcement agencies told Schemes.

Searches also occurred at Budinvest Engineering’s office and at Chukhno’s office as well as at the premises of other public contractors.

Neither NABU nor the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office has commented about the searches.

Reznichenko has not commented publicly about the inquiry Budinvest Engineering or evidence of a relationship with Khlanta. Before the start of the prosecutors’ probe Schemes repeatedly contacted him to ask about his apparent ties to Khlanta and the company. Phone calls text messages and e-mailed questions to his administration and press secretary went unanswered. A trip to a country house that Reznichenko reportedly owns also proved unfruitful.

A Dnipro native Reznichenko 50 worked as a vice president of UMH Group one of Ukraine’s largest media companies while Zelenskiy co-founder of the studio Kvartal 95 was still producing television content. He had run the Dnipropetrovsk region for over four years when Zelenskiy reappointed him to the post in 2020.

Reznichenko’s links to the presidential office extend beyond Zelenskiy however. An informal adviser to the governor former UMH Group advertising manager Yuriy Holyk terms himself one of the originators of the Great Reconstruction “ideology” and a “consultant” for its projects.

Holyk a former informal adviser to the head of Ukravtodor which oversees the upkeep of Ukraine’s highways regularly attends government meetings chaired by Tymoshenko the deputy head of Zelenskiy’s office with senior Ukrainian officials and international partners about Kyiv’s reconstruction plans. Holyk also features in official photos of Tymoshenko’s trips into the regions to inspect infrastructure.

On December 26 NABU detectives also searched Holyk’s residence in Kyiv’s Konyk gated community Ukrainska Pravda journalist Mykhaylo Tkach reported. Law enforcement sources confirmed this information to Schemes.



Schemes asked Holyk via a messaging app why the region had received such a large portion of state funds for roadwork and what had influenced the selection of Budinvest Engineering as a contractor. The app indicated that the message was read but there was no response.

Citing the war Zelenskiy’s press service declined also to discuss what role Holyk plays if any in government discussions about the allocations of funds for road repairs.

“The office of the President of Ukraine is not the administrator of local budgets"" a spokesperson said adding that “local authorities” and “relevant ministries” handle this issue.

At the local level the questions about the Dnipropetrovsk government’s payments to Budinvest Engineering and about the ownership of the firm itself continue.

One week after the announcement from the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office about its inquiry into the Dnipropetrovsk government’s payments to Budinvest Engineering Khlanta disinvested entirely from Budinvest Engineering according to Ukrainian business profiler YouControl.

Ninety-eight percent of the company is now owned by Chukhno the vice president of Prometey the professional basketball team that he co-founded with Volodymyr Dubinskiy the Dnipro businessman wanted along with his older brother Leonid Dubinskiy by the FBI.

An arrest warrant was issued in 2012 for the two after a federal court in California charged them with mail fraud.

Prometey’s website describes Chukhno and Volodymyr Dubinskiy as “business partners.”

The team’s home page prominently touts Budinvest Engineering as its main sponsor.

No Responses

Reached by Schemes by phone Chukhno the beneficiary owner of Budinvest Engineering declined to discuss details of the funds the firm has received from public coffers since the invasion or his business ties with Dubinskiy. After listening to a Schemes journalist’s questions he stopped answering the phone and directed Schemes to his press secretary who did not respond to submitted questions.

Budinvest’s director Dmytro Litnarovych still holds the remaining 2 percent stake in the company. Litnarovych did not respond to mobile-phone calls from Schemes.

Through a messaging app Schemes tracked down Volodymyr Dubinskiy often identified by Ukrainian media as the actual owner of Budinvest Engineering to ask whether Chukhno holds shares in the firm on his behalf and what ties if any Dubinskiy has to Reznichenko.

But though Dubinskiy received the message he did not respond.

Ukrainian media have reported that the Dubinskiy brothers own some 20 different firms that have won public tenders for services in the regional capital Dnipro including for road repairs and cleaning.

Budinvest Engineering’s website contains general information about its repair of highways and streets an array of truck and machinery photos and even a musical video about its road work. But the site does not provide details about the road repairs the company has executed at taxpayers’ expense.

Law enforcement previously has investigated the company following allegations of shoddy road repairs and money laundering through sham companies according to court records. In 2019  during Zelenskiy’s first year in office the firm featured in a State Bureau of Investigation probe into regional officials’ alleged embezzlement of public funds for road repairs.



Budinvest Engineering did not respond to questions Schemes sent to its official e-mail address. The phone number listed on Budinvest’s website was not in service when a Schemes reporter called.

At the company's Dnipro headquarters the security guard refused to say how to find managers who could answer Schemes’ questions about the company or to answer such questions himself. Guards at a second Budinvest Engineering location in Dnipropetrovsk region an asphalt-concrete factory in the city of Novomoskovsk stated that no managers were on the premises.

Information from Ukraine’s public finance portal E-Data raises questions about three areas of Budinvest Engineering’s 2022 operations as a state contractor.

Supplies

Ukrainian law requires companies to report to tax officials all of their monthly purchases and sales. However tax records for the first nine months of 2022 seen by Schemes indicate that three of Budinvest Engineering’s key subcontractors -- BNM LLC DZMK LLC and Maxi-Bud Plus LLC -- did not always purchase supplies in the same quantity that they told tax officials they had sold to Budinvest Engineering.

As of November 2 for instance BNM a timber wholesaler and concrete manufacturer had bought a total of 1300 tons of sand crushed stone and a crushed-sand mixture. However official records filed with tax authorities accessible on E-Data show that during this same period it sold almost 100 times that amount – over 100000 tons – of these supplies to Budinvest.

Since BNM is not a factory it could not produce these additional supplies itself.

Its registered phone number was not working at the time of Schemes’ investigation and the firm could not be contacted for additional information.

Pricing

According to data filed with the government Budinvest purchased two allotments of crushed stone used for building and repairing roads from the subcontractor Maxi-Bud Plus shortly after Russia’s invasion in February. One purchase in May was for 1258 hryvnyas ($34) per ton; the second in June-July for 1466 hryvnyas ($40) per ton.

Documents from the tax service however show that Maxi-Bud Plus bought this same type of crushed stone from manufacturers at prices at least six times cheaper – 185 and 233 hryvnyas ($5 and $6.30) per ton respectively.

Subcontractors

Two of Budinvest Engineering’s main subcontractors BNM and Maxi-Bud Plus share the same address in Dnipro: a Soviet-style office building on Berezinska Street.

But a security guard at the entrance to the building which houses some 40 firms had never heard of either company. “We have many companies here that only rent offices pay and take something away once a year” he said referring to mail.

Schemes could not contact either company at the phone numbers listed in their business registrations.

In 2021 the State Tax Service listed Maxi-Bud Plus as a “risky taxpayer” since despite a reported profit in the millions of hryvnyas it only employed one person. The Dnipropetrovsk District Administrative Court later struck down that categorization.

Ukraine’s 2023 budget includes 64.3 billion hryvnyas ($1.74 billion) for the State Road Fund a tax-financed stash for the upkeep reconstruction and repair of public roads. And Kyiv’s interest in financing road repairs appears centered on encouraging foreign investment.

But some observers caution that the rush to rebuild comes with risks of potential malfeasance: Despite its persistent efforts to combat graft Ukraine in 2021 ranked second only to Russia in the region for public perceptions of corruption according to Transparency International’s annual index.

A transparent procurement process clear goals independent overview and auditing mechanisms are among the recommendations of the Brookings Institution a Washington-based think tank for Ukraine’s reconstruction campaign.

Ukraine maintains it is aware of the stakes. The Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office in 2022 secured 25 convictions out of 42 cases that went to court Reuters reported.

As yet the office has not commented on the December 26 NABU searches connected to the Budinvest Engineering case.

The football World Cup in Qatar was not the only show drawing attention to the oil-rich Gulf in recent weeks. In Abu Dhabi an annual finance conference was so packed that attendees were left with standing room only as the region is increasingly viewed as one of the remaining sources of abundant capital.

When sessions ended bankers and investors squeezed through corridors pitching deals on the hoof. “It was so busy it felt like the whole island sank a little” one Abu Dhabi official quipped to a banker present.

There were similar scenes in neighbouring Saudi Arabia where the kingdom’s so-called “Davos in the Desert” investor conference drew record numbers with more than 1000 “global executives” attending including about 400 from the US and scores from Europe.

For many of those beating a path to the Gulf there is one thing on their minds — luring capital from and striking deals with sovereign wealth funds as the region enjoys its first petrodollar-fuelled boom in a decade.

“You have the world and his wife coming here looking for capital” says a veteran Gulf-based banker. “It feels like 2008.”

That was the year that thrust many of the Gulf’s SWFs into the spotlight as oil prices soared to a record $147 a barrel while much of the rest of the world suffered the global financial crisis.

Back then it was Abu Dhabi’s stable of investment vehicles and the Kuwaiti and Qatari SWFs that made the biggest splashes. These funds became go-to investors for distressed western assets desperate to raise capital. Citigroup Credit Suisse Barclays and Daimler were among high-profile companies and brands bolstered by injections of Gulf petrodollars.

Today the SWFs are once again eyeing opportunities amid another bout of global tumult buoyed by petrodollar surpluses after oil prices last year reached their highest levels since 2008.

While much of the world braces for recession the IMF forecasts that the Middle East’s oil and gas producers are set to reap up to $1.3tn in additional revenues than had been expected over the next four years as energy prices were pushed up by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Much of it will flow to the Gulf home to top crude exporter Saudi Arabia and the largest liquefied natural gas exporter Qatar.

It is a boom that is set to bolster the soft power of the region’s increasingly confident absolute monarchies notably Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as he seeks to defuse criticism of his regime’s human rights record and project the kingdom as a major G20 power.

“The quantum available is massive” says an investment banker. “For the last two months every week we have one or two companies here primarily from the US but also Europe China India doing roadshows.”

Yet Gulf officials caution there are differences with 2008. Although they consider this as a moment to capitalise on this time they say the investments will be done in a more strategic and less opportunistic manner.

“It’s not about the deal flow that is seeking us out. We want the deal flow that fits with our strategic ambitions” says Khaldoon Mubarak chief executive of Mubadala a $284bn Abu Dhabi sovereign fund that has investments in more than 50 countries. “In 2008 we reacted well but this time our approach is more proactive and strategically deliberate.”

Experienced investors

The Middle East’s sovereign wealth funds are bigger and more experienced than in 2008.

Mubadala managed assets of just $15bn during that period. Abu Dhabi the wealthy capital of the United Arab Emirates has also consolidated funds over the past decade after two of its vehicles — Aabar and Ipic — got sucked into Malaysia’s 1MDB fraud which became one of the world’s biggest financial scandals. The $450bn Qatar Investment Authority was just three years old in 2008 and often appeared to act on impulse rather than strategy.

“We were very young [in 2008] — the teams were a bit smaller and we were building the portfolio from scratch so we were more opportunistic” says Mansoor bin Ebrahim al-Mahmoud QIA chief executive. “Nowadays it’s totally different. We are mature well established with specialised teams and a robust asset-allocation strategy.”

He is eyeing an “opportunity to reposition our portfolio in certain directions to fill certain gaps or correct overexposure”.

It’s kind of the first thing people think about — we need strategic capital where are the sources?

Yet one of the main draws for investors this time round is a fund that sat on the sidelines during the 2008 boom — Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund or PIF. It has undergone a radical reinvention since Prince Mohammed took over as chair in 2015 as it has been tasked with leading Riyadh’s grandiose plans to overhaul its rentier economy.

It has committed to spending hundreds of billions of dollars at home while using its newfound financial and political clout to diversify the kingdom’s overseas exposure. It is also pursuing strategic investments to lure technology and knowhow onshore to bolster Riyadh’s development plans.

“It’s massive asset management a sovereign wealth fund a conglomerate and a government policy extension all combined into one” says another senior investment banker with a “tremendous appetite” for opportunities.

Rizwan Shaikh co-head of emerging markets at Citigroup’s banking capital markets and advisory division in Emea says: “We have to be selective in terms of who we bring in to put in front of the funds but they are keen and want to see what’s out there.”

At the same time he says the main inquiries his bank is receiving are from clients looking for capital and strategic partners. “It’s kind of the first thing people think about — we need strategic capital where are the sources?”

A delicate balance

The new phase of dealmaking by the Gulf’s SWFs began with the coronavirus pandemic.

Mubadala invested a record $30bn in 2021. Last year it committed to investing £10bn in the UK over five years and has already deployed about half of it. Its younger sister ADQ has been on the acquisition trail across the Middle East north Africa and Turkey. Even Adia Abu Dhabi’s most traditional and conservative SWF has been investing at a high velocity.

Some however believe there is still time for asset prices to fall further meaning they are not in a rush.

“Is it a market where you have a lot of cheap assets and it’s time to attack? No I think there’s a lot more pain that’s still coming” says Mubarak chief executive of Mubadala. “We’re careful how we deploy our powder. We’re well positioned in terms of liquidity and in terms of access to deal flow.”

Elsewhere the QIA’s largest investments last year include €2.4bn in German power company RWE and $1.5bn in Bodhi James Murdoch’s media venture in India. It was an anchor investor in Porsche’s initial public offering.

Saudi Arabia’s PIF continues to be highly active launching domestic companies ranging from an electric vehicle brand to a coffee business © Amer Hilabi/AFP via Getty Images

In Saudi Arabia the PIF has done fewer of the sort of big-ticket deals it did in 2016 when it took a $3.5bn stake in Uber and pumped $45bn into SoftBank’s floundering Vision Fund. But it continues to be highly active launching myriad companies at home from a Saudi electric vehicle brand Ceer to coffee and aircraft leasing companies while also trading billions of dollars in overseas stocks.

The fund’s foreign exposure has surged from 9 per cent of its assets in 2017 to about a quarter in June while the size of the fund has swelled from about $150bn seven years ago to more than $600bn. Its target is to reach more than $1tn assets under management by 2025 with about 30 per cent in international investments.

Noticeable global deals this year include its decision to pump more than $3bn into gaming companies including taking a 5 per cent stake in Nintendo.

The PIF’s transformation underscores the dramatic shift in the kingdom’s risk appetite and the way the leadership intends to manage its wealth. In the past Saudi governments typically used boom periods to dispense largesse to the population through benefits subsidies and public sector wage increases while also embarking on a flurry of state spending on infrastructure projects.

That would propel growth in the state-dominated economy but lead to cycles of boom and bust with the latter characterised by yawning deficits stalled projects and delayed payments to contractors. Any money that was saved would be tucked away at the central bank and conservatively managed.

Today much of the state spending is channelled through the PIF and a National Development Fund which are expected to be the main beneficiaries of the recent surpluses. “We don’t want money sitting idle yielding zero” says finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan who also is a member of the PIF board.

The delicate balance Riyadh wants to strike he says is maintaining fiscal discipline while also taking advantage of the opportunities presented by the boom.

He insists that Riyadh has strengthened its institutional capacity to monitor the efficiency and control of state spending saying it is using a data-driven approach to prioritise projects based on potential economic return. As an example he cites the establishment of a “spending efficiency centre” with more than 500 staff to help avoid “a rush in spending without proper plans”. It has generated direct and indirect savings of $186bn since 2016 according to the ministry.

The goal Jadaan says is “how to avoid projects from going bust when we have seen hundreds and hundreds of projects [in the past] start strong and then in the middle for whatever reason . . . are not completed”.

He adds that the difference today “is you are investing when there’s capacity in productive assets in assets and expenditure that will create more jobs and grow the economy”.

Riyadh has already used the windfall to accelerate projects Jadaan adds citing logistics as the kingdom plans to develop a railway network connecting the east and west and Red Sea ports.

“We are taking advantage of this moment as we speak” he says. “We are going to spend more when we have more money and we may even borrow more.”

The PIF raised $17bn in November through a syndicated loan weeks after it raised $3bn through a green bond a nod to the fact that even with the kingdom’s oil wealth the fund will need to borrow to meet its large commitments.

Steffen Hertog a Gulf expert at the London School of Economics says that while the finance ministry has put in more controls on spending it is the PIF’s activities that raise concerns adding that “we get almost no disclosure on the spending they undertake”.

That the PIF and some of the projects it oversees are using debt also creates potential sovereign risk he adds. Even with the windfall questions linger about how the PIF will meet its financial commitments. Experts say just Neom the futuristic city that is Prince Mohammed’s flagship megaproject will cost far more than $500bn originally stated.

“In a way it’s actually potentially even less accountable and less transparent than the previous sort of spending booms” Hertog says. “It’s more speculative than the capital spending that you would have had under governments. It can create higher returns but is also riskier; some people are worried about that.”

‘Almost nationalisation in reverse’

A key focus among officials in Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the current boom is to utilise state funds to bring companies to their shores to support domestic development plans. It comes as economic competition heats up in the region.

In Abu Dhabi officials talk of using the funds to help accelerate the development of tech and renewable energy hubs as well as the emirate’s financial centre ADGM. As part of the latter strategy Abu Dhabi is promising to commit seed capital to private equity funds willing to set up in the ADGM.

“The private equity market is changing. Today there’s an opportunity because most people are scaling back and we have the ability to scale up” says Mubarak of Mubadala.

Yet in terms of scale and ambition nothing compares to what the PIF is attempting to achieve in the Gulf’s largest economy and most populous nation.

As it has become the dominant economic force in Saudi Arabia it has created more than 60 new domestic companies over the past seven years. It expects to invest $40bn annually in the economy over the next decade with its mandate covering everything from developing a new airport and airline to incubating and growing new industries and driving vast infrastructure projects.

“It’s almost nationalisation in reverse” says a senior investment banker. “Everything else is going to get crowded out.”

The PIF’s domestic strategy includes an emphasis on sectors where Riyadh believes it can expand industries utilising domestic resources such as mining and building materials as well as projects designed to reverse the tradition of Saudis going abroad for shopping tourism and entertainment and support the nation’s development including housing healthcare and financial services.

But other areas where there is high local demand but limited supply such as automotives or defence will require the PIF importing capacity through acquisitions.

To support this the fund’s MENA and international investment teams can co-ordinate on investing in foreign stocks that fit with the domestic programme. The clearest example is the PIF’s 62 per cent stake in Lucid which led to the electric vehicle maker establishing a manufacturing hub in the kingdom.

Hertog says Saudi Arabia in particular is likely to need to acquire majority stakes to lure that foreign direct investment it is seeking saying “companies could promise them all sorts of things to get capital injections”.

“But you’ll have a real principal agency problem — where the company wants capital but it doesn’t want to invest in Saudi” he says. “You will be back to that logic of kind of offset deals in defence where companies have to sort of go through the motions and invest locally without really wanting to do it.”

Previous efforts by Gulf states to bring industry to their shores be it Saudi Arabia’s past ambitions to develop auto manufacturing or Abu Dhabi’s plans to establish a semiconductor plant in the emirate after Mubadala pumped billions of dollars into semiconductor firm GlobalFoundries never made it off the drawing board. And Saudi Arabia’s history is littered with projects that have either stalled or failed.

Still the veteran Gulf-based banker says while it is inevitable that resources will be wasted “what’s more striking is each country has entities that seem better able to manage the money”.

The risks he says “are we go backwards in terms of greed and corruption because there’s so much money around”.

For now though the mood in the Gulf is one of confidence.

“We will make mistakes but overall I think we are doing a great job” says Jadaan. “We are very confident [but] cautious obviously the world is in turbulence and we are not isolated.”

In 2022 the top news stories revolved around speculation surrounding acquisition in the ATM industry particularly whether if a company was going to acquire NCR Corp.

However that wasn't the only top story in 2022. Readers were also interested in cannabis dispensaries having to make the transition back to cash after there was a major crackdown on cashless ATMs.

Here are the top six most-read news items for 2022 below in reverse order.

6. Cannabis dispensaries return to cash following cashless crackdown

Cannabis dispensaries in the U.S. are returning to cash after a variety of ATM processors turned off ""cashless ATMs.""

The stores had used the machines to allow customers to purchase cannabis with a bank card but the technology made it appear like the withdrawals were happening from different locations which circumnavigates money laundering controls according to a Bloomberg report written by Tiffany Kary.

In particular NCR Corp. turned off this cashless service. As a result various dispensaries in Arizona California and Massachusetts are recommending users switch to cash. It has been a difficult time for the industry due to both slowing political momentum and concerns about the health risks of marijuana.

5. Regions Bank intros early pay protection line of credit

Regions Bank introduced its Early Pay feature which allows customers with direct deposit with a checking savings money market or Now Card to receive direct deposits up to two days early. The bank also rolled out a protection line of credit to offer $50 to $500 for short-term financial needs according to a press release.

Customers do not have to enroll in Early Pay to access its benefits. They can subscribe to alerts to receive notices when Early Pay is available. The protection line of credit is a digital-invitation offer only and has no annual or cash advance fee. It acts as the customer's linked account for overdraft protection.

4. Veritas Capital cited as possible NCR suitor

Veritas Capital a private equity firm is among the players taking a look at acquiring NCR Corp. according to a Deal Reporter report cited by Seeking Alpha.

Apollo Global Management has also been discussed as a possible buyer as previously reported.

3. NCR to separate into 2 companies

NCR Corp. will separate into two independent companies with one focused on digital commerce and the other specializing on ATMs according to a press release.

The ATM company will deliver NCR's ATM-as-a-service to customers in the banking and retail space as well as leverage digital currency solutions. The digital commerce company will utilize NCR's software to deliver digital transformation for retail hospitality and digital banking.

2. Nebraska woman charged with ATM crime

Furnas County Nebraska deputies have charged a woman for allegedly attempting to break into a Cambridge Bank ATM. Shannon Proctor along with an unidentified man allegedly tried to use a crowbar to steal from the ATM according to a report by Nebraska.tv.

A deputy responded to a bank alarm and reportedly found Proctor and a man who fled the scene. The man was not apprehended but the deputy arrested Proctor who claimed the ATM was unplugged when she tried to get money out of it.

1. NCR takeover in play?

A takeover of NCR Corp. is in the works according to CNBC's David Faber Seeking Alpha reported. The report cited Apollo Group a company that vied for Cardtronics with NCR as the most discussed buyer.

In late April Dealreporter reported at least six parties were interested in taking over NCR. NCR in early February said it began a strategic review that might involve structural changes a company sale a partial sale or a spinoff according to Seeking Alpha."

""I'm going to emphasize over and over and over and over again that we are absolutely on schedule with the milestones contained in that consent agreement"" said Tim O'Donnell the landfill's general manager during a recent visit to the site.

The landfill's operator Republic Services says it's roughly two-thirds of the way through a planned $23 million project to address wastewater treatment at the site. Construction is expected to be completed later this year.

But that work may not satisfy Lower Windsor Township residents who've grown increasingly frustrated by years of promised improvements. A number of them have paid for their own drinking water testing and have grown distrustful of the landfill's operators.

""I ran a division of a multibillion-dollar company. I understand companies like Republic Services"" said John Bowser one nearby resident who previously worked for DuPont.

Bowser is concerned about what will happen to contaminants — particularly the so-called PFAS ""forever chemicals"" that have shown up in local drinking water supplies — extracted by the landfill's reverse osmosis system.

In the 2000s Bowser worked with DuPont to remove PFAS chemicals found in everything from cookware to waterproof clothing and firefighting foam from the company's products.

Modern Landfill faced scrutiny from the state Department of Environmental Protection since at least 2017 after wastewater discharged into Kreutz Creek was found to exceed limits for boron and other contaminants.

Republic Services agreed to upgrade its treatment system but the project which was originally expected to be completed in July 2021 was delayed. John Repetz a DEP spokesperson said the state extended the landfill's permit allowing it to temporarily exceed boron and osmotic pressure levels.

Ted Evgeniadis executive director of the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association calls such agreements ""zombie permits.""

Since 1988 the landfill discharged treated wastewater into Kreutz Creek. According to O'Donnell the practice is not uncommon and is fully permitted as long as the waste product — known as leachate — is properly treated.

The upgrades include five tanks two reverse osmosis filters and a small building for heat exchanger equipment. Reverse osmosis filters consist of a high-pressure membrane system that launches water through a filter at high speeds according to the EPA. It is a fine filter that removes contaminants.

""There are varying types [of filtration]; there's ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis"" said Jacob Schmidt a Republic Services area environmental manager. ""And each of them as you move further and further it's these tighter and tighter screens.""

>> Please consider subscribing to support local journalism.

As the water travels through each successive screen more and more contaminants are removed.

""Parts per million is one drop [of PFAS] in an Olympic swimming pool"" Schmidt said describing the size of particles removed from the wastewater.

In addition to lowering boron levels and osmotic pressure these filters can treat for the PFAS chemicals that have turned up in Kreutz Creek.

“That study did reveal that York County Pennsylvania Kreutz Creek had the highest levels of PFAS in the entire country which is super alarming” Evgeniadis said.

Concerns over the landfill's effect on the environment are not new.

In 1986 the landfill was added to the EPA's superfund programs national priorities list which details nationwide sites that have released or could release hazardous substances according to the EPA based on hazardous waste it received in the 1970s.

Bowser is concerned that even though the reverse osmosis filters will keep PFAS from getting into Kreutz Creek a concentrated stream of PFAS will eventually be disposed of elsewhere.

According to Republic Services the PFAS and other substances filtered out ""will be managed off site at multiple fully licensed and permitted commercial facilities."" It's not clear however where precisely that material will go.

PFAS are almost impossible to destroy. There are several ongoing EPA studies into how to remove and destroy PFAS in the environment but so far a permanent solution remains elusive. Burning PFAS at extremely high temperatures for example could result in the chemicals' release into the air.

Bowser said the only way to significantly reduce the amount of PFAS getting into the environment is to cap the landfill with a plastic liner and then bury it in a layer of earth. Until then he said rainwater will continue to pick up the contaminant and take it downstream.

""My dream is for that landfill to close up tomorrow"" he said.

It's possible that Modern Landfill will end up being capped eventually as it nears capacity and Lower Windsor Township cut off negotiations over a proposed expansion that would allow it to continue accepting refuse.

O'Donnell said that if the current volume continues the landfill will reach capacity sometime in 2025. Once it hits capacity without permission to expand it will be capped. The landfill will not cease all operations because the area still needs to be maintained he said. Gas released from inside the landfill and water that runs off its surface would still need to be treated.

Private waste hauler Republic Services the city’s exclusive waste removal contractor appears to still be catching up on some pickup routes following multiple delays caused by weather and the holidays.

The city council now plans to address the issue at its meeting later this month.

Extreme cold caused delays the week before Christmas

City Clerk Adam Geffert told the Post Republic Services halted services on Dec. 22 and Dec. 23 “due to the extremely cold temperatures and blowing snow.”

Republic cited driver safety and their trucks’ hydraulic systems as the main concerns at that time Geffert said.

Other trash haulers in Johnson County and the Kansas City region canceled pickups those days due to the weather.

The city was told residents with Thursday and Friday pickups that week could put out as much trash as they wanted the following week and it would all be picked up.

Go deeper: This is not the first time Republic Services fell short on pickups in Prairie Village — or Johnson County.

But mechanical issues caused more delays

Geffert said delays in pickups continued through the week between Christmas and New Year’s.

Some homes in the area south of 75th Street and east of Mission Road were missed for two straight weeks.

Ultimately Geffert said Republic told the city on Monday that mechanical issues with some trucks prevented the completion of routes last week.

As of Tuesday Geffert said most routes in the city had now been completed.

The city now plans to fine Republic

Geffert said he told Republic on Tuesday after multiple attempts to contact the company over the New Year’s weekend that it was unacceptable to fail to update the city with multiple days worth of service issues.

“We are able to assess fines for service issues and intend to do so this month” Geffert said. “Needless to say city staff is frustrated with their performance and we apologize to residents for having to deal with these issues.”

Residents are fed up

“All in all it’s a mess” Prairie Village resident Carly Duvall said in an email to the Post.

She lives in the impacted area and says she went without a waste pickup from Dec. 16 to Monday.

She said she understands trash delays happen but thinks it unacceptable for a week-long delay to occur in the middle of the holiday season.

A lack of communication led to many residents leaving their trash out from Dec. 26 to Dec. 31 — allowing animals to rummage and wind to blow trash around she said.

Organizations in virtually every industry are looking for talented people who know how to build and maintain software.

If you have been coding for a while you might wonder how to leverage your coding experience and advance to the next stage of your career. Fortunately programmers have a variety of options as they look to expand on the mid-level corporate career track. Examples include developer advocate technical product manager and technical project manager—to name a few.

After programming what's next?

“We have seen developers go into devops roles project management business analyst product management and project coordinator positions” said Thomas Vick regional vice president for recruitment firm Robert Half’s technology practice. “It’s relatively common as more and more people are wanting to get out of positions that are strictly coding roles. They are seeking positions that are more interesting to them.”

There are four common paths to career advancement for software developers says Andi Blackwell project management vertical lead talent operations at recruitment firm Toptal.

Software architecture

One of the paths is architecture. “These roles are highly technical and are focused on designing building and integrating the foundational components of applications or systems” Blackwell says. “This would include roles like technical/application architect solution architect or enterprise architect.”

Devops

The move into devops is another common path for software developers. These positions are also highly technical says Blackwell and are focused on optimizing the tools processes and systems to build test release and manage high-quality software in complex or high-availability environments. Devops roles include release manager engineer and architect.

Leadership

A third path is leadership. “Roles in this area require both good people skills and good technical skills” Blackwell says. “And each in their own way is responsible for ensuring that teams have what they need to succeed whether technical process tools or skills.” Roles on the leadership path include scrum master technical project manager product manager technical lead and development manager.

Business and developer advocacy

A fourth path is business development and client success. These roles are focused on supporting business growth and retention. Developers in these roles work with the sales team to bring in new clients or with new and existing clients directly to help them use or implement the company’s products Blackwell says. Roles on this path include sales engineer client solution architect and developer advocate.

How to position yourself for success

How can an ambitious programmer get on a corporate career track that opens doors to other positions? First it’s a good idea to learn everything you can about the range of career paths and roles in your current company as well as the field in general.

Developers ""should do their research and read through job descriptions to make sure they have a thorough understanding of exactly what the positions they are seeking entails” Vick says. “It is also good for them to reach out to a recruiting firm to better understand what the positions require and for advice on how best to get themselves set up to take a position like the ones they are seeking.”

Once you know you want to move on to a new position a good next step is to pursue the skills required for the role or roles that interest you. Vick suggests researching the available certifications and classes for the positions you want.

“I’d also recommend they do their research and read job descriptions to help know what employers are looking for in those roles” and reach out to recruiting firms for help in finding the type of positions they’re seeking Vick says. “Any mentorship or coaching they might be able to find is also helpful” he says.

Learning and advancing on the job

Programmers should consider looking for opportunities in their current place of employment to discover potential roles they can fill Blackwell says. “Apply for open jobs to get hands-on experience since frequently companies give priority to hiring internally for roles and may even provide financial help to complete courses and/or certifications” she says.

In addition programmers can look to gain experience in areas that are not part of their existing job responsibilities. “You can volunteer to help solve a particular problem by identifying key pain points you and your colleagues may experience and step up by suggesting solutions” Blackwell says. “This offers an opportunity to learn on the job and be recognized by superiors for your helpful contributions.”

Find your best fit

Another way to get on-the-job experience is to look for opportunities at smaller companies “which are often a great place for developers to do just this because team members often wear multiple hats” Blackwell says. “You can typically utilize your current core skill set while gaining valuable experience in your chosen career path.”

Another possibility is to create new technology focus groups at their current organizations or within their community of programmers to help others upskill in this area. “Within this create opportunities for yourself and others in the group to learn and apply the skills” Blackwell says. “Along similar lines there may be technical groups you can join on LinkedIn for example where you can meet others with similar goals or experts in your areas of interest.”

Ultimately advancing from a programmer position is about finding the best fit. “Understand and identify what you enjoy working on and what your core strengths are” she says. “For example if you enjoy helping people perform at their best and grow professionally perhaps those roles that involve managing people would be a great fit. If you enjoy helping clients solve business problems using technology a business development role might be a good fit.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvMDQvdGhlLWpvYnMtcGVvcGxlLWFyZS1tb3N0LWxpa2VseS10by1xdWl0LWluLTIwMjMtYWNjb3JkaW5nLXRvLXBheXNjYWxlLmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMy8wMS8wNC90aGUtam9icy1wZW9wbGUtYXJlLW1vc3QtbGlrZWx5LXRvLXF1aXQtaW4tMjAyMy1hY2NvcmRpbmctdG8tcGF5c2NhbGUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 10 jobs people are most likely to quit in 2023 according to new research,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvMDQvdGhlLWpvYnMtcGVvcGxlLWFyZS1tb3N0LWxpa2VseS10by1xdWl0LWluLTIwMjMtYWNjb3JkaW5nLXRvLXBheXNjYWxlLmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMy8wMS8wNC90aGUtam9icy1wZW9wbGUtYXJlLW1vc3QtbGlrZWx5LXRvLXF1aXQtaW4tMjAyMy1hY2NvcmRpbmctdG8tcGF5c2NhbGUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E4C60370>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

To maintain this growth leaders should leverage digital technologies adopt strategies for the future of work and drive supply chain resiliency.” Deloitte

The Deloitte report 2023 manufacturing industry outlook predicts that manufacturers will likely continue progressing toward smart factory transformations as these initiatives drive future competitiveness.

Many manufacturers are making investments in laying the technology foundation for their smart factories. One in five manufacturers is already experimenting with underlying solutions or actively developing a metaverse platform for their products and services.

Trends influencing ASEAN’s manufacturers

According to Euromonitor International’s Voice of the Industry: Digital survey around 62% of companies globally plan to increase their investment in cloud computing over the next five years while around 50% of companies plan to invest in Artificial Intelligence the Internet of Things and production automation tools.

Pavan Mahajan VP of solutions delivery for APAC at Belden observes that the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies gaining momentum among manufacturing companies in the region. He attributes this trend to manufacturers seeking to accelerate their journey towards full digital transformation.

Boston Consulting Group observes that harnessing Industry 4.0 will be key in helping the ASEAN manufacturing sector become more competitive and move up the value chain with Singapore Malaysia and Vietnam among countries that are already investing in smart manufacturing solutions such as smart factories industrial IoT advanced robotics and cloud computing.

“Customers are beginning to embrace the desire for digital transformation and are looking to transform their manufacturing ecosystem with industrial automation and smart solutions” added Mahajan.

Industry 4.0 investment priorities

Justinas Liuima

According to Justinas Liuima insights manager industrial with Euromonitor International says to partly solve the problem and compensate for rapid wage growth companies are forecast to accelerate their investment in production automation tools in 2023.

“Production automation in many cases could be the only viable option for companies to ensure productivity growth” opined Liuima.

Mahajan says among Belden’s customers in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region a key investment area is IT/OT convergence.

IDC predicts that by 2024 50% of industrial organisations will be integrating data from edge OT systems with cloud-based reporting and analytics moving from single-asset views to sitewide operational awareness. The IT/OT convergence market in APAC is estimated to develop at the highest CAGR of 7.1% from 2022 to 2027 from US$49195 million in 2021 to US$73523 million in 2027.

“As data becomes increasingly crucial for manufacturing companies to solve business challenges and achieve greater operational efficiency performance safety and profitability having access to an optimised convergent network is key” noted Mahajan.

With both IT and OT data available he opined that companies could collect move integrate and analyse data to automate processes and make better more informed business decisions. “The additional capabilities in an IT/OT converged network such as edge computing and analytics will also usher in even greater opportunities for productivity and problem-solving” he added.

Mahajan said that another key area of investment for manufacturers is in edge-to-cloud environments especially edge technologies. We are seeing a higher level of acceptance and readiness among our manufacturing customers to invest in industrial edge solutions with an increasing adoption rate over the past two years.

This is happening worldwide as well as in APAC with GlobalData predicting that the global edge computing market will reach US$17.8 billion by 2025 with APAC sales accounting for 26.4%.

“As Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Industry 4.0 continue to gain momentum investing in industrial edge capabilities will be key in enabling fully connected operational systems reducing latency and cost of data processing while maintaining security and communication with the cloud” concluded Mahajan.

Core competencies needed to benefit from Industry 4.0 innovations

Katarzyna Grzybowska and Anna Łupicka authors of the report Key competencies for Industry 4.0 noted that the demand for special skills will drive the shift of job creation within Industry 4.0 requiring more qualified managers.

For his part Mahajan believes that to benefit from industry 4.0 manufacturers will need to have skills in network security and data management and governance.

“The expanded highly connected networks with more data transmission points which are characteristic of Industry 4.0 create a greater need for security. This only grows with the integration of cloud computing edge computing and the presence of older devices on an industrial network that can be more vulnerable” he explained.

Pavan Mahajan

“Manufacturers need to have proper security measures in place to ensure network security including the implementation of advanced network access control systems industrial cybersecurity firewalls and other hardware components to secure network infrastructures.” Pavan Mahajan

He added that manufacturers also need to place more emphasis on industrial data management and governance. “With the adoption of smart technologies and IIoT more and more devices are getting networked and connected. Organisations need to have a strong data governance policy that outlines how data needs to be stored managed accessed and analysed and by whom to ensure data isn’t lost stolen or misused” concluded Mahajan.

Top recommendations for ASEAN manufacturers

According to Mahajan the pandemic has shown that digitisation which leads to digitalisation and usage of advanced technologies is key to staying resilient and agile in the face of major disruptions.

“As we move into a 2023 full of uncertainties manufacturers in ASEAN need to further accelerate their digital transformation journey prioritising the adoption of technologies such as warehouse automation and connected manufacturing” he opined.

Mahajan posited that moving towards full automation for warehouses will help boost productivity and operational efficiency for manufacturers at the material handling level.

“Beyond being able to streamline workflows eliminate waste and maximise output smart automated warehouses will also be flexible and robust enough to support future technologies and processes effectively futureproofing network infrastructures against changes and disruptions” he continued.

“Depending on their focus and goals manufacturers could also consider making the leap towards connected manufacturing which harnesses the power of data to transform operations as well as customer and employee experience. With many uncertainties and challenges facing manufacturers now it can be difficult for them to focus on the future” he cautioned.

“Transitioning to connected manufacturing will ultimately enable manufacturers to stay ahead of the curve with significant long-term benefits such as boosting efficiency reducing costs and enhancing communication across all stages of manufacturing.” Pavan Mahajan

“As the threat landscape is becoming more sophisticated than ever manufacturers should look to reinforce their network security. Security should be taken into account at the initial stage of network design for a more holistic and effective approach to securing modern industrial networks.

“At the same time security best practices such as implementing firewalls and continuous monitoring of potential threats should be applied in day-to-day operations to minimise security risks” he concluded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYm9zc21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9iZXN0LXNtYXJ0LWZhY3Rvcmllcy1hbmQtc29sdXRpb25zL9IBQ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYm9zc21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9iZXN0LXNtYXJ0LWZhY3Rvcmllcy1hbmQtc29sdXRpb25zL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Best Smart Factories and Solutions,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYm9zc21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9iZXN0LXNtYXJ0LWZhY3Rvcmllcy1hbmQtc29sdXRpb25zL9IBQ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYm9zc21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9iZXN0LXNtYXJ0LWZhY3Rvcmllcy1hbmQtc29sdXRpb25zL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E57AC940>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

After a year like 2022 a new year is a great opportunity to look for safe stocks to buy and hold. The definition of a safe stock is broad so this article will focus on a select group of stocks known as dividend kings.

Dividends are a portion of a company’s profits (i.e. earnings) paid as cash on a regular schedule frequently quarterly. Investors should look for companies that not only continue to issue dividends on a year-over-year (YOY) basis but continue to increase their dividends every year.

The best of the best are the dividend kings. These companies have increased their dividend for at least 50 consecutive years. That’s longer than many investors reading this article have been alive.

They may not offer the highest dividend yield. But the reliability of the company’s dividend points to mature stable business models that allow the company to generate sufficient profit to reward their shareholders while continuing to invest in their businesses.

In bull markets these companies won’t be the highest flyers. But when the market is struggling these stocks can help you mitigate your risk. Here are seven dividend kings that should be on your list of safe stocks to buy and hold forever.

Safe Stocks to Buy and Hold: PPG Industries (PPG)

PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) is a more recent addition to the dividend kings list. The company is a global manufacturer and distributor of paints coatings and specialty materials. In addition to being the parent company of consumer brands like Glidden paint PPG offers removable coatings for a range of commercial applications in sectors including automotive industrial and aerospace.

Like many companies PPG will post a YOY drop in earnings. However it’s expected to post earnings in 2023 that will outpace 2021 numbers.

Dividend kings are frequently seen as low-growth companies. However PPG continues to pursue a strategy of growth through acquisition. At the company’s 2022 Investor Day it reported that over the last 10 years the company is has committed 37% of its cash to acquisitions.

That hasn’t prevented the company from allocating approximately 55% of its cash for dividends with three-year dividend growth coming in at around 7% annually. PPG has a dividend yield of 1.98% and a payout of $2.48 per share on an annual basis.

Stepan (SCL)

Many investors may not be familiar with Stepan (NYSE:SCL). The company produces and distributes specialty chemicals used in a variety of applications such as soap and cosmetics. Because of the specialty nature of the company’s chemicals it doesn’t have competitors that precisely match its business.

In 2022 SCL stock dropped 14%. That was better than the broader market but still somewhat curious since the company grew revenue and earnings on a YOY basis. That pattern is expected to continue over the next five years.

That growth helps support the company’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio which is below the market average at around 16 times earnings. And that will be more than enough to support the company’s dividend payout ratio which is around 20% as of this writing.

Stepan isn’t heavily covered by the analyst community. But it does have a price target of $137 which is a 30% increase from the current stock price.

Safe Stocks to Buy and Hold: Emerson Electric (EMR)

Prior to October 2022 Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) stock was down more than 20% for the year. But it’s made a charge in the last quarter and is now trading flat over the last 12 months.

This may mean investors who are looking for safety are putting the company’s dividend over its declining earnings due to a restructuring. Emerson Electric is attempting to become a pure-play automation company. This would allow it to compete with Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK). However the cost of this restructuring affected earnings in 2022 and may continue to be a slight drag in 2023.

The company has a net margin of 16.5% which is more than double the sector average. And with a 65-year history of increasing its dividend Emerson Electric is one of the longest standing of the dividend kings. The current dividend yield is 2.17% and it has an average annual payout of $2.08.

Dover Corporation (DOV)

Dover Corporation (NYSE:DOV) is the next dividend king on this list of safe stocks to buy and hold. The company operates in the industrial sector. This helps the company provide a steady stream of consistent revenue and earnings. Dover has a global presence. However just over 50% of the company’s revenues come from the United States.

Due to the realization of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed by Congress in 2021 the industrial sector is expected to be one of the leading sectors in 2023. But the company’s growth is expected to continue in the next five years and will be assisted by a profit margin which is well above the sector average.

The company’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are expected to be about $8.44 in 2022. That would be a 24% gain from the prior year. And in 2023 the company projects EPS of $8.92.

Safe Stocks to Buy and Hold: American States Water (AWR)

Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.com

When it comes to safe stocks to buy and hold the utility sector is a logical choice and American States Water (NYSE:AWR) is a leader among water companies. The utility giant has a service territory that spans nine states and one million customers.

Historical performance shows American States Water is a strong performer. One benefit of owning dividend kings is the total return you can get over time. AWR stock was down 19% in 2022. That’s better than the broader market. However over the last five years the company has generated stock price growth of 74%. That combines with a dividend that has grown at a 10% average annual rate over the last three years.

Investors who are considering American States Water as a long-term investment can point to its net margin. At 16.6% it’s more than double the sector average of 7.9%. That helps provide some context to a stock that has a forward P/E ratio around 34 times earnings.

PepsiCo (PEP)

Late last year I put both Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) on a list of consumer stocks that could soar in 2023. One of the reasons is both companies are defensive stocks. This means they have products that are in demand no matter what is happening in the broader economy.

PepsiCo offers a portfolio that includes both beverages and snack foods. With brand names such as Doritos and Quaker Foods the company straddles the line between “junk foods” and healthy options. Pepsi’s products can be considered both discretionary purchases and staples in consumer pantries.

The company delivers strong fundamentals including a profit margin that is slightly above the sector average. Plus PEP is a low-beta stock which means it tends to be less volatile than the broader market. Pepsi is a more recent entry into the dividend king club and currently has a dividend yield of 2.6%.

Safe Stocks to Buy and Hold: Kimberly Clark (KMB)

Source: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.com

Last on this list of safe stocks to buy and hold is Kimberly Clark (NYSE:KMB). When you think about defensive stocks you think about a stock like KMB. The company has a portfolio of products that are the definition of consumer staples. And with trusted name brands consumers will continue to buy the company’s products.

Revenue growth hasn’t been spectacular. But at a time when companies are having trouble passing along higher prices Kimberly Clark appears to have pricing power.

Over the past five years the stock has grown about 16%. That averages out to around 3% per year. For the four years prior to 2022 that wouldn’t be seen as impressive growth. But last year the stock’s loss of 5% was well below the market average. And when you factor in a dividend yield of 3.4% you can see how defensive stocks can be a great fit for a portfolio in any economy.

Rodriguez/Getty Images

Bleacher Report catches you up on the latest news from the WWE Universe.

Rhodes Edge Reportedly Weren't Slated for Raw Return

Despite plenty of buzz and speculation on social media there were reportedly never any plans for Cody Rhodes or Edge to make a live appearance on Monday night's episode of WWE Raw.

According to Fightful Select (h/t WrestlingInc's Colby Applegate) there was ""no indication"" that either Rhodes or Edge was supposed to return suggesting that Raw went off as scheduled.

Rhodes has been out of action since June with a torn pectoral muscle but WWE has seemingly begun the process of integrating him back into the product.

On last week's ""Best of 2022"" episode of Raw Rhodes took part in an interview segment. That was followed this week by a vignette hyping Cody's eventual return.

It has long been speculated by fans that Rhodes would be back in time for the Royal Rumble at the end of January and the timing of the vignette likely means that is the target date for Cody's in-ring return.

As for Edge he has been away from WWE since losing an 'I Quit' match to Finn Bálor at Extreme Rules in October. Finn Bálor won the match when Edge quit in an effort to prevent The Judgment Day from harming his wife Beth Phoenix.

Despite Edge's submission Rhea Ripley followed through with hitting Beth with a conchairto and neither member of the Hall of Fame couple has been seen on WWE programming ever since.

Like Rhodes Edge is a strong candidate to return for the Rumble since he is one of the top stars WWE has to offer.

Bliss Reportedly Expected to Play Heel Role

After snapping and attacking a referee and Raw women's champion Bianca Belair on Monday Alexa Bliss has reportedly undergone an official character change.

According to PWInsider Elite (h/t WrestlingInc's Sean Neumann) Alexa's actions on Raw marked her heel turn and she will continue to be a heel moving forward.

Belair and Bliss were close throughout the summer and fall as they teamed with Asuka against Damage CTRL. Their dynamic recently began to change however particularly once Bliss became the No. 1 contender for the Raw women's title.

Alexa attacked Belair from behind during an interview segment leading up to their match and she went even further to the dark side on Monday.

In the midst of her title match against Raw Bliss was distracted by two people in the crowd wearing the Bray Wyatt-related Uncle Howdy mask. She was also impacted by Wyatt's logo flashing on the big screen.

That prompted Bliss to attack the referee causing a disqualification. She then shifted her focus to The EST and hit her with a DDT on the steel stairs leaving Belair bloodied.

There is seemingly a much larger story left to tell with Bliss and Wyatt as their angle was never resolved during the aftermath of WrestleMania 37.

Bliss distracted Wyatt and cost him his match against Randy Orton at WrestleMania 37 and Wyatt was then released from the company a few months later.

WWE seems to be going back to that storyline which should allow for some of the loose ends to be tied up in the coming weeks and months.

Rollins' Cryptic Tweet Leads to Injury Speculation

Seth Rollins got WWE fans talking Tuesday with a simple three-word tweet.

After potentially suffering an injury on Raw Rollins tweeted the words ""Redesign. Rebuild. Reclaim"" which was one of his slogans several years ago:

Specifically Rollins used that motto after suffering a torn ACL in November 2015. The injury forced him to vacate the WWE World Heavyweight Championship and he remained out for nearly seven months.

At one point during his United States Championship match against Austin Theory on Monday's episode of Raw Rollins seemed to tweak his knee but he was able to finish the bout.

Per Marc Middleton of WrestlingHeadlines.com Rollins and the referee threw up the ""X"" sign after the match which is typically an indication that a wrestler is injured.

Raw announcer Corey Graves then checked on Rollins and reportedly helped him to the back with Rollins being unable to put much weight on one of his legs.

Fans are now left to wonder if Rollins is legitimately injured or if it was merely an angle that will play into the road to Royal Rumble and WrestleMania.

After Carnival Cruise Line it is the second largest cruise line.

As of January 2021 it owns three cruise lines: Royal Caribbean International Silversea Cruises and Celebrity Cruises. They also have a 50% stake in TUI cruises CDF Croisières de France and Pullmantur Cruises. So who owns Royal Caribbean?

The History

This group was originally called Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Things changed in 1997 when it bought Celebrity Cruises. The decision was made to keep the two brands separate following the initial merger. The company was later rebranded to Royal Caribbean International because of this decision. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd was made the parent company of both brands.

In 2000 Island Cruises formed as a joint venture between Royal Caribbean and First Choice Holidays. It became a type of informal line for the Brazilian and British markets.

Another acquisition occurred in 2006 with the purchase of Pullmantur Cruises in Spain. Following this purchase Royal Caribbean experienced a rapid expansion by creating Azamara Cruises. Azamara Cruises became a subsidiary of its Celebrity Cruises branch in 2007. May 2008 saw the company form CDF Croisieres de France to reach the French-speaking markets.

In 2009 they expanded into the German market by acquiring shares in TUI Cruises. The subsidiary of TUI Cruise TUI Travel contained 50% interest in Island Cruises after merging with First Choice Holidays. Holdings were rationalized by selling TUI Island Cruises.

A joint venture was announced in 2019 with ITM Group which led to the formation of Holistica to develop cruise destinations. The only area they want to establish is Grand Lucayan Resort in Freeport. The hotel campus had been sold to a subsidiary of the Bahamian Government.

Royal Caribbean Cruises bought the remaining Silversea Cruises shares in 2020. They changed the logo and renamed themselves Royal Caribbean Group. They later sold Azamara Cruises to Sycamore Partners for $201 million.

Just recently in 2022 they obtained court approval to buy Endeavor a former ship for Crystal Cruise for $275 million. It will later be renamed Silver Endeavor when it joins the Silversea Cruise fleet.

Who Owns Royal Caribbean?

Royal Caribbean International and its numerous subsidiaries fall under the Royal Caribbean Group banner. They have a fleet of 64 cruise ships and travel to 1000 destinations around the world.

Capital Research & Management owns the most shares in Royal Caribbean. Capital is a large investment group formed in 1931 with $2.6 trillion in assets in its portfolio. Currently they own 16% of the cruise company.

Even this 16% ownership is split between several branches within the group—Capital Research & Management Company’s international investors have an 11.66% stake. The remaining top ten of their shareholders are large investment groups like JPMorgan The Vanguard Group and several others.

Who was the Founder of Royal Caribbean International?

Royal Caribbean International was founded in 1968 in Norway by three shipping companies. These founding companies were IM Skaugen & Company Anders Wilhelmsen & Company and Gotaas Larsen. Song of Norway was their first ship which launched two years later. Nordic Prince was added one year later and Sun Viking followed in 1972.

In 1978 Song of Norway was the first cruise ship to be lengthened by adding an 85-foot section to a severed center of the ship. Since this project was so successful the company decided to do the same to Nordic Prince two years later. During the modification the sterns were changed creating additional space. The only ship that wasn’t changed was Sun Viking.

The group that founded Royal Caribbean later listed itself on the New York Stock Exchange before becoming the Royal Caribbean Group. This same group later incorporated the company in Liberia.

The company chose to incorporate in Liberia to avoid paying U.S. taxes and having to follow the labor and wage laws of the country. This is the same logic that several cruise lines adopt by registering themselves in countries like the Bahamas.

Who Is the CEO of Royal Caribbean?

Michael Bayley is president and CEO of Royal Caribbean International. The president and CEO of Royal Caribbean Group is Jason Liberty.

What Is the Net Worth of Royal Caribbean?

There is no listed net worth for Royal Caribbean International. However Royal Caribbean Group had a net worth of $11.93 billion in September 2022. This number places it ahead of Carnival Group by $1 billion.

Does the Company Have Stock?

Royal Caribbean Group does have stock and the New York Stock Exchange lists them as RCL. Royal Caribbean International however does not have stock. Currently Royal Caribbean Group contains the highest value for cruise line stocks for people to invest in.

If you make an investment and purchase 100 shares you receive shareholder benefits when you cruise on one of their Royal Caribbean ships. This also applies to Celebrity Cruises except for cruises to the Galapagos Islands.

Shareholder benefits include:

$250 onboard credit per stateroom for cruises lasting 14 nights or longer

$100 onboard credit per stateroom for cruises lasting 6-13 nights

$50 onboard credit per stateroom for cruises lasting five nights or less

To claim these benefits stakeholders should apply through the Royal Caribbean website. You will need to provide proof of your shares.

How Are Shares Purchased?

Shares are purchased using a stockbroker. They may be a licensed stockbroker or smartphone/laptop platforms. You will need to find a platform that deals with the NYSE and make a request to purchase RCL stock.

Stockbrokers tend to cost more; however they will offer you advice. This is usually better for those who need help deciding what to invest in. However if you understand the risks going through the online stockbroker platform tends to be cheaper.

Conclusion

Three shipping companies originally founded Royal Caribbean. Through diligent work and strategic expansion efforts they quickly morphed into a vast empire enjoyed by millions of cruisers each year. Royal Caribbean continues to stay on the top of the cruise line empire by continually adapting itself to suit changing times.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJveWFsY2FyaWJiZWFuYmxvZy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8wMy9yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tZXhwZXJpbWVudHMtbmV3LWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQteW91bmdlci1taWxsZW5uaWFsLWd1ZXN0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean experiments with new entertainment for younger Millennial guests,"If you're between the age of 18 and 25 there's now more activities for you to do on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship than before.

Royal Caribbean has quietly unveiled a new activities program aimed at an age group that has traditionally found itself on the periphery of things to do on a cruise ship.

The new activities are referred to as the Hyperlink program and they aim to bridge cruise ship activities following the teen club age to the more common adult offerings.

Speaking to travel agents on Wonder of the Seas last week Royal Caribbean Director of Entertainment Activities & Media Operations Ken Rush talked briefly about the new option.

""We have been doing we've been doing a trial on the Symphony of the Seas of what we're calling the Hyperlink program which is going to be a new program for the 18 to 25 year olds. So we're doing that right now and it's coming.""

Since then the program has been spotted in the Cruise Compass of other ships across the fleet including Odyssey of the Seas and Wonder of the Seas.

It's not clear yet which ships offer it or not.

Addressing a need

For many young adults on a cruise they see a gap in programming that appeals to them once they are too old for the teen club.

Royal Caribbean limits the teen club to passengers 17 years and younger which means anyone between the age of 18-20 is found in a middle ground of being too old for the teen club but not old enough to drink.

Examples of events

In looking through the Royal Caribbean app we can see examples of the events the Hyperlink program includes.

Similar to the teen events there are now special events listed that cater only to guests between the age of 18-25.

It appears the goal is to gather passengers of this age so they can meet and spend time together with the intention of fostering new friendships.

Just like other events there's no pre-registration needed. Guests of this age can simply show up at the selected time and location.

Royal Caribbean's activities staff curate the event just like other events onboard.

More for millennials

There are an estimated 80 million millennials in the United States making them the largest generation currently.

The Hyperlink program is aimed at guests at the younger end of the spectrum as the millennial generation spans anyone born between 1980 and 2000.

An estimated 32% of millennials have already taken a cruise in the last five years and Millennials seem to like the idea that cruises are transportation and accommodation in one. The appeal of leaving your bags unpacked the entire trip has caught on and cruise lines are highlighting this as they expand their offerings.

While millennials may not make up the majority of cruise passengers right now getting them on board will become increasingly more important as they get older.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXRyYWRlLWNydWlzZS5jb20vc2hpcGJ1aWxkaW5nLXJlZnVyYi1lcXVpcG1lbnQvcm95YWwtY2FyaWJiZWFuLXNob3dzLXdoYXQtd2VudC1jcmVhdGluZy1pY29uLXNlYXMtYXF1YWRvbWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean shows what went into creating Icon of Seas' AquaDome,"A tranquil oasis by day for lounging dining and fountain shows by night it transforms into an entertainment hot spot with Royal Caribbean International's high-dive aqua shows slackliners and aerialists.

One of eight neighborhoods

A new episode of the 'Making an Icon' video series traces the inspiration planning and challenges that went into AquaDome one of the eight neighborhoods on the world's future largest cruise ship.

'It came all the way down from our chairman who sketched the dome on a napkin and handed it to the shipyard and said ""Build me this""' said RCI's Jay Rosser senior product owner product development explaining the AquaDome's origin.

Richard Fain's sketch on a napkin

'Taking something that works down below onboard the ship and in the aft part and moving [it] forward and high up and is not the most natural thing for an architect' said Harri Kulovaara EVP maritime Royal Caribbean Group in a characteristically Finnish understatement about relocating the iconic AquaTheater into the dome.

Impacts stability

'The higher you lift the weight the more impact it brings on the ship's stability and the center of gravity within the ship ... [that] was quite a lot of challenge to the engineers' elaborated Kelly Gonzalez SVP architectural design/newbuilding Royal Caribbean Group noting that additional collaboration and testing was needed.

The largest structure of glass and steel that's ever been lifted onto a cruise ship according to 'Making an Icon: Creating AquaDome' the 363-ton structure was assembled at Meyer Turku and then attached to a 154-ton rig to hold it in place for the move. It took eight months to assemble the 12 modules comprising the dome.

What'll happen inside

Aside from the marvel of engineering assembly and installation is another marvel: what will take place inside.

Oasis-class AquaTheaters are in the open but for Icon class the AquaTheater is inside 'which means we can control the weather we can control the production values the lighting the smoke effects. It's all now at the touch of a button' explained RCI's Nick Weir SVP entertainment.

Stage lifts robot arms and aerial pas de deux

There are 60-foot dive platforms stage lifts that give more flexibility and six axis robot arms to work wonders while computers and winches will allow flying artists to perform in any position with the first-ever double system according to Weir enabling an aerial pas de deux.

Duke University/Instagram Jerry Seinfeld gives the commencement address at Duke University on May 12 2024

Jerry Seinfeld has some apologies to offer nearly two decades after the release of Bee Movie.

On Sunday May 12 the Seinfeld alum 70 gave a commencement address to the graduating seniors at Duke University in Durham North Carolina — where his son Julian currently attends and his daughter Sascha previously graduated from.

During his speech the comedian took time to reflect on his 2007 animated film Bee Movie — specifically one controversial element of the storyline.

""I made a cartoon movie about bees you may have watched as a child"" Seinfeld said in a video captured by an attendee and shared on TikTok.

""If any of you felt slightly uncomfortable about the sexual undertones in the relationship between Barry B. Benson and Vanessa the florist who saves his life I would like to apologize for that now"" he continued earning laughs from the crowd. ""I may not have calibrated that perfectly.""

Fans of the DreamWorks kids' movie have previously made long-running jokes about the romantic tension between Seinfeld's character in the film Barry (a bee) and Renée Zellweger's character Vanessa (a human). Back in October 2021 Seinfeld addressed the same issue during an appearance on The Tonight Show apologizing once again for the innuendo.

""I apologize for what seems to be a certain uncomfortable subtle sexual aspect of the Bee Movie"" he said at the time. ""[It] really was not intentional but after it came out I realized this is really not appropriate for children. Because the bee seems to have a thing for the girl and we don’t really want to pursue that as an idea in children’s entertainment.""

Seinfeld's commencement speech at Duke also drew public attention when anti-war protesters walked out of the ceremony and booed from the audience when the TV star took the podium according to NBC News and CBS News.

Seinfeld has been making a slew of public appearances in recent weeks in support of his newest movie Unfrosted which marks his feature-film directorial debut. Speaking with PEOPLE at the premiere of the movie on April 30 Seinfeld opened up about taking on the role of director for the first time in his career.

""You don't want to think about that this is a really big important job. Like the pilot never wants to come on the PA system and go 'I'm going to try and get this plane in the air.' You have to be confident"" he said.

Seinfeld previously told PEOPLE that he has ""been obsessed with Pop-Tarts my whole life"" which is what inspired him to take on the movie.

""My friend Spike Feresten who was a writer on my show and is still a good friend of mine thought we should make a movie out of the story the real story which we did"" he explained.



Unfrosted — which features a star-studded cast including Melissa McCarthy Jim Gaffigan Hugh Grant and more — is set in 1963 Battle Creek Mich. when ""Kellogg's and Post sworn cereal rivals race to create a pastry that will change the face of breakfast forever"" according to a synopsis.

Text description provided by the architects. This project is a weekend house in the mountains of the Sierra de Arteaga in the state of Coahuila in northern Mexico. The house is laid out on the slope of an old orchard in mountainous surroundings to have minimal impact on the site and natural vegetation. This solution also ensured the best views as the orchard vegetation is much more open and lower than the surrounding forest.

The house is divided into three parts: an elongated 40 m × 10 m rectangle defining enclosed areas of shelter the services at each end and a central social area around the fireplace. All these areas are connected by a long terrace looking directly towards the mountains through a sequence of beams and pillars forming the external structure of the house while framing the natural landscape.

The volume is perforated with courtyards that break up the program and bring natural light inside.

The largest of these contains a staircase leading up to the roof where there are 360-degree views over the valley and the mountains.

The construction comprises exposed concrete walls pillars and beams poured with horizontal formwork metalwork details and large glass panels with aluminum frames. The site also contains a viewpoint and firepit that is independent of the house and an outdoor table seating up to 20 both constructed as concrete monoliths.

The house is understood as a kind of sanctuary where its users move away from the city and meet nature. The house allows them to connect with their natural environment generating a deep awareness of the place resources and the world they inhabit safely and pleasantly.

Although the house belongs to a family the experience of going to their refuge in the mountains generates moments of reflection and self-discovery for each of its members according to their ages their roles and family responsibilities. The house is understood as a refuge and an observatory an instrument to observe the landscape the mountains and the forest and feel the time passing by."

The company said Wednesday it's reducing its headcount by 10% while pursuing ""select real estate exits and office space reductions within certain markets"" according to a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company expects its real estate restructuring to be completed by 2026 according to the filing. Salesforce has more than 70000 employees globally.

A representative for Salesforce a seller of software related to functions such as sales analytics and marketing declined to comment on questions from CoStar News on the properties it plans to leave.

Salesforce founded in 1999 occupies roughly 3.8 million square feet across the U.S. and it had recently called some employees back to the office in a reversal of an earlier remote work policy. The layoff of thousands of its employees comes after the company has sponsored advertisements featuring actor Matthew McConaughey talking about using ""our power and our people"" and that ""hope and trust are in short supply.""

Its headquarters is located in San Francisco's tallest building the 61-story 415 Mission St. according to CoStar data. The company also owns the 42-story 50 Fremont St. in San Francisco after buying the building for $640 million or about $783 per square foot in February 2015.

Salesforce plans to move into a roughly 500000-square-foot space in Chicago this year at 333 W. Wolf Point Plaza according to CoStar data. Its other major hubs include New York where it occupies roughly 271000 square feet and Atlanta where it leases about 160000 square feet. Other sizable Salesforce offices are located in Dallas Indianapolis Salt Lake City and Toronto where it occupies roughly 63000 square feet and 11000 square feet in Vancouver according to CoStar data.

The company in November was telling some employees to return to the office as sales slowed in the wake of adopting its ""work from anywhere policy"" in 2021 allowing employees to work remotely for as many as four days a week.

Tech companies were among some of the most visible adopters of remote work policies after the pandemic started in March 2020. However some of these companies began calling employees back to the office last year including Apple Twitter and Snapchat parent company Snap Inc.

Salesforce expects to spend between $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion in charges related to its restructuring plan according to the SEC filing.

""As our revenue accelerated through the pandemic we hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we’re now facing and I take responsibility for that"" Co-CEO Marc Benioff said in a letter to employees on Jan. 4.

",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8wNC9zYWxlc2ZvcmNlLXRvLWN1dC13b3JrZm9yY2UtYnktMTAtYWZ0ZXItaGlyaW5nLXRvby1tYW55LXBlb3BsZS1kdXJpbmctdGhlLXBhbmRlbWljL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Salesforce to cut workforce by 10% after hiring 'too many people' during the pandemic,"Salesforce has announced that it’s cutting some 10% of its workforce impacting more than 7000 employees while it will also shutter offices in “certain markets.”

In a letter to employees and a corresponding filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff referenced the “challenging” environment in which it’s operating pointing to the “more measured approach” its customers are making with their purchasing decisions.

Similar to other companies hit by significant layoffs over the past year Benioff added that Salesforce had hired too many people through the pandemic during the boom times. For context the company claimed 79000 employees last February a 30% increase on 2020.

“I’ve been thinking a lot about how we came to this moment” Benioff wrote. “As our revenue accelerated through the pandemic we hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we’re now facing and I take responsibility for that.”

Benioff said that those impacted in the U.S. will receive a “minimum” of almost five months worth of pay as well as health insurance and “other benefits to help with their transition.” Outside the U.S. Benioff said workers can expect a “similar level of support.”

Tough times

The news follows just a few months after activist investor Starboard Value acquired a stake in the enterprise software company with our analysis at the time concluding that Starboard was seeking cost-cutting measures as part of its investment. Certainly Salesforce revealed an initial round of layoffs in early November affecting “hundreds” of workers with co-CEO and co-chair Bret Taylor announcing shortly after that he would be stepping down.

With just four days into the new year there is little sign of the economic headwinds easing and today’s news follows a slew of major layoffs last year including Facebook parent Meta which laid off 13% of its workforce and Stripe which cut 14%. Already reports abound that Tesla is gearing up for a fresh wave of redundancies in Q1 2023 while Amazon this week secured an $8 billion loan as part of its broader measures to counter the “uncertain macroeconomic environment.”

As with just about every other tech company Salesforce has been facing significant headwinds too. After hitting an all-time valuation peak of more than $300 billion in late 2021 Salesforce’s market cap has experienced something of a “correction” in the intervening months now sitting at around $134 billion — roughly where it was at three years ago. The company also refused to provide a revenue forecast for 2023 at its most recent earnings report last year.

Salesforce said that the restructuring effort will cost it between $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion which it expects to incur in Q4 of fiscal 2023."

You can get VNQ on Webull Robinhood and eToro today

Real estate investment trust (REIT) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are one of the easiest ways to start investing in real estate. These ETFs hold REITs that invest in physical property (equity) mortgages on those properties (debt) or a mix of the two (hybrid).

You can trade REIT ETFs intraday with partners like Webull Robinhood and eToro offering commission-free trading. REIT ETFs like the Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund (NYSEARCA: VNQ) often have a cost per share under $100 making them accessible to more investors.

Many brokers also offer fractional investing making it easy to start investing in REIT ETFs for just $1.

Below you’ll learn the ins and outs of VNQ and why it could be a good addition to your portfolio.

What is the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ)?

This REIT ETF is one of the most well-known real estate funds especially since it has $33 billion under management and 171 holdings. Its holdings include reputable REITs like Realty Income Corp. (NYSE: O) Simon Property Group Inc. (NYSE: SPG) and SBA Communications Corp. (NASDAQ: SBAC).

Like many Vanguard funds VNQ is passively managed meaning that it’s designed to track an underlying index like the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index. As a passively managed fund it has a low expense ratio of 0.12%. Investing in low-cost passively managed funds can save fees compared to actively managed funds.

VNQ Price History

This ETF was launched in 2004 trading for $52. It’s currently trading at $82 down from its 52-week high/all-time high of $116.

Like other ETFs it’s susceptible to general downturns in the market. Several factors like the ongoing war in Ukraine record high inflation sky-high energy costs and interest rate spikes have led to the current bear market.

VNQ has a $24.5 billion market cap and an average daily trading volume of 6 million.

VNQ vs. Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund Admiral Shares

Besides VNQ you could invest in its sister mutual fund the Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund Admiral Shares. Both are passively managed and provide diversification to the real estate sector for the same low expense ratio of 0.12%.

Here are a few main differences between them:

VGLSX has a minimum investment of $3000 while VNQ has no minimum investment. VNQ is an ETF that can be traded intraday while VGLSX can only be traded around its daily repricing which happens at the end of each trading day. Vanguard supports automatic dividend reinvestment for VGLSX but not VNQ.

VNQ Alternatives

Two main rival REIT ETFs similar to Vanguard's REIT VNQ include:

iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF (NYSEARCA: USRT)

This REIT ETF is trading at approximately $50 per share and has a 0.08% expense ratio. It is currently down 24% this year and has a lower yield compared to VNQ (3.54% vs. 3.32%). Compared to VNQ it has fewer assets under management ($33 billion vs. $1.9 billion) and fewer holdings (171 vs. 140).

Charles Schwab US REIT ETF (NYSEARCA: SCHH)

Like VNQ and USRT this passively managed ETF has the lowest expense ratio compared to the other two ETFs at only 0.07%. It has $5.6 billion in assets under management 132 holdings and a 3.2% yield.

It also has the lowest price per share at just $19 and is down 25% YTD.

How to Buy the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ)

VNQ is easy to trade online commission-free thanks to Webull Robinhood and eToro. Since it’s an ETF it also trades intraday meaning that you can trade it at any time during the day unlike mutual funds.

With ETFs you also have more flexibility when it comes to trading strategies like buying on margin (using debt to trade) or short selling. However approach those two strategies with caution since they’re meant for advanced traders.

Trading VNQ through typical brokers like the ones listed above takes a few minutes to complete. You’d just have to select the dollar or share amount account and order type (with market orders being the most common).

How to Buy the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) With an IRA

With partners like Webull and Robinhood you can hold VNQ in a Roth or Traditional IRA. It’s recommended to hold REITs and REIT ETFs in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs since their dividends are taxed at higher ordinary tax rates.

If you open a Roth IRA then you won’t pay taxes on your REIT ETF’s gains or dividends.

With a Traditional IRA you could deduct your contributions (maximum limit of $6500 for taxpayers 50 years old and younger $7500 for taxpayers older than 50 in 2023).

However you’d still have to pay ordinary taxes on the accumulated gains and income from your REIT ETFs when you take distributions from a Traditional IRA.

It can be tricky to determine whether a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA is the best fit for you. Benzinga’s guide can help make this decision easier for you.

Is VNQ a Good Investment?

VNQ can be a good way to gain affordable exposure to real estate considering its low share price and expense ratio. This REIT ETF has seen substantial growth since its launch in 2004.

It also offers a respectable 3.54% yield which is greater than many dividend-paying stocks and competing REIT ETFs. While it’s down 26% since the beginning of the year its current price level could represent an opportunity to buy at a discount.

Frequently Asked Questions

Q 1. What is the difference between a REIT and a REIT ETF? A REITs invest in physical property or mortgages. REIT ETFs are funds that have multiple REITs as underlying holdings. Some REIT ETFs are meant to track or mimic the performance of a benchmark like the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index. Q 2. Are REIT ETFs a good investment during inflation/interest rate hikes? A REIT ETFs can perform well during times of high inflation and interest rate hikes since rents may increase faster than inflation. Be cautious of REITs and REIT ETFs that use excessive leverage.

Unveiled in a research report released Tuesday before the bell the list - which is updated quarterly - is comprised of “high-conviction long-term” investing picks seen to have significant upside potential.”

Last year the firm’s selections delivered a total return in local currency of negative 10.4 per cent outperforming the MSCI World Index (negative 18.4 per cent). Since its 2019 inception the list has had a total positive return of 23.2 per cent topping the benchmark at 15.6 per cent.

Broadly RBC strategists are expecting a flattish or positive low single digit 12-month return in the S&P 500 as investors contend with deeply bearish sentiment (a contrarian/bullish signal) and ongoing concerns about the outlook for the economy the Fed geopolitics and corporate earnings. It recommends holding overweight positions in the Energy Financials Health Care Technology and Utilities sectors over the next six to 12 months.

“With the changes to the Top 30 list this quarter we switch into best ideas that we also view as offering more attractive positioning in the current environment” it said.

The lone Canadian company to be added to the list is Constellation Software Inc. (CSU-T).

“We add Constellation Software with our outlook for high shareholder returns reflecting Constellation’s ability to rapidly compound capital through acquisitions potential to benefit from an uncertain macro environment (high mix of recurring revenue and greater likelihood of M&A) and attractive valuation in our view” said analyst Paul Treiber who has an “outperform” recommendation and $2600 target for its shares (versus the $2472.61 average on the Street).

Returning Canadian companies are:

* Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. (ATD-T) with an “outperform” rating and $80 target. The average target on the Street is $69.92.

Analyst Irene Nattel: “Despite challenging macro backdrop multiple avenues for growth underpinned by: 1) top-line momentum from a more-focused data-driven approach to merchandising/promotional strategies; 2) well-defined initiatives and strategies to optimize procurement; 3) focus on localized merchandise pricing promotions and assortments; 4) innovative fuel initiatives including rollout of Circle-K gas; 5) cost optimization; 6) network development; and 7) opportunistic acquisitions. On track to exceed F23 EBITDA objective of $5.1B excluding merger and acquisition. Solid underlying operating performance aided by focused execution of strategies outlined at mid-2021 investor event to deliver ‘double again’ objective.”

* Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ-T) with an “outperform” rating and $89 target. The average is $92.90.

Analyst Greg Pardy: “Canadian Natural Resources’ management committee structure and shareholder alignment are unique factors which distinguish the company globally. CNQ’s long-life low-decline portfolio—anchored by moderate sustaining capital— affords the company superior free cash flow generative power.”

“Impressive Shareholder Returns. CNQ’s share buyback remains ring-fenced from acquisitions and strategic growth capital under a formulaic approach. More specifically now that net debt levels are below $15 billion the company is allocating 50 per cent of its free cash flow after dividends and sustaining capital to share repurchases with the balance (less strategic growth capital/acquisitions) earmarked for debt reduction.”

* Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP-T) with an “outperform” rating and $122 target. The average is $114.14.

Analyst Walter Spracklin: “Our positive view on CP centers on a best-in-class railroad on the cusp of a transformative acquisition that if approved should set the stage for significant growth and a material upward valuation re-rate.

“CP’s purchase of KSC significantly improves network reach. The network advantage of the CP-KCS deal is the most compelling merit of the transaction in our view. The deal opens up new markets as well as gives CP a meaningful structural advantage versus peers. The transaction significantly increases the company’s network reach from Vancouver to Saint John and now via KCS down to the ports of Lazaro Cardenas and Veracruz in Mexico. The new network connects six of the seven-largest metro regions in North America in a single-line connection particularly between the Midwest US/Canada into the Gulf Coast / Mexico and a new third option between the Midwest US and Texas/Mexico.”

* Element Fleet Management Corp. (EFN-T) with an “outperform” rating and $26 target. The average is $22.08.

Analyst Geoffrey Kwan: “Four key themes drive our positive view of EFN: 1) attractive growth – We forecast that EFN’s EPS could grow at a mid-teens CAGR over the next five years driven by new client wins organic growth within existing customers and significant returns of capital; 2) multiple potential catalysts; 3) strong defensive attributes – EFN faces minimal credit/residual risks and tends to have long-term contracts (3–5 years) with high retention rates (99 per cent); and 4) attractive valuation – we see high EPS growth as a key driver of valuation and potential valuation multiple expansion.”

* Nutrien Ltd. (NTR-N NTR-T) with an “outperform” rating and US$120 target. The average is US$101.95.

Analyst Andrew Wong: “Nutrien is the world’s largest fertilizer producer and ag input retailer formed through the merger of Agrium and PotashCorp in January 2018. We believe the company has built the most diverse vertically integrated agricultural input business with an attractive earnings profile growing free cash flows and solid balance sheet.”

“We expect Nutrien to generate more than $18B in excess cash (after dividends) through 2025 which should be deployed through a combination of share buybacks dividend increases and accretive Retail M&A. We expect the company to continue regular share buybacks and dividend increases.”

* Restaurant Brands International Inc. (QSR-N QSR-T) with an “outperform” rating and US$80 target. The average is US$67.

Analyst Christopher Carril: “Despite above-average global system sales growth and accelerating comp growth at Burger King and Popeyes QSR’s valuation remains in line with the global “all-franchised” restaurant peer group average driven in large part by continued weakness at Tim Hortons (responsible for 50 per cent of total op. profit). While we believe that TH sales improvement remains the primary catalyst for QSR shares we see the combination of BK-driven near-best-in-class unit growth (normalized 5-per-cent-plus) current momentum at PLK significant scale and potential to add brands in the future as key positives for a stock that in our view remains attractively valued.”

* Telus Corp. (T-T) with an “outperform” rating and $34 target. The average is $33.

Analyst Drew McReynolds: “We view 2022 as a pivotal turning point for TELUS as the company transitions into a new post-FTTH (Fibre To The Home) build / 5G phase. We expect the company to emerge in 2023 with a distinctively different financial and operational profile relative to most global telecom peers. As FTTH coverage reaches 85-90 per cent of the targeted broadband footprint by the end of 2022 enhanced capex flexibility should enable TELUS to capitalize on 5G without meaningful capital constraints opportunity costs or free cash flow impairment. Longer term under certain operational and regulatory conditions we see strong strategic and financial rationale for TELUS to explore a transformational re-organization that can fully unlock the value of core infrastructure assets and core technology assets”

That is because the Jan 20 2023 $2.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What do the Analysts Think?

Clearly options traders are pricing in a big move for Schlumberger shares but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently Schlumberger is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Oil and Gas - Field Services industry that ranks in the Top 16% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved up from 68 cents per share to 69 cents in that period.



Given the way analysts feel about Schlumberger right now this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay.

During these convoluted times companies engaged in hydrocarbon production are looking to distance themselves from their core product. The rebranding trend comes as public sentiment of fossil fuels dims while they demand more of same. Changing brands to something that sounds less oily is also seen as a way to attract young technical whiz kids who may have more progressive leanings into preparing for an industry career as companies fret over a dearth of newly minted engineers geophysicists and the like. The slim pickings from the university talent pipeline were highlighted in the results of a Texas Tech University survey of petroleum-related schools that showed only 400 petroleum engineers graduating from U.S. universities in 2022 — an 83% decline from the 2017 peak.

Though it seems to be garnering more attention lately rebranding is not new. In 2018 Norwegian behemoth Statoil changed its name to the more hipster sounding Equinor. Two years later British Petroleum adopted the BP moniker enabling it to conveniently proclaim itself as going “beyond petroleum.” The two incidentally are now partners in a couple of major offshore wind projects in New York.

Now comes oilfield services giant Schlumberger which less than two months ago said it would thereafter be known as SLB to signify its focus on decarbonization and the energy transition. Other than disassociating itself with the iconic oilfield brand it seems unclear how exactly its new identity encapsulates that focal point.

And this from Paul Pastusek a drilling mechanics advisor with ExxonMobil no less. “I think we need to rebrand as the energy industry. Forget about oil and gas and say energy in all forms is what makes life better” he said at September’s International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) Drilling Technology Committee (DEC) hybrid forum in Houston.

The forum was held to debate the ongoing struggle to plug the brain drain in an industry increasingly transforming from reliance on dumb iron to digitalization automation and high-level data analysis. Wholesale rebranding was but one of the ideas floated to attract and retain desperately needed technical talent who now have ample opportunities in industries that may offer a more agreeable work-life balance and without the baggage of continual boom and bust cycles. Emphasizing the industry’s high-tech and environmental societal and governance (ESG) initiatives they say could go a long way to help entice tech-savvy newbies.

“The industry is going through some cycles we've never seen before with the pandemic and the sudden rush for energy supplies with the other world issues going on. A lot of high-end technical problems need to be solved and the competition (for talent) is tough” said one of the forum organizers Blaine Dow of Schlumberger er SLB.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMixgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFicm9la25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvMDQvZmVhdHVyZXMvaW4tdGhlLWRpYXNwb3JhL3J1bGUtb2YtbGF3LWNpdGl6ZW5zLXJpZ2h0cy1hbmQtdGhlLXN0YXR1dG9yeS1kdXR5LW9mLXRoZS1lbnZpcm9ubWVudGFsLXByb3RlY3Rpb24tYWdlbmN5LXRvLXVwaG9sZC10aGUtZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC1wcm90ZWN0aW9uLWFjdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rule of Law Citizens’ Rights and the Statutory Duty of the Environmental Protection Agency to uphold the ...,"(This week’s column is dedicated to the memory of Elaine Therese Radzik Sochacki (nee Vieira) April 1st 1930 – January 4 2011.)

On December 16 2022 Justice Nareshwar Harnanan pronounced his ruling on the Judicial Review case filed in the High Court by Vanda Radzik Danuta Radzik and Raphael Singh vs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Environmental Assessment Bureau (EAB) and Schlumberger Guyana Inc. (SGI). Justice Harnanan quashed the decision by the EPA to award an environmental authorisation to SGI on the grounds that it was ultra vires and in breach of the EPA’s statutory duty as set out in the Environmental Act section 11 (2) Cap 20:05. Additionally the judge ruled that the EPA’s decision to waive the requirements of an EIA was in breach of the EPA’s statutory duty to give reasons for waiving an EIA for the construction and operations of a radioactive source storage and calibration facility. An injunction was issued and directed to SGI restraining it its servants And/or agents from continuing the operations unless and/or until in receipt of a lawfully issued environmental permit as set out in the Environmental Protection Act Cap 20:05.

We welcome this landmark ruling and example of the Court upholding the Rule of Law in Guyana.

Prior to our filing for a Judicial Review in the High Court 51 community residents elected neighbourhood officials and Guyanese stakeholders supported the original Letter of Appeal addressed and delivered to the EAB and EPA in May 2021. This Letter cited the same breaches of the Environmental Protection Act referenced above. The EAB and EPA summarily rejected this appeal.

On August 29th 2022 54 citizens of Guyana signed an Open Letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) & the Environmental Assessment Board (EAB) which was delivered by email with a hand delivered hard copy. The open letter was also published in Stabroek News with all names attached.

The letter registered dismay that a 1-million US dollar grant from the World Bank to the EPA to strengthen its monitoring and enforcement capacity was not fully utilised by the EPA. The grant was aimed at establishing a corps of personnel including 34 highly specialized and experienced petroleum geological and environmental engineers. But because the monies were not fully utilized it failed to achieve the intended outcome and the EPA remains lacking in these essential skills and capacities.

The letter noted the many failings of the EPA which has a duty under the EPA Act “to provide protection manage the natural environment assess impacts of development activities by conducting promoting and coordinating research on pollution and prevention; formulating standards guidelines and codes of practice including for the release of contaminants into the environment; monitoring and coordinating natural resources and how they are being impacted advising key stakeholder on the content and applicability of environmental control instruments and providing general information to the public on the state of the environment.”

It called on the EPA to implement eleven actions. The EPA was given a 30-day period to respond to this letter. To date no response has been forthcoming from the EPA or the EAB to these recommendations. This column focuses on three of these demands:

• Ensure that environmental permits granted are fixed for a period of no more than 3 years; and that renewals are dependent on a comprehensive transparent consultative process. The track record of companies awarded permits must comply with international best practice standards and norms and with the EPA’s own law and regulations.

• Ensure that all reports on type quantity frequency containment and classification of wastes and destinations to and from waste management facilities are complied with and made available to those communities directly affected workers and the Guyanese public.

• Publicize without delay all the companies that have environmental permits to receive handle store treat oil and gas wastes or operate mud plants and their waste management plans to ensure compliance with international best practices. Where these are deficient or absent we call for a stop notice / cease order until compliance is met subject to inspection by suitably qualified experts.

In light of the aforementioned recommendations we (and the Guyanese public) would like to know the status of ‘EPA-EMD2012HWRRF1R1 RECORDING AND REPORTING FORM OF HAZARDOUS WASTES (for New and Existing Operations)’. General instructions of this form state that it must be completed by the holder of an Environmental Authorization no later than forty-five days after the end of the operating year and should be prepared on activities relating to the previous calendar year along with any additional information requested and submitted to the EPA:

Specific Instructions for ‘Completing Form 3 Block B includes providing a description of the operation process identifying all hazardous materials/chemicals used within the operation process and the number of years the project has been operational’.

For Block C ‘providing information on hazardous materials/chemicals used in the life cycle of the project the type of hazardous material/chemicals used its hazardous physical and chemical characteristics and the quantity and type of storage used e.g. containers bags etc’.

For Block D ‘providing information on all types of hazardous wastes generated hazardous characteristics quantity of hazardous wastes generated physical characteristics chemical characteristics type of storage..’

For Block E ‘reporting of all spills information on the date of incident type and amount of waste spilled measures taken to mitigate incident treatment standards for waste data for off- site shipment of waste transporter and receiver details and location of off-site waste facility treatment standards for waste spilled (EPA recording and reporting form for hazardous waste for new and existing operations pages 57-60 in EEPGL’s Comprehensive Waste Management Report Oct 2021).

The Liza 1 oil field as far as we know started oil production in December 2019 and the Liza 2 oil field in February 2022. Estimated summaries of hazard waste generation & management methods given for the years 2020-2022 for Liza 1 and 2 show a combined estimated total of 15310 metric tonnes (33752772 lbs.) with an estimated 85% of these hazardous oil & gas wastes to be transported to onshore waste management facilities (this information can be found on pg. 59 table 2-6 Liza 1 EIA and pg. 2-51 table 2.12-8 Liza 2 EIA).

The EPA should have complied with its own obligations and submitted the required forms referred to above including that of companies such as Tiger Rental Services Sustainable Environmental Solutions (SES) Schlumberger Guyana Inc Saipem and Halliburton etc. Where are these reports and why have the findings of these reports not been made public as lawfully required?

The EPA has waived EIAs for most if not all of these waste management companies as no EIAs can be found on the EPA website. Neither are environmental permits for these same waste management companies available on the EPA website. This is in violation of the EPA Act Part 111- Establishment and Functions of Agency section 4 (3) e which calls for the EPA to “maintain and make available to members of the public during normal working hours a register of all…environmental authorisations granted and other information in accordance with section 36”.

As the frenzied pace and expansion of the oil and gas industry continues amounts of hazardous wastes generated will also significantly increase in volume. This in turn increases the risk to health safety and well-being of Guyanese workers communities and the environment. Needless to say meaningful community consultations and information sharing to directly affected communities are generally non-existent. Likewise there is an absence of independent monitoring and reporting on these facilities storing and transporting hazardous waste and toxic substances including radioactive sources located within longstanding residential communities or in very close proximity to same.

The Government’s recent recognition that the number of collisions by vessels with the Demerara Harbour Bridge and the substantial increase in river traffic from the oil and gas industry also increases the risk of spills of and contamination by hazardous waste and other toxic substances.

These risks constitute a clear and present danger and necessitate modern and robust regulatory frameworks with necessary capacities for full implementation. We urge this to be made a priority.

We note the increasingly horrifying impact of environmental cultural and social degradation and pollution on Indigenous communities from gold and manganese mining and the long-lasting and current impacts on the health and well-being of Guyanese in bauxite communities.

Guyana’s EPA Act specifically states the following:

(b) to promote the participation of members of the public in the process of integrating environmental concerns in planning for development on a sustainable basis;

(d) to establish monitor and enforce environmental regulations;

(e) to prevent or control environmental pollution;

(f) to co-ordinate an integrated coastal zone management programme;

(3) (a) Any person who may be affected by a project exempted under subsection (2) (a) may lodge an appeal with the Environmental Assessment Board established under section 18 within sixty days of the date of publication of the Agency’s decision and the Environmental Assessment Board shall within a reasonable time publish a decision confirming or setting aside the Agency’s decision.

The EPA’s trend of silence and apparent refusal to engage with citizens on a regular basis in meaningful consultations and continuous disclosure of information and public reporting is a violation of its mandate.

It is time for us Guyanese to take a stand against our communities serving as sacrifice zones for fossil fuels and extractive industries unscrupulous companies and state authorities that fail to act in accordance with the rule of law.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiwQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMy8wMS8wNC8yNTgzMzAyLzAvZW4vQWxsaWFudC1FbmVyZ3ktQW5ub3VuY2VzLUFwcG9pbnRtZW50LW9mLVN0ZXBoYW5pZS1Db3gtdG8tQm9hcmQtb2YtRGlyZWN0b3JzLWFuZC1SZXRpcmVtZW50LW9mLUJvYXJkLU1lbWJlci1EZWFuLU9lc3RyZWljaC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alliant Energy Announces Appointment of Stephanie Cox to Board of Directors and Retirement of Board Member Dean ...,"MADISON Wis.

Enterprise data storage solutions provider Pure Storage Inc. (NYSE: PSTG) stock closed out 2022 with a (-16.5%) loss. Much of the selling in the shares was attributed to the weakening demand for storage chips as warned by DRAM maker Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU).

Micron warned of continued demand weakness through the first half of 2023 in its Q3 2022 earnings report. This results in falling flash memory prices which is bad for the producers and suppliers but positive for consumers. Pure Storage is a consumer of memory chips not a producer.

It provides enterprise storage solutions as a service utilizing the memory chips buys. This makes Pure Storage a winner with improved margins. Pure Storage has been lumped together with storage chip makers and device suppliers like Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ: WDC) and Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NYSE: STX) and suffer from declining flash memory prices Pure Storage benefits from the cheaper costs helping to bolster its margins.

Consistently Strong Earnings Again

Pure Storage had a strong Q3 2022 as revenues rose 20% YoY beating earnings expectations by $0.06. Its subscription service revenues climbed 30% YoY to $1 billion. The Company continues to benefit from the ever-hungry need for mission-critical data storage access and management through its flash-optimized technology.

Conservative Guidance

The Company issued inline guidance for Q4 2022 of revenues coming in between $810 million versus $812.78 million consensus analyst estimates with a non-GAAP operating margin of 16%. The Company expects longer sales cycles due to the uncertain economic climate as companies curb spending.

What Sets Them Apart From Big Competitors

During the Q3 2022 conference call Pure Storage was asked how it diverges itself from industry peers like NetApp Inc. (NASDAQ: NTAP) Nutanix Inc. (NASDAQ: NTNX) and even Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE: DELL) who aren't seeing comparable strength in their demand. CEO Charlie Giancarlo points out that its core strategy is to drive all Flash data environments in the data center with modern software capabilities and management abilities.

They make all vendors develop a software stack focused on the benefits of a Pure semiconductor versus refilling with SSDs in a disk-oriented architecture. This enables less power space cooling requirements and labor while offering more reliability and performance than competitors. CEO Giancarlo stated ""The combination of Pure's Evergreen offerings best-in-class power space and cooling and operating simplicity results in significantly lower operating costs for enterprise customers.""

He also added that the Company is relentless in its ability to grow accounts ""Finally I'll mention that once we penetrate an account our ability to expand in that account is very large because of the improved experience that our customers have."" The Net Promotor score is the most important number for the Company. It reflects its customer's positive experience enabling it to realize broad expansion capabilities once an account is acquired.

Weekly Symmetrical Triangle Breakdown Commences

PSTG stock has been chopping in a weekly symmetrical triangle formation since the beginning of 2022. It made its high of $36.71 in March 2022 and its low of $21.90 in May 2022. Since then it has been making lower highs and higher lows with an ever-tightening trading range to form a breakout through the upper trend line above the $31.11 market structure high (MSH) sell trigger or below the lower trend line under $27.77.

It appears the breakdown has begun dramatically with a large red candle. The weekly stochastic rejection of the 80-band on its Q3 2022 earnings report appears to be giving bears the advantage as it falls towards the 20-band. Shares attempted a bounce off the $26.30 level but are having difficulty reclaiming the weekly lower trend line as it continues to climb by the week making it even tougher to bounce.

(CRM) will cut 10% of its workforce and shutter some offices as the customer relationship management software company shrinks after a pandemic hiring boom.

Key Takeaways Cloud software company Salesforce will reduce employee headcount by 10% and downsize office space according to an SEC filing.

Restructuring charges are expected to be as high as $2.1 billion with about half incurred in the current quarter.

Tech firms including Meta Platforms Amazon and Twitter have announced layoffs in recent months as the industry cuts costs following rapid expansion early in the pandemic.

Inflation and interest rate hikes have weakened revenue growth across the tech industry.

First Tech Layoffs of 2023

The firm disclosed its plans Wednesday in an SEC filing saying it expects the restructuring to incur charges of up to $2.1 billion and that $800 million to $1 billion of those costs will be recorded in the current quarter.

Up to $650 million of the restructuring charges will be the result of office space reductions. Salesforce said that it will close offices and exit real estate positions in certain markets but didn't provide details.

Salesforce's employee headcount was almost 74000 as of January 2022 nearly a third larger than in 2021. The company is the latest in a growing list of tech firms to announce layoffs including Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Snap Inc. (SNAP) and Twitter. Many of these companies aggressively increased their workforces during the pandemic and have now trimmed costs amid high inflation and a series of interest rate hikes.

Salesforce has reported decelerating revenue growth in the last year as customers reduce spending and become less reliant on cloud-based software than they were during COVID-related lockdowns. Revenue increased 14% year-over-year for the latest quarter reported the slowest growth in several quarters.

Major Layoffs of 2022

Salesforce follows in the footsteps of several other tech companies once buoyed by pandemic restrictions and supportive monetary policy adjusting to a tougher economic environment.

In addition Phison indicates that their new PS7201 Retimer can retransmit new signals over long PCIe Gen5 cable lengths (which are typically between server nodes and rack storage enclosures) or between automotive computing systems.

The PS7201 also benefits from a full 16 lanes which can be bifurcated has an extended reach by 42dB at 16GHz and features fast performance with latency modes <5ns. The CXL 2.0 architectures will also benefit from the PS7201 due to its fully compliant capabilities.

Market Impact

Enterprises alike have been waiting for the promise of Gen5 SSDs to hit the mass market. Currently shipments are extremely limited and even most of the SKUs that are shipping in the enterprise are more akin to Gen4 SSDs than true Gen5. While they may use a Gen5 interface there are usually fewer lanes which limits overall performance. It will be interesting to see if SSD brands latch onto the Phison X Gen5 controller to be able to quickly come to market with a complete SSD. This is Phison’s first major effort into the enterprise SSD space.

The Phison E26 targets the client space which is also hungry for Gen5 performance especially as GPU direct storage gets closer to reality. The E26 has been shown off for a year now so it’s fair to say that production has been much slower than anticipated. That said Phison already has a deep bench of players who are likely to take up this platform. Seagate Sabrent and Corsair have all shipped Phison SSDs this year. We should see these drives in the market “soon” most likely led by Sabrent who has been a consistent early adopter of Phison tech.

(ECA LNG) and Vista Pacifico S.A.P.I. de C.V. received authorisation from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to re-export US-sourced LNG from Mexico to non-free trade agreement (FTA) nations. The DOE’s significant action is an important milestone for these two development projects which are now each one step closer to supporting the world’s energy security and environmental goals.

“Advancing new infrastructure investments is critical to supporting the energy needs of America’s allies and we are grateful for the leadership of the Biden Administration US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and various Congressional stakeholders –including Senators Joe Manchin Ted Cruz and John Cornyn. These export projects are expected to support efforts across the Indo-Pacific region to diversifying energy supplies while transitioning away from coal in power production” said Justin Bird CEO of Sempra Infrastructure. “They are also expected to help strengthen US trading relationships as well as create new jobs and boost the US and Mexico economies.”

Under the permits granted by DOE Vista Pacifico LNG is authorised to re-export up to 200 billion ft3/y of LNG from US-sourced natural gas from the project under development in Topolobampo Sinaloa Mexico to any country with which the US does not have an FTA requiring national treatment for trade in natural gas. Vista Pacifico LNG is projected to be a mid scale facility with approximately 3.5 million tpy of export capacity. Sempra Infrastructure is advancing development of Vista Pacifico LNG in collaboration with Mexico’s Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) as previously announced.

The DOE also increased the authorised export volumes of ECA LNG Phase 2 permitting it to re-export up to 636 billion ft3/y of LNG from US-sourced natural gas from the proposed project in Ensenada Baja California Mexico to non-FTA nations. Both permits are applicable for the period beginning on the date of first commercial re-export though through December 2050.

The proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 is expected to be comprised of two trains and one LNG storage tank and produce approximately 12 million tpy of export capacity. ECA LNG Phase 1 received non-FTA export authorisation in 2019 and is currently under construction with commercial operations expected in 2025.

Development of ECA LNG Phase 2 and Vista Pacifico LNG are contingent upon completing the required commercial agreements securing all necessary permits obtaining financing and reaching a final investment decision among other factors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2VuZXJneS91cy1wb2lzZWQtcmVnYWluLWNyb3duLXdvcmxkcy10b3AtbG5nLWV4cG9ydGVyLTIwMjMtMDEtMDQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. poised to regain crown as world's top LNG exporter,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-poised-regain-crown-worlds-top-lng-exporter-2023-01-04/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2VuZXJneS91cy1wb2lzZWQtcmVnYWluLWNyb3duLXdvcmxkcy10b3AtbG5nLWV4cG9ydGVyLTIwMjMtMDEtMDQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhc3Rjb3VudHltYWdhemluZS5vcmcvc2RnZS1oaWtlcy1yYXRlcy1zb21lLXdpbGwtcGF5LWRvdWJsZS1uYXR1cmFsLWdhcy1lbGVjdHJpYy1yYXRlcy1hbHNvLXJpc2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SDG&E HIKES RATES: SOME WILL PAY DOUBLE FOR NATURAL GAS ELECTRIC RATES ALSO RISE,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhc3Rjb3VudHltYWdhemluZS5vcmcvc2RnZS1oaWtlcy1yYXRlcy1zb21lLXdpbGwtcGF5LWRvdWJsZS1uYXR1cmFsLWdhcy1lbGVjdHJpYy1yYXRlcy1hbHNvLXJpc2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E29C7190>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Here’s a summary of these big-times changes to the Cloud Wars Top 10 now in its seventh year of analyzing and stacking the world’s largest and most influential cloud providers:

Cloud Wars Top 10 company Previous Rank New Rank Salesforce 4 6 Oracle 5 4 SAP 6 5 ServiceNow 7 10 IBM 10 7

The moves reflect superb transformations within 45-year-old Oracle 50-year-old SAP and 112-year-old IBM as each of those companies had to:

revise its products and technologies to meet the cloud-centric needs of customers

overhaul its go-to-market programs to align with that new mindset among customers

reorganize its sales support and marketing teams to reflect that new reality

develop innovative new approaches to solve the modern digital challenges customers are facing

strengthen and expand its global partners ecosystem; and

do all this while battling — and in many cases beating — ravenous and extremely capable competitors

Since every action has an equal and opposite reaction the ascendancy of Oracle SAP and IBM was counterbalanced by the falling fortunes in the Cloud Wars Top 10 by Salesforce and ServiceNow.

The reasons behind the downward moves for those two companies are radically different.

Salesforce Falls from #4 to #6

For Salesforce it was a series of shocking revelations that came out in its fiscal Q3 earnings call on Nov. 30.

While the company’s growth rate had not dropped below 20% for many years it tumbled to 14% for the quarter that ended Oct. 31 Co-CEO Bret Taylor’s decision to announce his imminent departure just 12 months after taking that high-profile job suggests significant problems within the company on strategic direction product strategy competitive challenges and more Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield’s decision to announce his desire to leave right on the heels of Taylor’s announcement raises questions about the company’s fastest-growing business unit; and Benioff’s recent comments about the lower productivity of remote workers run directly counter to comments he’s made over the past two-and-a-half years about how the pandemic changed “everything” particularly the antiquated notion of people traveling to headquarters offices to do their jobs

ServiceNow Falls from #7 to #10

Being part sentimental squish I’ll admit I can be charmed by a heartfelt rallying cry. And CEO Bill McDermott’s vision for ServiceNow to be the “defining software company of the 21st century” has a lot of feel-good charm to it.

But while I’m not sure exactly where “charm” falls on the priority lists of the business executives among ServiceNow’s customers and prospects I suspect it’s somewhere south of #50 or perhaps even #75. So while I applaud McDermott’s overall performance in reshaping and repositioning ServiceNow and in driving very solid levels of growth in his three years as CEO the company is gliding toward no-man’s land because it’s trying to create a new and standalone category in a market with limited appetite for such singularity.

Is it an applications company? No not really although it does create some applications and helps customers create their own.

So then is it a platform company? Well yes but a very different type of platform company – all the other platform vendors have some big assets in place that can be leveraged by their platforms:

That’s what Microsoft does in a variety of ways but particularly with Power Platform

Google Cloud does it with its fast-growing database business

Oracle does it in many ways but particularly Oracle Database and the fast-growing Autonomous Database

SAP has its high-growth Business Technology Platform

IBM’s Red Hat is becoming extremely popular in hybrid cloud platforms which is a vast opportunity

Workday Extend enables customers and partners to build on its HCM and Financials apps

And Snowflake has begun using its Data Cloud as a terrific platform for customers and partners to build upon

So — it’s become unclear to me how and why “the platform of platforms” will drive huge change and transformation for customers at a time when they have so many excellent alternatives from cloud providers they already work with in very vital ways.

The New Cloud Wars Top 10

Microsoft Amazon Google Cloud Oracle (was #5) SAP (was #6) Salesforce (was #4) IBM (was #10) Workday Snowflake ServiceNow (was #7)

Oracle: 3 Reasons It Jumped to #4

The past two quarters its cloud-revenue growth rate has been 45% and 43% Its passionate and wide-ranging commitment to automate the entire healthcare industries in ways no other tech vendor is even approaching Its fearless and successful assault on “The 3 Hyperscalers” for cloud infrastructure that has turned that into a four-way contest

SAP: 3 Reasons It Jumped to #5

Its cloud-revenue growth rate for the past two quarters has been 34% and 38% Its S/4HANA Cloud growth rate has been between 80% and 100% with no signs of moderating Its RISE go-to-market program is pushing the entire Cloud Wars Top 10 to re-imagine how those companies work with customers undergoing profound business transformation

IBM: 3 Reasons It Jumped to #7

Its cloud business will do well over $20 billion in calendar 2022 and its growth rate has been tracking nicely upwards over the past few quarters. Can it hit 20% in 2023? IBM is fusing artificial intelligence (AI) with cloud as broadly and effectively as any company in the Cloud Wars Top 10 In the past 33 months CEO Arvind Krishna has done a superb job of remaking IBM into an externally focused business whose component pieces are no longer battling each other but are instead coming together to drive new levels of innovation and opportunity for their customers

Final Thoughts

Congratulations to Oracle SAP and IBM for defying the doomsayers and much more importantly dazzling their customers!

And to Salesforce and ServiceNow: The challenge for 2023 is whether you can keep up with the wildly reinvigorated “old timers” that have just vaulted past you!

Here’s the new lineup for the world’s fastest-growing and most-influential cloud providers and then I’ll offer a couple of thoughts on each. And please bear in mind that this list below is not the official Cloud Wars Top 10 rankings — rather it’s a stack-rank of the growth leaders. The last column on the right shows where each company ranks on the Cloud Wars Top 10.

Fastest-Growing Major Cloud Providers as of Jan. 4 2023

Company Growth Rate Qtr. Ended Top 10 rank 1. Oracle 43% Nov. 30 #4 2. SAP 38% Sept. 30 #5 3. Google Cloud 37.5% Sept. 30 #3 4. Amazon AWS 27% Sept. 30 #2 5. Microsoft 24% Sept. 30 #1 6. Workday 22.3% Oct. 31 #8 7. ServiceNow 22% Oct. 31 #10 8. IBM 19% Sept. 30 #7 9. Salesforce 14% Oct. 31 #6 10. Snowflake** 67% Oct. 31 #10

(**Snowflake is at bottom of list because its revenue figures are so much lower than that of the other Top 10 companies. When Snowflake quarterly revenue reaches $1 billion I’ll rank it in the same way as the others.**)

No doubt the tough global economy the ravages of inflation and the superstrong dollar have each played a part in framing each of these numbers but every single company on this list has had to deal with those same factors — so nobody gets a pass. And for the sake of comparison here’s the Cloud Wars Top 10 growth chart from two months ago: “Cloud Q3 Growth Leaders: #1 Oracle #2 SAP #3 Google #4 AWS.”

Six of these Cloud Wars Top 10 companies have quarters ending on Jan. 31 so in early February I’ll post an updated growth-chart list including those new figures. Until then here are a few thoughts on each company organized in the order shown above in the growth-rate chart.

1. Oracle 43%. Huge momentum across its LOB (line-of-business) apps business (Fusion Cloud ERP Fusion HCM NetSuite Cloud ERP) which will close about $14 billion in revenue this year; its industry-cloud business; and its OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) business which last quarter grew at a 59% clip. Plus customers are beginning to make big commitments with mission-critical workloads to cloud-native Autonomous Database.

2. SAP 38%. The biggest growth driver for SAP is its S/4HANA Cloud ERP suite which for the past few quarters has been growing at 80% or higher. Plus the Business Technology Platform is becoming a huge asset for SAP as it gives incumbent customers another big reason to stick with SAP as they move production ERP (enterprise resource planning) workloads to the cloud.

3. Google Cloud 37.5%. It’s been a remarkable run for Google Cloud in the past four years under CEO Thomas Kurian as the company has gone from internally focused tech laboratory to customer-driven transformation enabler. Two hot areas for 2023: industry-specific solutions and multicloud solutions including but not limited to Anthos.

4. AWS 27%. A slew of new products were churned out at re:Invent a couple of months ago but as the competition in the Cloud Wars Top 10 gets even more savage in 2023 AWS must pivot from competing on volume of new product introductions to new ways of driving value for business customers. Will it make a stronger play for industry expertise in 2023?

5. Microsoft 24%. When Microsoft releases its fiscal-Q2 earnings at the end of this month it will be fascinating to see if it was able to reach $100 billion in cloud revenue for the calendar year. A few months ago I would have said that achievement was a lock — but with Microsoft’s declining growth rate I now think it’ll be a stretch. For the first three quarters of 2022 its revenue was $23.4 billion $25.11 billion and $25.7 billion meaning it needs $25.8 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31. I’m betting they’ll make it—but not by much.

6. Workday 22.3%. Low-key but high-performance Workday keeps hammering out impressive numbers quarter after quarter as it adds new Fortune 1000 customers for its HCM and Financials applications. I’m looking for the company’s more-aggressive push into industry-specific solutions to be a huge factor in ensuring Workday’s momentum continues throughout 2023.

7. ServiceNow 22%. In 2023 ServiceNow needs to redefine itself in a way that not only differentiates it from what it used to be but also in why and how it’s a better choice for platform-specific requirements of customers. Over the past several years ServiceNow has not had to compete with the other major players — but I think that’s going to change radically in 2023.

8. IBM 19%. With his company’s cloud-revenue growth rate rising throughout 2022 IBM CEO Arvind Krishna is bullish on the 112-year-old company’s prospects for 2023 around its expertise in hybrid cloud artificial intelligence (AI) and data. Krishna highlighted the big businesses IBM’s building with former competitors Microsoft and Amazon. Plus its ability to assertively complement its technological prowess with deep industry knowledge via IBM Consulting is a big benefit for customers.

9. Salesforce 14%. No that’s not a typo — Salesforce’s growth rate did indeed plunge to 14% for the quarter ended Nov. 30 after several years of 20% or more. And I think until Salesforce can address these five major questions about its precipitous stumble and tumble last quarter it’s going to have a very tough time regaining its former market momentum.

10. Snowflake 67%. With product revenue reaching $522 million for the quarter ended Nov. 30 Snowflake continues to have huge momentum. But its overall size relative to the other companies in the Cloud Wars Top 10 leads me to isolate it and its growth rate in these head-to-head matchups. The company’s banking on its industry focus to keep that big momentum rolling throughout 2023.

Despite being extremely convenient the need for a personal office was eclipsed by coworking spaces and company headquarters. But as most people know the story all too well a certain shelter-in-place order would turn the temporary solution of a home office into a permanent reality. In fact the United States Census Bureau found that the number of people who are working from home has tripled between 2019 and 2021. And as more people find a happy medium with their hybrid schedule an estimated 36.2 million Americans are slated to be working remotely by 2025.

If you’ve been dragging your heels to formally welcome a proper home office into your space a new year is the perfect excuse to do so. And what better way to get the design ball rolling than with paint? While a fresh coat of paint can transform any area choosing the right hue for your office is a big decision. You’ll want to find a shade that can not only spark inspiration during creativity lulls and create a calming atmosphere but also one that you can stand to stare at for your 9-to-5 grind. Fortunately the search is over. We tapped more than a dozen designers to share their go-to shades for any home office. From serene blues to moody blacks and everything in between these office paint colors are so striking that you’ll be tempted to work overtime.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tL3dhcm0tcGFpbnQtY29sb3JzLTY4OTEyMzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 Paint Colors That Will Make Your Home Feel Warm and Cozy,"Even if it seems like a subtle detail the color you paint a room can have an enormous overall impact on the ambiance of your space. For instance one shade of gray can read stark and cold while other variations can lend the perfect amount of welcoming warmth.

Farrow & Ball

The same is true for hues in the brown white green and even purples. We asked an assortment of interior designers to share which interior paint colors are giving them all the warm and cozy vibes right now so prepare to feel inspired.

Fallow & Ball

“We are seeing a strong dive into walnut brown from paint to furniture wood stains textiles and more” says Heather Fujikawa owner and principal designer at House Sprucing. London Clay is Farrow & Ball’s ""warmest brown"" that's infused with undertones of magenta. It leans into the earthy walnut trend while capturing a wealth of warmth.

Where to Use It:

“This cozy paint color could be beautiful as a signature wall in a room or painted on an entry wall for unique contrast” Fujikawa suggests.

Benjamin Moore

Colors like olive and sage are also trending in a big way this year. “If you're looking to use this trend in your home in a way that feels cozy go for a mid-toned shade like Louisburg Green” advises Kaitlin Madden co-founder of The Finish. She adds “To me paints that aren't too dark or too light feel the coziest. Very light colors tend to create spaces that feel vibrant and energetic while very deep shades can be very dramatic.”

Madden loves this accent color for a powder room.

Want to go darker with your green? Try Black Forest Green which is part of Benjamin Moore’s historic collection. “It’s a color that will stand the test of time but also put you right in the middle of the current green trend” says home expert Jaclyn James.

Where to Use It:

“Black Forest Green is a great color to add warmth to your home office and for a pop of color in your kitchen on the island” says James. “This color would also work well in a room that has a complementary bold wallpaper accent wall to add warmth while not overpowering the wallpaper.”

Baby Fawn is a creamy off-white greige that boasts impeccable balance. “I absolutely love this warm tone” says Fujikawa. “It is a subtle neutral with just the right amount of tint and warmth.”

Where to Use It:

The perfect backdrop color Baby Fawn can be used on bookshelves or on a feature wall. Fujikawa adds “It also performs beautifully as a two-toned cabinet paint color in a kitchen or provides subtle contrast with interior doors by painting the doors a different color than the overall paint color in the home.”



PPG

This new 2023 release from PPG Paints is part of the brand’s Serenity color palette which is loaded with both warm and cool soothing tones. Weathered Wood is a mid-toned neutral brown sugar beige that sits on the warmer side of the scale. Kimberly Greenwell housing education expert and host of My Southern Home says “This color will wrap you in all the seasonal feels all year long.”

Where to Use It:

“This color is perfect for the living area of a home or a lower level” Greenwell says. She adds that mid-dark neutral tones are “perfect for open floor plans with lots of windows and large lower levels.”

Sherwin-Williams

For a boost of rich warmth consider Sherwin-Williams’ Clove. It’s not quite brown and not entirely black but lands somewhere perfectly in the middle. “It adds a comfortable coziness to any room” says Linda Smith co-founder of BLDC Design. “The richness of the color plays as a neutral with almost any palette.”

Where to Use It:

Smith recommends using this paint color in smaller spaces to create a strong dramatic statement such as in a guest bedroom or small bathroom.

Sherwin-Williams

Finding the perfect white can be challenging as too often this “non-color"" can read sterile or harsh. This paint color allows you to have your white paint and cozy aesthetic too. “White Sand has just enough undertones to create a clean pure softness in any space” says Smith. “It's a perfect choice for a modern interior design.”

Where to Use It:

This neutral paint color works in any part of the home.

Benjamin Moore

Here’s another variation of cozy white to try only this one is slightly purer in white tonality without losing that hint of warmth. “This is the creamiest most beautiful white paint color for your home” says lifestyle influencer Kat Jamieson. “We have this on both the interior and exterior of our Connecticut farmhouse.”

Where to Use It:

This soft neutral hue also works well in any room.

Sherwin-Williams

Black Magic invites you to consider the opposite side of the color spectrum. “It’s a rich color with neutral undertones but there's also a softness to this color” says James. “This color gives you that wow factor while at the same time creating a blanket of coziness.”

Where to Use It:

Truly versatile Black Magic works beautifully for kitchen islands bathroom vanities or oversized rooms that need a good warming up. James says “Don't be afraid to paint the ceiling with this color too. It's becoming more popular to add warmth and drama all the way to the tippy top.”

Benjamin Moore

“Warm neutrals are a great alternative to white because they're just as easy to use but tend to make a space feel extra cozy” notes Madden. “Finnie Gray is a beautiful accessible neutral that can look either like a sage green or a greige depending on the light.”

Where to Use It:

Finnie Gray is perfect for a bedroom den or as an accent color on doorways and trim.

Farrow & Ball

For a cozy gray paint color that offers a little more heft try Farrow & Ball’s Down Pipe. Carissa Byrne Hebert founder of CBH Interiors says it’s one of her favorites. She notes “The color has beautiful depth to it and adds drama to a space without being too overwhelming.

Where to Use It:

This moody deep gray is the perfect dark accent for any space big or small.

PPG

“Synchronicity is a pale gray-meets-peachy beige with a perfect hint of cozy brown undertone” says Greenwell. “This soothing gray is a great neutral and will have you calmed and relaxed in your space.”

Where to Use It:

Light grays are perfect for any room in a home because they blend seamlessly with patterned furniture and fun pillows. Greenwell recommends using the same color for your trim which allows the wall to blend into the room so your furniture pops.

Benjamin Moore

For a gray with a tinge of soft coral-y pink try this paint color from Benjamin Moore. This rich hue somehow feels both complex and minimalist at the same time.

Where to Use It:

“This yummy medium-tone gray is just what you need on the walls of a reading nook or a full-blown living room” says Hebert. “Either way it just wraps you up like a warm wool blanket.”

Farrow & Ball

This satisfyingly deep purple hue nods to a sense of regalness but without feeling too stuffy. “Pelt is unexpectedly sexy” says Hebert. “You don’t know why you didn’t see it before but now that you’ve seen it you just want it.”

Where to Use It:

“I recommend going all in on this color” Hebert says. “Paint all four walls of a room this deep moody purple you won’t regret it.

Benjamin Moore

If purple isn’t really your aesthetic but you like that end of the spectrum check out Benjamin Moore’s maritime-inspired Hale Navy. “This is a great color to bring warmth to your home” says interior designer Andi Morse. It's part of the brand's historical collection and effortlessly blends both cool and warm.

Where to Use It:

Try it on cabinets or built-ins to add a nice touch of warmth. “You can even paint all the walls and ceiling in it to create a cocoon feeling for a room” says Morse. “I also love this in a dining room space.”

“If that were to happen the Collision Industry Foundation (CIF) ensures that others in our industry will be there in support” said CIF President Michael Quinn who is also president of AirPro Diagnostics. “We help each other we look after each other and we connect the industry.”

Prior to the creation of CIF in 2001 members of the collision industry rallied donations and volunteers to perform works that would benefit organizations such as Habitat for Humanity and Ronald McDonald House. Although their efforts were successful Quinn said they were the result of the work of a small group of people and required a substantial personal investment in time and administration.

CIF project leaders discussed building a foundation to coordinate fundraising create committees gather volunteers and brainstorm. At the time volunteers had committed to raising $500000 toward constructing a medical center for Camp Make-A-Dream a free camp for children with active cancer. They realized it was no longer possible for a handful of volunteers to coordinate a project of such enormity.

As a result they formed CIF a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization incorporated April 26 2001. CIF’s founders include Mark Claypool Glen Funk Dan Greenwald Marco Grossi Jeanne Silver Charles Sulkala and Doug Webb.

The organization’s mission is to provide emergency relief by securing and distributing donations to collision repair professionals who have experienced significant losses due to natural disasters or other catastrophic events. That assistance can be monetary connecting individuals with suppliers or other industry providers and/or lending a hand to rebuild or retool.

Since its inception CIF has managed the funds donated to support charitable and educational causes in the collision industry. They are disbursed after trustees selection committee volunteers and leaders review the projects. Due to the complexity of some projects CIF funds the foundation’s administration.

In the early years CIF worked closely with the National Auto Body Council (NABC) whose members suggested worthy causes. Some of the charitable projects funded by CIF have included donations to local causes including children’s hospitals and abused women’s outreach programs; donations to sponsor student participation at the 2005 WorldSkills competition and fund the purchase of a handicapped accessible school bus for Camp Make-A-Dream; and The Hurricane Katrina Disaster Relief Fund for collision industry victims. Following Hurricane Rita the Disaster Relief Fund was created to aid industry victims of any natural disaster.

Until 2020 CIF coordinated fundraising to raise money for specific disasters. Members of CIF’s Board of Trustees typically reach out to organizations that have donated in the past or they feel would be good candidates. The CIF Gala typically held annually in January has been a major fundraiser for CIF since 2010.

During the pandemic the need for assistance was widespread across the country due to layoffs and reductions in work hours at collision repair shops. Hundreds of individuals found themselves in need of assistance. Quinn said this differed from past disasters or catastrophic events that were tied to a particular geographic area or location. CIF had not dealt with a situation of this magnitude.

CIF used the reserves in the Disaster Relief Fund to make an initial commitment of $100000 to assist those impacted by COVID-19. The organization also put out a call to the industry for donations. The outcome was raising an additional $150000 that was dispersed to individuals in need. CIF Trustees vetted each request and responded to more than 700 requests for assistance from 38 states.

Through the pandemic CIF implemented new methods of fundraising. These included online events such as a magic show and a silent auction.

In addition to the call for pandemic assistance in 2020 CIF participated in Giving Tuesday a national day of philanthropic support. Forty donors contributed to these efforts. The organization has continued to participate in Giving Tuesday for the past two years.

The CIF Annual Donor program was introduced in 2021 so it would be easier for industry organizations to make an ongoing commitment to CIF streamlining the donation process for CIF and supporting organizations. There are currently 36 donors up from 23 annual donors in 2021.

“Our annual donor commitments make it possible for CIF to provide assistance to our industry brothers and sisters in times of crisis” said Quinn. “We appreciate their generosity and ongoing support and are honored to conduct work on their behalf.”

“We could not fulfill our mission without our entire network of donors volunteers and supporters” added Ann Gonzalez CIF vice president. “No words can express the depth of our thanks to this industry for allowing us to do this work on their behalf. Speaking for the CIF board we thank our CIF community from the bottom of our hearts.”

In 2022 the annual fundraising gala was held after being on hold for nearly two years due to the pandemic. “This event provided the opportunity to bring industry individuals together as well as raise additional funds through event ticket sales raffles and silent auctions” said Quinn. For 2023 the event is going to be held during its usual timeframe on Jan. 18 in Palm Springs CA.

Typically raffle and auction items are donated to CIF so all proceeds from those sales go directly to the Disaster Relief Fund.

At the July 2022 CIF Gala President Michael Quinn presented a check to Bryan Miller a burn victim from the collision industry who suffered third-degree burns over most of his body.

At the July 2022 gala in Pittsburgh PA CIF was proud to present a check for $15000 to Bryan Miller an individual from the collision industry who displayed heroic bravery and resiliency despite suffering third-degree burns over most of his body. Miller hopes to find a new role in the industry and continue working in a shop. Numerous donations of money as well as training equipment etc. have allowed him to plan his next steps.

Unfortunately Quinn said there will always be another disaster like the record flooding in Kentucky or wildfires in Oregon or another health care emergency like COVID-19. “It is our intention that CIF will always be there---reaching out through our distribution channels seeking to identify individuals in need and providing whatever assistance we can” he said.

Future plans include expanding the annual donor program and gaining visibility with additional industry organizations. CIF is increasing the number of trustees on its board to fill the seats with leaders from various industry segments and building closer connections with other nonprofit organizations.

“People who become connected with CIF do so in support of our mission and vision with a desire to contribute and serve” said Quinn. “We are part of an industry that looks after our own who have big hearts and take generous actions. Whatever the need CIF is there and will be there continuing our legacy of service.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZncvbmFtZS93aWxsaWFtLW5vbGFuLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM4NTkwNDMw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,William Nolan Obituary (1925 - 2023) - North Richland Hills TX - Star-Telegram,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZncvbmFtZS93aWxsaWFtLW5vbGFuLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM4NTkwNDMw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3B721A0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The first episode of season four of our Netflix show Dream Home Makeover takes us inside the kitchen and pantry of one of our Studio McGee member’s homes. The renovation includes the dining room kitchen and a stunning multi-use pantry converted from an underutilized dining room. Let’s step inside the kitchen first taking a deeper dive into the two-tone cabinetry. The lower cabinets and island are a moody charcoal shade—Peppercorn by Sherwin-Williams—set against a light cream—Natural Tan by Sherwin-Williams—on the upper half and adjacent built-in wall cabinetry. The island’s countertop is a dark-hued quartz from Caesarstone with a lighter grey-veined quartz also from Caesarstone utilized in the rest of the space. All are finished with aged brass hardware. The quartz countertop is run up the back of the wall along one side of the kitchen with a small six-inch ledge added to the top “it’s what I call the salt and pepper and spice station” explains Shea. One of the biggest statement-making pieces in the kitchen is the plaster hood made custom by Killowen Construction. “We designed it to have these really cool curves” explains Shea.

“This ledge is great for easy-access storage and with no upper cabinets on the wall we can put the ledge high enough to keep everything safe from splatters while cooking.” -Shea McGee

The walls and ceiling are Timeless by Clare with white oak hardwood throughout the entire space. Adding an organic touch to the shiplap-backed coffee nook is brass gallery railing “with closed storage going all the way to the ceiling” Shea adds. Take a deeper look into the dining room and pantry below as well as shop items from the Cottonwood Kitchen Remodel in the slider at the bottom of this post.

The Cottonwood Kitchen Remodel | Dining Room

The dining room is open to the kitchen with the same oak hardwood flooring running throughout for cohesion. A six-person oak wood table sits under a liner aged iron chandelier. Replacing the client’s ill-functioning doors where only one side opened— “discount doors” Syd called them like “Franch doors”—with French doors allowed for a seamless transition into the backyard.

The Cottonwood Kitchen Remodel | Pantry

This pantry is one of our favorites ever as it functions as much more than a space to store food. “It’s one of the biggest pantries we’ve ever designed” says Shea “and it’s big enough to have an island.” The walls ceiling and trim are again Timeless by Clare while the built-in shelving and shiplap backing is finished in Natural Tan by Sherwin-Williams. The plethora of storage shelves are broken up visually by utilizing seagrass baskets on the lower ones giving room for prettier display items up top. A marble-top island can easily be pushed aside but makes for a handy place to mix or roll out dough right in the place where the ingredients are stashe

“I love to have a back kitchen for entertaining because you set everything out then you come in here and hide all the mess” -Shea McGee

Here are the details.,"Williams-Sonoma is closing its location at Lehigh Valley Mall the second business to leave the shopping center’s outdoor lifestyle section in four months.

A closing date for the store hasn’t been announced but an employee who answered the phone Wednesday afternoon said it could be by the end of this week as most of the remaining stock has been sold.

The employee said all food and glassware is marked 30% off while furniture is 50% off.

The California retailer of upscale cookware appliances and home furnishings isn’t going out of business and will continue to sell via its website and a smaller footprint of brick-and-mortar stores. In its latest earnings report Williams-Sonoma reported year-over-year revenue growth of 8.1%.

With the Lehigh Valley’s only location shuttering shoppers who still want to shop in person and maybe get a free sample of peppermint bark or cake will have to drive to King of Prussia Harrisburg or Bridgewater New Jersey.

Another recent departure from the lifestyle center was Bravo! Italian Kitchen which left in October.

Williams-Sonoma is an original tenant in the lifestyle center that opened in 2008. Thirteen of the center’s 15 spots remain occupied including Pottery Barn an Apple Store Chico’s and White House Black Market.

According to its 2021 earnings report Simon Property Group which partly owns and manages Lehigh Valley Mall said the 150-store mall was at 94.4% capacity. It’s down from 97% in 2019 but up from 91% in 2020.

That circular crimped-edge form factor makes the Uncrustable an easy one-handed bite and it only makes sense that other businesses would be interested in making a similar product. But the J.M. Smucker Company owner of Uncrustables isn’t exactly a fan of that idea. Smucker is trying to stop startup Gallant Tiger from selling its popular sandwich pockets on the grounds that they’re too similar to Uncrustables.

Today reports that the Minneapolis-based Gallant Tiger was hit by a cease and desist letter by Smucker. The letter states:

It has come to our attention that Gallant Tiger LLC recently launched a new prepackaged round crustless sandwich. We have no issue with others in the marketplace selling prepackaged PB&J sandwiches but Gallant Tiger’s use of the identical round crustless design and images of a round crustless sandwich with a bite taken out creates a likelihood of consumer confusion and causes harm to our goodwill in our trademark.

Gallant Tiger’s product looks like a decidedly more adult sandwich with flavors like apple jelly and almond butter chai-spiced pear butter paired with peanut butter (doesn’t that sound good?) and salted strawberry jam and peanut butter. I’m not getting childhood vibes from these versions. At the very least it’s more complex than what Smucker’s working with.

Angela Washelesky a lawyer for the firm representing Gallant Tiger in this matter pointed out in a response that Smucker’s patent on “sealed crustless sandwiches” has expired.

“There are not very many shapes that a sandwich can be made into” she wrote. “Further there is an aesthetic aspect to a round sandwich. Most plates are round and a round sandwich on a round plate is more aesthetically pleasing than a square sandwich on a round plate.”

Uncrustables are extraordinarily popular but there’s no particular genius behind them; you can even purchase sandwich press tools to make your own crimped-edge sandwiches (yes round ones) at home. More than anything Smucker has maintained its corner of the market by securing a broad and widely debated patent and by regularly reinforcing the protections of that patent by sending cease and desist letters to a broad range of companies it views as competitors. In 2001 the company even sent a cease and desist letter to Michigan-based Albie’s Foods claiming a violation of intellectual property rights. But Albie’s wasn’t having it—the shop was a pasty shop and the pasty has been Michigan specialty for decades. The cease and desist was overturned.

Today reached out to Smucker for comment on the Gallant Tiger issue and the company responded by saying:

Please know we are not intending to restrict competition rather we are simply focused on protecting the unique trademark design that has become synonymous with the brand and avoid instances of deliberate copycat products in the marketplace. We continue to encourage discussion with the Gallant Tiger team and are hopeful they will engage us so that we can reach an amicable resolution.﻿

Smucker also points out that its cease and desist doesn’t reference the patents but rather the trademarks associated with Uncrustables.

I don’t know man. It still sounds like the bigger corporation is seeking out tactics to squash a competitor one that appears to have a completely different customer in mind. I have a feeling that any customer with a craving for a blueberry bourbon sage jam and peanut butter handheld can tell the difference between that and an Uncrustable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2dyYW5kcmFwaWRzLmNvbS9mb29kLWFncmlidXNpbmVzcy9mYW1pbHktb3duZWQtaHVkc29udmlsbGUtaWNlLWNyZWFtLWhpcmVzLWZvcm1lci1zbXVja2VyLWV4ZWMtYXMtbmV3LWNlby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Family-owned Hudsonville Ice Cream hires former Smucker exec as new CEO,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2dyYW5kcmFwaWRzLmNvbS9mb29kLWFncmlidXNpbmVzcy9mYW1pbHktb3duZWQtaHVkc29udmlsbGUtaWNlLWNyZWFtLWhpcmVzLWZvcm1lci1zbXVja2VyLWV4ZWMtYXMtbmV3LWNlby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2671990>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

In a year where I lost myself in Elden Ring’s Lands Between wrapped up Kratos and Atreus’ Nordic adventure and spent another few semesters with my Phantom Thieves in Persona 5 Royal on Nintendo Switch somehow a card-battler that released in October may have occupied the most of my time of any game this year. But truth be told I can’t be 100% sure of that because unlike those aforementioned games Marvel Snap doesn’t show us our personal stats which is both a blessing and a curse.

Recommended Videos

I’m a sucker for games that keep detailed track of everything I’ve done in them. I love looking back on my adventure and seeing how many miles I’ve run bullets I’ve fired zombies I’ve slain and burgers I’ve eaten. I think this started with me back on the SNES with The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past which had a counter on the file selection screen that let me know how many times I died on my quest to save Hyrule. But it’s only grown throughout the decades to the point where if someone like Rockstar Bethesda or CD Projekt is going to create a sprawling open world then I want to know everything about my playthrough… even if some of it’s a bit dark and twisted like Skyrim letting you know how many bunnies you’ve slaughtered.

My fascination with data also exists on a more macro level as I’ve kept a series of detailed and ongoing notes on my phone every year for the past half-decade of games I’ve played movies I’ve watched and seasons of TV shows I’ve finished. I don’t really do anything interesting with the information and I’m not trying to glean some greater meaning from it. But sometimes I just like scrolling through my notes and remembering how I spent a bulk of January 2021 replaying the Metal Gear Solid franchise (I’m weird) or how I did a full David Fincher rewatch in October 2020 leading up to the release of Mank (yeah I already said I’m weird) or how I watched all of Attack on Titan for the first time in a span of week last spring (okay that one’s probably not healthy).

And it’s with this that I look at Marvel Snap and wish it would be more forward-facing with my personal stats and data. There are basic things that I’d love to know about my time with the game like how many matches I’ve played and what my win/loss record is. Digging a bit deeper I’d love to know what my most played cards are which rounds I’m most likely to Snap on and which cards could be found in decks I’ve lost the most to.

Now some of these stats are kept track of on the backend and there are ways to view them if you play on Android or PC via third-party methods. However not only do I play on iOS but I also don’t want to have to jump through some shady-looking hoops in order to check out this information. I mean one of the reasons that Marvel Snap has become such a fixture in my life over the past few months is because of its short matches and ability to play in portrait mode on my phone — clearly I’m all about the easiest possible experience here.

It’s obvious that Marvel Snap is still in its relative infancy with a lot of big plans in store for 2023 including artist credits and the ability to battle against your pals so it’s possible that forward-facing data is in the works. That said maybe developer Second Dinner is keeping these stats obfuscated from us on purpose. Perhaps seeing the sheer amount of time that countless people such as myself have spent in the game over the past three months would act as a black mirror giving us pause on how we were spending our free time on a game designed to keep us in its grasp while I still have an ever-growing backlog to get to. But at this point I’m fully aware I have a Marvel Snap problem so at the very least I’d appreciate some receipts to back it up.

Covering food and drinks they have been crucial for the survival of many families during the cost of living crisis and will continue into 2023.

What are the SNAP Benefits dates for 2023?

SNAP support is guaranteed through COLA until the end of September 2023 and the first payments in January will also include a cost-of-living adjustment for the 2023 fiscal year.

Dates in 2023 will follow the same format as in 2022 so January payments should be made as expected in the first 10 days of the month.

As with 2022 payments will be made onto Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards during that time period.

Please note that these dates can vary according to the state in which you live.

How to apply for SNAP benefits

To apply for SNAP you should go through your state's local SNAP office or alternatively visit the website online.

On SNAP's Application and Local Office Locators page you can find more information about how to apply with relevant information in your local state.

It is important to understand this information clearly as your SNAP benefits must be requested from the state you currently live in as different states have different requirements and resource and income limits.

What is included in SNAP benefits?

SNAP benefits do help to provide food but there are some elements which are not included.

Items included cover things like fruits and vegetables meat poultry and fish dairy products breads and cereals snack foods and non-alcoholic beverages and seeds and plants which produce food for the household to eat.

Among the prohibited items are alcoholic beverages tobacco products vitamins medicines supplements live animals pet foods cleaning supplies paper products and cosmetics.

Southern Company is the publicly-traded parent company of Alabama Power serving 1.5 million electric utility customers.

Fanning boasted in a letter ""for the seventh consecutive year we have been recognized as one of the Top 50 Companies for Diversity by Diversitylnc.""

""Some 81% of system employees participated in diversity equity and inclusion development in 2022"" Fanning said. ""Across the enterprise employee resources groups councils and networks bring employees together to cultivate inclusion and a healthy work environment.""

Fanning is being replaced by Chris Womack who was appointed president of Southern Company and elected as a member of the Board of Directors of Southern Company effective Friday according to a press release in January.

""As Chris Womack takes the reins as President and CEO I have never been more enthusiastic about the future"" Fanning said in the letter to stockholders. ""And even as a new generation of leaders emerges and we move boldly forward with new innovations we remain committed to the ideals that have characterized our company for more than 100 years. Customers remain at the center of all we do and our mission continues to be bigger than our bottom line.""

A recent analysis by Opelika-Auburn News and the Dothan Eagle found Alabama's average monthly residential electricity bills were the third-highest in the nation according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The state falls behind Hawaii and Connecticut.

Alabama Power issued four rate hikes in 2022 approved by the Alabama Public Service Commission. Commissioners blamed the most recent increases on President Joe Biden.

The Alabama Republican Party passed a resolution in February stating that DEI policies — which proponents claim promote the representation and participation of different identity groups — do not fulfill their alleged purpose. Instead they ""have actually stifled intellectual diversity prevented equal opportunity and discriminated against anyone who dissents from these policies"" according to the resolution. The resolution was specific to abolishing DEI policies and bureaucracies in public universities and institutions.

Southern Company's Board of Directors said in a letter to stockholders on Friday that ""we recognize that Southern Company's talent is one of its greatest strengths and the Company has a strong track record of employee engagement and retention. Workforce sustainability topics including DE&I are regularly discussed by the Board and its committees.""

""As we think longer-term we believe that a diverse equitable and inclusive corporate culture brings broader perspectives greater innovation richer thinking and wider cultural bandwidth"" board members wrote. ""We also recognize the importance of racial equity and inclusion within the communities Southern Company serves and the Company's Moving to Equity initiative is regularly discussed by the Board and its committees. At a time of transformation in our industry we believe that companies with a clear sense of purpose combined with a culture that embraces change engages in healthy debate and encourages innovation will be the most adaptable.""

According to a list of Southern Company's ""human capital pillars"" included in the report to stockholders they're ""committed to a diverse equitable and inclusive workplace in order to best serve the diverse communities in our footprint.""

""Our diversity equity and inclusion (DE&I) efforts promote an inclusive and actively anti-racist culture as we strive to create a workplace where everyone feels welcomed valued and respected and all groups are well-represented included and fairly treated"" the report states. ""Our strategy for recruiting hiring retaining and developing employees includes a deliberate focus on DE&I. We integrate continuous feedback from employees to refine our commitments and actions. We have adopted new commitments to attract engage include and retain a diverse workforce. Looking ahead we will continue to integrate DE&I competencies into talent development offerings and advance our expanded HBCU engagement and strategic diversity recruiting initiatives.""

The Southern Company system and its charitable foundations are committing $225 million through 2025 to ""advance racial equity and social justice in our communities"" according to the report.

Southern Company's annual stockholder meeting is May 24th in Pine Mountain Ga.

LUV,Southwest Airlines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZGlnaW5vbWljYS5jb20vd2hhdC1qdXN0LWhhcHBlbmVkLXNvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1jYXV0aW9uYXJ5LXRhbGUtYWJvdXQtdW5kZXJmdW5kaW5nLWtleS1pdC10ZWNobm9sb2d50gF1aHR0cHM6Ly9kaWdpbm9taWNhLmNvbS93aGF0LWp1c3QtaGFwcGVuZWQtc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWNhdXRpb25hcnktdGFsZS1hYm91dC11bmRlcmZ1bmRpbmcta2V5LWl0LXRlY2hub2xvZ3k_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What just happened to Southwest Airlines? A cautionary tale about underfunding key IT technology,"2022 was the year of glowing reports of organizations applying digital technology especially cloud computing AI distributed data architecture and analytics to drive ""digital transformation.""

This is a cautionary tale of a legendary company that depleted investment in a core IT technology while draining cash reserves for stock buy-back to reward executives with seven-figure compensation.

As a result it ruined the holiday season for perhaps a million stranded passengers and may have permanently damaged the company.

The near-collapse of Southwest Airlines service when winter weather began disrupting air travel on Thursday December 22 2022 exposed troubling questions about the airline: obsolete technology tone-deaf executives and a business model that couldn't scale.

According to industry tracker FlightAware the extent of the debacle was reported in the New York Times article What Caused the Chaos at Southwest?:

Southwest Airlines canceled roughly 15750 flights in the seven days from the 22nd to the 28th at a rate of 17% 30% 35% 33% 66% 72% and 62% respectively. In comparison Delta Air Lines American Airlines and United Airlines each canceled fewer than 40 flights by the 28th. Delta had the fewest with only 15 cancellations. By the 28th about 87% of all canceled flights in the US were from Southwest alone. More than 2500 flights or 62 percent of its planned flights on the 28th had been canceled. Southwest said in a statement on Wednesday that it planned to fly one-third of its scheduled flights for the next several days as it tried to return to normal operations meaning it would continue to cancel close to 2500 flights a day. Some passengers unable to rebook Southwest flights rented cars or spent hundreds of dollars buying tickets on other airlines.

Industry experts expressed surprise that Southwest could fail so spectacularly. CBS News Travel Editor Peter Greenberg joined CBS 2 Streaming Anchor Brad Edwards to talk about the mass of Southwest Airlines flight cancellations. Greenberg said:

Of all the airlines that could melt down I was really surprised it would be Southwest - because think about this. They only fly one type of equipment. They're known for getting their planes in and out in 20 to 25 minutes. They cross-train their staff - that means the guy who does your bag can also push the plane out. They do a great job of turning their planes around – except when what happens? Their communication system breaks down - and that's what happened here on a system-wide basis.

He shouldn't have been surprised. This wasn't the first time. Signs of impending problems similar but less extreme occurred in 2021. The problem was more than just the weather. The vast snowstorm exposed other vulnerabilities in Southwest's network.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg didn't mince words placing the blame squarely on management:

While weather can disrupt flight schedules the thousands of cancellations by Southwest in recent days have not been because of the weather. Other airlines that experienced weather related cancellations and delays due to the winter storm recovered relatively quickly unlike Southwest. Yesterday (12/28) Southwest canceled 59 percent of its flights while other major airlines canceled 3 percent. As Southwest acknowledges the cancellations and significant delays at least since December 24 are due to circumstances within the airline's control. I recognize that Southwest's employees from customer service agents to ground staff to flight crews are working extremely hard under trying circumstances to help the airline return to normalcy. These frontline employees are not to blame for mistakes at the leadership level. Inadequate computer systems made it difficult to shift crews to where they were needed most. In addition Southwest lacks agreements with other airlines and could not rebook passengers on competitors' flights forcing many people to wait days until Southwest clears its backlog.

In another New York Times report on the situation we learn that:

In contrast to Southwest's ""point to point"" model most airlines use a ""hub-and-spoke"" system in which planes typically return to a hub airport after flying out to other cities. Southwest's route model often lets passengers fly directly from smaller cities and regions without stopping at a central hub like Denver or New York. Point-to-point flights cut travel times by eliminating the intermediate stop — typically a big advantage for travelers who are not flying from major metro areas. Inadequate computer systems made it difficult to shift crews to where they were needed most. In addition Southwest lacks agreements with other airlines and could not rebook passengers on competitors' flights forcing many people to wait days until Southwest clears its backlog.

In weather emergencies hub-and-spoke airlines can quickly relocate equipment and crews to hubs for affected routes restarting schedules. For Southwest that option isn't available and disruptions in some routes provoke logistical problems with resources out of position to resume normal operations.

A confounding factor is that Southwest's operations give them significant advantages as Peter Greenberg noted above. However their point-to-point model is far more likely to collapse under severe disruption. There is a formula in route optimization (n * ( n − 1)) /2) to calculate the number of routes where the variable of n stands for the number of point-to-point cities (destinations). If an airline offers flights to 100 destinations 4950 routes will be needed to cover all destinations in the network.

Southwest has roughly 6000 pilots and approximately 10000 cabin crews composed of two pilots and three or four flight attendants per flight. Unless this personnel (equipment ground crew and gate attendants) are in scheduled places at the scheduled time Southwest's tight operations can quickly fall apart because if any of those resources are misplaced or off-shift FAA regulations restrict the plane from flying passengers.

Scheduling airlines is a complex system with constraints concerning union rules federal regulations and airline policies when assigning crews and pilots to flights. However Southwest's system couldn't track where its crew members and pilots were after so many flights were canceled.

Rescheduling for Southwest involves complexity. For example every flight must have a captain preferably not two which may result in other flights needing a captain. One cabin crew flight attendant must be designated as a Purser (supervisor). Though not strictly required it is preferred to have at least one of the pilots familiar with the destination airport.

As CNN reported in Why Southwest Is Still Melting Down Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson commented:

Our technology could not handle the process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft. Southwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew but the company's scheduling software wasn't able to match them quickly and accurately.

My take

Management cut corners on modernizing Southwest's routing system which was developed twenty years ago and patched repeatedly even as the airline's operations expanded adding complexity to the system. Twenty-year-old software surely was designed in the ""managing from scarcity"" mentality of computer resources. Their scheduling optimization software is so old that it is likely incapable of handling such an enormous disruption. Older patched software is subject to “technical debt” a deficiency between the current requirements and. advanced technology and what it needed. Airlines which were early adopters of automating optimization models are particularly susceptible to technical debt but Southwest’s current predicament is extreme.

In March in its open letter to the company the flight attendants union even placed updating the creaking scheduling technology above its demands for increased pay. No action was taken - and Southwest now finds it in a very difficult spot with a wall of technical debt to somehow overcome.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1kZWZlbnNlL3NvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1pcy1zdWVkLW5vdC1wcm92aWRpbmctcmVmdW5kcy1hZnRlci1tZWx0ZG93bi0yMDIzLTAxLTAzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines is sued for not providing refunds after meltdown,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1kZWZlbnNlL3NvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1pcy1zdWVkLW5vdC1wcm92aWRpbmctcmVmdW5kcy1hZnRlci1tZWx0ZG93bi0yMDIzLTAxLTAzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2EBD5A0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The coffeehouse chain the world’s largest restaurant brand by revenue is making changes to its rewards offerings making it more costly to earn many popular items and less costly to earn a handful of others. The company notified program members Wednesday (Dec. 28) and updated its Starbucks Rewards Terms of Use page to reflect these changes set to take effect Feb. 13.

For instance the number of rewards points or Stars it takes to earn brewed hot coffee bakery items and hot tea has doubled and the number it takes to earn breakfast items specialty drinks and packaged food items has also increased. However the number of Stars required for iced coffee and tea and for packaged coffee has decreased.

“We occasionally need to make changes to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Starbucks Rewards program and to meet the changing needs of our members” a Starbucks spokesperson told PYMNTS via email.

The news comes just months after competitor Dunkin’ made a similar modification changing its DD Perks program to Dunkin’ Rewards and unveiling a new point structure that made it more difficult to earn popular items.

Reactions from Dunkin’ customers on social media platforms showed frustration that although points are now rewarded in higher values they cannot be redeemed for as much giving consumers less rewards bang for their buck.

“When we set out to improve DD Perks we asked our members what they wanted to see in a new program” Scott Murphy head of the beverage-snack category and president at Dunkin’ said in a statement at the time. “They told us three things: flexibility variety and recognition. And we did just that. We solved the three biggest constraints to bring a new and improved customer experience to Dunkin’ fans.”

Additionally in the past few months customers of fast-casual giant Chipotle Mexican Grill have been observing on Twitter and Reddit that the number of points required to redeem a free entrée is on the rise.

Chipotle did not immediately respond to PYMNTS’ request for comment.

These changes come amid soaring food prices with restaurants’ margins taking a hit as they attempt to absorb much of this inflation. Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that in November the most recent month on record food prices overall were up 10.6% for consumers while restaurant prices only increased 8.5%.

Yet even with the economic strain of keeping price increases relatively low some restaurant brands believe that the way to succeed in this inflationary period is not to pare back rewards but rather to scale them up.

“With some of the macroeconomic trends ahead I think it would make sense if rewards programs started to become more generous and more restaurants are participating in them” Or’el Anbar director of analytics at fast-casual chain Just Salad told PYMNTS in an interview. “Because it’s easy to roll out to a lot of point-of-sale systems and use the technology restaurants already have in place to now offer rewards functionality and customers are going to be looking for value.”

Indeed loyalty programs can be essential to driving direct restaurant orders in the face of competition from third-party marketplaces. Research from the October edition of PYMNTS’ Restaurant Digital Divide report “The 2022 Restaurant Digital Divide: Restaurant Apps and Websites in the Spotlight” which drew from a survey of nearly 2000 U.S. consumers found that 45% of frequent first-party app and website users cited better access to discounts or rewards as an influential feature impacting their preferences for these first-party channels.

They can also be a helpful tool in the fight against trade-down to food-at-home options as consumers mind their spending amid rising prices. Research from the August edition of PYMNTS’ Consumer Inflation Sentiment study “Consumer Inflation Sentiment: Inflation Slowly Ebbs but Consumer Outlook Remains Gloomy” revealed that in response to inflation 78% of consumers were eating at home more. Plus 38% reported they were opting more for lower-priced restaurants.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3BhbWRhbnppZ2VyLzIwMjMvMDEvMDQvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWlzLXJld2FyZGluZy1jdXN0b21lcnMtbGVzcy1qdXN0LXdoZW4taXQtc2hvdWxkLWJlLXJld2FyZGluZy10aGVtLW1vcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks Is Rewarding Customers Less Just When It Should Be Rewarding Them More,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2023/01/04/starbucks-is-rewarding-customers-less-just-when-it-should-be-rewarding-them-more/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3BhbWRhbnppZ2VyLzIwMjMvMDEvMDQvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWlzLXJld2FyZGluZy1jdXN0b21lcnMtbGVzcy1qdXN0LXdoZW4taXQtc2hvdWxkLWJlLXJld2FyZGluZy10aGVtLW1vcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RhbmR3aW5lLmNvbS9zdGFyYnVja3MtY2hhbmdpbmctcmV3YXJkcy1wcm9ncmFtLTcwOTA5NTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks Changing Its Rewards Program,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.foodandwine.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /starbucks-changing-rewards-program-7090954 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E4CAA7A0>, 'Connection to www.foodandwine.com timed out.

Warren Montgomery prosecutor for St. Tammany and Washington parishes sent a memo to all police chiefs and captains in St. Tammany advising them of how state law applies to books on library shelves.

“Please utilize this as a screening tool when reviewing charges for public library cases that are deemed to be ‘material’ harmful to minors or otherwise” Montgomery wrote in the memo. See the full memo below.

The memo gives an explanation of a criminal statute regarding the distribution of material harmful to minors. The DA asserts that the statute which typically applies to commercial entities can also be interpreted to apply to the public library system.

Collin Simms the DA’s criminal section chief said in an interview the memo was sent after several complaints were made to the Slidell Police Department. The department did not respond to multiple comment requests from the Illuminator.

A complaint was made to the Covington Police Department regarding “Gender Queer” a graphic novel about the author’s journey with their gender identity according to The Advocate. The article said several people voiced concerns to the Mandeville Police Department but its chief did not view them as criminal complaints.

SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. DONATE

Montgomery’s memo comes at a time of rising tensions in St. Tammany. The parish is the latest venue for a conservative movement to challenge library materials some view as inappropriate for children and teens. The efforts have also targeted library displays such as Pride Month exhibits and events featuring drag queens.

While some of the challenged books were written to teach young people about sex many do not include sexual themes. They include stories about LGBTQ people and minorities.

Similar movements have taken hold in Lafayette Livingston and Rapides parishes but the fight in St. Tammany Parish has seen an increase in tactics to remove books from shelves.

While just two books were subject to challenges in Livingston Parish from January to November 2022 St. Tammany received 75 challenges in the three weeks leading up to a Library Board of Control meeting last month.

St. Tammany was also where Attorney General Jeff Landry a Republican who recently launched a bid for governor announced a new statewide tip line for what he called “taxpayer-subsidized sexualization of children” at libraries. Landry’s office said the tip line was related to his work in the AG’s Cyber Crime Unit.

The movement has been led by two conservative groups. Citizens for a New Louisiana a Lafayette-based advocacy organization has been involved in similar fights across the state. The St. Tammany Parish Library Accountability Project an informal group led by David Cougle and Connie Phillips has kept the fires burning closer to home.

In daily posts to their Facebook followers the Accountability Project decries pedophilic materials and criticizes library officials.

“The library is knowingly breaking the law” one group post reads. “(St. Tammany) Parish Council fire the [board of control]. That’s “cause!!!” Are you all groomers?”

Both groups falsely posted on social media that Montgomery used the memo to order St. Tammany libraries to create a separate area for sexual content that would be inaccessible to minors.

Ken Levy a criminal law professor at LSU said the memo merely advises police on a particular state law and does not order them to take any specific action.

In an interview Michael Lunsford executive director of Citizens for a New Louisiana acknowledged the memo was not a direct order. He said his post claiming the DA ordered a separate area inaccessible to minors was simply meant to draw in readers adding that there aren’t enough characters in a Twitter post to explain everything.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGxwci5vcmcvZWNvbm9teS1idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIzLTAxLTAzL2xhdGV4LWdsb3Zlcy1hcmUtbm8tbG9uZ2VyLWFsbG93ZWQtaW4taWxsaW5vaXMtZm9vZC1zZXJ2aWNlLW5leHQtaXMtaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUtaW4tMjAyNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New law bans latex gloves in Illinois restaurants,"Metro East food service providers are now barred from using latex gloves as a new state law takes effect.

The Illinois General Assembly passed the Latex Glove Ban Act this year which Gov. JB Pritzker signed into law in June. The goal of the new law is to protect workers and customers who may be allergic to latex.

The law does carve out exceptions but they must be “due to a crisis that interrupts a food service establishment’s ability to source nonlatex gloves.” If latex gloves are used a sign must be prominently displayed.

Glenn Beaubien who owns State Street Market in Alton is one of the restaurant owners who’s made the switch from latex.

The fine dining restaurant in the city’s downtown got notice of the change from the Illinois Department of Public Health about one month ago Beaubien said. The restaurant has since switched to vinyl.

“Latex (gloves) are more expensive than vinyl gloves. So from a cost perspective that's a better win for us” he said. “The vinyl gloves aren't as tight fitting so they're a tad bit more cumbersome to use but it still is a vehicle to ensure that we’re working cleanly.”

Beaubien said he was a little surprised to read about the change in a letter.

In his eyes kitchens with a good handwashing culture are just as effective. He said he’s worked in states where gloves aren’t required.

“It worked very well” he said. “We had a timer set. When the timer went off everyone for the most part would stop doing what they were doing and they would line up at the hand sink.”

That’s not to say gloves aren’t as safe he said.

Starting in 2024 the latex ban will also apply to health care settings — many of which have already made the switch.

In health care people who have repeated exposures to latex generally are the most likely to develop an allergy said Maya Jerath the clinical director of Washington University’s Division of Allergy and Immunology.

“That could be health care workers or for example children who have been in the health care system a lot because they're born with some kind of a chronic condition that requires them to have multiple surgeries” Jerath said.

While she doesn’t have experience in the food service industry she said it would be safe to assume the same could be true: The employees who’ve worn latex regularly would likely be the most at risk to develop an allergy.

Sam Toia president and CEO of the Illinois Restaurant Association said the new law fits the direction the food service industry is heading.

“For the most part most of these are restaurants providers they've already moved away from latex gloves” Toia said.

Food service is one of the most regulated industries Toia said so restaurants are naturally sensitive to their customers' allergies prompting a move by many away from latex.

He said he was happy to see state lawmakers include the provision that allows latex to be used in a bind.

“We’d always rather be at the table than on the menu” he said.

At least seven other states have similar latex bans: Arizona California Connecticut Hawaii Ohio Oregon and Rhode Island.

Whether this is something that should be legislated by state lawmakers is another issue Jerath said. The scientific evidence to move away from latex is there however.

“If you can move away from it that only benefits that population and possibly sensitizes less people as well” she said.

Most dental offices she said have moved away from latex and opt for Nitrile or vinyl gloves. Wash U’s clinics have also moved away from latex."

The India Economic Times reports the company is in “advanced talks” in advanced talks to acquire a 47-acre land parcel in Thane Maharashtra along with realty developer Assetz Property Group from steel manufacturer Mukand.

According to unnamed people with ‘direct knowledge’ of the matter the freehold plot is spread across Thane’s Kalwe and Dighe localities and is valued at more than Rs 806 crore ($97.2m). NTT previously acquired around 55 acres from Mukand in the same area last year for Rs 801 crore (then $106m).

New York-based private equity firm Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners formed Digital Edge in August 2020. The company has more than a dozen data centers in operation or construction across the APAC region; including eight in Japan across Tokyo and Osaka; three in South Korea across Seoul Busan and Incheon; and one each in Manila in the Philippines and Jakarta in Indonesia.

Jesse and Emma were just starting their life together having purchased their first home in October 2021 welcomed their daughter into the world in March 2022 and recently married in October 2022. Jesse was a kindhearted devoted family man who absolutely adored Emma and Iggy.





Without Jesse her husband and life partner Emma is now faced with navigating life as a single mother. Unfortunately Jesse did not have life insurance. They had recently talked about it but were still newlyweds and it didn't seem to be an urgent priority. Emma has a good steady job but she’s going to be seriously stretched to make ends meet on her own.





Many have asked how they can support Emma and Iggy so this fund was created to do so. Any contributions that can be made to support Emma and Iggy during this difficult time and into the next chapter of their life are deeply appreciated. All donations will be used to meet current living expenses (mortgage utilities car payment daycare) and to directly support raising Jesse's beautiful daughter Iggy.





We appreciate all the love and support

Rock Island Arsenal - Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center will help distribute one of these advances to Soldiers across the force and in the field a mixed-reality headset called the Integrated Visual Augmentation System or IVAS in a partnership with Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier.

The IVAS is designed for dismounted close-combat force Soldiers to integrate key technology systems into one device enhancing situational awareness lethality survivability maneuverability and other warfighter capabilities to include synchronization with Soldiers in armored vehicles and helicopters.

IVAS provides Soldiers a field of view nearly twice as wide as those offered by current systems. It is capable of navigation and passive target interrogation which allows users to identify targets without being seen by opposing forces.

Currently thousands of IVAS systems are on ground in RIA-JMTC’s staging facility in preparation for fielding. The Army anticipates procuring up to 121500 units for close-combat forces over the coming years.

The RIA-JMTC IVAS team is on track to begin deliveries to units in the fall of 2023.

“That gives us time to receive everything dress-right-dress” said Sunny Koshal branch chief Program Management IVAS RIA-JMTC. “It gives us time to get a good accountability. It gives us time to pack and ship each item that needs to go because every item has to go as a lot not as an individual item.”

Besides their partnership with IVAS RIA-JMTC and PEO Soldier have built a strong relationship through their work on other programs to include a four-year partnership with PM Lethality for weapon cleaning kits. At one time the warehouse held more than $20 million worth of kits awaiting fielding.

The IVAS is delivered in multiple packages so RIA-JMTC employees will need time to package each kit with the system batteries and any other required components prior to shipping to Soldiers all over the world.

This fight-rehearse-train system will not only assist Soldiers on the battlefield but also improve their training opportunities. The goggles allow Soldiers to plan a mission virtually without concern for available space in addition to providing real-time mapping and augmented reality capabilities. Soldiers can train for missions and rehearse operations at the point of need.

The mixed-reality headsets allow Soldiers to see through smoke and around corners use holographic imagery thermal and low-light sensors to see in the dark and display 3D terrain maps and a compass projected into their field of vision. They provide tools to better conduct land navigation battlefield tracking and movement through urban buildings and open terrain.

The IVAS will be the single most advanced fighting goggle available anywhere in the world. Its capabilities result from the tireless integrated efforts of the Army and industry. The partnership between RIA-JMTC and PEO Soldier will help ensure these systems get to our Soldiers as soon as they are ready.

Hamilton platform based on the Altra line of Arm CPUs from Ampere Computing.

Since Amazon’s Graviton chips aren’t available outside of AWS and Nvidia has yet to ship its “Grace” CPU superchips that means these systems have to use Ampere’s Altra and Altra Max CPU families if Supermicro wants to have an Arm server play.

Introduced in 2020 the Altra CPU is available with up to 80 Neoverse N1 cores running at 3.3G Hz. Ampere’s Altra Max released a year later boosted the core count to 128 albeit at the expense of a lower 3 GHz operating frequency. Both chips are produced using 7 nanometer manufacturing process from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co – that’s the same process used in AMD’s “Rome” Epyc 7002 and “Milan” Epyc 7003 chips.

Unlike its X86 competitors neither the Altra nor Altra Max chips support simultaneous multithreading (SMT). Ampere contends this as an advantage in cloud-native workloads where it says the 1:1 core-to-thread ratio allows for more predictable performance within a core and across the cores on a die. And it is in the cloud where Ampere has seen some of its largest successes with Google Microsoft Oracle and Cloudflare having deployed its chips in their respective datacenters. So it’s hardly surprising that Supermicro would aim its Ampere-based Mt. Hamilton platform at the cloud-native arena.

The systems are available in 1U and 2U single-socket configurations with support for up to 4 TB of 3.2 GHz DDR4 memory across 16 DIMMs – the max supported by Ampere’s Altra processors.

Like many Supermicro systems today the Mt. Hamilton platform is modular and supports a variety of storage and PCI-Express configurations including up to four double-width GPUs or two dozen 2.5-inch U.2 NVM-Express SSDs. For networking the motherboards are equipped with redundant Nvidia ConnectX4 NICs good for 25 Gb/sec using SFP28 cages.

The air-cooled systems are also designed to operate in extended temperatures ranging from 35 C to 55 C. This means these systems are more than capable of handling the higher datacenter temps prescribed by the American Society of Heat Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) which top out at 32 C or about 90 F.

Supermicro is far from the only OEM that’s embraced Ampere’s Arm CPUs. Foxconn Gigabyte Wiwynn and most recently Hewlett Packard Enterprise have launched Altra-based systems in either single- or dual-socket configurations.

But with 2023 on the horizon Ampere’s Altra chips are starting to show their age. They lack support for DDR5 memory and PCI-Express 5.0 peripherals (and thus CXL on the latter). The chipmaker is working on a new processor called AmpereOne that will have more cores and ditch Arm’s Neoverse cores in favor of an in-house design but details on the upcoming chip remain elusive.

However Ampere won’t be Supermicro’s only supplier of Arm CPUs for much longer. At Computex this spring Supermicro showed off an HGX reference server that will use Nvidia’s Arm-based Grace or Grace-Hopper Superchips.

The design which will be used by six vendors including Supermicro Asus Foxconn Gigabyte QCT and Wiwynn will begin shipping early in 2023.

While perhaps best known for its enthusiast workstation and gaming motherboard and graphics products Gigabyte is no stranger to the server and datacenter arena. Alongside consumer-focused boards Gigabyte also operates as an original design manufacturer developing components like motherboards for OEMs and producing white box systems for cloud and hyperscale customers.

Among Gigabyte’s more notable customers is Yandex – also known as the Google of Russia. However Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine may have thrown a wrench in that deal.

According to Gigabyte spinning off Giga Computing won’t have a material impact on day-to-day operations. The new company will be owned in its entirety by Gigabyte after all and they about say as much. The good news for existing customers is this means there shouldn’t be any disruptions to service and or procurement. Gigabyte claims the newly formed subsidiary will continue to maintain and support all existing enterprise products and solutions.

Instead it appears Gigabyte’s decision to form Giga Computing may have been an effort to separate its concerns and allow the parent company to focus its energy on consumer electronics like GPUs laptops desktops and other PC components. Based on their finances this makes a lot of sense. The company’s motherboard and graphics business accounted for roughly three-quarters of their annual revenues in 2021.

The move mirrors that of other prominent OEMs whose logos span the consumer and enterprise spaces. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s 2015 split from HP which makes PCs and printers springs to mind. However whereas HPE was already a leading OEM at the time Gigabyte is not. With that said it is obvious the company sees Giga Computing as means to changing that.

In its most recent annual earnings report Gigabyte emphasized a desire to move beyond its ODM business and deeper into the channel end market. In a June financial filing Gigabyte took its first step towards going just that revealing its plans to spin off its Netcom business as Giga Computing Technology Co. with the express goal of improving “the competitiveness and operating performance” of its server and networking business unit.

But the company has a long way to go. Despite the fact Giga Computing is valued at approximately NT$833600000 or about $27 million adjusting for exchange rates. The wholly owned Gigabyte subsidiary didn’t make the list of top server OEMs or ODMs in IDC’s latest server market report. In an email to The Next Platform IDC says Gigabyte’s share of the ODM-Direct market is less than 1 percent.

In 2021 Gigabyte reported revenues of approximately $4 billion however only a fraction of that was from server sales. Gigabyte classifies its Netcom business under approximately $1 billion of “other” revenues which in addition to servers includes its laptop and peripheral business. However some estimates put Gigabyte’s server biz in the neighborhood of 25 percent of revenues – or just shy of $800 million a year.

Based on IDCs figures that would make Giga Computing less than half the size of Inventec’s server business ($2.1 billion) and about a third the size of Supermicro’s server businesses ($2.5 billion).

While Giga Computing may not be the biggest player in the server space it is also not the smallest and the company has been keen to push next-gen computing platforming. Last year Gigabyte announced a flurry of high-performance compute AI and communications platforms running on everything from your standard X86 fare from AMD and Intel to more exotic systems using Nvidia A100 and AMD’s MI250 GPU accelerators as well as Arm-based systems using Ampere’s Altra and Altra Max CPUs.

The company has also embraced next-gen cooling tech including direct liquid cooled GPU servers and both single- and two-phase immersion cooling tanks. The latter tech submerges server chassis in a vat of non-conductive fluids – typically a synthetic oil from Exxon or Castrol or specialized refrigerants from the likes of 3M.

The company is clearly determined to carve out a niche as demand for systems grows more diverse and specialized.",,,,,,

This survey was conducted online within the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of NerdWallet from November 10-14 2022 among 2064 U.S. adults ages 18 and older. The sampling precision of Harris online polls is measured by using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study the sample data is accurate to within +/- 2.8 percentage points using a 95% confidence level. For complete survey methodology including weighting variables and subgroup sample sizes please contact press@nerdwallet.com.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvbmV3cy9oZXJlcy13aHktaW52ZXN0b3JzLXJldGFpbi1nZW5wYWN0LTExMzAxMTEzNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's Why Investors Should Retain Genpact (G) Stock Now,"Genpact Limited G is benefiting from its investor-friendly steps and strong clientele.

G’s earnings and revenues for 2022 are expected to improve 11.8% and 8.3% respectively from the corresponding year-ago reported figures. Shares of the company have jumped 10% in the past six-month period compared with 4.8% rise of the industry it belongs to.

Factors That Augur Well

Genpact is benefiting from a strong clientele worldwide. The company serves almost one fourth of the Global Fortune 500 including big names such as AstraZeneca Novartis Bayer Dentsu AXA Hitachi Konica Minolta Heineken Santander Synchrony Financial and Sysco.

The company's Global Client base has improved rapidly over the last five years (2016-2021) with revenues increasing at a healthy CAGR of 10.5% to reach $3.65 billion in 2021. Global Clients as a percentage of total revenues increased from approximately 86% in 2016 to approximately 91% in 2021. We believe that Genpact’s expertise in providing BPO services will continue to expand customer base in the long run.

We are impressed with Genpact’s endeavours in returning value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments. During 2021 2020 and 2019 Genpact repurchased shares worth $298.2 million $137.1 million and $30 million respectively. The company paid $80.5 million $74.2 million and $64.7 million as dividends to its shareholders during 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively.

Such shareholder-friendly moves indicate the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.

A Key Risk

Genpact's current ratio at the end of third-quarter 2022 was pegged at 1.08 lower than the current ratio of 1.58 reported at the end of third-quarter 2022 and the prior-year quarter’s 1.58. Decreasing current ratio does not bode well for the company.

Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider

Genpact currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Business Services sector are Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation BAH and Cross Country Healthcare Inc. CCRN.

Booz Allen carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. BAH has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 8.9%.

Booz Allen delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.8% on average.

The advancements could help provide future insight into neuroscience pathology and many other biological and medical fields.

In the paper ""Magnify is a universal molecular anchoring strategy for expansion microscopy(opens in new window)"" published Jan. 2 in the journal Nature Biotechnology collaborators from Carnegie Mellon University the University of Pittsburgh and Brown University describe new protocols dubbed Magnify.

""Magnify can be a potent and accessible tool for the biotechnology community"" said Yongxin (Leon) Zhao(opens in new window) the Eberly Family Career Development Associate Professor of Biological Sciences(opens in new window).

Zhao's Biophotonics Lab(opens in new window) is a leader in the field of enabling super-resolution imaging of biological samples through physically expanding samples in a process known as expansion microscopy. Through the process samples are embedded in a swellable hydrogel that homogenously expands to increase the distance between molecules allowing them to be observed in greater resolution. This allows nanoscale biological structures that previously only could be viewed using expensive high-resolution imaging techniques to be seen with standard microscopy tools.

Magnify is a variant of expansion microscopy that allows researchers to use a new hydrogel formula invented by Zhao's team that retains a spectrum of biomolecules offers a broader application to a variety of tissues and increases the expansion rate up to 11 times linearly or approximately 1300 folds of the original volume.

""We overcame some of the long-standing challenges of expansion microscopy"" Zhao said. ""One of the main selling points for Magnify is the universal strategy to keep the tissue's biomolecules including proteins nucleic acids and carbohydrates within the expanded sample.""

Zhao said that keeping different biological components intact matters because previous protocols required eliminating many various biomolecules that held tissues together. But these molecules could contain valuable information for researchers.

""In the past to make cells really expandable you needed to use enzymes to digest proteins so in the end you had an empty gel with labels that indicate the location of the protein of interest"" he said. With the new method the molecules are kept intact and multiple types of biomolecules can be labeled in a single sample.

""Before it was like having single-choice questions. If you wanted to label proteins that would be the version one protocol. If you wanted to label nuclei then that would be a different version"" Zhao said. ""If you wanted to do simultaneous imaging it was difficult. Now with Magnify you can pick multiple items to label such as proteins lipids and carbohydrates and image them together.""

Lab researchers Aleksandra Klimas a postdoctoral researcher and Brendan Gallagher a doctoral student were first co-authors on the paper.

""This is an accessible way to image specimens in high resolution"" Klimas said. ""Traditionally you need expensive equipment and specific reagents and training. However this method is broadly applicable to many types of sample preparations and can be viewed with standard microscopes that you would have in a biology laboratory.""

Gallagher who has a background in neuroscience said their goal was to make the protocols as compatible as possible for researchers who could benefit from adopting Magnify as part of their toolkits.

""One of the key concepts that we tried to keep in mind was to meet researchers where they are and have them change as few things in their protocols as possible"" Gallagher said. ""It works with different tissue types fixation methods and even tissue that has been preserved and stored. It is very flexible in that you don't necessarily need to redesign experiments with Magnify in mind completely; it will work with what you have already."""

Verizon officially turned down its 3G network on the final day of 2022. It had been the last holdout among national mobile network operators with AT&T and T-Mobile US already having completed their 3G shutdowns.

Verizon first began announcing in 2016—seven years ago—that it was planning a 3G shut-down in 2019. However the operator decided to delay the decommissioning first by one year (to the end of 2020) and ultimately to December 31 of 2022.

The carrier indicated in March of 2021 that it had been working with customers who still had 3G devices to migrate them to 4G or 5G-capable devices and that less than 1% of its customers were still using 3G at that point. Verizon indicated that customers who need help starting 4G or 5G service should call customer service at 800-922-0204.

AT&T phased out its 3G network in February of 2022. T-Mobile US has been undergoing an extensive network rationalization since its acquisition of Sprint both to reduce network costs as well as to migrate technologies. T-Mo shut down Sprint’s 3G CDMA network in March of 2022—after a two-month delay prompted by protests from Dish Network which wanted more time to transition the Boost Mobile customers which it had acquired from Sprint—followed by a turn-down of the Sprint LTE network in June 2022 and finally by the sunset of its own 3G UMTS network in July 2022. However the carrier has so far left its 2G network intact with no firm date set for a 2G shutdown.

While some rural operators continue to operate 3G networks the national network shutdowns pose an abrupt end to service for individuals and companies which rely on those legacy networks that are reaching the end of their operational life and not all customers are willing or able to be transitioned. Dish Wireless for instance reported that despite the additional two months that it was given to transition users around 126000 of its customers did not migrate off of the old T-Mo/Sprint 3G network before it was shut down. The Rural Wireless Association was among parties which asked the Federal Communications Commission in 2021 to step in and delay 3G shutdowns because its members were reporting degraded 3G availability even before the official shut-down dates; the Alarm Industry Communications Committee also wanted an extension of 3G service in order for companies to transition devices ranging from alarm systems and ankle bracelet trackers elevator emergency phones and emergency radios for lone workers in industries in isolated places such as agriculture and oil and gas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vYmlsZXdvcmxkbGl2ZS5jb20vb2xkX2xhdGVzdC1zdG9yaWVzL3Zlcml6b24tcHVsbHMtcGx1Zy1vbi0zZy1uZXR3b3JrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon pulls plug on 3G network,"US operator Verizon followed on the heels of rivals AT&T and T-Mobile US when it shut down its 3G CDMA network at year-end 2022 three years after initially announcing a closure.

A Verizon representative told Mobile World Live (MWL) the operator started actively decommissioning its 3G network in 2016 but extended the shut off date from 2019 to the end of 2022 “in order to care for our customers and give them every effort to minimise disruptions to their service as they moved to newer and more advanced technologies”.

That outreach included proactively communicating through billing messages digital and traditional outreach as well as sending some customers updated devices.

By contrast AT&T announced that it phased out its 3G network in February 2022 while T-Mobile shut down its 3G UMTS network 1 July of the same year.

T-Mobile finished closing down Sprint’s 3G CDMA network by 31 March last year while Sprint’s 4G LTE network was shuttered by 20 June.

T-Mobile announced in December it had refarmed 1900MHz spectrum used in 3G and 4G to improve speed and performance on its Ultra Capacity 5G service.

Verizon attributed subscriber losses in Q2 and Q3 last year for its prepaid MVNO TracFone service to competitors closing down their 3G networks but the operator’s representative stated those customers are in the process of being moved to the operator’s 4G network.

Dish Network executives blamed the shut down of T-Mobile’s CDMA network for the loss of 343000 Boost Mobile customers in last year’s Q1. Dish Network and MVNO host T-Mobile were mired in a dispute about the timeline for the CDMA shutdown for more than a year.

Additional operators such as Cricket Boost Mobile Straight Talk and several Lifeline mobile service providers used AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile ‘s 3G networks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitwFodHRwczovL2lvdGJ1c2luZXNzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8wNC80MDc5OS1uZXh0YmFzZS1uYW1lcy10LW1vYmlsZS1hcy1leGNsdXNpdmUtbm9ydGgtYW1lcmljYW4tY29ubmVjdGl2aXR5LXByb3ZpZGVyLWZvci1uZXh0YmFzZS1pcS13b3JsZHMtZmlyc3QtdHJ1bHktc21hcnQtaW90LWNvbm5lY3RlZC1kYXNoLWNhbS_SAbsBaHR0cHM6Ly9pb3RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvMDQvNDA3OTktbmV4dGJhc2UtbmFtZXMtdC1tb2JpbGUtYXMtZXhjbHVzaXZlLW5vcnRoLWFtZXJpY2FuLWNvbm5lY3Rpdml0eS1wcm92aWRlci1mb3ItbmV4dGJhc2UtaXEtd29ybGRzLWZpcnN0LXRydWx5LXNtYXJ0LWlvdC1jb25uZWN0ZWQtZGFzaC1jYW0vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nextbase Names T-Mobile as Exclusive North American Connectivity Provider for Nextbase iQ World’s First ...,"With sophisticated Ambarella AI Computer Vision Processor Nextbase iQ offers extraordinary onboard intelligence

Employers have not embraced adding in-plan annuities to defined contribution plans which was one of the legislative provisions of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement (SECURE) Act of 2019 the report showed.



“The SECURE Act did little to quell employer concerns about annuities” the Alight report stated. “Even though the SECURE Act was designed to help relieve fiduciaries’ responsibilities for selecting an in-plan annuity provider nearly half of employers say fiduciary concerns are a major reason they don’t have annuities in their plans.”



Alight’s data showed that among employers 47% cite fiduciary concerns as a major reason for not adding annuities. The figure has remained stagnant since the 2018 report Alight found. Most (44%) of employer respondents are waiting to see how the market evolves and an equal percentage cite difficulty with participant communication. Fully 38% of respondents blame operational or administrative concerns and 32% cite participant use concerns as major reasons for abstaining from annuities the Alight research showed.



Alight data showed 12% of employers already have annuities in their defined contribution plan 3% are very interested in annuities for the plan 35% are moderately interested and 51% are not at all interested in annuities in their defined contribution plan.



Plan sponsors are however taking other actions intended to improve retirement outcomes for participants. Many were driven to make changes to their 401(k) and other defined contribution plans because of inflation hammered stock markets and the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic the 2023 Alight Solutions Hot Topics in Retirement and Financial Wellbeing Report found.



The current economic environment has spurred five out of six plan sponsors to change their 401(k) plans in 2022 or plan to in 2023 the report found.



“Employers’ top initiatives are enhancing their financial wellbeing programs measuring the competitiveness of their retirement plans and expanding inclusion and diversity efforts” the report stated.



Employers are providing resources including guidance on investing when inflation is high and are likely to increase communication to workers about investing in the current environment as 87% reported being very or moderately likely to expand their financial well-being program in 2023 the research showed.



The largest group of employers 55% of those responding said they have already or are expected to provide participants with access to advisers who offer guidance on investing Alight Solutions found. Another 29% either added in 2022 or are expected to include in 2023 an inflation-protection specific investment such as Treasury inflation protected securities in the plan 25% of employers said they provide tools than can model inflation scenarios and 13% said they focused on communicating to participants how to invest in high-inflation environments the research showed.



In 2023 61% of employers said they plan to offer budgeting assistance compared to 35% that did in 2018 the research shows.



Among employers responding to the survey 47% said they are very likely to focus on financial well-being of employees—with strengthened plan features planning resources communication mobile apps or online tools—beyond retirement decisions 40% are moderately likely and 13% not at all likely to do so the research showed.



Alight also found that 38% of employers say they are very likely to expand inclusion and diversity efforts in retirement and financial well-being plans 39% say they are moderately likely and 24% say they are not at all likely. Finally 42% of employers reported they are very likely to measure the competitive position of the retirement program with 35% moderately likely and 24% not at all likely.



“We did not ask how employers are increasing benefits” says Rob Austin director of research at Alight Solutions in an email. “Anecdotally some plan sponsors are providing richer matches or relaxing eligibility and vesting requirements.”



The Alight report was based on data acquired from 90 employer respondents employing more than 3 million workers. The survey was administered by Alight in September 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvc3RvY2tzLWNsb3NlLW91dC0yMDIyLXdpdGgtd29yc3QtbG9zc2VzLXNpbmNlLTIwMDjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stocks Close Out 2022 With Worst Losses Since 2008,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvc3RvY2tzLWNsb3NlLW91dC0yMDIyLXdpdGgtd29yc3QtbG9zc2VzLXNpbmNlLTIwMDjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E5342680>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

If you're about to scratch your head and say something along the lines of ""it wasn't like this back in my day"" pause. This advert for PlayStation 1 and Nintendo 64 games published in 1996 shows that it certainly was.

We're well-acquainted with Strauss Zelnick's comments (who is the CEO of Take-Two Interactive) about the $70 price tag on new-gen games. But other titans are hopping off that fence and potentially starting an industry standard. Ubisoft confirmed that its triple-A offerings will set the player back $70 in an interview in late 2022 and Microsoft followed suit to say that titles like Forza Motorsport Redfall and Starfield will cost $69.99 on all platforms.

There is good news though. Starfield will be available through Xbox Game Pass when it launches in the first half of this year. Check out the trailer below!

﻿ ﻿

Alas and alack - at least it's not 1996 any more. This advert from a Toys R Us magazine shows games like Super Mario 64 for $59.99 Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire for $69.99 and DOOM 64 for $74.99. On the other side of the spread PS1 classics like Twisted Metal 2 sold for $39.99 Need for Speed II for $49.99 and the Die Hard Trilogy for $54.99. Take a look:

""Most people made like $5/hr back then. To pay [for] a $60 game you’d need to work 12 hours. Sheesh no wonder my parents didn’t buy them for us. We did rent a lot though"" said Reddit user MarcMuffin. ""My friends and I all coordinated our birthday/Christmas gifts for games we all wanted and we’d just swap amongst ourselves to cover as much ground as possible"" added JerHat.

Advert

Obviously $20 or $30 was a lot more money back in the 1990s than it is today and we do have many more options for playing games like subscription services. One thing is for sure though. ""Shoutout to all the parents who bought us games and did so much for us"" praised InfernalBiryani. Amazing username too.

Hitman and Hitman 2 to be delisted later this month

The modern Hitman Trilogy has been considered to rank among the best games on Game Pass since it joined last January but as developer IOI looks to simplify the rather confusing purchase options for the games it seems like there will be some casualties — according to IOI  as of January 26th Hitman 3 will become World of Assassination and include all standard content from Hitman and Hitman 2 both of which seem set to be delisted at that time.It's not entirely clear what this simplification of purchase options might mean for the two delisted games going forward — while owners should still be able to play them IO's clear focus on Hitman 3 (or Hitman: World of Assassination as it will soon be known) likely means that ongoing support won't last forever which could present issues given how many moving parts there are in how the Hitman games work. If you still need achievements in these two games (rather than the shorter lists for their content which appear as an extension of Hitman 3's achievements) this is probably a sign that you'll want to crack on sooner rather than later.Given the timing of the planned rebranding and delisting falling almost exactly a year after the trilogy hit Game Pass it feels as though it may coincide with Hitman Trilogy being part of the second wave of January Game Pass leavers — if you're playing these games via the service this is also a good time to crack on as there's a decent chance they won't be available through Game Pass much longer.Disappointed to see these great stealth games go?

Discover SCENE

YouTuber Logan Paul is no stranger to crypto—or controversy. In a video published Tuesday he vehemently denied most of the claims YouTuber Coffeezilla had made against his crypto game project CryptoZoo and said he intends to sue Coffeezilla whose real name is Stephen Findeisen for defamation.

CryptoZoo is an online game on the Binance Smart Chain launched in 2021 where users buy “eggs” that hatch into hybrid animals. According to a company blog post the animals could yield holders passive income in the form of the ZOO token.

Paul previously said on an August 2021 episode of his podcast that CryptoZoo is “a really fun game that makes you money.” But that vision hasn’t exactly been realized.

The ZOO token has plummeted roughly 89% in the past year according to PancakeSwap data. And Findeisen spoke with over six different people who claim to have lost thousands each from their CryptoZoo purchases. In total just six of the individuals claim to have collectively lost nearly $600000.

The CryptoZoo blog has not published a new post since April 2022 and neither its Instagram nor Twitter page have posted any new content since May 2022. Such a lack of activity could be interpreted as abandonment.

The CryptoZoo Twitter account did however suddenly retweet Paul’s Coffeezilla response video Tuesday—and Paul insists that CryptoZoo is not dead yet.

“CryptoZoo is coming. I will make damn sure of it” Paul said in his video.

Paul denied that he ever scammed his fanbase through CryptoZoo and called Findeisen’s three-part series about the project “deeply unethical dangerously misleading and illegal.”

“You led the charge to drive and monetize a narrative telling millions of people that I’m a fraud or I tried to scam my audience” Paul said. “That is patently false.”

Paul claimed that Findeisen actually knows Paul is innocent but was “twisting” facts and published the videos anyway. Paul argued that Findeisen “published a defamatory hit piece fully knowing I was innocent.”

Attorney and Adjunct Professor of Law Andrew Rossow told Decrypt that because Paul is a public figure he would need to prove “actual malice” or that Findeisen published the videos with a “reckless disregard for the truth” in order for a court to take Paul’s case seriously.

“I think the biggest question that remains unanswered as of press time which is at the heart of a potential defamation claim is whether or not Paul’s ‘CryptoZoo’ was actually a ‘scam’—one that Paul intentionally created for the purposes of intentionally misleading and defrauding investors” Rossow said.

When it comes to whether Findeisen could be held liable in court Rossow said that more information is needed on all of the steps Findeisen took toward “obtaining the truth” from Paul.

Logan Paul responded. TL;DW

0 apologies

0 addressing victims

0 accountability

I will reply in full when I organize my thoughts but for now Logan accuses me of not reaching out to him directly until Dec 24 2022...but doesn't mention I reached out over a year prior on Instagram. pic.twitter.com/5AfEfDXFwj — Coffeezilla (@coffeebreak_YT) January 3 2023

While Paul might have plans to take legal action he doesn’t disagree with everything in Coffeezilla’s series. Paul did agree with Findeisen’s assessment of former CryptoZoo employee Eddie Ibanez alleging that Ibanez is a “professional con man.”

Paul said Ibanez who was previously listed on CryptoZoo’s website as their “scientist” is currently “being investigated by a higher authority that I cannot speak on.”

Paul also took issue with Findeisen’s interview with former CryptoZoo engineer Zach Kelling who told Findeisen that he had a team of 30 engineers working on the project for $50000 a week but were never paid. Paul said Kelling only had three engineers.

“I got everything stolen from me and our community” Paul said of the CryptoZoo fiasco claiming that he and his manager Jeffrey Levin have only lost money on CryptoZoo.

Paul also claims that Findeisen’s published phone call interview with Levin was “illegal” and makes Findeisen “like an internet criminal” because he had not been granted permission to publicize the call.

Neither Paul nor Levin have responded to Decrypt’s requests for comment.

But Paul did spend some time addressing the controversy on the latest episode of his Impaulsive podcast Wednesday.

“The guy is good” Paul said of the Coffeezilla CryptoZoo videos. “He is a very good storyteller and he is very very manipulative.”

Regardless Paul intends to take legal action against Findeisen for the trio of Coffeezilla YouTube videos.

“I suggest you use the money you got from pumping your Patreon to hire a good lawyer—you’re gonna need it” Paul said in his Tuesday response video. “I’ll see you in court.”

In a message to Decrypt Findeisen said he has not yet received any legal action from Paul’s team.

“The fact Logan is suing me instead of the criminals and con-men he hired says it all” Findeisen told Decrypt via direct message. “He took zero accountability. Zero apologies. He just wants to save his own reputation instead of cleaning up the mess that he and his team created.”"

The clothing market is very competitive but good management and intelligent buying pays off.

Buy Clothing stocks YOUR CAPITAL IS AT RISK

Some of the branded stocks on our list may look fairly middle of the road in fashion terms but their stock price performance is anything but. If the stars align even dowdy retailers can see their stock price increase by more than 150% in less than a year.

This guide looks behind the curtain on six of the best clothing stocks to buy right now and offers inside tips on how to find the right broker to trade them.

Is It a Fashionable Time to Be Investing in Clothing and Apparel Stocks?

It can be said that fashion is always fashionable but the companies and creators of sellable goods that pique the public’s interest can come and go like the wind. When you think of clothing you think of basic necessities. Who doesn’t need clothing? This industry however can be very fickle. The latest trendsetter may rise and then fall as the next competitor comes along. On the whole the industry could very well be performing admirably but individual firms may not show success.

Some years back prognosticators such as McKinsey and other industry observers predicted that the overall industry would grow at roughly 5% a year from 2018 forward. And then COVID-19 struck. The severe shaking of consumer behaviour benefited some firms and was detrimental to others depending primarily upon what sector of the business the firm was in. Low-cost apparel did well. Sports apparel did not but analysts are confident that consumer demand will shift.

Manufacturing costs have also forced major changes upon the industry in the past few decades but the digital age is now upon us. Companies must use technology to compete effectively in today’s market by bringing their ideas to consumers more quickly. Labour issues and global concerns over environmental sustainability add to the pressures that this industry must endure and address.

Buy Clothing stocks YOUR CAPITAL IS AT RISK

Investing in the clothing industry can be risky. It is highly competitive and the pace of change is only increasing with each passing year. What are the major threats that could impact the clothing and apparel industry going forward? Here are just a few to consider:

Consumer Sentiment: Generation X is now giving way to the Millennials. Attitudes and fashion consciousness are shifting and retailers must adapt quickly when sustainability and social responsibility come into play.

Environmental Impact: Unfortunately there is a great deal of waste in the fashion industry as well as a heavy dependence on water for production and securing raw materials. Technology will play a large role going forward.

Labour Issues: Globalisation has enabled a dependence upon cheap labour and studies reflect that extreme climate variations may put pressure on existing labour pools.

Transportation Logistics: When oil resources are under pressure all of this industry suffers due in part to transportation woes and logistical timetables. Apparel and clothing stocks are not immune to these issues.

Government Regulation: Concerns over water use oil dependency and the environment could also drive government officials to be more aggressive in restrictive regulations.

How Healthy Is the Clothing and Apparel Industry?

How can we measure the health of the clothing and apparel industry? There may be private funds or thematic attempts to formulate a comparable index but for now most investors look to a sub-index of the S&P 500 index. Let’s take a look at the current charting for this sub-index:

Buy Clothing stocks YOUR CAPITAL IS AT RISK

A COVID-19-driven dip occurred in early 2020 but the industry has rebounded as a recovery in shopping by consumers took place in 2021. Apparel and clothing stocks however were not immune to the overall downturn in share prices that overwhelmed stock markets across the globe in 2022. The latter half of 2022 was a different story. Shopping picked up and those store chains that found themselves well positioned for a recovery were the first to benefit.

What about 2023? McKinsey’s best thoughts on the topic are that the industry will not deliver the same level of profit growth in 2020-2021 some 21% overall and that going forward growth rates might be sluggish except in the luxury sector. There will be challenges but there will always be companies that are ahead of the game and adapt to increasing complexity. The best clothing stocks detailed below could be the firms that will shine.

The Best Clothing Stocks to Buy Right Now

The clothing and apparel sector reflects the fashion tastes of individual consumers so the nature of these companies is also particularly diverse. As a result our top six clothing stocks offer exposure to firms that are very different from each other and operating in different parts of the world.

It’s not a question of high fashion or low fashion more a case of spotting the business with a good business model an eye for current trends and a share price positioned to head higher.

TJX Companies

TJX Companies based out of Massachusetts contains a range of household names that operate from North America to Europe and Australia. Brands include Marshalls TJ Maxx TK Maxx Sierra and Winners.

The investment opportunity relating to TJX relates to its approach to doing business. The firm scoops up excess or unwanted stock that strong-brand retailers no longer want. The COVID-19 pandemic therefore represented something of a golden opportunity for the firm.

With their stores boarded up due to lockdown retailers such as GAP cancelled or refused shipments from producers in Asia. TJX stepped in and bought up inventory at the bottom of the market. As CEO Ernie Herrman explains: “Historically disruptions in the marketplace have created off-price buying opportunities for us.” ( S&P Global )

After its recent third fiscal quarter the company announced a $0.295 dividend for shareholders of record on 1st December. Based on these results alone analysts at Barclays raised their price target from $76 to $94.

The number of hedge funds following this stock has also increased by 10%. Fund managers have noted that TJX benefited handsomely from the COVID-19 pandemic and was able to capture the change in consumers’ attitudes. Eager shoppers in both the US and Europe were quick to visit TJX for the bargains that it is known for.

The TJX stock price is currently $78.87 at the time of writing. It has more than doubled from its 2020 lows and shows no signs of slowing down having already recovered from its mid-year dip in 2022. If analysts are correct a $94 price looks doable.

Lululemon Athletica

Another clothing retailer that is a good prospect is athleisure wear specialist Lululemon Athletica. The firm was already building a clothing market share prior to the global lockdown but its range of comfortable but classy products was the perfect fit for home-based working. The firm uses a two-pronged attack in the Canadian market by selling directly to consumers as well as through its company-owned outlets.

The firm has pioneered the home-shopping revolution and provides a live chat service for clients looking to learn more about an online product. It has also adopted Klarna to make payment easier and has got a good track record of complying with ethical concerns such as modern slavery and gender pay gaps.

The firm’s stock has been on a tear since pre-pandemic nearly tripling in value. It has pulled back to catch its breath now sitting at $327 roughly support from late 2020. JP Morgan analysts however have a price target of $413 having recently reduced it from $464.

Farfetch

Farfetch headquartered in London may be a good play if the analysts are correct about luxury goods outperforming the general apparel and clothing market. The firm’s specialty is selling luxury goods online to the US Europe and other global marketplaces. Share prices hit a high of nearly $75 in early 2021 but have nosedived down to $4.45.

At these low prices hedge funds have piled in raising the number of funds owning FTCH from 39 to 50 firms. Societe Generale has also reiterated its ‘Buy’ recommendation and revised its target upward to $12. Analysts regard Farfetch as the premier luxury online marketplace far surpassing its competitors in reach and diversity of products offered. Do you hear ‘undervalued’?

NIKE

NIKE a perennial favourite among investors hit a stock price high of $175+ at the end of 2021 only to fall sharply in 2022 down to $112. NIKE is the obvious leader in its field of athletic footwear apparel and equipment but it is one firm that has suffered due to high shipping costs and the ongoing strength of the US dollar.

Chart courtesy of eToro

Share prices have recovered a bit of late but analysts regard NIKE as a good long-term investment and expect it to regain its form and deliver 10% revenue growth and accelerating profit margins. The global demand for active wear is a trend favouring NIKE and quality usually does rise to the top.

Ross Stores

Ross Stores is yet another off-price apparel and home fashion retailer. Headquartered in California the company has survived a round of store closures made during the pandemic only to see demand increase for its products. As a result its profits have gyrated the reason for the rollercoaster appearance of its share-pricing chart.

Chart courtesy of eToro

Results for Q3 2022 beat Street estimates and prices rose accordingly. Analysts at Barclays have restated their ‘Overweight’ rating and are targeting $127. Current share price is $116.

Tapestry Inc.

Tapestry represents another play in the luxury segment of accessories and lifestyle products. The firm focuses on markets in the US China Japan and other selected international markets.

The stock soared in late 2021 tripling in value in six months but it has tapered off slowly to $38 today. Analysts at Citibank are targeting $42 but it set a high of $50 in May 2021. Do you want to bet?

What to Know Before Investing in Clothing Stocks

It’s important to keep a few factors in mind when trading retail company stocks:

Firms do go bust – This highly competitive sector has claimed many high-profile victims and if this happens equity holders see their positions go to zero.

Reputational risk – The clothing industry has the second-largest carbon footprint in the world. Fast fashion risks losing its client base if ethical concerns outweigh the ‘must-have’ attraction of items.

Squeezed margins – Labour practices in the industry have come under intense scrutiny. Operators are now looking a long way down their supply chain to ensure that workers are paid a fair wage and unless these added costs are passed on to consumers profits will decrease.

High Street challenges — Even before the pandemic the High Street was on its knees. How this situation pans out will be crucial to the fortunes of clothing retailers and the price of their stock.

How to Start Trading Stocks Online

Stock trading has been transformed by online platforms and mobile trading apps. Accounts take minutes to set up and brokers offer free demo accounts to practice with and an extensive range of research and analysis tools to help you develop your trading skills.

The ‘democratisation’ of trading has also seen costs driven down as brokers compete for market share.

It’s particularly important for beginners to appreciate the need to use a well-regulated broker – one operating under licence from any of the below is a good place to start.

Tier-1 Regulators

Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)

Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)

US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC)

1. Research Clothing Stocks

Successful trading relies on basing decisions on a well-thought-out strategy. Brokers offer free in-depth analysis and news feeds on the different stocks and taking advantage of that offer is a good first step.

2. Find a Broker

Different brokers specialise in different markets. If you’re looking to trade a particular name it’s worth checking if your broker of choice covers that market prior to going through the registration process.

Broker choice will to a large extent come down to personal preference. Each broker has a different ‘feel’ and finding one to suit you is important. It might be the case that you’re looking to trade on the go in which case cross-referencing to these reviews will help you find out those ranked highly in terms of mobile trading.

3. Open and Fund an Account

Brokers are required to ask a few questions of onboarding clients. These are to comply with regulatory obligations and designed to protect the customer. While they involve a bit of form filling they are ultimately a sign that you’re making a good broker choice.

Funding accounts is very straightforward but costs and speed of processing may be factors you want to consider. Trading is hard enough without paying out on account admin charges so it is worth checking the T&Cs of your short-listed brokers.

The process of verifying your account and logging your Know Your Client (KYC) documentation should take only a matter of minutes. After that you’re ready to fund your account and start trading

4. Set Order Types

Practicing using a demo account is a good way to get to grips with the mechanics of trading. Demo accounts use virtual funds so fat-finger errors won’t cost you but will instead represent valuable lessons on how to trade.

The platforms will offer you a range of order types that can help you manage risk. Stop losses are trading instructions that are built into your account to kick you out of a position at a certain price. This is very useful in the event that a position goes wrong.

Take-profit instructions are automated instructions that work in the opposite direction.

5. Select and Buy Clothing Stocks

Buying the best clothing stocks is as simple as logging on entering the amount of shares you want to purchase and clicking ‘buy’.

These trading platforms have invested heavily in developing functionality which is ideal for beginners. They’ve also addressed the issue of client safety and operate under licence from Tier-1 regulators. Successful trading involves choosing a safe broker that offers extra support such as educational resources and high-quality customer service. These brokers tick those boxes and even if you’re just curious it’s possible to visit their sites and try the service in a risk-free demo account.

Summary

Hunting out the best clothing stocks can be a profitable experience. There are risks involved with all trading but by choosing a safe broker you at least mitigate the risk of losing your money to a scammer.

Investing in clothing retailers also offers investors the chance to carry out ground-level research. Institutional investors send interns and analysts out to stores to ‘see if they’re busy’ and in the same way there’s nothing to stop individual investors going with their gut instinct on how they think a particular brand might fare.",,,

Targa Resources Corp. agreed to acquire Blackstone Energy Partners’ 25 percent interest in Targa’s Grand Prix NGL Pipeline for $1.05 billion in cash plus customary working capital adjustments. Targa will own 100 percent of Grand Prix upon closing.

Grand Prix has capacity to transport up to 1 million barrels per day of natural gas liquids (NGLs) to the NGL market hub at Mont Belvieu Texas. Grand Prix connects Targa’s gathering and processing positions throughout the Permian Basin north Texas and southern Oklahoma (as well as third-party positions) to Targa’s fractionation and storage complex at Mont Belvieu. The acquisition price represents about 8.75 times Grand Prix’s estimated 2023 adjusted EBITDA multiple and allows Targa to further benefit by now owning 100 percent of the recently announced Daytona Pipeline expansion of Grand Prix according to the company.

“The performance of our Grand Prix NGL Pipeline has exceeded expectations since it began full operations in the third quarter of 2019 integrating our leading NGL supply aggregation position in the Permian Basin to key demand markets in Mont Belvieu and along the U.S. Gulf Coast” says Matt Meloy CEO of Targa in a company press release.

“Our business has strong momentum for 2023 and this acquisition further simplifies Targa while also increasing our fee-based margin and providing additional cash flow stability” Meloy adds. “Given our expected record 2022 EBITDA and the strength of our outlook for 2023 we expect to remain comfortably within our long-term consolidated leverage ratio target range of three to four times. This acquisition further supports our already-strong cash flow profile and ability over time to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders through common dividend increases and common share repurchases.”

The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023 with an effective date of Jan. 1.

This as Edward Kelly an analyst for the bank said the retailer’s outlook “has deteriorated meaningfully” according to a summary of the report Wednesday (Jan. 4) published by Seeking Alpha.

“Our concerns include the potential for a sustained period of comp weakness in general merchandise an inflection to negative traffic in Q4 a lack of visibility on the timing/magnitude of the margin recovery story and the return of pre-COVID model scalability concerns” Kelly said.

Target did not reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment.

The report says Kelly is advising clients to move to a more conservative position and that investment opportunities in consumer staples retail brands “don’t look particularly compelling” to begin the year.

He named Target as one of the “bottom five” retailers at risk along with Kroger Costco Sprouts Farmers Market and United Natural Foods. Kelly’s top picks included Walmart BJ’s Wholesale Club and Dollar General.

Target warned investors in November that its crucial holiday sales season would likely not meet expectations in spite of record levels of promotions aimed at shrinking its inventory.

The news led to a drop in Target’s shares which are down 35% over the past year months. As PYMNTS noted at the time that slump “was in stark contrast to the results and market reaction” seen when Walmart released its earnings the day before.

“Many consumers this year have relied on borrowing or dipping into their savings to manage their weekly budgets but for many consumers those options are starting to run out” CEO Brian Cornell said on the company’s conference call.

“As a result our guests are exhibiting increasing price sensitivity becoming more focused on and responsive to promotions and more hesitant to purchase at full price.”

That’s in keeping with recent PYMNTS research which found that 60.4% of consumers listed discounts or sales as their primary factor in choosing a retailer.

Rising costs of goods and services in almost every category have stretched most Americans’ wallets: 60% of surveyed consumers say they live paycheck to paycheck including 43% of those earning over $100000 per year.

Target’s promotional activities continued after Christmas as it joined a number of other retailers last week in jump-starting their January clearance sales.

The past few months have also seen Target announce a variety of innovations such as the addition of Starbucks products to its curbside pick-up offering as well as a store remodel plan designed to give the retailer more backroom fulfillment space.

It was a prediction that their profits paid for dearly.

In fact shoppers held off purchasing discretionary items when the cost of goods and services reached record heights. Furniture orders in May for example dropped as much as 41% compared to the same period last year according to accounting firm Smith Leonard. Additionally people began dedicating more of their budgets to experiences like traveling as coronavirus restrictions eased. Retailers found their warehouses and stores stocked to the brim with merchandise that shoppers didn’t want to buy — or at least at full price.

“Our guests are exhibiting increasing price sensitivity becoming more focused on and responsive to promotions and were hesitant to purchase at full price” Target CEO Brian Cornell said during a call with investors and analysts in November.

Retailers rolled out promotions canceled orders and tapped liquidators in an attempt to right-size their inventory levels at the expense of their bottom lines. By the end of Walmart’s first quarter the company was sitting on $61 billion worth of inventory. When the impact of the excess inventory began to take hold in the first quarter Walmart’s operating income slid by $1.6 billion while Target’s operating income tanked 43% year-over-year. It was a surprising turn of events coming from after a year of hyper-growth.

“It’s the classic supply and demand problem” said David Berliner national leader of BDO’s restructuring and turnaround services practice. “In a perfect balanced world where the demand equals supply it’s much easier to predict what your prices are going to be how much to order. But once the demand and supply get out of sync it leads to the problems that we’re seeing here.”

Companies often order their supply of products months before they hit the shelves. But since the pandemic took hold predicting demand has become even more difficult.

Target for instance said earlier this year that the categories that were leading sales had flipped with toys and luggage in high demand. Meanwhile categories that saw record levels of growth like home goods started to dial down. Data from the Commerce Department indicate that sales for furniture had been slipping for several months this year compared to the same periods last year and when it does inch upward growth remained sluggish compared to other categories.

“Some of the things that they thought consumers would continue buying — home goods casual clothing — started to build up because consumers quickly change what they were looking to buy” Berliner said. He added that some retailers may have over-ordered their supply of merchandise after the supply chain delays caused empty shelves in stores.

Indeed the excess inventory as a result of mismatched demand had given retailers a major headache throughout the year. Retailers were rolling out steep discounts in an attempt to clear their shelves. Because of their heavy promotions retailers’ bottom lines suffered. Due to the financial impact retailers have had to pull back on some growth initiatives to focus on solving the inventory glut.

For example several Old Navy stores scaled back on the company’s inclusive sizing initiative to right-size inventory levels — a decision that drew criticism from social media users. Warehouse closures mass layoffs and a slowdown of its operations expansion plans plagued Amazon this year as e-commerce sales cooled down. When Amazon closed two warehouses in the Baltimore Maryland area the e-commerce giant laid off 353 workers.

“Retailers were quick to recognize the problem” said Kassi Socha director analyst at Gartner. “But given the unprecedented nature of what occurred their ability to adapt and solve for the problem took a bit of time.”

Socha said retailers are strategically discounting this holiday in order to solve their inventory issues. Due to their inventory concerns several retailers rolled out their holiday promotions earlier this year. Target launched its Deal Days event four days earlier than last year. Meanwhile Amazon unveiled its first “Prime Early Access Sale” which was held on Oct. 11 to 12.

However consumers are now beginning to be savvier when it comes to finding deals said Rebekah Kondrat managing partner of retail agency Rekon Retail. Despite already heavily discounting retailers like Gap said that it will keep leaning heavily on markdowns and discounting to work its way through the $3.04 billion of product it is sitting on.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022[1] was signed into law by President Biden on August 16 2022 and added new section 4501 to the Internal Revenue Code[2] imposing an excise tax on certain repurchases of corporate stock. The new provision applies to repurchases of stock after December 31 2022. On December 27 2022 the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and the Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) issued Notice 2023-2 (the “Notice”) to provide taxpayers with interim guidance addressing the application of the new excise tax.

The Statute

New section 4501(a) imposes a tax equal to one percent of the fair market value of any stock of a “covered corporation” that is repurchased by that corporation (and certain affiliates) during the taxable year. The statute defines a “covered corporation” to include any domestic corporation the stock of which is traded on an established securities market[3] and defines a “repurchase” that triggers the excise tax as a redemption described in section 317(b) with certain exceptions as well as any transaction determined by the Secretary of the Treasury (the “Secretary”) to be an “economically similar” transaction.[4]

The value of stock repurchases subject to the excise tax is reduced by the fair market value of any repurchases that fall within one of six statutory exceptions[5] including repurchases in connection with certain corporate reorganizations repurchases under a $1 million de minimis threshold and repurchases in connection with certain retirement plan contributions. The stock repurchase excise tax base also is reduced by the fair market value of any issuances of the covered corporation’s stock during its taxable year (the “netting rule”).[6] No income tax deduction is allowed for the payment of the excise tax.[7]

The statute provides the Secretary with authority to prescribe regulations and other guidance as necessary to carry out and prevent the avoidance of the purposes of the excise tax to address special classes of stock and preferred stock and to provide for the application of rules involving the acquisition of the stock of certain foreign corporations.[8]

Notice 2023-2: Key Provisions

Notice 2023-2 provides initial guidance and operating rules for the excise tax including some welcome news but does not provide all of the relief for which taxpayers and practitioners had advocated. It also previews anticipated procedures for reporting and paying the tax and requests comments on various aspects of the tax and the implementation of the tax. The IRS and Treasury have imposed a 60-day deadline for comments although the first day of that 60-day period does not begin until the Notice is published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin which could be as early as this week. The following discussion is a high-level summary of the most notable provisions in the Notice.

Definitions: “Redemptions” and “Economically Similar Transactions”

Consistent with section 4501(c)(1) the Notice states that for purposes of the stock repurchase excise tax a repurchase means either a section 317(b) redemption or an economically similar transaction.[9] The Notice goes on to provide two exceptions to the section 317(b) rule as well as lists of transactions that are economically similar and transactions that are not economically similar.

Section 317(b) Redemptions Carved Out of Repurchase Treatment

As noted above the Code contains six exceptions to repurchase treatment.[10] The Notice provides an exclusive list of section 317(b) redemptions that are not treated as repurchases for purposes of the excise tax:[11]

Section 304(a)(1) transactions. Under section 304(a)(1) a transaction involving two commonly controlled corporations in which one corporation acquires the shares of the second corporation from the controlling person(s) is treated as a distribution in redemption of the acquiring corporation’s deemed issued stock. The Notice provides that the deemed redemption is not a repurchase for purposes of the excise tax regardless of whether section 302(a) or (d) applies to the deemed redemption while also disregarding the stock deemed issued under section 304(a)(1) for purposes of the netting rule (discussed below).[12]

Payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares. A payment by a covered corporation of cash in lieu of the issuance of a fractional share in connection with a section 368(a) reorganization a section 355 distribution or pursuant to the settlement of an option or similar financial instrument is not treated as a section 317(b) redemption if the cash received by the shareholder in lieu of the fractional share represents a mere rounding off of the shares issued in the exchange or settlement the payment is carried out solely for administrative convenience or other non-tax reasons and the amount of cash paid to the shareholder in lieu of a fractional share does not exceed the value of one full share of the stock of the covered corporation.[13]

Economically Similar Transactions

Section 4501(c)(1)(B) authorizes the IRS and Treasury to issue regulations applying the stock repurchase excise tax to “economically similar transactions” that may not fit the technical definition of a section 317(b) redemption. The Notice provides an exclusive list of five transactions that the IRS and Treasury have deemed to be economically similar transactions:[14]

Acquisitive reorganizations. The exchange by shareholders of a target covered corporation of their target corporation stock in a reorganization is economically similar to a repurchase by the target corporation. Notably although the term “acquisition reorganization” does not include section 368(a)(1)(B) reorganizations it does include reorganizations qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(E).[15]

Recapitalizations. The exchange by shareholders of a covered corporation of their stock in the covered corporation for new stock issued by the covered corporation in a recapitalization described in section 368(a)(1)(E) is economically similar to a repurchase by the recapitalizing covered corporation.

F reorganizations. The exchange by shareholders of a covered corporation of their stock in the transferor corporation (as defined in Treas. Reg. § 1.368-2(m)(1)) as part of a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F) is economically similar to a repurchase by the transferor corporation.

Split-offs. In the case of a split-off by a covered corporation pursuant to section 355 and section 356 as it relates to section 355 the exchange by the distributing corporation’s shareholders of their distributing corporation stock for controlled corporation stock or other property is economically similar to a repurchase by the distributing corporation.

Complete liquidations to which both section 331 and section 332 apply. If a covered corporation liquidates in a transaction to which section 331 applies to certain shareholders and section 332 applies to other shareholders the section 331 components are economically similar to repurchases by the covered corporation whereas the section 332 components are not repurchases.[16]

Although at first blush the inclusion of tax-free transactions on the “demon” list of economically similar transactions may be disturbing the “qualifying property exception” discussed below should reduce the repurchase amount to zero if there is no boot (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares) involved in the transaction.

Not Economically Similar Transactions

The Notice also includes a nonexclusive list of transactions that are treated as not economically similar to a repurchase although the list identifies only two such transactions: complete liquidations covered solely by section 331 or by section 332(a) and divisive section 355 transactions other than split-offs.[17]

Three points regarding the “angel” list bear mentioning. First because this “angel” list is nonexclusive (and the “demon list” is exclusive) taxpayers presumably have the ability to treat other similar transactions as not economically similar to a repurchase especially given that section 3.04(4)(a) of the Notice provides an exclusive list of economically similar transactions.[18] Second the inclusion of section 331 complete liquidations on the list should provide welcome relief to many special purpose acquisition companies (commonly known as “SPACs”) for which the potential application of the excise tax to their unwinds presented challenging issues.[19] Third the Notice does not state that section 331 liquidations are not treated as section 317(b) redemptions leaving some uncertainty that would benefit from clarification.[20]

Specified Affiliates and Surrogate Foreign Corporations

Section 4501(c)(2)(A) treats the acquisition of stock of a covered corporation by a specified affiliate of that covered corporation from a person that is not the covered corporation or a specified affiliate of the covered corporation as a repurchase by the covered corporation. Section 4501(d) includes special rules with respect to acquisitions of stock of certain foreign corporations and certain surrogate foreign corporations (i.e. foreign corporations that are subject to the anti-inversion provisions of section 7874).[21] The Notice provides additional detail as to when these provisions are triggered including by adding a per se rule in situations in which a transaction is undertaken with a principal purpose of avoiding the stock repurchase excise tax.

Fair Market Value of Repurchased Stock

Although section 4501 imposes an excise tax on stock repurchases within a particular tax year the statute does not specifically address how and when the repurchased stock is valued. Section 3.06 of the Notice fills in some of these timing and valuation details. Under this portion of the Notice stock is treated as repurchased at the time that ownership of the stock transfers to the covered corporation or to the applicable acquiror for federal income tax purposes (or in the case of economically similar transactions at the time of the exchange).

The Notice first provides that the fair market value of repurchased stock is its market price (regardless of whether the market price is the price at which the stock was repurchased). The Notice then prescribes four methods for determining the market price of repurchased stock that is traded on an established securities market: (i) the daily volume-weighted average price on the repurchase date; (ii) the price at the close of day on the repurchase date; (iii) the average of the high and low prices on the repurchase date; and (iv) the trading price at the time of the repurchase. If the date on which the repurchase occurs is not a trading day the market price is determined on the immediately preceding trading date.

The covered corporation must use the same method of determining the market price of repurchased stock that is traded on an established securities market for all repurchases that occur during the covered corporation’s taxable year. If the repurchased stock is not traded on an established securities market the market price of the repurchased stock is determined as of the repurchase date under the principles of Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-1(b)(5)(iv)(B)(1).

Section 3.08 of the Notice provides that similar rules apply for valuing stock issued by the covered corporation for purposes of applying the netting rule (discussed below) other than stock issued to an employee (for which the fair market value of the stock is determined under section 83 as of the date the stock is issued or provided to the employee).

Statutory Exceptions to the Excise Tax and Elaboration by the Notice

Under section 4501(e) repurchases that occur in one of six types of transactions are excluded from the excise tax. The excepted transactions listed in the statute are:

Tax-free reorganizations. To the extent that a repurchase is part of a reorganization (within the meaning of section 368(a)) and no gain or loss is recognized on the repurchase by the shareholder by reason of the reorganization;

Employer-sponsored retirement plans. Stock repurchased (or an amount of stock equal to the value of the stock repurchased) that is contributed to an employer-sponsored retirement plan employee stock ownership plan or similar plan;

De minimis repurchases. Stock repurchased where the total value of the stock repurchased during the taxable year does not exceed $1000000;

Dealer transactions. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary in cases in which the repurchase is by a dealer in securities in the ordinary course of business;

Repurchases by RICs and REITs. Repurchases by a section 851 regulated investment company or a real estate investment trust; and

Dividend-equivalent repurchases. Repurchases treated as a dividend under the Code.

Section 3.07 of the Notice contains details with respect to the statutory exceptions to the excise tax contained in section 4501(e) and provides that a repurchase that is described in a statutory exception under section 4501(e) is treated as a reduction in computing the covered corporation’s stock repurchase excise tax base.

Reorganization Exception

The Notice expands on the statute’s first exception for reorganizations under section 368(a)[22] by more specifically defining situations that are treated as transactions that do not result in gain or loss to the shareholder. The Notice does so by adding a “qualifying property exception” that reduces the stock repurchase excise tax base interpreting the statutory exception not to have a “cliff effect” in which a transaction must be entirely tax free but instead to have a broader “to the extent” exception in which the exception applies to the extent the shareholders receive qualifying property (i.e. property the receipt of which does not give rise to gain or loss to the shareholder under section 354 or 355[23]) in one of four types of qualifying transactions:

a repurchase by a target corporation as part of an acquisitive reorganization;

a repurchase by a covered corporation or a covered foreign surrogate corporation as part of an section 368(a)(1)(E) reorganization;

a repurchase by a transferor corporation as part of an section 368(a)(1)(F) reorganization; and

a repurchase by a distributing corporation as part of a split-off (whether or not part of a section 368(a)(1)(D) reorganization).

Thus if section 354 or 355 applies to any of these transactions the qualifying property exception will reduce the covered corporation’s stock repurchase excise tax base. Conversely to the extent that an exchanging shareholder receives property other than qualifying property in such a transaction the qualifying property exception will not apply with respect to such non-qualifying property.

The approach of the Notice provides welcome relief to taxpayers who were concerned that a penny of boot in an otherwise tax-free reorganization would cause the entire transaction to be treated as a repurchase but this portion of the Notice likely is a disappointment to those who had hoped that guidance would provide that boot received in a reorganization would be excepted from the excise tax. In this regard a reorganization with boot even if fully sourced or funded by the acquiring corporation will be subject to the excise tax to the extent of the boot.[24] This is to be distinguished from taxable transactions – the Notice makes clear that the funding source of the cash (as determined under general tax principles) is determinative in fully taxable transactions.[25] Relatedly in a fully taxable reverse subsidiary cash merger where the transitory merger subsidiary incurs debt to fund a portion of the purchase price the debt-financed portion will be subject to the excise tax because the target corporation is treated as redeeming its own stock in exchange for the borrowed cash received by the target’s shareholders in the merger.[26]

Retirement Plan Exception

The Notice provides some helpful guidance with respect to the statutory exception to the excise tax for stock contributions to employer-sponsored retirement plans.[27] Specifically the Notice clarifies that contributions need not be for the same class of stock as was subject to the repurchase although different valuation rules apply in determining the amount of the reduction to the excise tax base when different classes of stock are repurchased and contributed.[28] The Notice provides additional rules for determining the fair market value of stock repurchased by a covered corporation in the context of this exception as well as a special timing rule for contributions made to a retirement plan.[29]

Dealer in Securities Exception

The Notice prescribes general rules for repurchases by a dealer in securities in the ordinary course of business.[30] Specifically the Notice states that the exception is available for dealers in securities only if the dealer accounts for the stock as securities held primarily for sale to customers in the dealer’s ordinary course of business disposes of the stock within a time period consistent with the holding of the stock for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business and does not sell or otherwise transfer the stock to an applicable acquiror or the covered corporation as applicable other than a sale or transfer to a dealer that otherwise satisfies the requirements of the exception.

Exception for Repurchases Treated as Dividends

The Notice adds a rebuttable presumption that repurchases to which section 302 or section 356(a) applies do not qualify for the statutory exception for dividends under section 4501(e)(6).[31] A covered corporation may rebut this presumption with regard to a specific shareholder by establishing with “sufficient evidence” that the shareholder treats the repurchase as a dividend on the shareholder’s tax return. This evidentiary requirement is likely to present challenges for widely held public corporations because the Notice requires that the covered corporation obtain certification from the shareholder that the repurchase constitutes a redemption treated as a section 301 distribution under section 302(d) or that the repurchase has the effect of the distribution of a dividend under section 356(a)(2) including evidence that applicable withholding occurred if required.

The Netting Rule

As mentioned above section 4501(c)(3) provides for a taxpayer-friendly downward adjustment to the amount subject to the stock repurchase excise tax for the fair market value of any stock issued by the covered corporation during the tax year. The Notice describes this adjustment as the “netting rule” and clarifies certain valuation and timing rules.[32] The Notice also provides an exclusive list of situations that do not qualify for the rule (and therefore do not reduce the excise tax base of the covered corporation)[33] including a no-double-counting rule that eliminates netting with respect to transactions exempted from the scope of the tax under section 4501(e) discussed above.

The Notice confirms what might be considered a taxpayer favorable timing mismatch in the text of the statute.[34] Specifically although section 4501 applies only to repurchases occurring after December 31 2022[35] the netting rule permits reductions with respect to a covered corporation’s issuances of stock occurring at any time during the entire taxable year. The Notice specifically states that “solely in the case of a covered corporation that has a taxable year that both begins before January 1 2023 and ends after December 31 2022 that covered corporation may solely with regard to any covered repurchases during that taxable year to which the stock repurchase excise tax applies apply the netting rule to reduce the fair market value of the covered corporation’s covered repurchases during that taxable year by the fair market value of all issuances of its stock during the entirety of that taxable year.”[36]

Reporting Requirements

The Notice provides that the excise tax must be reported on Form 720 Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return.[37] (On December 30 2022 the IRS issued in draft form Form 7208 Excise Tax on Repurchase of Corporate Stock that taxpayers will be required to attach to the Form 720.[38]) The IRS and Treasury expect the forthcoming proposed regulations to provide that the excise tax will be reported once per taxable year on the Form 720 that is due for the first full quarter after the close of a taxpayer’s taxable year. The Notice gives as an example a taxpayer with a taxable year ending on December 31 2023 which would report its stock repurchase excise tax on the Form 720 for the first quarter of 2024 due on April 30 2024.

Comments Requested and Additional Future Coverage

Section 6 of the Notice requests comments on both specific and general issues including the need for: special rules for redeemable preferred stock or other special classes of stock or debt; the determination of the fair market value of the stock repurchased; factors that should be considered in guidance regarding indirect ownership for purposes of whether a corporation or a partnership is a specified affiliate; whether special rules for bankrupt or troubled companies are needed; and whether additional rules should be added to prevent the avoidance of tax in the context of certain financial arrangements.

Reliance and Effective Date of Forthcoming Regulations

Until the issuance of the forthcoming proposed regulations taxpayers may rely on the rules described in the Notice.[39]

Although regulations typically are effective when finalized under section 7805(b)(2) final regulations issued within 18 months after the August 16 2022 enactment of this new provision can have retroactive effect. Section 7805(b)(3) also permits certain anti-abuse regulations to have retroactive effect but this provision presents challenges under the Administrative Procedure Act that in our experience make the IRS and Treasury less willing to rely on it.[40]

Additional Observations

It is likely that tax planners will revisit commonly used techniques in the M&A area such as the market-standard reverse subsidiary cash merger. As noted above to the extent the merger subsidiary is debt-financed the target corporation is treated as incurring the debt and redeeming its own stock which will cause the debt-financed portion of the acquisition proceeds to be included in the excise tax base. For this reason there may be interest in alternative structures that avoid such redemption treatment such as structures that place the leverage at a holding company level.

Interestingly the Notice was one of two that the IRS and Treasury issued on December 27 both providing interim guidance with respect to recent legislation (the other Notice 2023-7 addresses the new corporate alternative minimum tax and will be the subject of another client alert). In the past in implementing new legislation the IRS and Treasury have often chosen to issue proposed/temporary regulations without first issuing a notice. It is possible that the court cases challenging the validity of regulations particularly those challenges involving the Administrative Procedure Act have caused the government to be more cautious in promulgating regulations without providing meaningful opportunity for stakeholder input.

[14] § 3.04(4)(a). In the description of each transaction the term “covered corporation” includes a “covered surrogate foreign corporation” as appropriate. The fact that the list is exclusive provides welcome certainty to taxpayers.

[15] The final regulations would benefit from an overlap rule to address transactions described in both section 368(a)(1)(B) and section 368(a)(2)(E) in which the consideration includes voting stock described in section 351(g)(2).

[16] This would occur for example in a situation in which a covered corporation has an 80-percent corporate shareholder and one or more minority shareholders.

[18] Moreover it appears that § 3.04(4)(b) is unnecessary in light of § 3.04(4)(a).

[19] The Notice does not contain an exception for redemptions of preferred stock despite some requests from the SPAC industry and others for such an exception.

[20] See e.g. Rev. Rul. 79-401 1979-2 C.B. 128 in which the IRS ruled that the liquidating distribution at issue was “a ‘redemption’ within the meaning of section 317(b) of the Code which defines that term for purposes of section 303 [i.e. for purposes of part I of subchapter C] even though section 317(b) does not apply to section 331.”

[21] Only surrogate foreign corporations that were acquired in transactions described in section 7874(a)(2)(B) after September 20 2021 are subject to these rules. Further presumably these rules apply only to surrogate foreign corporations subject to section 7874(a)(2)(B) and not to corporations subject to section 7874(b) which are treated as domestic corporations for purposes of chapter 37 of the Code.

[22] Section 4501(e)(1).

[23]Stock-for-stock exchanges relying solely on section 1036 generally are not section 317(b) redemptions nor apparently are they “economically similar” transactions (because they were not included in the Notice’s exclusive list).

As the electric-vehicle ( EV ) champion’s share price rose its worth was couched in terms of the combined value of the next two then five then ten biggest carmakers. A year ago Tesla’s market value surpassed $1.2trn more than most other car companies put together. Since then it has lost 71% of that—a sum exceeding the value of most of the industry. The fortune of its mercurial boss Elon Musk has shrivelled by more than $200bn as a result.

The latest blow came on January 3rd after Tesla missed analysts’ expectations for deliveries for the third quarter in a row and reported that the gap between production and deliveries had grown suggesting softening demand for its EV s. It lost 12% of its value—roughly $50bn or one Ford Motor Company—in a day. Even bullish investors now doubt that Mr Musk will fulfil his promise of making 20m cars a year by 2030 or that Tesla’s ”Autopilot” is close to becoming a world-changing fully autonomous driving system. Yet the main reason for the market’s recalibration of Tesla’s prospects is a dawning realisation that the company is chiefly a carmaker—and that its boss is not superhuman."

Parts made by more than a dozen US and Western companies were found inside a single Iranian drone downed in Ukraine last fall according to a Ukrainian intelligence assessment obtained exclusively by CNN.

The assessment which was shared with US government officials late last year illustrates the extent of the problem facing the Biden administration which has vowed to shut down Iran’s production of drones that Russia is launching by the hundreds into Ukraine.

CNN reported last month that the White House has created an administration-wide task force to investigate how US and Western-made technology – ranging from smaller equipment like semiconductors and GPS modules to larger parts like engines – has ended up in Iranian drones.

Of the 52 components Ukrainians removed from the Iranian Shahed-136 drone 40 appear to have been manufactured by 13 different American companies according to the assessment.

The remaining 12 components were manufactured by companies in Canada Switzerland Japan Taiwan and China according to the assessment.

The options for combating the issue are limited. The US has for years imposed tough export control restrictions and sanctions to prevent Iran from obtaining high-end materials. Now US officials are looking at enhanced enforcement of those sanctions encouraging companies to better monitor their own supply chains and perhaps most importantly trying to identify the third-party distributors taking these products and re-selling them to bad actors.

NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson told CNN in a statement that “We are looking at ways to target Iranian UAV production through sanctions export controls and talking to private companies whose parts have been used in the production. We are assessing further steps we can take in terms of export controls to restrict Iran’s access to technologies used in drones.”

There is no evidence suggesting that any of those companies are running afoul of US sanctions laws and knowingly exporting their technology to be used in the drones. Even with many companies promising increased monitoring controlling where these highly ubiquitous parts end up in the global market is often very difficult for manufacturers experts told CNN. Companies may also not know what they are looking for if the US government has not caught up with and sanctioned the actors buying and selling the products for illicit purposes.

And the Ukrainian intelligence assessment is further proof that despite sanctions Iran is still finding an abundance of commercially available technology. For example the company that built the downed drone Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industries Corporation (HESA) has been under US sanctions since 2008.

A game of whack a mole worth playing

One major issue is that it is far easier for Russian and Iranian officials to set up shell companies to use to purchase the equipment and evade sanctions than it is for Western governments to uncover those front companies which can sometimes take years experts said.

“This is a game of Whack-a-Mole. And the United States government needs to get incredibly good at Whack-a- Mole period” said former Pentagon official Gregory Allen who now serves as Director of the Artificial Intelligence Governance Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “This is a core competency of the US national security establishment – or it had better become one.”

Allen who recently co-authored an investigation into the efficacy of US export controls said ultimately “there is no substitute for robust in-house capabilities in the US government.”

He cautioned that it is not an easy job. The microelectronics industry relies heavily on third party distributors and resellers that are difficult to track and the microchips and other small devices ending up in so many of the Iranian and Russian drones are not only inexpensive and widely available they are also easily hidden.

“Why do smugglers like diamonds?” Allen said. “Because they’re small lightweight and worth a ton of money. And unfortunately computer chips have similar properties.” Success won’t necessarily be measured in stopping 100% of transactions he added but rather in making it more difficult and expensive for bad actors to get what they need.

‘A prolonged attack’ with Iranian drones

The rush to stop Iran from manufacturing the drones is growing more urgent as Russia continues to deploy them across Ukraine with relentless ferocity targeting both civilian areas and key infrastructure. Russia is also preparing to establish its own factory to produce them with Iran’s help according to US officials. On Monday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian forces had shot down more than 80 Iranian drones in just two days.

Zelensky also said that Ukraine had intelligence that Russia “is planning a prolonged attack with Shaheds” betting that it will lead to the “exhaustion of our people our air defense our energy sector.”

A separate probe of Iranian drones downed in Ukraine conducted by the UK-based investigative firm Conflict Armament Research found that 82% of the components had been manufactured by companies based in the US.

Damien Spleeters the Deputy Director of Operations at Conflict Armament Research told CNN that sanctions will only be effective if governments continue to monitor what parts are being used and how they got there.

“Iran and Russia are going to try to go around those sanctions and will try to change their acquisition channels” Spleeters said. “And that’s precisely what we want to focus on: getting in the field and opening up those systems tracing the components and monitoring for changes.”

Experts also told CNN that if the US government wants to beef up enforcement of the sanctions it will need to devote more resources and hire more employees who can be on the ground to track the vendors and resellers of these products.

“Nobody has really thought about investing more in agencies like the Bureau of Industry Security which were really sleepy parts of the DC national security establishment for a few decades” Allen of CSIS said referring to a branch of the Commerce Department that deals primarily with export controls enforcement. “And now suddenly they’re at the forefront of national security technology competition and they’re not being resourced remotely in that vein.”

US companies say they are complying with US law

According to the Ukrainian assessment among the US-made components found in the drone were nearly two dozen parts built by Texas Instruments including microcontrollers voltage regulators and digital signal controllers; a GPS module by Hemisphere GNSS; a microprocessor by NXP USA Inc.; and circuit board components by Analog Devices and Onsemi. Also discovered were components built by International Rectifier – now owned by the German company Infineon – and the Swiss company U-Blox.

CNN sent emailed requests for comment last month to all the companies identified by the Ukrainians. The six that responded emphasized that they condemn any unauthorized use of their products while noting that combating the diversion and misuse of their semiconductors and other microelectronics is an industry-wide challenge that they are working to confront.

“TI is not selling any products into Russia Belarus or Iran” Texas Instruments said in a statement. ” TI complies with applicable laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and partners with law enforcement organizations as necessary and appropriate. Additionally we do not support or condone the use of our products in applications they weren’t designed for.”

Gregor Rodehuser a spokesperson for the German semiconductor manufacturer Infineon told CNN that “our position is very clear: Infineon condemns the Russian aggression against Ukraine. It is a blatant violation of international law and an attack on the values of humanity.” He added that “apart from the direct business it proves difficult to control consecutive sales throughout the entire lifetime of a product. Nevertheless we instruct our customers including distributors to only conduct consecutive sales in line with applicable rules.”

Analog Devices a semiconductor company headquartered in Massachusetts said in a statement that they are intensifying efforts “to identify and counter this activity including implementing enhanced monitoring and audit processes and taking enforcement action where appropriate…to help to reduce unauthorized resale diversion and unintended misuse of our products.”

Jacey Zuniga director of corporate communications for the Austin Texas-based semiconductor company NXP USA said that the company “complies with all applicable export control restrictions and sanctions imposed by the countries in which we operate. Military applications are not a focus area for NXP. As a company we are vehemently opposed to our products being used for human rights violations.”

Phoenix Arizona-based semiconductor manufacturing company Onsemi also said it complies with “applicable export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and does not sell directly or indirectly to Russia Belarus or Iran nor to any foreign military organizations. We cooperate with law enforcement and government agencies as necessary and appropriate to demonstrate how Onsemi conducts business in accordance with all legal requirements and that we hold ourselves to the highest standards of ethical conduct.”

Swiss semiconductor manufacturer U-Blox also said in a statement that its products are for commercial use only and that the use of its products for Russian military equipment “is in clear breach of u-blox’s conditions of sale applicable to customers and distributors alike.”

CES runs January 5-8 this week in Las Vegas NV but CES Media Days are already underway running yesterday and today (January 3-4).

As part of the company’s battery management systems (BMS) portfolio TI has launched its BQ79718-Q1 battery cell monitor IC and BQ79731-Q1 battery pack monitor IC. According to the company these ASIL D-compliant chips are vital to meeting the needs of today’s EV BMS architectures.

In this article we discuss the relationship between battery monitoring accuracy and EV range we examine the key details of TI's new chips and we share insights from our interview with Sam Wong general manager for BMS at TI.

Why Measurement Accuracy Matters

It’s clear that widespread adoption of EVs is tied closely with vehicle range—how far an EV can drive before needing to recharge its battery system. According to TI the most important factor in designing a BMS for an EV is to enable auto manufacturers to know the true range of a vehicle. Doing so requires accurate measurement of the battery systems.

Along those lines TI claims its new automotive battery cell and pack monitors provide the most accurate measurement capability available. TI says its BQ79718-Q1 allows carmakers to achieve high-performance battery cell voltage measurements down to ±1 mV of open circuit voltage (OCV) accuracy.

Putting things into perspective Wong says that TI’s previous generation of cell monitor offered an accuracy of ±3 mV. “That accuracy was very good when the whole industry was using NMC (magnesium nickel cobalt) EV batteries” says Wong. Now the industry is switching to LFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteries. LFP batteries are up to 20% cheaper than NMC batteries mostly because iron is a readily available metal.

New Trade Offs to Consider with LFP Batteries

All that said LFP batteries have a significant drawback says Wong. The discharging curve of an LFP device is very flat compared to an NMC battery. As shown in the table in the image below with ±10 mV accuracy in the MMC battery pack you have to budget for a ±6 mile difference in EV range.

With an OCV measurement accuracy of ±1 mV the BQ79718-Q1 enables greater effective range for EVs. Image used courtesy of Texas Instruments (Click image to enlarge)

“At that same ±10 mV accuracy applied to an LFP battery pack the differential translates to ±78 miles” says Wong. “Considering that an average EV’s range is 300 that’s a good chunk of mileage paranoia that drivers have to suffer.”

With TI’s new BQ79718-Q1’s accuracy of ±1 mV drivers only have to face a ±15 mile uncertainty when it comes to knowing when their battery is truly in danger of running out of charge says Wong.

“We all drive cars and even in a gasoline-powered car situation we typically won't leave 5% in the gas tank before going to the gas station. So this ±15 miles gives a similar user experience for EV drivers because that translates to 5% of 300 miles.”

Battery Pack Monitor for BJB Systems

TI’s other new device the BQ79731-Q1 can be used to measure divided down high voltage nodes in a battery system. The device embeds two current sense paths. It can measure voltage across fuse contactors and check isolation voltage in battery junction box (BJB) systems.

The BQ79731-Q1 IC allows measurement of the battery pack current down to 0.05% of accuracy. Used together the two chips provide what TI claims is the clearest picture possible to measure accurate state of charge but also the state of health at the individual cell and pack level.

The BQ79731-Q1 boasts battery pack current measurement with an accuracy of 0.05%. Image used courtesy of Texas Instruments

Meanwhile the devices enable voltage and current synchronization at 64 µs. According to TI this means the EV’s BMS can do instantaneous monitoring of battery pack power. This enables a real-time snapshot of battery health says TI.

Because of this level of synchronization BMS designs can perform electrochemical impedance spectroscopy which can extract info on a battery cell’s core temperature battery aging and the battery’s state of charge. More information is available on the datasheets for the BQ79718-Q1 and BQ79731-Q1.

Eval Boards and IC Packaging Specs

Automotive engineers can evaluate the battery cell monitor using TI’s BQ79718-Q1 evaluation module (BQ79718EVM-049). The 18-channel BQ79718-Q1 is provided in a tiny 10 mm × 10 mm 64-pin thermally enhanced thin quad flat package (HTQFP).

The battery pack monitor BQ79731-Q1 also has an evaluation module (BQ79731Q1EVM-060). The BQ79731-Q1 comes in a 7 mm × 7 mm 48-pin thermally enhanced thin quad flat package (HTQFP). All products featured for BMS are available now.

The Road Toward Greater Confidence in EVs

While EVs are by no means a new phenomenon there are many hurdles that could slow their adoption. Technology changes such as adoption of new battery chemistries like LFPs come with new tradeoffs. But those tradeoffs can be mitigated by smart EV BMS design choices. These new battery monitoring ICs perhaps represent an example of just such solutions.

At CES this week TI is demonstrating its BMS technology featuring its new BQ79718-Q1 and BQ79731-Q1 devices. If you're at the show you can visit them at the North Hall N115 meeting room at the Las Vegas Convention Center. Demo videos are expected to be posted today on TI’s CES 2023 page.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYXJzdGVjaG5pY2EuY29tL2NhcnMvMjAyMy8wMS9hLW5ldy1iYXR0ZXJ5LW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtc3lzdGVtLWNvdWxkLWJvb3N0LWV2LXJhbmdlLWJ5LTIwLXBlcmNlbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A new battery management system could boost EV range by 20 percent,"One of the more exciting developments to come to electric vehicles over the past few years has been the development of lithium-iron phosphate cells as an alternative to more traditional lithium-ion chemistries that use minerals like nickel manganese and cobalt. Now a new battery management system or BMS could mean much more accurate range predictions for EVs with these batteries.

Why LFP?

LiFePO4 or LFP batteries were mostly the province of Chinese EV makers until last year thanks to a series of exclusive patent licenses signed with the US and Canadian researchers who first developed the technology. But those patents are expiring and non-Chinese automakers are beginning to adopt LFP batteries.

LFP cells dislike very cold weather more than an equivalent NMC or nickel-cobalt aluminum cell and they also store less energy. But that last bit might in fact be an advantage to this chemistry—there's no danger that an LFP pack will combust or explode in a crash so there's much less need to surround the pack with a heavy protective shell.

That in turn means that while the cells are less energy-dense energy density at the pack level actually increases because more of the volume is given over to battery cells instead of crash structures. LFP batteries also have longer useful lifetimes than NMC or NCA packs. LFP cells were about 20 percent cheaper per kWh than NMC cells in 2022.

It's little wonder then that Tesla switched to LFP cells for many cars in 2021 and that Ford is adding LFP cells to the Mustang Mach-E this year and the F-150 Lightning pickup truck in 2024.

More accurate measurements mean more accurate range prediction

To get the full benefit from LFP battery chemistry Texas Instruments has developed a new BMS (for both the battery packs and cells) that's much more sensitive than existing systems. ""In our previous generation we're able to go down to 3.5 millivolts and that is state of the art. Now in this latest generation we're about three and a half times better—1 millivolt"" explained Sam Wong who works on BMSes at TI.

That's necessary because of the very flat discharge curve of LFP cells. ""It'll start from 4 volts it'll go down it'll stay very flat"" explained Mark Ng manager of marketing for EV powertrains at TI. ""When you're at 70 percent charge to 30 percent charge in that region [the discharge curve] stays flat and that's where you need this 1-millivolt accuracy. Because if I'm not accurate I have no clue whether I'm [at] 70 percent charge or 40 percent charge"" Ng told me.

That inaccuracy could be as much as 63 miles (100 km) for a 300-mile (483-km) EV compared to a BMS with only 10-mV accuracy. The more accurate BMSes also benefit NMC or NCA chemistries although to a much lesser degree—there's an improvement in the margin of error from about six miles for a 300-mile EV down to about half a mile.

There's also a functional safety benefit to the new BMSes which meet the toughest ASIL-D automotive safety standard. ""With this device we're able to measure the voltage twice using the redundancy inside the chip to tell the system that there's something wrong if it doesn't agree with each other. It's almost like a voting system—'I'm saying this battery is 4 volts and the other side is saying 3 volts""—something must be wrong with [the battery]"" Ng explained.

Beyond that the new BMSes are able to cope with both 400 V and 800 V packs and can be specified wirelessly—something General Motors has already adopted for its family of Ultium packs using an earlier iteration of TI's tech—which reduces the need for copper wiring in the packs which in turn reduces both cost and weight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGVjdHJvbmljZGVzaWduLmNvbS90b29scy9sZWFybmluZy1yZXNvdXJjZXMvd2hpdGVwYXBlci8yMTI1NjAwNC90ZXhhcy1pbnN0cnVtZW50cy10aGUtY29ubmVjdGVkLXdvcmxkLW1hcmNoZXMtdG8tdGhlLWJlYXQtb2YtYmF3LXRlY2hub2xvZ3nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Connected World Marches to the Beat of BAW Technology,". This material can convert electrical energy to mechanical-acoustical energy producing reliable oscillations that enable a high-frequency clock output. A BAW resonator enables Texas Instruments’ CC2652RB SimpleLink MCU to operate without an external crystal oscillator.

The MCU’s integrated resonator reduces its footprint and minimizes bill-of-materials (BOM) costs without compromising latency and it offers ±40-ppm frequency stability across the full operating-temperature and operating-voltage ranges. In addition the 2.4-GHz multiprotocol MCU offers ultra-low jitter and phase noise to meet the clock requirements of various wireless-communication standards.

TI also integrates BAW technology into its LMK6C low-jitter high-performance fixed-frequency oscillator. It delivers enhanced jitter performance and improved reliability in terms of vibration shock temperature stability and reliability.

On top of that the technology finds use in TI’s LMK05318 high-performance network synchronizer clock device which provides jitter cleaning clock generation and advanced clock monitoring to meet the timing requirements of communications-infrastructure and industrial applications. The ultra-low jitter and high power-supply noise rejection (PSNR) of the device can reduce bit error rates (BERs) in the high-speed serial links that traverse the connected world.

BAW vs. Quartz

The new BAW technology competes with the venerable quartz-crystal oscillator which has dominated the timing reference market for more than a century. But BAW offers significant advantages: It consumes less power permits smaller system designs and simplifies system integration while offering similar or better performance than quartz.

A review of quartz resonators helps illustrate some of their drawbacks in comparison with BAW implementations. Figure 2 illustrates one way of implementing a quartz oscillator—combining a quartz crystal oscillating circuit and output driver.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9ydHJlbmQuY29tL2V2ZW50cy90ZXhhcy1pbnN0cnVtZW50cy1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlLWJhdHRlcnktbWFuYWdlbWVudC1yYW5nZS1jZXMtMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gaining Range by Measuring Battery State-of-Charge More Accurately,"Batteries are expensive scary things. If we're not worried about them catching fire we're worried about them losing sufficient capacity and range to render our electric vehicle both unusable and unsalable. A good battery management system (BMS) is a great defender against either disaster and Texas Instruments has just introduced new cell and pack monitors that up the standard of BMS accuracy and precision enough to potentially boost an EV's real-time remaining range figures—even when the battery is new.

How Battery Management Works

It's the battery management system's job to continuously monitor a battery's state of charge and state of health. Neither can be measured directly; both must be calculated or inferred from other measurements. Determining state of charge (which portends range) requires measurement of the battery's voltage current impedance temperature capacity and recent charging/discharging profile. State of health is similarly determined based on historic consideration of most of the above factors plus the number nature of the charge and discharge cycles it has survived. Sensors at the cell and pack level measure the above parameters.

TI's Better BMS Mousetrap

TI's new BQ79718-Q1 cell-monitoring system is capable of measuring battery voltage down to 1 millivolt accuracy (its predecessor was +/- 3.5mV while some others deviate by as much as 10mV) while the BQ79731-Q1 pack-monitoring system can measure battery pack current down to 0.05 percent accuracy another big improvement over current state-of-the-art BMS technology. Add to that voltage-current synchronization down to 64 microseconds and the accuracy of the calculated instantaneous charging or discharging power levels is unprecedented allowing a far more accurate real-time snapshot of battery health.

How Much Range Can This Gain?

The answer to that question depends quite heavily on what lithium-ion battery chemistry is being monitored. Most fancy high-end electric cars in the U.S. use nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries because of their higher energy density. With these a typical 300-mile pack's range could vary by 6 miles at a voltage accuracy of 10mV which drops to just 0.5 mile with TI's 1mV accuracy. Big deal right?

But the lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) chemistry that is vastly cheaper (and often more ethically sourced) demonstrates a much flatter voltage curve as it discharges meaning that small variations in measured voltage can result in drastically different range estimates. To wit: A 300-mile LFP battery's range can be off by as much as 78 miles with a 10mV miscalculation. This drops to just 15 miles with accuracy of 1mV. So the TI technology is also an enabler of less-expensive LFP battery technology.

How Much and How Soon?

This technology is being introduced at CES 2023 but Texas Instruments is offering development and evaluation modules for testing the cell and pack monitors for $399 and $199 respectively with the individual monitors each priced at $8.39 each for 1000. So look for them to hit volume production after a few years of development priced way below those figures."

Biological experiments rely heavily on the pH of buffers and samples. A small shift in the pH indicates a change in the acidity but also adds an unaccounted variable to the data obtained. When reagents are prepared by different members of the lab or are stored for longer periods of time pH values tend to drift. As such having standard operating procedures (SOPs) specifically related to pH measurements upholds the quality of the experiments across the entire lab over many years of research projects. It is vital scientists use up-to-date technology and the latest tools combined with this comprehensive pH measurement SOP for increased reliability.

While many labs have a ‘pH protocol’ placed next to pH meters creating a thorough SOP takes a slightly different approach. It considers both the methodology of conducting accurate pH measurements as well as troubleshooting in different scenarios.

In this exclusive SelectScience® interview we speak with industry veteran Ricki Hartwell Senior Global Product Manager at Thermo Fisher Scientific who brings two decades of experience resolving common and uncommon pH pain points and explains how to make pH measurements more reliable. Plus Hartwell has also contributed to designing novel pH meters for the scientific market.

SOPs are commonly seen in highly regulated biopharma labs and are now becoming more commonplace in academic labs in an effort to achieve data and process reproducibility. “SOPs ensure that each person in the lab whether they're a lab manager a technician or an operator are all using the exact same techniques for pH calibration and measurement” says Hartwell. “This is done so that all the different parameters that could affect the measurement are kept standardized to ensure that the reported results are consistent accurate and precise.”

Ideally what should a pH measurement SOP contain?

“When labs develop SOPs for pH we recommend that the science behind the measurement is fully explored and understood so that the SOP addresses all the different factors that can negatively or positively affect the result obtained” shares Hartwell.

pH measurements are often brushed off as a simple and routine task even though they can have a significant impact on the lab’s overall data and can significantly impact on experimental repeatability. An SOP therefore needs to cover the various aspects of conducting a pH measurement in order to make pH measurements more reliable. Hartwell continues: “There are a lot of different factors that influence pH values. For example knowing whether the electrode is compatible with the sample calibrating the pH meter and electrode with the correct pH buffers making sure the sample value is bracketed with at least two buffers on either side understanding what an average slope value means and what it should be for a good calibration to name a few.”

In general labs should aim to include the following in their pH measurement SOP:

“Proper electrode calibration is essential for a good measurement. Yet a lot of people underestimate the importance of calibration” notes Hartwell. “If electrodes aren’t properly calibrated all of the results obtained after that could be questioned. Prioritizing electrode calibration ensures that the results reported are going to be accurate and believable and any experiments performed thereafter are valid.”

Common challenges that scientists face with pH measurements

“A lot of scientists may not fully understand why they're taking a pH measurement or what's really happening when they take a measurement” says Hartwell summarizing 20 years of experience helping customers resolve pH issues. “Often a pH electrode might be old or nearing the end of its lifetime and no longer reliable but is still producing pH results. In this instance the problems faced with pH measurements are a direct result of the electrode’s condition and not the buffer preparation process.”

Our goal at Thermo Fisher Scientific is to make it as easy as possible for a scientist to use a pH meter during a busy day. Ricki Hartwell

If pH measurements appear unstable a good rule of thumb would be to clean the electrode and calibrate it. If this issue persists it may be time for a replacement. When in doubt reach out to customer support staff to troubleshoot and get recommendations on the next step. Hartwell continues: “When things are working well scientists rarely need our support. But when things go wrong it can cause delays for the entire research team. We have a technical support department accessible via phone or email that can walk you through any problem and offer as much or as little support as the situation demands.”

Key pH bench meter features to consider when purchasing or upgrading

Given that pH measurements often fall at the beginning of a long experimental method simplicity and ease-of-use are by far are the most desired features. “Our goal at Thermo Fisher Scientific is to make it as easy as possible for a scientist to use a pH meter during a busy day and not get confused or worried about what's going on” says Hartwell. “We design our pH meters by continuously testing them with actual customers in the field taking their feedback and incorporating that into the end product.”

The Orion Lab Star pH bench meter was created in much the same way – to simplify operations for the scientist improve efficiency and make pH measurements more reliable. Each feature has been meticulously designed with the scientist’s experience in mind. The features highlighted below would qualify as a good-to-have list so that pH measurements remain hassle-free in the long run:





Budget-friendly: Starter pH meters may fit the budget but they also need to perform a handful of basic functions without requiring too many add-ons. “We pack a lot of features and functions into a budget-friendly price” says Hartwell describing the Orion Lab Star pH bench meter. Small footprint: Lab space comes at a premium. Choose pH meters that have a smaller footprint to save valuable bench space. Easy-to-read display: It should be easy to view results on the pH meter screen even with fatigued eyes. Hartwell says “Our pH meter offers a large 5-inch display with backlight so if you're looking at measurements eight hours a day you wouldn’t be squinting to read them.” Additionally helpful icons appearing on the screen can help the user stay on track or make quick fixes during measurements or calibration. Date- and time-stamped logs: Paper-based record-keeping of pH measurements may not be reliable or readily accessible during data audits. Having built-in data logging features can offer data traceability. “The Orion Lab Star pH meter saves date- and time-stamped calibration logs and data logs internally so customers can keep a record of all measurements for GLP or GMP compliance purposes” notes Hartwell. Options for both printed and electronic data records: Scientists shouldn’t have to choose between printing out data or exporting it electronically – they should be able to do either based on individual preferences.

Operating a pH meter may be a routine task in most labs; however it should also be a seamless part of working in a lab requiring minimal effort and helping scientists conduct robust and efficient experiments. To help achieve this detailed documentation of the process through a solid pH measurement SOP can help to further streamline the process so that scientists can spend more time on what matters most in the lab.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTg2LTAyMi0wNTU1OS0z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cas12a2 elicits abortive infection through RNA-triggered destruction of dsDNA,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='idp.nature.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /authorize?response_type=cookie&client_id=grover&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-022-05559-3 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2989210>, 'Connection to idp.nature.com timed out.

The ASX share market is full of interesting businesses. But there are some compelling companies listed elsewhere around the world. We can get access to those with ASX exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Some ETFs like the Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF (ASX: VAS) track an index with businesses that are spread across a variety of sectors such as the S&P/ASX 300 Index (ASX: XKO).

But there are a growing number of ETFs that provide investors with access to a specific industry or theme.

A report by Sharesies has identified which ETFs investors have been buying. While the Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF was the most popular I'm going to outline the next two most popular ETFs that were bought in November 2022 on the Sharesies platform.

VanEck Global Clean Energy ETF (ASX: CLNE)

The purpose of the ETF is to give investors exposure to 30 of the largest companies involved in ""clean energy production and associated technology and equipment globally"" according to VanEck. These businesses are from both 'developed' and 'developing' markets.

There are four main areas that this ASX ETF is invested in – independent power producers and energy traders (33% of the portfolio) electrical equipment (29.3%) semiconductors and semiconductor equipment (24.8%) and electric utilities (12.9%).

In terms of geographic weighting the US is the biggest allocation with 41% but many countries have a weighting of more than 2.5%: Spain (10%) China (9.2%) Israel (7.5%) New Zealand (6.6%) Denmark (5.3%) Canada (4.6%) Japan (4.2%) Brazil (2.9%) and Austria (2.6%).

At the end of November 2022 these were the ten biggest positions in the portfolio: Solaredge Technologies Vestas Wind Systems Sunrun First Solar Enphase Energy EDP Renovaveis Bloom Energy Xinyi Solar Chubu Electric Power and Brookfield Renewable. Those positions make up around 48% of the total portfolio.

This ASX ETF comes with an annual management fee of around 0.65%.

BetaShares Climate Change Innovation ETF (ASX: ERTH)

This investment provides a more diversified exposure to the fight against climate change. It's invested in up to 100 global companies that make at least 50% of their revenue from ""products and services that help to address climate change and other environmental problems through the reduction or avoidance of CO2 emissions"".

Sectors covered within the ETF include clean energy providers along with companies tackling ""green transport waste management sustainable product development and improved energy efficiency and storage"".

Looking at the allocations green energy gets the biggest allocation with 23.8% of the portfolio followed by 'enabling solutions' (21.9%) green transportation (21.3%) sustainable products (21.1%) and water and waste improvements (11.9%).

The portfolio is a bit more US-focused than the first one I outlined with a weighting of 53.9% to the United States. Other weightings of more than 2% include China (8.6%) South Korea (6.2%) Denmark (5.1%) France (4.4%) Japan (3.5%) Spain (2.5%) Sweden (2.3%) and Germany (2.1%).

The top holdings of this ASX ETF look very different from the VanEck one. Here are the biggest 10 positions: Trane Technologies Enphase Energy Eaton Vestas Wind Systems American Water Works Ecolab Samsung Cie De Saint-Gobain East Japan Railway and BYD.

This ETF comes with an annual management fee of 0.65%.",,,,,,,,,

Insurance companies are meant to protect against calamity in our society and the worsening of climate change caused by burning fossil fuels is certainly a calamity.

What are examples of the type of proposed projects that the insurance industry should be avoiding? To start it should not be insuring new drilling in Alaska’s arctic.

The coastal plain of Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is teeming with life from migratory birds to thousands of caribou to a struggling population of polar bears who are fighting for survival against climate change. The coastal plain is sacred to the Gwich’in who call it “Iizhik Gwats’an Gwandaii Goodlit” (The Sacred Place Where Life Begins). After pushing for decades to be allowed to drill oil companies got one step closer in 2017 with the passage of the Tax Act which authorized the coastal plain oil and gas program. But following a failed lease sale in 2021 four oil companies have actually pulled out of the refuge making us question whether there’s actually any interest in drilling there at all. Committing to deny insurance for coastal plain drilling should be an easy commitment to make. In fact 17 international insurers have already committed not to insure drilling in the refuge.

To the west of the refuge ConocoPhillips Alaska’s largest crude oil producer has proposed the Willow Project. If allowed to move forward it will be the single largest oil extraction project on U.S. federal land. The rising temperatures associated with climate change have made fossil fuel extraction more difficult and costly due to melting permafrost. The financial losses that oil companies would incur should discourage drilling in the arctic. However ConocoPhillips plans to refreeze the tundra using “chillers” and then proceed to drill it for oil. The proposed 30 years of oil drilling from the Willow Project would extract 500 million barrels of petroleum from this snowy sanctuary. The project would single-handedly release annual emissions equivalent to more than 70 new coal fired power plants operating in a given year.

If shareholders for these three companies vote in favor of Green Century’s resolution they will be making it that much harder for oil companies including ConocoPhillips to move forward with their plans to drill in the arctic. That will be good news for the caribou birds polar bears and Indigenous peoples in the arctic and good news for the entire planet; we don’t need more oil drilling. And you can’t drill for oil without insurance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvNS13YXlzLXRvLW1ha2UtdHJhdmVsLW1vcmUtbWVhbmluZ2Z1bC1pbi0yMDIz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 ways to make travel more meaningful in 2023,"With 2022’s travel woes in the rearview mirror the year ahead beckons with the prospect of rediscovering the world’s wonders. “We are seeing travel patterns and habits normalize to pre-pandemic times a good sign of what is to come in 2023” says Tiffany Townsend NYC & Company’s executive vice president of global communications. “People are keen to get out there and seize the opportunity to travel whether they’re returning to a beloved spot or finally visiting their dream destination.”

From acknowledging new perspectives on history to following a thrilling on-screen story into the real world these five New Year’s resolutions can help make your travels more meaningful.

Blaze a trail

This year resolve to get out on a path that reveals a lesser known destination or that brings a fresh perspective to a beloved favorite. The new 250-mile Trans Bhutan Trail lures trekkers from this enchanting country’s famed Himalayan peaks to outlying regions with its dense forests and ancient fortresses. Other recently created trails span Armenia; circumnavigate Prince Edward Island in Canada; and explore medieval Alpine history and culture around Zermatt Switzerland.

Follow your passion

Is the future of travel passion-based? Either way following your latest obsession can deepen a connection to a place—whether it’s to Sicily after binging White Lotus or Puerto Rico to chase chupacabras. In 2023 soccer fans can head to Australia and New Zealand for the FIFA Women’s World Cup matches. Disney enthusiasts will want to check out the company’s 100th anniversary celebrations (and get their hands on the commemorative swag) at parks around the world. Baseball lovers will flock once again to places like Phoenix for spring training. Anime and comic superfans can geek out at the Anime Expo in California and the ever popular New York Comic Con.

Support local ecosystems

You can help preserve the landscapes and wildlife you love by supporting places that leverage tourism to protect them. Responsible tourism helps rewilding efforts in Scotland contributes to small-town survival in Slovenia and elevates a new kind of community-based safari in Botswana. You can also encourage more inclusive nature experiences with outfitters that welcome diverse groups or differently abled travelers.

(Go beyond the beach at these inclusive coastal destinations.)

Grow your roots

It’s never been easier to travel in search of family history and heritage. When the International African American Museum opens in Charleston South Carolina on January 21 visitors can access a database of millions of genealogical records at its Center for Family History. Ghana continues to welcome Black travelers to reforge ancestral links to West Africa. River cruise lines are helping travelers learn more about their European connections by partnering with ancestry testing services. Whether the exploration of roots has fueled the rise in multi-generational travel or vice versa this travel trend is a great way to bring families together.

(In Charleston Black history is being told through a new lens.)

Learn something new

There are more opportunities than ever for travelers to add to their skill set while making authentic cultural connections. Learn traditional jewelry-making alongside a Polynesian family in Bora Bora or perfect your snowshoeing technique along a historic route in Japan once traveled by feudal lords and samurai warriors. Pitch in to get dinner on the table in Guatemala or trace how traditional foods make its way from farm to plate on an agritourism stay in Tennessee. Or explore mountainside gardens while learning about the health benefits of Rastafarian-inspired organic cooking in St. Lucia. With hands-on experiences like these trips remain memorable long after they have ended.

During his previous travels he spent too much time wandering around offsite facilities or spent a lot of money to park closer at specific airport garages.

But instead of just complaining about the painful parking experience Adeyemi decided to do something about it.

He recently launched Varkn to help others improve the process of getting in and out of the airport. As the name suggests the platform is an affordable on-demand combined valet and parking option designed specifically for airports.

After putting in their flight information a traveler is matched with a driver who is in charge of receiving and returning their car directly at the terminal. The platform keeps track of any delays or cancellations that might occur to ensure a car arrives right on time once a traveler lands.

To date most of Varkn’s customers have been families that need a little extra time travel or business consultants in a rush to catch a flight. “Especially when you have kids it is difficult to take shuttle buses with baggage and strollers” added Adeyemi.

The ultimate goal Adeyemi said is to build out an Uber-like mobile app for busy travel customers and become a “valet-as-a-service” platform across hospitality travel and restaurant industries. That can be particularly beneficial for valet drivers that rely on tips and from each customer.

Taking Off In Atlanta

Adeyemi previously lived in Delaware where he worked at the University of Delaware and launched his first startup in the wearable technology space.

He moved South after being selected for Techstars Atlanta’s 2022 cohort.“I needed the right mentorship. I needed funding. And I needed connections” Adeyemi said when asked about why joining Techstars was an important move for Varkn.

He said going through the Techstars program helped him better understand his MVP (minimum viable product) and what it takes to do an original customer trial.

The team is currently operating at Atlanta’s Hartsfield Jackson International Airport for jetsetters traveling in 2023.

Those who want to learn more about Adeyemi’s business plan can rewatch his recent Techstars Atlanta pitch here:

Atlanta’s TravelTech Scene

It’s no surprise Atlanta boasts several emerging startups in the travel sector. Hartsfield continues to be the busiest airport in the world and plays host to 275000 passengers each day.

Alongside Varkn startups working inside and near the Atlanta airport include Travelsist (a gig-based app for assisting travelers inside terminals) UnDelay (a flight disruption analysis platform) and Rush The Line (think an Uber Eats option delivered right to your gate).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc3VyYW5jZWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wMS8wNC83MDE0ODIuaHRt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Insurance Journal's Top Cyber Stories of 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc3VyYW5jZWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wMS8wNC83MDE0ODIuaHRt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2EBE440>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

In another move to benefit the construction industry Trimble acquired Ryvit. Launched in 2016 Ryvit is an integration platform-as-a-service provider for the construction industry.

Ryvit’s technology builds connections between commonly used applications and data sources allowing information sharing both within and across organizations. This data sharing helps project teams use the right information to make the right decisions at the right time.

“The construction industry today is stymied by disparate data and technology solutions that don’t connect with one another making it difficult to share information across departments and amongst project teams” said Pete Large senior vice president Trimble Construction sector. “Ryvit provides a platform for software solution providers and construction stakeholders to rapidly build and deploy workflows enabling the automatic flow of critical information across organizations and teams in real time. At Trimble we believe that openness and interoperability are imperative to the future of the construction industry and are excited to extend Ryvit’s capabilities to more customers applications and partners as we move the construction industry forward.”

Ryvit helps customers seamlessly integrate their data and coordinate their workflows for greater project visibility because it processes millions of records between construction technology partners daily. All current Ryvit integrations allow for an open extensible ecosystem. They will continue to be supported as part of Trimble Construction One. Rybit’s primary offerings will undergo a rebrand to Data Xchange and App Xchange.

Data Xchange will allow end users to configure and manage their data flows between connected systems. App Xchange serves as the developer’s command center for connecting systems building pre-configured dataflows and onboarding new customers.

“Ryvit has been relentlessly focused on transforming the construction industry into a more productive and profitable industry powered by data” said Tom Stemm chief executive officer of Ryvit. ""Over the past seven years we’ve done this by building a platform that connects data between some of the industry’s largest technology providers to improve efficiency and streamline workflows for construction. Trimble is similarly focused on becoming an industry-leading open platform provider so this acquisition is a perfect match for both companies who share a similar mission and vision for the industries we serve.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL25ldy15b3JrL25vcnRoZm9yay9hZnRlci00MC15ZWFycy1sb25nLWlzbGFuZC13b21hbi1sb3Nlcy1mb3JldmVyLWxvdmUtaS13YXNudC1yZWFkedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After 40 Years Long Island Woman Loses Forever Love: 'I Wasn't Ready',"Obituaries After 40 Years Long Island Woman Loses Forever Love: 'I Wasn't Ready' ""I don't know what I'm going to do without her."" When Anne Trimble died at 70 she left behind her devastated love of 40 years.

NORTH FORK NY — Back in 2014 Anne Trimble owner of Trimble's of Corchaug Nursery in Cutchogue welcomed girls from the Butterfly Effect Project giving a presentation on how to grow and pot plants and also explaining photosynthesis and the wonders of nature.

The girls who ranged in age from 5 to 14 many of whom had never had a garden or experienced the feeling of warm soil on their hands took home plants for their moms for Mother's Day. As she gently knelt behind each child Trimble shared tips not just for gardening but for life — tips about patience and the importance of nurturing of tending carefully to the things you love. The girls watched enchanted as Trimble released a butterfly into the sky symbolizing the own wings they were given to explore the flowers and plants and the inherent joy of nature that day.

When Trimble died Dec. 27 at 70 she left behind a devastated North Fork community. Trimble who gave back quietly and with kindness for decades was loved beyond measure by her neighbors customers friends and community.

But no one loved Trimble more than her wife Nancy Leskody with whom she shared a lifetime that spanned four decades and will undoubtedly shine on through eternity.

Speaking with Patch Leskody described the insidious cancer that stole her forever love. ""It was very fast"" she said. In late August Trimble began experiencing pain and thought she had shingles since she'd had them before Leskody said. Because she also had rheumatoid arthritis Trimble saw her normal physician who ordered chest X-rays and a sonogram.

The news that followed was agonizing ""He told us she had cancer"" Leskody said. The cancer was in her lungs on her spine; there were lesions on her brain. ""It was awful — just awful"" Leskody said.

Despite the grim diagnosis there was hope at first. Trimble underwent radiation and chemotherapy for weeks — but her condition worsened. ""She couldn't walk couldn't talk very well"" Leskody said. After Trimble's third chemotherapy she was suffering so Leskody called 911 and brought her to the hospital. From there the outlook became more bleak. ""She got COVID and then she got pneumonia"" Leskody said. ""It just didn't stop. It was one thing after another."" Trimble and Leskody thought the next step was rehab — and then they heard the words they never wanted to believe. ""I hadn't wanted to go down that dark road"" Leskody said. ""I thought maybe things would get better in rehab. But she was just too weak. And we were told that it was time for hospice care.""

The hospice workers cared for Trimble for about two weeks. ""Then on December 27 she just couldn't move at all she couldn't walk she couldn't talk. It was horrible."" During her last hours Trimble was surrounded by her relatives and many many friends. ""A lot of people were here and we were just trying to hang with her to talk to her — she couldn't talk but she could still hear. And so we were all talking and she was just napping and then she just stopped breathing. It was very peaceful."" Anne Trimble with Nancy Leskody and their relatives. / Courtesy Nancy Leskody But for Leskody the fog of grief was heavy. ""I wasn't ready at all"" she said. ""I thought I was really. But I wasn't ready."" The hospice staff had warned Leskody that it wouldn't be long that Trimble did not have much time. ""They told me to stay with her and thank God I was there when she died"" she said. She is grateful that so many people were together in their home when she lost her love. ""It was so much easier to be with people with our family than alone"" she said.

Losing her life's partner has been an unthinkable tragedy Leskody said. ""She made me a better person"" she said. ""I just miss her so much."" She added: ""I have to say I wasn't always the easiest person to get along with. But she was always so forgiving to me. She always told me 'It's all right to feel the way you feel.' She always calmed me down and made me feel so much love from her."" Her voice breaking Leskody said: ""I just don’t know what I’m going to do without her. We’ve been together for so long. We were together more than 40 years."" Although they'd shared a lifetime they were only married recently on October 23. Although they'd been planning the marriage for some time they needed to work out details. ""Finally I said to her 'I really want to do this. I don't want you to leave — and we haven't done this. Because this needs to be a part of our relationship. We've been together for so long it's not right not to be married.""

They shared a beautiful service with just friends in their living room. Although she wasn't feeling well that day Trimble got up experienced the wedding both had waited so long for. Looking back on their relationship Leskody remembered Trimble's love of children her innate kindness. ""Everywhere we went she'd strike up a conversation with people. We always had such a good time talking to people we didn't even know. She just helped spread the love and helped me to spread the love too."" Courtesy Nancy Leskody The couple enjoyed trips to Mexico Switzerland England and upstate. ""We haven’t been without each other for a day. We were always together"" Leskody said. ""It’s really hard lately.""

Losing her own mother who died at 101 was difficult because they were very close Leskody said. ""But this is 500 times worse."" Trimble who grew up in Pascoag Rhode Island graduated with a degree in horticulture from the University of Rhode Island; her first job was working at the children's garden at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden followed by a position at Tavern on the Green Leskody said; she was the one who planted hundreds of white impatiens around the iconic Central Park eatery. When the two met Leskody had been working as a waitress and Trimble had a small company. ""We just clicked right away"" she said. ""She was just an amazing person. I had never met a person so kind as she was before in my life. When I met her things were so much more beautiful."" Trimble Leskody said changed her forever.

""She gave me hope to have a different life. I was a waitress in a dead-end job and not doing very well. But she turned me on to plants. I really love plants. She told me 'We can do this. We can have a business together.'"" One day the two were traveling out to see Leskody's mother in Cutchogue and they passed the former Parisi's Nursery on Main Road in Cutchogue; there was a greenhouse and together they envisioned the future. They found partners and borrowed from their parents and bought the nursery in 1991. ""It was more than we could afford by ourselves back then"" Leskody said. ""We started working at Trimble's; it was just the two of us in the beginning. I stayed at nursery and Anne went out and did landscaping. We just kept plugging along."" Throughout her life Trimble was passionate about giving a voice to the voiceless speaking out for the immigrant community who she said were critical to the North Fork canvas at a ""Synergy"" meeting in Greenport in 2017. In business today for 32 years they've created an iconic North Fork destination for those hoping to brighten their lives with flowers and plants. ""Our accountant says we are very good businesswomen"" Leskody said.

Anne Trimble. / Courtesy Nancy Leskody The two share North Fork values through and through. ""We do business with people on a handshake"" Leskody said. ""We say 'Send us a bill' and we pay it."" They've also found great joy in giving back in donating to local causes and school events. ""It wasn't always for the other people it was for us too"" Leskody said. ""We wanted to see the community look well and be healthy — plants help the community to be healthy. In order to be part of the community you have to give back. It gave us pleasure."" And in her darkest hour it is that same community that has wrapped Leskody in warmth and love giving her the strength to face the unimaginable. ""Neighbors have been leaving food. Customers have been texting calling. We live in a wonderful community"" she said. ""Without this community — our neighbors family and friends — I don't think I could have gotten through this."" Services for Anne Trimble will be held at the DeFriest-Gratten Funeral Home located at 13805 Main Road in Mattituck on January 7 from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.

NSV Development is managing the project. Nicholas Schnittker | Times

NSV Development will build 24 townhomes next to Truist Bank’s downtown Wilson office building. Work on the site is expected to start in the first quarter of 2023.

“We recently completed the final phases of design for both the site layout and the townhome units” said Andrew Holton principal at NSV.







Holton said vertical construction will begin shortly after the site work begins and work should be completed roughly a year after that. NSV Development is the same company working on the Centro mixed-use project on the former BB&T towers site.

The Moss Street Townhomes will be sandwiched between Kenan and Broad streets in what is now a gravel lot.

A site plan submitted to the city of Wilson’s planning department by Bartlett Engineering & Surveying shows 24 townhomes split into two blocks of four one block of seven and one block of nine.

The site is roughly rectangular with a corner carved out for the historic home at the corner of Moss and Broad streets that previously housed the Wilson Visitors Center.

The city of Wilson currently owns the property. Rebecca Agner the city’s communications and marketing director said the land will be conveyed to NSV soon.

A portion of the parcel used to be part of the Paul V. Berry Hickory Grove Park which was removed to make way for the new Truist office at the corner of Pine and Barnes streets. The city retained the lot next to Truist for future development with NSV in the Pine Street redevelopment project which the Wilson City Council approved in February 2020.

The park was originally part of the land swap between the city and BB&T that paved the way for development at the former BB&T towers site.

In September 2018 the council unanimously voted to return Paul V. Berry’s $75000 donation for the park’s naming rights. Since Berry is deceased the money went to his estate.

The park featured commemorative pavers that were collected prior to the park’s removal and reinstalled two years later at the corner of Kenan and Pine streets in downtown Wilson.

These are the top 10 banks in the US by assets with key insights as to how they got there where they plan to go in the future and how smaller banks can stand out in a competitive industry.

1. JPMorgan Chase – $3.31 Trillion

By targeting digitally-savvy consumers and introducing artificial intelligence (AI) to its offerings JPMorgan Chase has been able to outperform its competitors. JPMorgan is playing the long-game by acquiring millennials through digital channels—in hopes of eventually converting them to higher-value customers.

Additionally JPMorgan is investing heavily in banking technology and had the biggest tech budget of all banks in 2019 with $11.4 billion. A key focus of these funds is identifying use cases to implement AI techniques—such as leveraging voice assistants to enable investment banking clients to access analyst reports and stock exchange information.

In addition to keeping tabs on direct competitors JP Morgan is also keeping tabs on how companies in other sectors are marketing to clients. “We look across all industries—it may be totally unrelated to financial services” says Allison Beer. “When we find some delightful customer experience I’ll screenshot it on my phone and show it to my team as inspiration” adds Beer.

2. Bank of America – $2.41 Trillion

Bank of America has been able to cut costs and appeal to young users by adapting strategies for the digital age. The bank’s digitized branches–which allow customers to access contactless ATMs and connect with call centers via video-conference technology—accumulated half the traffic of nearby branches only five months after launching in 2017.

Bank of America’s digital-only services have also re-defined what the company offers its customers. Its voice-enabled assistant Erica allows customers to make peer-to-peer (P2P) payments as well as bill payments. Since officially launching in 2017 Erica has surpassed 15 million users.

What’s more digital payments network Zelle allows users to digitally send real-time payments to friends and family. By integrating this feature into its mobile app Bank of America has opened the door for increased consumer engagement.

Among the new financial service products to launch this year Bank of America released a business-to-consumer (B2C) payout solution that gives users greater flexibility with payments; a new credit card meant for business travelers; and a new credit card tied to a cash rewards program.

3. Citigroup – $1.714 Trillion

For four years in a row Citibank has been named the “Best Bank for High-Net-Worth Families” by Kiplinger’s Personal Finance. For customers that maintain $200000 in deposit retirement and investment accounts the bank grants them access to its Citigold Package.

Insider Intelligence’s Mobile Banking Competitive Edge Study also shows that Citi took the top spot for digital money management tools as rated by consumers. Its in-platform features—including the ability to view recurring charges and see a financial wellness score—helped Citi secure a spot as one of the best banks in the US.

As for the future of growth it’s all about ensuring “that every product we deliver at Citi is digital first” says Michael Naggar chief digital officer of Citibank’s US consumer bank. “Today digital means taking transactions out of the call center and branch and digitizing them. But our goal is connecting analog and digital so that people can’t see where one ends and the other begins” adds Naggar.

Now due to rising interest from its customers Citigroup is looking into launching crypto services such as financing trading and custody. What’s more it narrowly beat out Wells Fargo this year securing the top 3 spot in assets of the big four banks in 2022.

4. Wells Fargo & Co. – $1.712 Trillion

Wells Fargo is following the lead of top competitors by targeting millennials through mobile financial services. Pay with Wells Fargo is a mobile service where users can access their most used payment features before signing into the app. Additionally Wells Fargo’s app Greenhouse helps customers simplify their bills and track spending.

Over the last year Wells Fargo has been optimizing its business to focus on sectors with strong revenue-generating potential like credit cards. For example the financial services firm has a new suite of Visa credit cards which will directly challenge a joint card from PayPal Synchrony Financial as well as Citigroup’s Double Cash per Bloomberg.

Joining the contactless payment market has also bolstered Wells Fargo’s position as a leading bank. This is not surprising as 78% of the top 100 US merchants are now accepting contactless transactions and 44% of US consumers prefer contactless payments per Insider Intelligence research.

5. U.S. Bancorp – $591.21 Billion

U.S. Bancorp the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association earned a spot on the list of top US banks due to its commitment to compete with tech giants making their way into the banking industry.

With Facebook Amazon Apple and Google all announcing their desire to launch financial services U.S. Bancorp was inspired to improve its own technology. According to Terry Dolan chief financial officer of U.S. Bancorp “the bank plans to partner with fintechs in order to maintain competitive banking technology.”

6. PNC Financial Services – $553.39 Billion

PNC Bank stands out as a top US bank due to its specialized customer perks and original products and services. For example PNC offers mobile payment options to corporate clients who hold Visa commercial cards—allowing them to leverage popular mobile wallets like Apple Pay.

What’s more PNC has taken steps to combat fraud a growing problem in the financial industry and the digital world—including piloted credit cards with card verification values that periodically refresh. While fraudsters may be able to guess three-digit CVV codes relatively easily due to the limited number of permutations periodically changing CVVs makes stolen data less valuable.

Most recently PNC responded to the rise in digital banking by rolling out hybrid branches called solution centers—housing self-serve tools such as video teller machines ATMs and mobile workstations while in-person staff assist with more complex needs. The hybrid approach is a strong tactic that aligns well with consumer preferences. For example a 2020 KPMG survey showed that once the pandemic eases customers would be less likely to visit branches to manage accounts (6%) or check balances (8%).

7. Truist Financial Corporation – $534.19 Billion

Truist is the bank formed by Branch Banking and Trust Company (BB&T) and SunTrust at the end of 2019. According to the Federal Reserve’s 2019 figures BB&T and SunTrust were ranked 11th and 12th in bank assets respectively.

Now operating over 2000 branches in 15 states and Washington D.C. the combined bank offers consumer and commercial banking asset management securities brokerage mortgage and insurance products and financial services.

8. Goldman Sachs – $513.91 Billion

A newcomer to the top ten Goldman Sachs is a well known global investment banking management and securities firm. Its clients have access to a variety of financial services including banking products through Marcus—its online banking division that made its debut in fall 2016 and began offering personal loans per Bankrate.

While its investment banking arm experienced a hit in Q3 of 2022 Goldman saw its consumer and wealth management revenue increase 18% YoY due to credit card balances and higher interest rates. Additionally its fixed income saw 41% YoY growth—helping Goldman exceed analysts’ estimates. The firm has also announced a full overhaul of its products and services to mitigate its losses in other areas.

9. TD Bank – $394.33 Billion

In addition to having extensive influence abroad TD Bank has become one of the largest banks in the US due to its integration of artificial intelligence and utilization of digital technology.

TD Bank has partnered with KAI Consumer Banking to launch Clari an AI-powered chatbot in Canada. Clari answers customers’ questions via text message and notifies them when credit card payments and when a payment is made. As Clari has significantly cut down the call volume in Canada it is likely that TD Bank may develop a similar chatbot for its US branches.

In another partnership the company teamed up with fintech provider Amount to leverage its suite of digital lending tools—including fraud detection and account verification.

10. Capital One – $391.81 Billion

Capital One has made the list of top US banks likely due to its ongoing commitment to digital transformation. Capital One increased its technology staff from 2500 in 2011 to 9000 in 2019 helping launch Eno—its AI-powered chatbot similar to Bank of America’s Erica.

Despite its major data breach in mid-2019 the bank also came first on our Banking Digital Trust Report where it was the frontrunner on all six pillars of trust: security privacy reputation reliability ease of use and feature breadth. Capital One’s high scores likely stemmed from its recent large-scale cloud migration which has improved service continuity facilitated upgrades and reinforced security protocols to get back into customers’ good graces.

Capital One also acquired fintech United Income in 2019 a digital platform that offers wealth management services for people transitioning into retirement. This combination allows the firm to offer technological capabilities with human facets. For example by providing access to a team of wealth managers this makes Capital One appealing to consumers who still desire human interaction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHA6Ly9yb2JlcnRkeWVyLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbS8yMDIzLzAxL3RydWlzdC1tb3Zlcy1pbnRvLW5ldy1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1hdC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Truist moves into new development at Chevy Chase Lake (Photos),Bethesda news restaurants nightlife events and openings real estate crime reports and more - the way only a lifelong Bethesda resident like Robert Dyer can bring it to you.

Smithfield Foods has seen a wave of departures among its corporate officers over the past four months.

The company’s former chief operating officer Brady Stewart resigned Dec. 20 to accept a position with Arkansas-headquartered competitor Tyson Foods according to Smithfield and Tyson press releases.

Smithfield had previously announced on Nov. 29 that its former chief financial officer Glenn Nunziata would leave the company at the end of 2022.

Russ Dokken according to his LinkedIn profile recently retired as Smithfield’s chief sales officer after 36 years with the company.

Keira Lombardo who’d been with Smithfield for 20 years resigned as the company’s chief administrative officer in September according to her LinkedIn profile.

Stewart had joined Smithfield in 2017 and been its chief operating officer since 2021 according to his LinkedIn profile. He’d joined Smithfield initially as vice president and general manager of Kansas City Sausage Company and Pine Ridge Farms when Smithfield acquired the companies. As chief operating officer Stewart had been responsible for leading Smithfield’s business across more than 500 company-owned farms and 46 production facilities in the United States Tyson’s press release states.

“While the company evaluates longer-term organizational changes members of Smithfield’s operations team – including those leading hog production manufacturing fresh pork business management and sales” are to report to President and Chief Executive Officer Shane Smith “effective immediately” Smithfield’s Dec. 20 press release stated.

Nunziata according to his Smithfield biography joined the company as its CFO in 2015 after spending 19 years with the New York Boston Washington D.C. and Richmond offices of the London-headquartered Ernst & Young accounting firm. As CFO Nunziata was responsible for overseeing the company’s finances taxes risk management and served as Smithfield’s principal accounting officer.

Nunziata in Smithfield’s Nov. 29 press release called his time with the company and with Ernst & Young the “highlight” of his career and contended the “future is bright” for Smithfield. Nunziata added that he planned to “take some time to consider the next phase” of his career.

Mark Hall formerly Smithfield’s executive vice president of finance has taken Nunziata’s place as CFO effective Jan. 1. Hall according to a Smithfield press release joined the company in 2014 as vice president of finance for Smithfield’s John Morrell Food Group brand and was promoted in 2015 to the same position for Smithfield’s combined packaged meats business. He assumed his immediate past role as executive vice president of finance in late 2020.

Dokken was named to the chief sales officer position in 2021 according to past reporting by The Smithfield Times. In that role he was responsible for aligning sales marketing product innovation and business management initiatives. Dokken began his career in 1986 also with John Morrell before the company was acquired by Smithfield in 1995.

Lombardo according to past Times reporting had been in her chief administrative officer role since 2021. In that role she led the company’s administrative operations including corporate communications external affairs government affairs human resources investor relations legal and sustainability functions.

Dokken and Lombardo each entered what would become their final positions with Smithfield during the brief tenure of former President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Organ. Organ became president and CEO on Nov. 27 2020 succeeding Kenneth Sullivan who had held the position since 2015 but then stepped down himself in July 2021 and was succeeded by Smith.

Jim Monroe vice president of corporate affairs for Smithfield denied there was any sort of connection between the four officers’ recent decisions to leave.

“These were decisions made by the individuals involved” Monroe said.

Old Dominion University finance professor Thomas Schneider however contends the four departures coincide with the sale of Smithfield’s seasoning division known as Saratoga Food Specialties to Solina Group a French food company. Smithfield’s Hong Kong-based parent company WH Group announced the sale on Oct. 3 listing a sale price of $587.5 million.

According to a filing by WH Group Chairman Wan Long WH Group “expects to recognize a gain” of approximately $467 million before costs and expenses relating to the sale in the fiscal year ending Dec. 31.

“Executive departures timed around large deals like this are not unusual in the corporate world as companies sort themselves for efficiency” Schneider said.

The departures may also reflect continued fallout from a feud that began in 2021 between Wan Long and his son Wan Hongjian Schneider speculated. According to reporting by Business Insider and the Wall Street Journal shares in WH Group plunged 11.6% in August of that year after Hongjian the firm’s former executive director accused his father of tax evasion and overseeing corporate fraud. Hongjian according to Business Insider had been fired from his father’s company in June of that year for “aggressive behaviors.”

According to Schneider Hongjian specifically alleged that WH Group’s acquisition of Smithfield Foods in 2013 was primarily aimed at helping Long move money outside of China.

“Regardless of the underlying motives this deal will enable Solina Group to expand its business to the U.S. and it will leave Smithfield a leaner company to focus on the pork business” Schneider said.

Monroe called Schneider’s speculation “really off the mark” and “inaccurate.”

“Smithfield has a strong management team in place” Monroe said. “Most importantly we have 60000 outstanding team members around the globe most of whom work on the front lines doing the work of producing good food the right way.”

Smithfield employs about 3000 people locally between its headquarters and the meatpacking plant in town.

A local large scale chicken farm operation with ties to Tyson Foods is being sued for receiving a government loan aimed at helping small farmers.

A group of concerned citizens has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Services Agency Farm Credit Mid-America FLCA and two Henderson County farming operations in federal court in Jackson.

The lawsuit alleges that a federal loan program meant for “family farms” is illegally being used to finance industrial poultry operations controlled by large corporations.

Lawyers for the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) filed the lawsuit in the Western District of Tennessee Eastern Division of the U.S. District Court on December 12 2022.

The poultry warehouses are located on Judge McClough Road and White Cemetery Road in northern Henderson County.

This is a first-of-its-kind lawsuit addressing how the federal government loans money to fund large scale poultry operations. The operation includes 16 industrial-scale poultry warehouses that are more than 50 feet wide and 600 feet long and would raise millions of chickens for Tyson Foods each year.

Project Censored's State of the Free Press 2023 edited by Andy Lee Roth and Mickey Huff is available now. Published in collaboration with Random Lengths News this is the second of two parts. Read the first five stories on the list here.

6) Corporate Consolidation Causing Record Inflation in Food Prices

“Corporate consolidation is a main driver of record inflation in food prices despite claims by media pundits and partisan commentators to the contrary” Project Censored reports. “The establishment press has covered the current wave of inflation exhaustively but only rarely will discuss the market power of giant firms as a possible cause and then usually only to reject it” as they did when the Biden administration cited meat industry consolidation as a cause of price increases in September 2021 “treating administration attempts to link inflation to consolidation as a rhetorical move meant to distract from conservative critiques of Biden’s stimulus program.”

But as Food and Water Watch reported in Nov 2021 “while the cost of meat shot up prices paid to farmers actually declined spurring a federal investigation.” That investigation is ongoing but meat conglomerates Tyson Foods Perdue Farms Smithfield Foods and JBS have paid just over $225 million to settle related civil suits in the poultry beef and pork markets.

That’s just part of the problem. A July 2021 joint investigation by Food and Water Watch and the Guardian “reported that a handful of ‘food giants’ — including Kraft Heinz General Mills Conagra Unilever and Del Monte — control an average of 64 percent of sales of sixty-one popular grocery items” Project Censored noted. Three companies own 93% of carbonated soft drink brands; while another three produce 73% of the cereals on offer and a single company PepsiCo owns five of the most popular dip brands — 88% of the market. Altogether “four firms or fewer controlled at least 50% of the market for 79% of the groceries” the Guardian reported.

It’s not just producers: “In an October 2021 article for Common Dreams Kenny Stancil documents that food producers distributors and grocery store chains are engaging in pandemic profiteering and taking advantage of “decades of consolidation which has given a handful of corporations an ever-greater degree of market control and with it the power to set prices” according to research by the Groundwork Collaborative.

As for grocers “Kroger the largest supermarket chain in the country cited rising inflation as the reason for hiking prices in their stores even as they cut worker pay by 8 percent” Project Censored noted. “Yet as Stancil explained Kroger’s CEO publicly gloated that ‘a little bit of inflation is always good for business.’ That CEO earned 909 times what the median worker earned while worker pay decreased by 8% in 2020 and “the company spent $1.498 billion on stock buybacks between April 2020 and July 2021 to enrich its shareholders” the Groundwork Collaborative reported. Kroger was one of just four companies that took in an estimated two-thirds of all grocery sales in 2019 according to Food and Water Watch.

More broadly “A report for the American Prospect by Rakeem Mabud chief economist at the Groundwork Collaborative and David Dayen revealed that one of the most common inflation scapegoats supply chain problems is itself a consequence of consolidation” Project Censored noted. “Just three global alliances of ocean shippers are responsible for 80 percent of all cargo... These shippers raked in “nearly $80 billion in the first three quarters of 2021 twice as much as in the entire ten-year period from 2010 to 2020” by increasing their rates as much as tenfold.

Supply chain consolidation reflects a broader shift in the global economy the Prospect argued. “In 1970 Milton Friedman argued in The New York Times that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.” Manufacturers used that to rationalize a financial imperative to benefit shareholders by seeking the lowest-cost labor possible.” This led to a surge in outsourcing to East Asia and eventually China. “This added new costs for shipping but deregulating all the industries in the supply chain could more than compensate.”

Occasionally articles touched on the issue of consolidation (mostly to debunk it) though there are a couple of opinion pieces to the contrary. “But these isolated opinion pieces were far out-numbered by the hundreds even thousands of reports and analyses by commercial media outlets that blamed everything but oligopolistic price gouging for the rising cost of groceries” Project Censored concluded.

7) Concerns for Journalistic Independence as Gates Foundation Gives $319 Million to News Outlets

The list of billionaires with media empires includes familiar names like Rupert Murdoch Warren Buffett Jeff Bezos Mark Zuckerberg and most recently Elon Musk. But “While other billionaires’ media empires are relatively well known the extent to which [Microsoft co-founder Bill] Gates’s cash underwrites the modern media landscape is not” Alan MacLeod wrote for MintPress News in November 2021.

MacLeod examined more than 30000 individual grants from the the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and found it had donated “more than $319 million to fund news outlets journalism centers and training programs press associations and specific media campaigns raising questions about conflicts of interest and journalistic independence” Project Censored summarized.

“Today it is possible for an individual to train as a reporter thanks to a Gates Foundation Grant find work at a Gates-funded outlet and to belong to a press association funded by Gates” MacLeod wrote.

“Recipients of this cash include many of America’s most important news outlets including CNN NBC NPR PBS and The Atlantic. Gates also sponsors a myriad of influential foreign organizations including the BBC The Guardian The Financial Times and The Daily Telegraph in the United Kingdom; prominent European newspapers such as Le Monde (France) Der Spiegel (Germany) and El País (Spain); as well as big global broadcasters like Al-Jazeera” he reported.

“MacLeod’s report includes a number of Gates-funded news outlets that also regularly feature in Project Censored’s annual Top 25 story lists such as the Solutions Journalism Network ($7.2m) The Conversation ($6.6m) the Bureau of Investigative Journalism ($1m) and ProPublica ($1m) in addition to the Guardian and the Atlantic” Project Censored noted. “Direct awards to news outlets often targeted specific issues MacLeod reported. For example CNN received $3.6 million to support ‘journalism on the everyday inequalities endured by women and girls across the world’ according to one grant. Another grant earmarked $2.3 million for the Texas Tribune ‘to increase public awareness and engagement of education reform issues in Texas.’ As MacLeod noted given Bill Gates’ advocacy of the charter school movement — which undermines teachers’ unions and effectively aims to privatize the public education system — ‘a cynic might interpret this as planting pro-corporate charter school propaganda into the media disguised as objective news reporting.’”

“[T]here are clear shortcomings with this non-exhaustive list meaning the true figure is undoubtedly far higher. First it does not count sub-grants — money given by recipients to media around the world” because there’s no record of them MacLeod reported.

“For a tax-privileged charity that so very often trumpets the importance of transparency it’s remarkable how intensely secretive the Gates Foundation is about its financial flows” Tim Schwab one of the few investigative journalists who has scrutinized the tech billionaire told MintPress.

Also missing were grants aimed at producing articles for academic journals although “they regularly form the basis for stories in the mainstream press and help shape narratives around key issues” he noted. “The Gates Foundation has given far and wide to academic sources with at least $13.6 million going toward creating content for the prestigious medical journal The Lancet.” And more broadly “even money given to universities for purely research projects eventually ends up in academic journals and ultimately downstream into mass media. … Neither these nor grants funding the printing of books or establishment of websites counted in the total although they too are forms of media.”

“No major corporate news outlets appear to have covered this issue” only a scattering of independent outlets Project Censored noted. This despite the fact that “As far back as 2011 the Seattle Times published an article investigating how the Gates Foundation’s ‘growing support of media organizations blurs the line between journalism and advocacy.’”

8) CIA Discussed Plans to Kidnap or Kill Julian Assange

The CIA seriously considered plans to kidnap or assassinate WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in late 2017 according to a September 2021 Yahoo News investigation based on interviews with more than 30 former U.S. officials eight of whom detailed U.S. plans to abduct Assange and three of whom described the development of plans to kill him. If it had been up to CIA Director Mike Pompeo they almost certainly would have been acted on after WikiLeaks announced it had obtained a massive tranche of files — dubbed “Vault 7” — from the CIA’s ultra-secret hacking division and posted some of them online.

In his first public remarks as Donald Trump’s CIA director “Pompeo devoted much of his speech to the threat posed by WikiLeaks” Yahoo News noted “Rather than use the platform to give an overview of global challenges or to lay out any bureaucratic changes he was planning to make at the agency.” He even called it “a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia” a designation intended to grant the CIA wide latitude in what actions it took while shielding it from congressional oversight.

“Potential scenarios proposed by the CIA and Trump administration officials included crashing into a Russian vehicle carrying Assange in order to grab him shooting the tires of an airplane carrying Assange in order to prevent its takeoff and engaging in a gun battle through the streets of London” Project Censored summarized. “Senior CIA officials went so far as to request ‘sketches’ or ‘options’ detailing methods to kill Assange.”

“WikiLeaks was a complete obsession of Pompeo’s” a former Trump administration national security official told Yahoo News. “After Vault 7 Pompeo and [Deputy CIA Director Gina] Haspel wanted vengeance on Assange.” It went so far that “Pompeo and others at the agency proposed abducting Assange from the embassy and surreptitiously bringing him back to the United States via a third country — a process known as rendition” they reported. (Assassination entered the picture later on.) Since it would take place in Britain there had to be agreement from them. “But the British said ‘No way you’re not doing that on our territory that ain’t happening’” a former senior counterintelligence official told Yahoo News.

There was also push-back from National Security Council or NSC lawyers and the Department of Justice which wanted to put Assange on trial. But the CIA continued to push for capturing or killing Assange. Trump’s “NSC lawyers were bulwarks against the CIA’s potentially illegal proposals according to former officials” Yahoo News reported but the CIA’s own lawyers may have been kept in the dark. “When Pompeo took over he cut the lawyers out of a lot of things” a former senior intelligence community attorney told them. “Pompeo’s ready access to the Oval Office where he would meet with Trump alone exacerbated the lawyers’ fears. [The NSC’s top lawyer John] Eisenberg fretted that the CIA director was leaving those meetings with authorities or approvals signed by the president that Eisenberg knew nothing about according to former officials.”

“US plans to kidnap or assassinate Julian Assange have received little to no establishment news coverage in the United States other than scant summaries by Business Insider and The Verge and tangential coverage by Reuters each based on the original Yahoo News report” Project Censored notes. “Among US independent news outlets Democracy Now! featured an interview with Michael Isikoff one of the Yahoo News reporters who broke the story and Jennifer Robinson a human rights attorney who has been advising Julian Assange and WikiLeaks since 2010. Rolling Stone and The Hill also published articles based on the original Yahoo News report.”

9) New Laws Preventing Dark Money Disclosures Sweep the Nation

Since the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United relaxing campaign finance regulations dark money spending has exploded and now Republican lawmakers across the U.S. are pushing legislation to make it illegal to compel nonprofit organizations to disclose who the dark money donors are. Recently-passed laws in Arkansas Arizona Iowa Oklahoma Mississippi South Dakota Tennessee Utah and West Virginia are based on model legislation from the American Legislative Exchange Council or ALEC which brings together corporate lobbyists and conservative lawmakers to advance special-interest business-friendly legislation.

“ALEC is deeply enmeshed with the sprawling political influence networks tied to billionaire families like the Kochs and the Bradleys both of which use non-disclosing nonprofits that help to conceal how money is funneled” Donald Shaw reported for Sludge on June 15 2021. “Penalties for violating the laws vary between the states but in some states could include prison sentences.”

“Shaw explained how these bills create a loophole allowing wealthy individuals and groups to pass ‘dark money’ anonymously to 501(c) organizations which in turn can make independent expenditures to influence elections (or contribute to other organizations that make independent political expenditures such as Super PACs) effectively shielding the ultimate source of political funds from public scrutiny” Project Censored summarized. “‘These bills are about making dark money darker’ Aaron McKean legal counsel for the Campaign Legal Center told Shaw.”

The South Dakota law was overwhelmingly passed by the GOP-dominated legislature despite the fact that voters passed a 2016 ballot measure requiring disclosure of “the identity of donors who give more than $100 to organizations for the purpose of political expenditures” a requirement the legislature repealed a year later Shaw reported in February 2021.

There’s a federal impact as well. “In a March 2022 article for Sludge Shaw documented that the federal omnibus appropriations bill for fiscal year 2022 contained a rider exempting political groups that declare themselves “social welfare organizations” from reporting their donors and another preventing the Securities and Exchange Commission from ‘requiring corporations to publicly disclose more of their political and lobbying spending’” Project Censored noted going on to cite a May 2021 article from Open Secrets about Senate Republicans’ “Don’t Weaponize the IRS Act” that “would prevent the IRS from requiring that 501(c)(4) nonprofits disclose their top donors.”

Democrats and good government groups have pushed back. “On April 27 2021 thirty-eight Democratic senators sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig urging them to roll back an anti-disclosure rule put in place by the Trump Administration” Project Censored reported. “In addition the Democrats’ comprehensive voting-rights bill the For the People Act would have compelled the disclosure of all contributions by individuals who surpass $10000 in donations in a given reporting period. The bill was passed by the House but died in the Senate.”

While there’s been some coverage of some aspects of this story — a Washington Post story about Democrats pressuring the Biden administration the Associated Press reporting on South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem’s defense of her state’s law — except for regional papers like the Tampa Bay Times Project Censored reports “There has been little acknowledgment in the establishment press of the stream of ALEC-inspired bills passing through state legislatures that seek to keep the source of so much of the money spent to influence elections hidden in the shadows.”

10) Major Media Outlets Lobby Against Regulation of “Surveillance Advertising”

“Surveillance advertising” — collecting users’ data to target them with tailored advertising — has become a ubiquitous extremely profitable practice on the world’s most popular social media apps and platforms — Facebook YouTube Instagram TikTok etc. But now as Lee Fang reported for the Intercept in February 2022 the Biden administration’s Federal Trade Commission or FTC is seeking to regulate user data collection. Lobbyists for the Interactive Advertising Bureau or IAB are pushing back.

“In a letter IAB called for the FTC to oppose a ban on data-driven advertising networks claiming the modern media cannot exist without mass data collection” Fang reported.

“The IAB represents both data brokers and online media outlets that depend on digital advertising such as CNN the New York Times MSNBC Time U.S. News and World Report the Washington Post Vox the Orlando Sentinel Fox News and dozens of other media companies” Fang explained. “The privacy push has largely been framed as a showdown between technology companies and the administration” but “The lobbying reveals a tension that is rarely a center of the discourse around online privacy: Major media corporations increasingly rely on a vast ecosystem of privacy violations even as the public relies on them to report on it.” As a result “Major news outlets have remained mostly silent on the FTC’s current push and a parallel effort to ban surveillance advertising by the House and Senate by Rep. Anna Eshoo D-Calif. and Sen. Cory Booker D-N.J.” Fang concluded.

“The IAB argues that targeted advertising — and by extension the siphoning of user data — has become necessary due to declining revenues from print sales and subscriptions” Project Censored summarized. “Non-digital advertising revenue decreased from $124.8 billion in 2011 to $89.8 billion in 2020 while digital advertising revenue rose from $31.9 billion to $152.2 billion in the same period according to Pew Research.” Complicating matters “The personal information collected by online media is typically sold to aggregators such as BlueKai (owned by Oracle) and OpenX that exploit user data — including data describing minors — to create predictive models of users’ behavior which are then sold to advertising agencies. The covert nature of surveillance advertising makes it difficult for users to opt out.” In addition “The user information collected by media sites also enables direct manipulation of public perceptions of political issues as famously happened when the British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica tapped into personal data from millions of Facebook users to craft campaign propaganda during the 2016 US presidential election.”

“The corporate media have reported the FTC’s openness to new rules limiting the collection and exploitation of user data but have generally not drawn attention to IAB lobbying against the proposed regulations” Project Censored noted citing articles in the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post as examples. “[N]either outlet discussed IAB its lobbying on this issue or the big media clients the organization represents.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcmFkaXNlZnVuZXJhbGhvbWVwYi5jb20vb2JpdHVhcnkvZGVtYXJjdXMtbC1zY290dNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | DeMarcuz Lee Scott of Pine Bluff Arkansas,"Demarcuz L.

Insider Intelligence broke down the top 10 banks in the US by assets with key insights as to how they got there where they plan to go in the future and how smaller banks can compete in the industry.

Do you work in the Financial Services industry? Get business insights on the latest industry trends companies and technologies with data-driven market research & forecasts.

The Federal Reserve has rolled out a list of top US banks by assets and we’ve broken down exactly how these financial service giants manage to stay ahead of the competition. For decades banks have been merging partnering and expanding—so much so that the top four banks accounted for 50% of all US banking assets last year.

In addition to having more than a trillion dollars in consolidated domestic assets JPMorgan Chase Bank of America Citigroup and Wells Fargo increased their tech spending to meet the growing demand for efficient mobile banking apps and compete with neobanks and other fintechs.

The incumbents’ shift towards digital strategy gave them an edge among customers—from traditional to early adopters—regardless of their level of comfort with technology. This demonstrates that digital payment options are no longer complementary but crucial in today’s mobile-first world.

These are the top 10 banks in the US by assets with key insights as to how they got there where they plan to go in the future and how smaller banks can stand out in a competitive industry.

1. JPMorgan Chase – $3.31 Trillion

By targeting digitally-savvy consumers and introducing artificial intelligence (AI) to its offerings JPMorgan Chase has been able to outperform its competitors. JPMorgan is playing the long-game by acquiring millennials through digital channels—in hopes of eventually converting them to higher-value customers.

Additionally JPMorgan is investing heavily in banking technology and had the biggest tech budget of all banks in 2019 with $11.4 billion. A key focus of these funds is identifying use cases to implement AI techniques—such as leveraging voice assistants to enable investment banking clients to access analyst reports and stock exchange information.

In addition to keeping tabs on direct competitors JP Morgan is also keeping tabs on how companies in other sectors are marketing to clients. “We look across all industries—it may be totally unrelated to financial services” says Allison Beer. “When we find some delightful customer experience I’ll screenshot it on my phone and show it to my team as inspiration” adds Beer.

2. Bank of America – $2.41 Trillion

Bank of America has been able to cut costs and appeal to young users by adapting strategies for the digital age. The bank’s digitized branches–which allow customers to access contactless ATMs and connect with call centers via video-conference technology—accumulated half the traffic of nearby branches only five months after launching in 2017.

Bank of America’s digital-only services have also re-defined what the company offers its customers. Its voice-enabled assistant Erica allows customers to make peer-to-peer (P2P) payments as well as bill payments. Since officially launching in 2017 Erica has surpassed 15 million users.

What’s more digital payments network Zelle allows users to digitally send real-time payments to friends and family. By integrating this feature into its mobile app Bank of America has opened the door for increased consumer engagement.

Among the new financial service products to launch this year Bank of America released a business-to-consumer (B2C) payout solution that gives users greater flexibility with payments; a new credit card meant for business travelers; and a new credit card tied to a cash rewards program.

3. Citigroup – $1.714 Trillion

For four years in a row Citibank has been named the “Best Bank for High-Net-Worth Families” by Kiplinger’s Personal Finance. For customers that maintain $200000 in deposit retirement and investment accounts the bank grants them access to its Citigold Package.

Insider Intelligence’s Mobile Banking Competitive Edge Study also shows that Citi took the top spot for digital money management tools as rated by consumers. Its in-platform features—including the ability to view recurring charges and see a financial wellness score—helped Citi secure a spot as one of the best banks in the US.

As for the future of growth it’s all about ensuring “that every product we deliver at Citi is digital first” says Michael Naggar chief digital officer of Citibank’s US consumer bank. “Today digital means taking transactions out of the call center and branch and digitizing them. But our goal is connecting analog and digital so that people can’t see where one ends and the other begins” adds Naggar.

Now due to rising interest from its customers Citigroup is looking into launching crypto services such as financing trading and custody. What’s more it narrowly beat out Wells Fargo this year securing the top 3 spot in assets of the big four banks in 2022.

4. Wells Fargo & Co. – $1.712 Trillion

Wells Fargo is following the lead of top competitors by targeting millennials through mobile financial services. Pay with Wells Fargo is a mobile service where users can access their most used payment features before signing into the app. Additionally Wells Fargo’s app Greenhouse helps customers simplify their bills and track spending.

Over the last year Wells Fargo has been optimizing its business to focus on sectors with strong revenue-generating potential like credit cards. For example the financial services firm has a new suite of Visa credit cards which will directly challenge a joint card from PayPal Synchrony Financial as well as Citigroup’s Double Cash per Bloomberg.

Joining the contactless payment market has also bolstered Wells Fargo’s position as a leading bank. This is not surprising as 78% of the top 100 US merchants are now accepting contactless transactions and 44% of US consumers prefer contactless payments per Insider Intelligence research.

5. U.S. Bancorp – $591.21 Billion

U.S. Bancorp the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association earned a spot on the list of top US banks due to its commitment to compete with tech giants making their way into the banking industry.

With Facebook Amazon Apple and Google all announcing their desire to launch financial services U.S. Bancorp was inspired to improve its own technology. According to Terry Dolan chief financial officer of U.S. Bancorp “the bank plans to partner with fintechs in order to maintain competitive banking technology.”

6. PNC Financial Services – $553.39 Billion

PNC Bank stands out as a top US bank due to its specialized customer perks and original products and services. For example PNC offers mobile payment options to corporate clients who hold Visa commercial cards—allowing them to leverage popular mobile wallets like Apple Pay.

What’s more PNC has taken steps to combat fraud a growing problem in the financial industry and the digital world—including piloted credit cards with card verification values that periodically refresh. While fraudsters may be able to guess three-digit CVV codes relatively easily due to the limited number of permutations periodically changing CVVs makes stolen data less valuable.

Most recently PNC responded to the rise in digital banking by rolling out hybrid branches called solution centers—housing self-serve tools such as video teller machines ATMs and mobile workstations while in-person staff assist with more complex needs. The hybrid approach is a strong tactic that aligns well with consumer preferences. For example a 2020 KPMG survey showed that once the pandemic eases customers would be less likely to visit branches to manage accounts (6%) or check balances (8%).

7. Truist Financial Corporation – $534.19 Billion

Truist is the bank formed by Branch Banking and Trust Company (BB&T) and SunTrust at the end of 2019. According to the Federal Reserve’s 2019 figures BB&T and SunTrust were ranked 11th and 12th in bank assets respectively.

Now operating over 2000 branches in 15 states and Washington D.C. the combined bank offers consumer and commercial banking asset management securities brokerage mortgage and insurance products and financial services.

8. Goldman Sachs – $513.91 Billion

A newcomer to the top ten Goldman Sachs is a well known global investment banking management and securities firm. Its clients have access to a variety of financial services including banking products through Marcus—its online banking division that made its debut in fall 2016 and began offering personal loans per Bankrate.

While its investment banking arm experienced a hit in Q3 of 2022 Goldman saw its consumer and wealth management revenue increase 18% YoY due to credit card balances and higher interest rates. Additionally its fixed income saw 41% YoY growth—helping Goldman exceed analysts’ estimates. The firm has also announced a full overhaul of its products and services to mitigate its losses in other areas.

9. TD Bank – $394.33 Billion

In addition to having extensive influence abroad TD Bank has become one of the largest banks in the US due to its integration of artificial intelligence and utilization of digital technology.

TD Bank has partnered with KAI Consumer Banking to launch Clari an AI-powered chatbot in Canada. Clari answers customers’ questions via text message and notifies them when credit card payments and when a payment is made. As Clari has significantly cut down the call volume in Canada it is likely that TD Bank may develop a similar chatbot for its US branches.

In another partnership the company teamed up with fintech provider Amount to leverage its suite of digital lending tools—including fraud detection and account verification.

10. Capital One – $391.81 Billion

Capital One has made the list of top US banks likely due to its ongoing commitment to digital transformation. Capital One increased its technology staff from 2500 in 2011 to 9000 in 2019 helping launch Eno—its AI-powered chatbot similar to Bank of America’s Erica.

Despite its major data breach in mid-2019 the bank also came first on our Banking Digital Trust Report where it was the frontrunner on all six pillars of trust: security privacy reputation reliability ease of use and feature breadth. Capital One’s high scores likely stemmed from its recent large-scale cloud migration which has improved service continuity facilitated upgrades and reinforced security protocols to get back into customers’ good graces.

Capital One also acquired fintech United Income in 2019 a digital platform that offers wealth management services for people transitioning into retirement. This combination allows the firm to offer technological capabilities with human facets. For example by providing access to a team of wealth managers this makes Capital One appealing to consumers who still desire human interaction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8va3N0cC5jb20va3N0cC1uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvY2hhcmdlcy1mYXRhbC1zaG9vdGluZy1uZWFyLXVzLWJhbmstc3RhZGl1bS1oYXBwZW5lZC1kdXJpbmctZHJ1Zy1kZWFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Charges: Fatal shooting near US Bank Stadium happened during drug deal,"A shooting that killed a man near U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis last week happened during a drug deal according to the man accused of the killing.

Idris Adbillahi Haji-Mohamed 28 from Rochester was formally charged Wednesday with second-degree intentional murder in the death of 26-year-old Jeremy Demond Ellis.

RELATED: Suspect arrested in fatal shooting Friday across from U.S. Bank Stadium victim identified

According to Minneapolis police officers responded to a parking lot near the corner of South Sixth Street and Chicago Avenue on a report of shooting at around 9 p.m. on Dec. 30. There officers found Ellis with several apparent gunshot wounds in a white Dodge Charger. He died at the scene.

Court documents state that officers found several $100 bills on the front passenger seat of the car as well as a gun between the driver’s seat and center console. Additionally officers found five discharged .40-caliber casings in the parking lot.

Witnesses provided officers with a description of the suspected shooter and officers then saw a man matching that description leaving a nearby apartment building a criminal complaint states. That man was identified as Haji-Mohamed who admitted he was the registered owner of the Charger.

In an interview with police Haji-Mohamed offered multiple versions of what happened before eventually saying he was buying drugs from Ellis the complaint states. He added that Ellis ordered him out of the car at gunpoint and started driving away in the car so he fired several shots at Ellis.

Haji-Mohamed said he then changed clothes and gave them and the gun he used to a friend. The complaint states officers later recovered those items from a car in the apartment building’s garage.

The complaint also notes that Haji-Mohamed was on conditional release with an ankle bracelet in connection to murder charges out of Clay County. Those charges stem from a Sept. 10 2021 shooting in Moorhead that killed 32-year-old Abdi Abdi.

Charges from that incident state that as Haji-Mohamed left a Casey’s store he encountered Abdi sitting in a car outside the store and briefly chatted with people in Abdi’s car. Then when Abdi drove away Haji-Mohamed’s vehicle followed. When the vehicle stopped and Abdi was smoking a cigarette Haji-Mohamed allegedly chased and started shooting at him. When Abdi fell to the ground Haji-Mohamed fired five shots at him point blank the complaint states.

Major exchange-traded banks had a median month-to-date return of negative 4.8% compared with positive 1.9% in November 2022 and positive 8.6% in October 2022 according to an S&P Global Market Intelligence analysis. The S&P U.S. BMI Banks index recorded a negative 7.6% return while the S&P 500 booked a negative 5.8%.

During the month the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee boosted the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points. Although the increase was smaller than the four straight 75-basis-point hikes earlier in 2022 U.S. bank stocks moved down following the announcement. In his post-rate-setting committee meeting news conference Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the economic pain from higher rates was far from over.

Silvergate tops the list

Silvergate Capital Corp.'s stock was the worst-performing bank stock in December 2022 with a month-to-date return of negative 36.6% more than double the negative return of the second on the list Triumph Financial Inc.'s stock.

Silvergate shares had suffered for most of 2022 amid the turmoil in the cryptocurrency market and more recently due to the company's exposure to troubled cryptocurrency exchange FTX Trading Ltd. Earlier in December 2022 Silvergate CEO Alan Lane issued a letter to push back on what he called ""misinformation"" regarding the company's role in the digital asset ecosystem.

The stock of Triumph Financial which was the second-most expensive U.S. bank stock by price-to-estimated 2023 earnings in December 2022 returned a negative 18.2%. Signature Bank another cryptocurrency-friendly bank was the third-worst performer with a return of negative 17.4%.

Republic First Bancorp Inc. shares posted a negative return of 15.7%. During the month the company announced leadership changes and its receipt of an updated investment proposal worth $75 million from a group of activist shareholders.

The largest bank by market capitalization on the worst-performer list was Wells Fargo & Co.'s stock returning a negative 13.9%. In December 2022 the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered the Wall Street giant to pay $2 billion in redress to consumers and pay a $1.7 billion civil penalty among other enforcement actions.

Merger targets on the best-performer list

Merger targets were among the best performers in December 2022: Malvern Bancorp Inc. with a 24.1% return; Salisbury Bancorp Inc. with 7.2%; and HV Bancorp Inc. with 6.7%.



Malvern Bancorp is in a pending deal to be sold to First Bank and Salisbury Bancorp will merge with and into NBT Bancorp Inc. HV Bancorp will be acquired by Citizens Financial Services Inc. which also made it to the list with a return of 6.2%.

""The events of the past year have been marked by significant volatility and the exposure of vulnerabilities in the crypto-asset sector"" the regulators said in a joint statement from the Federal Reserve Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The comments come just weeks after the spectacular collapse of crypto exchange FTX .

U.S. banking regulators warned financial institutions on Tuesday that dealing with cryptocurrency exposes them to an array of risks including scams and fraud.

During the crypto boom when financial players seemed to announce a new crypto partnership on a weekly basis bank executives said they needed further guidance from regulators before dealing more directly with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in retail and institutional trading businesses.

Now about two months after the bankruptcy filing of FTX the industry has been exposed as rife with poor risk management interconnected risks and outright fraud.

While the statement indicated that regulators were still assessing how banks could adopt crypto while adhering to their various mandates for consumer protection and anti-money laundering they seemed to give a clue as to which direction they were headed in.

""Based on the agencies' current understanding and experience to date the agencies believe that issuing or holding as principal crypto-assets that are issued stored or transferred on an open public and/or decentralized network or similar system is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices"" the regulators said.

They also said that they have ""significant safety and soundness concerns"" with banks that focus on crypto clients or that have ""concentrated exposures"" to the sector.

Traditional banks have largely sidestepped the crypto meltdown unlike the 2008 financial crisis in which they played a central role. One exception has been Silvergate Capital  whose shares have been battered in the past year."
UBER,Uber,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbWVkY2l0eW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvdWJlci1mb3ItbnVyc2VzLWxhdW5jaGVzLXVwZGF0ZWQtYXBwLWFzLWVtcGxveWVlLWJhc2UtZ3Jvd3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Uber for Nurses’ Launches Updated App As Employee Base Grows,"Fed up with poor staffing levels and excessive burnout nurses continue to leave their hospital jobs in droves. In fact experts predict that the U.S. healthcare industry will be short 2.1 million nurses by 2025.

Hydreight was founded in 2018 as a telehealth platform and medical network that addresses this issue by letting nurses be their own boss and work as independent 1099 contractors. Last week the Las Vegas-based company launched an updated app so that the hundreds of nurses on its platform can have a more streamlined experience.

The startup’s platform makes it possible for nurses med spa technicians and other licensed healthcare professionals to be in control of their own schedules and deliver services outside of a hospital or traditional medical facility said Hydreight CEO Shane Madden.

“The platform operates as a marketplace essentially as an ‘Uber for nurses’ allowing them to connect directly with patients and deliver services anywhere” he said.

Nurses use Hydreight’s platform to offer services such as IV drip Botox Covid-19 testing and other medical and med spa treatments. These services can be delivered at the patient’s home hotel office or any other suitable location Madden said.

Patients who join Hydreight’s medical network can use its app — which operates similarly to popular food delivery apps — to order a medical service from its pharmaceutical IV menu or aesthetic services menu.

Sponsored Post A Personalized Approach to Medication Nonadherence At the Abarca Forward conference earlier this year George Van Antwerp managing director at Deloitte discussed how social determinants of health and a personalized member experience can improve medication adherence and health outcomes.

Hydreight’s platform provides medical director oversight liability insurance HIPAA-compliant documentation and access to a digital pharmacy Madden added. This means that nurses can work for themselves without the stress of operating their own business.

Across all 50 states Hydreight currently has 688 accounts that provide medical services and tens of thousands of patients using its app. The startup said it’s difficult to say the exact number of nurses on its platform because each account is different — some have one nurse working solo and others consist of a team of nurses who joined using one account.

Some Hydreight nurses went viral on TikTok last year for posting videos saying they earn higher wages than travel nurses. Hydreight nurses said they earn as much as $3500 a week. The average monthly salary for travel nurses is $9790 which breaks down to about $2500 a week.

Madden said Hydreight was founded to give nurses more autonomy and freedom and the company will remain dedicated to serving their best interests.

“We are committed to continuous improvement and listening to what users need. This update gives nurses and other health and wellness service providers more control over what they offer as well as overall improved performance usability reporting and aesthetic and functional upgrades. For both patients and service providers it includes an improved booking experience and more options for how each wants to use the platform” he said.

Still Hydreight is not the only company offering at-home IV services — there’s also The IV Doc. Madden believes his company differentiates itself with its proprietary HIPAA-compliant software medical director oversight medical liability insurance and infusions protocols.

“There is no other mobile wellness organization that provides its partners with everything they need to run their business all in one place” he said.

For nearly 20 minutes in November 2022 Shaik Salauddin walked alongside Rahul Gandhi the former president of India’s main opposition political party the Indian National Congress in Hyderabad. The march was part of Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra (“unite India movement”) in which he walked across 12 states to modernize his party’s image ahead of the elections in 2024. In a video Gandhi can be seen placing his hand on Salauddin’s shoulder as they engage in a deep conversation while passing through the Kukatpally neighborhood of the southern Indian city.

Salauddin is neither a powerful politician nor an affluent business tycoon. An Uber driver by profession over the last three years Salauddin has become a quasi-celebrity as a gig industry organizer: spearheading strikes engaging with policymakers and highlighting issues in the media to help improve the working conditions of his peers. Walking alongside Salauddin sent a strong message to Gandhi’s supporters: He is serious about India’s unemployment issues. Perhaps Gandhi knew how important it was to be seen with the unofficial leader of millions of gig workers in India.

In 2019 Salauddin co-founded the Indian Federation of App-based Transport Workers (IFAT) a coalition of unions that now has over 36000 members. He currently serves as the federation’s national general secretary. In 2020 he also launched the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (TGPWU) which now has over 10000 members including cab drivers food and grocery delivery workers and e-commerce delivery persons from the southern state.

“We aren’t getting successes promptly but have recently started to see some positive changes” Salauddin told Rest of World. “My fight for gig and platform workers will keep going on.”

Four tech and gig-work researchers and several journalists told Rest of World that Salauddin is the de facto point person for any gig work-related issues. One researcher compared him to the “anchoring contact you have on LinkedIn who knows everybody.”

“In terms of ride-hailing Shaik is the biggest union representative in the country” Balaji Parthasarathy lead investigator for India at Fairwork who works closely with Salauddin told Rest of World. Fairwork is a University of Oxford project that evaluates the working conditions of gig workers of digital platforms.

Salauddin was among the first wave of drivers to start working for Uber and Ola in Hyderabad. He told Rest of World that he decided to join Uber in 2014 lured by the company’s prominent advertising campaign and outreach to attract drivers. Prior to this he used to drive rental taxis. “I spent the first three-four months just understanding what these platforms are” Salauddin told Rest of World during a meeting at his Hyderabad office in June 2022.

The first few months of working for Uber were smooth he said with the company continuing to offer hefty incentives. Many of his fellow drivers bought cars on loan banking on high payouts from Uber and other ride-hailing platforms like Ola he said. But the smooth ride was short-lived. As more drivers joined earnings started to decline.

This drop in earnings led to at least two Uber drivers dying by suicide in Hyderabad allegedly after failing to pay the equated monthly installments on the cars they had bought for their work. Salauddin remembers watching an ambulance take the dead body of Mohammed Zaheer one of the Uber drivers who died by suicide in January 2018 to the Uber office in Hyderabad. He spearheaded a protest with hundreds of other drivers in the city at the time but realized it didn’t have the impact he had anticipated.

The deaths made Salauddin reconsider his path as just a driver he said. He came to believe that companies such as Uber and Ola were exploiting him and his co-workers by setting unrealistic targets without considering the repercussions. He realized then that gig workers across the country were fighting for their rights in isolation and they needed to come together to make a difference. So he started working towards unionizing.

In response to queries sent by Rest of World about Uber’s interactions with driver union representatives in India including Salauddin a company spokesperson said “Uber has always met with driver-partners to listen to their feedback about their experience with Uber and ensure we take that into account when making product changes and formulating policies.” The spokesperson further said that last year Uber established a Driver Advisory Council to “bring together driver partners and Uber representatives to formally discuss issues or concerns.”

Now Salauddin doesn’t drive for Uber as often as he used to. Instead he spends his time coordinating with gig workers across states and organizing countrywide movements for gig worker rights and better working conditions.

In June Rest of World visited Salauddin’s brand-new office in Hyderabad. Dressed as always in a button-down shirt and trousers he sat cross-legged on the floor of the threadbare 400-square-foot office for much of the afternoon. Surrounded by a few plastic chairs and simple tables Salauddin juggled phone calls sending messages on Telegram and WhatsApp groups and meeting local gig workers who came in seeking guidance.

His diary is his lifeline. In it he scribbles notes during these meetings and keeps a daily timetable. He travels between Delhi Bengaluru Mumbai and Kolkata where he meets union members and attends workshops and seminars. Because his car goes mostly unused during the week he lends it out to other drivers. His last Uber ride was in September 2022 he said.

Salauddin who has a degree in computer studies switches between Hindi and English smoothly. He speaks confidently about the “unfair practices of platforms” and frequently refers to “the algorithm” when talking about why gig workers suffer due to apps. Unlike many other union leaders in India Salauddin is extremely tech- and media-savvy. He regularly keeps in touch with local and foreign journalists sharing screenshots and press releases via WhatsApp. He’s articulate and knows how to build a story.

On the afternoon of Rest of World’s visit Salauddin’s phone buzzed nonstop mostly from Telegram and WhatsApp notifications. He’s in at least 64 Telegram groups and over 20 WhatsApp groups—many of which he has created—dedicated to providing a safe space for gig workers to discuss their woes in real time. “Just like policemen have walkie-talkies we have these Telegram groups” Salauddin said. “Whatever problems we want to discuss we do it there. We start a movement from there.”

“Just like policemen have walkie-talkies we have these Telegram groups.”

The conversations in these WhatsApp and Telegram groups—often through voice notes—eventually become the evidence that Salauddin uses to create press releases lodge police complaints and start campaigns against unfair practices by tech companies.

It was in one of these WhatsApp groups that Salauddin learned about the October 2022 incident where a customer ordering on the delivery app Swiggy explicitly requested a Hindu delivery person rather than ostensibly a Muslim delivery person. Salauddin highlighted the issue on Twitter—where he has over 1500 followers—and triggered a nationwide debate.

“[We] demand that Swiggy take strict action against such bigotry” he said in his tweet. “You built your business on the backs of workers and it’s your minimum duty to ensure their safety and dignity at work.”

Salauddin insists that his union TGPWU isn’t politically affiliated. But over the course of his work he has managed to rub shoulders with some prominent politicians like Asaduddin Owaisi Kavitha Kalvakuntla M. Shanmugam Harbhajan Singh and K. Keshav Rao among others he said.

In 2019 during a strike of public and private transport workers in Telangana the state’s governor Tamilisai Soundararajan invited the Telangana State Taxi and Drivers Joint Action Committee to her office. She spoke to Salauddin the committee’s chairman and asked him to call off the strike.

In 2020 Salauddin was also able to get the support of some local and state-level politicians to lobby the government to pass a bill on security benefits for gig workers. “I did a lot of internal lobbying to bring the social security code and many of the politicians I met gave me a letter in support of that” he said.

The efforts of IFAT and TGPWU have had other successes too. In the spring of last year cab drivers on Uber and Ola in India protested against low fares by switching off the air conditioning in their cars. Uber and Ola did not increase drivers’ base fares but a month later they agreed to display the drop location to drivers after years of resistance. Much of the mobilization and information-sharing that brought about these changes has been made possible through the Telegram and WhatsApp groups Salauddin is active in.

However he says his biggest recent win has been getting Gandhi to talk about gig workers. “I thought he would give me five minutes just like he gave others” Salauddin told Rest of World over the phone in November 2022. “I was a bit worried if this would just be a photo op or [would] actually make a difference — but he engaged with me asked me a lot of follow-up questions.”

Salauddin claims that for years Gandhi had never publicly discussed platforms like Swiggy Zomato Uber and Ola and the conditions of their workers. But after their walk together Gandhi has brought up the problems. Publicizing these issues Salauddin says drives him. “There’s nothing I can be happier about.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3lvcmsuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAtaHVydC1hcy11YmVyLWNyYXNoZXMtaW50by1vdXRkb29yLWRpbmluZy1hcmVhLWluLW1hbmhhdHRhbi80MDI1Njc3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inwood Car Crash: Uber Driver Slams Into Outdoor Dining Area – NBC New York,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3lvcmsuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAtaHVydC1hcy11YmVyLWNyYXNoZXMtaW50by1vdXRkb29yLWRpbmluZy1hcmVhLWluLW1hbmhhdHRhbi80MDI1Njc3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2EE48B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The app-based for-hire vehicles account for 43.9% of Midtown Manhattan traffic or more than either cabs or personal vehicles according to research by Lucius Riccio a Stern Business School adjunct professor who served as DOT boss under Mayor David Dinkins in the 1990s.

Based on that the city should focus its congestion-pricing toll plan on app-based services at least at the outset Riccio said.

“The largest share of the vehicles on our streets are these for-hire vehicles that pay nothing to be on our streets” he told The Post on Tuesday.

“There’s nothing wrong with congestion pricing [but] for-hire vehicles should be charged first. People should recognize they’re the real cause of congestion in Midtown.”

In 2019 for-hire hacks began paying a $2.75-per-ride congestion charge which is not part of the toll plan.

But Riccio noted that yellow taxi drivers currently pay around $15000 in general annual fees. If the city charged app-based cars $5000 in such fees per year it could raise half a billion dollars according to his estimates. A congestion-pricing toll targeting for-hire drivers at the start would only help level that playing field further he said.

3 Riccio blames Uber and its competitors for driving Midtown congestion. Stefan Jeremiah for NY Post

For his study Ricco based his congestion results on 90 short videos he shot of daytime traffic at several Midtown intersections in October and November tallying up each vehicle type he observed.

“Although this group may not be a perfect random sample of Midtown it is a varied collection of locations with a large number of vehicles observed” he wrote in the study.

Speaking to The Post Riccio pinned blame for the results on city leaders who permitted Uber Lyft and other companies to enter the market with almost no barriers to entry.

“The people who are advocates for congestion pricing did not speak up at all when 100000 for-hire vehicles — Uber Lyft etc. — were allowed for almost nothing no charge to fill up our streets” Riccio said.

The MTA’s congestion pricing program was passed by the state legislature and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2019. It is set to go into effect no earlier than the end of the year with tolls being recommended by a select panel and approved by the MTA board.

The plan aims to reduce overall traffic in Manhattan’s downtown by charging anywhere from $9 to $23 per vehicle entering the borough below 60th Street.

Critics say the move could badly hurt the immigrant-dominated taxi and app-based industry with the MTA is warning some drivers may be put out of work as a result.

Taxi analyst Bruce Schaller who helped craft ex-Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s failed congestion pricing proposal in 2007 and 2008 said Riccio is right to point out the disproportionate presence of app-based cars.

But Schaller cautioned against charging them the congestion fee while exempting taxis even at the start. Doing so would simply push customers to yellow cabs and not cut traffic he said.

“You’re not exempting cabs or Ubers or Lyfts or whatever the case may be you’re exempting the people in them and they’re fungible they’ll move around” Schaller explained.

“You would benefit the [yellow taxis] which is a good thing but you’re not accomplishing your actual goal of reducing congestion” the analyst said. “It would be a disaster if we put congestion pricing in and we didn’t see a benefit.”

A rep for Uber disputed Riccio’s findings — pointing to a report from August by the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission that concluded the “return of congestion shortly after the initial onset of the pandemic … cannot be attributed to the FHV industry.”

The Uber spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein added “A recently released review by the TLC found that the return of congestion in Midtown could not be attributed to the for-hire vehicle industry.

“Despite that fact Uber Lyft and Taxi riders have already paid nearly $1 billion in congestion fees since 2019 while other vehicles clogged city streets without paying a cent” of those costs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAxLzA0L3ViZXItc3VyZ2UtcHJpY2VzLWV4cGxhaW4tZmVkLWluZmxhdGlvbi1taXNz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Uber surge prices explain the Fed's inflation miss,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.axios.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2023/01/04/uber-surge-prices-explain-fed-inflation-miss (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2EE44F0>, 'Connection to www.axios.com timed out.

West Whiteland Township Police shared surveillance video that allegedly shows the women brazenly filling store baskets with thousands worth of fragrances at the store in Exton last Thursday.

Investigators say the group robbed two other Ulta Beauty stores in nearby Newtown Square and Plymouth Township Montgomery County earlier in the day. Those robberies tipped off police and store employees when the group set its sights on the Exton store which has previously been the target of similar robberies.

Officers quickly responded to the store and briefly managed to stop the suspect's vehicle before it took off triggering a high speed pursuit. West Whiteland Police and neighboring departments chased the vehicle and stopped it on Route 202 and arrested Diamond Richards 33 Annabelle Cain 20 and 32-year-old Itaijyah Clark.

During a search of the suspect's vehicle police allegedly found thousands of dollars in fragrances from the three Ulta thefts and multiple boxes of shoes taken from a DSW. Jackets and Polo brand clothing believed to have been stolen from an Exton Macy's were also found in the car along with toys from Kohls.

Detective Scott Pezick says these types of retail thefts have happened along the east coast and departments are diligently sharing information to help thwart the trend.

""There are several groups some from this area some from out of state"" Detective Pezick said. ""Hopefully we start slowing it down by making some arrests.""

All three woman are facing retail theft charges according to police.

Two women are facing felony shoplifting charges for thefts of dozens of products at the Ulta Beauty store 27844 Woodward Ave. on Dec. 23.

The same store was targeted 10 days earlier by five masked women police said who swarmed the store and stole about $7000 worth of perfumes and colognes within minutes and fled.

Royal Oak police Lt. Albert Carter said police are still working to determine whether the two women in the Dec. 23 thefts are connected to the earlier flash-thefts.

A driver who was with the two women was arrested but no charges were filed against her in Royal Oak.

Charged are Tiara Judge 28 of Grand Rapids and Jasmine Phillips 24 of Wyoming MI. They are free on bond and due back in Royal Oak 44th District Court at 9:45 a.m. before Judge Derek Meinecke. Each of the women is charged with first-degree shoplifting a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.

Carter said Judge and Phillips quickly loaded perfume and cologne into baskets from shelves just as the crew of women did back on Dec. 13.

“Other Ulta stores have been getting hit by these typically large groups of women” Carter said.

The two suspects on Dec. 23 are also believed to have been involved in thefts at Ulta stores in Troy Rochester Hills Orion Township and Shelby Township he added.

Royal Oak police worked with police in Shelby Township to arrest the suspects after getting a description of a getaway vehicle police said.

Similar types of flash-mob thefts have happened at other Ulta stores in states as far away as Illinois and Georgia.

In Michigan Royal Oak police said they believe there are several women from the west side of the state involved in such thefts.

Man recording large fight is assaulted

A Madison Heights man 22 is charged with assaulting a Farmington Hills man 22 who used his cell phone to record video of a large fight that broke out in downtown.

Someone called police about a large fight in a parking lot behind 526 Main Street near Sixth Street about 12:45 a.m. Dec. 23.

Police showed up and found several young men fighting.

One of them was bleeding from his nose and police said he was punched in the face by the Farmington Hills man for recording the fight.

“The suspect then took the victim’s cell phone and threw it on the railroad tracks” said Royal Oak police Lt. Albert Carter.

The men involved in the fight had just been escorted out of the nearby O’Toole’s bar.

Police recover Royal Oak man’s stolen van

Royal Oak police on Monday found a van reported stolen by its owner in Royal Oak on Dec. 27.

Police said the 2017 Toyota Sienna was locked when it was taken from the owner’s driveway in the 1900 block of Guthrie Avenue. Someone broke out a window on the van to get inside the vehicle.

The van turned up abandoned in Hazel Park and was recovered.

Police said they have no suspect but are processing the vehicle for fingerprints and other evidence.

Clawson man banned from bar returns is arrested

A Clawson man 40 who is banned from the Royal Inn bar 4724 Rochester Road was arrested after he returned there Dec. 28.

The bar banned the man after he caused trouble with other customers Nov. 27. Police notified him last month of the ban.

But an employee at the bar called police last Wednesday when the Clawson man returned.

The Clawson man left before police arrived but officers found him walking along 14 Mile Road and he was arrested for trespassing a misdemeanor.

Unlocked vehicles targeted

A $250 car radio and other items were stolen from three unlocked vehicles on Dec. 27.

The radio was taken from a car in the 1800 block of East 10 Mile Road.

Someone also stole CDs coins and paperwork from a vehicle parked in the 1900 block of East 10 Mile Road.

Early the same morning change was reported stolen from a car parked in the 1700 block of Guthrie Avenue.

Cars vandalized

Windows were smashed on Porsche and a Saturn parked in a bar parking lot.

The vehicles were parked outside the Ye Olde Saloon 1041 S. Main Street. The two incidents were reported to police at 11:55 p.m. Dec. 22.

It is expected to cost $400 to replace the broken window on the Porsche.

Lester

Brightline recently announced that 110 mph train testing through Martin and St. Lucie counties will resume Friday Jan. 6.

Testing which will continue through Jan. 23 will take place along an 11-mile section of track in Martin and St. Lucie counties with flaggers and law enforcement present at five of the railroad crossings (Walton Road and Riverview Drive in St. Lucie County; and County Line Road Skyline Drive and Pitchford Landing in Martin County) where trains will operate at high speeds. Testing is expected to bring additional wait times.

Brightline began high-speed testing in the Treasure Coast in October reaching top speeds of 110 mph marking “the fastest a train has traveled in the state of Florida.” Brightline has also completed 79 mph testing through St. Lucie Indian River and Brevard counties. High-speed testing in preparation for opening to Orlando in 2023 is occurring in phases along the 129-mile rail corridor between West Palm Beach and Cocoa.

Below is a video released by Brightline that features the 110-mph testing and highlights the safety improvements at crossings throughout the testing corridor.

According to Brightline the railroad has made crucial safety improvements at all 156 railroad crossings along the corridor. At the crossings in this testing area all safety improvements have been installed. Those improvements Brightline says vary per crossing but may include new crossing gates signal systems pedestrian gates pavement markings and roadway profiles. Where trains will operate at 110 mph all crossings have quad gates or medians to prevent motorists from driving around lowered crossing gates.

Brightline has also launched a new safety website which includes updated safety content PSAs and a virtual pledge.

Brightline currently serves Miami Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach with stations in Aventura and Boca Raton having just opened at the end of 2022. The Orlando station will begin service in 2023.

Brightline also plans to bring its service to additional city pairs and congested corridors across the country that are “too close to fly and too long to drive.” Plans are currently in the works to connect Las Vegas to Southern California.

They said the work is a follow up action from a review following a fatal accident in spring of 2022.

""The improvements include milling the asphalt pavement at the approach ramp to remove what is best described as a bump in both lanes of travel"" said Alaisha Montanez the Public Information Officer for TxDOT's Abilene district. ""We also replaced some curve warning signs and the exit signs on the overhead bridges and we'll be installing some rumble strips and providing additional lane markings with the curving and arrows.""

TxDOT says this is the first of several projects coming up this year that are being completed entirely by funds dedicated to public safety.

""We'll be doing some safety illumination along Business 20 which is South 1st from Leggett to Ross"" said Montanez. ""Another is railroad grade crossings and pedestrian improvements at various intersections along the Union Pacific Railroad in town so right there along South 1st. The last that I'll share is cable and concrete median barriers on Loop 322 North Winters Freeway and US 277 north of I-20.""

The current work being done on Loop 322 has an added safety measure in the work itself.

""This is the first time that in the Abilene district we have used the new maintenance work zone speed reduction process so basically just having travelers slow down leading up to and within those work zones"" said Montanez.

The work on Loop 322 is set to be completed next week.

The United Workers’ Union (UWU) bureaucracy is pushing the deal after ending a four-week strike by more than 50 workers at the plant on the basis of a meagre 4.5 percent per annum pay rise offer—well below the current inflation rate of 7.3 percent.

Striking Pampas workers and supporters at “community rally” on Saturday December 3.

The union leadership hailed the sell-out Pampas deal as a “historic win” because the company has supposedly agreed to offer permanent full-time positions to around a dozen workers currently engaged as labour-hire casuals. Some casuals have worked in the same roles for more than a decade.

Management and the union are using the promise of “secure” jobs as a means of suppressing opposition to the deal. However permanency and direct employment will not protect workers from redundancies due to automation downsizing or factory closure which are an ever-present threat in an industry marked by constant restructuring.

Pampas workers should reject the proposed agreement. Even if the proclamations of management and the union bureaucracy are true workers should not have to accept a cut in real wages in exchange for permanent jobs and leave entitlements for themselves or their co-workers. Voting “no” in the formal ballot is only the first step.

To fight for real wage increases and permanent jobs for all without trade offs Pampas workers need to mount a unified struggle with the growing sections of workers around the world who confront similar attacks on their working and living conditions.

The UWU bureaucracy has deliberately confined the dispute within the single Footscray factory. But Pampas is just a small component of Wilmar International a vast multinational corporation with more than 500 manufacturing plants and a workforce of around 100000 people.

Wilmar’s subsidiary Goodman Fielder which owns the Pampas brand is a major Australasian food manufacturing operation with more than $1 billion in annual revenue. With 12 factories in Australia and a similar number in New Zealand as well as six facilities in Fiji eight in Papua New Guinea and three in New Caledonia the company produces and distributes consumer food items under numerous familiar brands.

These include Helga’s Buttercup and Wonder White bread CSR sugar and Equal artificial sweetener Crisco ETA and Gold’n Canola oils Praise mayonnaise Meadow Lea and Olive Grove spreads and Meadow Fresh dairy products.

Like the rest of the food manufacturing industry Goodman Fielder has undergone vast changes over recent decades. In 2003 the company was acquired by former shipping and spice giant Burns Philp before being floated on the Australian Stock Exchange in 2005. In 2015 Goodman Fielder was purchased for $1.37 billion by a joint venture between Singapore-based Wilmar and Indonesia’s First Pacific. Wilmar took complete control of the company in 2019 buying out First Pacific for $425 million.

Wilmar International is the world’s biggest processor of palm oil and the largest producer of edible oils for the consumer market. It is also a major global producer of livestock feed soaps and detergents and one of the largest flour and rice millers in China.

In 2021 Wilmar recorded a net profit of $1.89 billion up 23.2 percent from 2020 from revenue of $65.79 billion a 30 percent increase on the previous year. The company’s main shareholders are the Kuok Group headed by Malaysian sugar property and hotel baron Robert Kuok and US-based multinational food processing corporation Archer Daniels Midland along with major institutional investors in the US and Asia.

Since purchasing CSR Limited’s sugar business for $1.75 billion in 2010 Wilmar has become Australia’s largest raw sugar producer and refiner processing more than half the country’s raw sugar about 80 percent of which is exported overseas. Wilmar’s Australian consumer and commercial sugar sales and distribution have been incorporated into Goodman Fielder.

To facilitate this massive export business Wilmar operates its own bulk freight terminal in Queensland. This is part of the company’s vertical integration strategy. Wilmar operates its own shipping line with 38 liquid bulk vessels 17 dry bulk vessels and owns 17 ports in Indonesia China and Myanmar.

This strategy was a critical motivation behind Wilmar’s 2015 acquisition of Goodman Fielder. At the time of the purchase the Financial Times noted: “The move illustrates the growing appetite among leading agribusinesses for acquisitions higher up the global food chain.” A consumer goods business whose major inputs are grains oils and sugar was regarded as a natural fit.

Wilmar and First Pacific saw the acquisition as a means of pushing well-established Australian and New Zealand brands into Asia to capitalise on demand from the growing middle class in the region for Western products.

First Pacific’s annual reports between 2015 and 2018 explain the twin objectives of the new management—slashing costs through restructuring in Australia and New Zealand especially in the baking area while driving up sales in China and the Asia-Pacific especially of long-life milk produced in New Zealand.

In the annual reports of Wilmar International a vastly larger outfit than First Pacific Goodman Fielder barely rates a mention outside of research and development projects and token environmental initiatives. This should be a warning to Goodman Fielder workers not just at Pampas—while the profits they generate are not enough to cause a blip on Wilmar’s radar losses such as the $34.5 million negative result in 2021 will not be tolerated and are likely to provoke sweeping cuts.

Before Goodman Fielder was acquired by Wilmar and First Pacific in 2015 it had already undergone several years of restructuring under the banner of Project Renaissance which aimed to slash $100 million in annual costs by 2015. In 2008 the company employed 8000 workers in 90 facilities in Australia New Zealand Papua New Guinea Fiji New Caledonia Indonesia Thailand and China. By 2014 the company had only 5500 workers.

The restructuring and cost cutting has continued under the new ownership. Financial records filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in 2022 show that by 2021 Goodman Fielder had just 3325 workers on its books.

In 2017 Goodman Fielder shut down four factories in Australia slashing 215 jobs. This included the closure of the company’s only factory in Western Australia cutting 75 jobs. To keep its brands on supermarket shelves Goodman Fielder contracted chief competitor George Weston Foods which owns the TipTop brand to produce Helga’s and Wonder White bread under licence. Also closed in 2017 were Goodman Fielder’s Carina and Hemmant facilities both in Brisbane Queensland.

In New Zealand in the same year Goodman Fielder closed two factories in Auckland and automated some warehouse operations in Auckland and Christchurch putting around 150 employees out of work.

The closure of smaller regional facilities and consolidation of operations into factories in the major cities was geared towards gaining maximum benefit from investment in machinery and automation as well as 24-hour operation. In May 2020 Goodman Fielder upgraded a number of its factories with new baking equipment automated ingredient handling systems and robotic pan stores in order to drive down manufacturing costs.

In 2021 ownership of Goodman Fielder’s Fiji Papua New Guinea and New Caledonia operations—which employ around 2000 people—was transferred to its Singaporean parent company. Workers should not assume that a restructuring operation of this size is an inconsequential administrative decision. Expansion in the Asia-Pacific was a key strategic consideration behind Wilmar’s acquisition of Goodman Fielder and the move to split this section of the company off from its Australian and New Zealand operations could be a sign of preparations to sell off parts of Goodman Fielder that are deemed to be underperforming.

In April 2022 39 workers at Goodman Fielder’s Palmerston North factory in New Zealand were made redundant after the company abruptly ended the production of cakes and slices under the Ernest Adams brand. The E Tū union which claimed to cover 98 percent of the Ernest Adams workforce did nothing to oppose the sackings noting only that workers had been “shocked by a significant restructure proposal.”

Pampas workers should take note. Working at the sole factory making a product line does not mean they are immune as Goodman Fielder will not hesitate to shut down production of an entire category if it is not satisfying their profit demands.

Continual cost cutting has become standard operating procedure in the global food production industry. Nestlé sets aside $US3 billion each year for restructuring costs. General Mills has slashed almost 10000 jobs since 2014 and closed at least 21 plants since 2005 as part of a never-ending chain of cost-cutting initiatives.

Pampas and Goodman Fielder do not exist in an economic and political vacuum. The ongoing US-NATO war against Russia in Ukraine has created major upheavals in many of Wilmar’s key products including oils fertiliser and grains. A global shortage of sunflower oil half of which is produced in Ukraine last year forced Goodman Fielder to reformulate many of its products including mayonnaise and salad dressings.

While the global wheat price has fallen dramatically from the record-high $US12.80 per bushel in May 2022 it is still almost double what it was in 2015 when Wilmar acquired Goodman Fielder. A renewed surge potentially driven by a breakdown in the trade corridor arrangements between Russia and Ukraine could have drastic consequences for the profitability of Goodman Fielder’s baking operations.

The centrality of China to Wilmar’s operations also poses a risk with the country’s economy already slowing and now facing upheaval as large sections of the population become infected with COVID-19 now that Beijing has adopted the same homicidal “herd immunity” policies as every other capitalist government. Trade with China and throughout Asia and the Pacific will likely be further disrupted as the US and its allies including Australia step up preparations for war against China.

It is vital that Pampas workers recognise that while they work in a small suburban factory earning less than $30 per hour their livelihoods are inextricably linked to decisions made in the boardroom of one of the 200 largest companies in the world. The actions taken by the billionaire owners of Wilmar International are driven exclusively by the demands of wealthy shareholders for ever-greater profits and dividends. The needs of the company’s 100000 employees count for nothing.

Pampas workers are not only up against local factory managers but the owners of Goodman Fielder and the giant Wilmar corporation. Any fight for decent wages and conditions necessitates a turn to the tens of thousands of workers in Australia New Zealand and throughout the region and internationally who similarly face soaring inflation and constant threats to their jobs and conditions.

This is impossible within the framework of the UWU which refused to even mobilise its members in other sections of the company including warehouse workers at the same factory relying on the draconian anti-strike laws enacted by successive union-backed Labor governments as the pretext for its suppression of a broader fight.

This was not an accident or tactical error by the union leadership but the product of the class role of unions as an arm of management. The vast profits of multinational corporations depend on the union bureaucracies dividing workers factory by factory and country by country.

Pampas workers need to take matters into their own hands and build a new fighting organisation a rank-and-file committee that is democratically controlled by workers and completely independent of the union. This committee will be the mechanism through which workers can develop a plan of action to fight for demands based on the actual needs of workers.

Such a fight inevitably means a political struggle against the capitalist system which places profit ahead of the jobs wages and very lives of workers and against the capitalist governments the state apparatus and trade unions that defend it. That fight needs to be waged on the basis of a socialist program that includes placing food giants like Goodman Fielder and Wilmar under public ownership and the democratic control of the working class.

We urge Pampas workers to vote no to the union-management sell-out agreement and to form an independent rank-and-file committee.

Sector performance

Despite the S&P 500 logging one of its worst years in recent history the energy sector performed well in 2022.

The S&P 500 Energy index generated a return of 65.7% during the year the highest of any sector by a significant margin.

The S&P 500 Utilities index was the only other sector to close 2022 with a positive return at 1.6%.

Did you pursue a career in that field first? And if so do you feel it contributed to your success in business?

Yes. I took a job with the United Parcel Service of America Inc. (UPS) in their Industrial Engineering department. I spent nine years with them working through various industrial engineering and operations management jobs. I believe my background in engineering provided a great foundation for methodical thinking that has been invaluable to me as I pursued new ventures in many different business areas.

""Combining an engineering degree and an M.B.A. is a sound educational path for any business career.”

How do you think your in-field experience before grad school prepared you to pursue an M.B.A.?

Going back for an M.B.A. after more than six years in the working world made it very enjoyable as I felt I could contribute to class discussions and roundtables. The insight I shared about corporate life and management along with what other alumni brought to the table benefited the students who went directly from their undergraduate program to graduate school.

What was your first job like after earning an M.B.A.? Did you initially have any setbacks and how did you overcome them?

Soon after I graduated from St. John’s University with my M.B.A. I left UPS to pursue a career in consulting. The most significant factor in facing new challenges is to believe in yourself. As a consultant you must sell yourself and your abilities to be an impactful team member. Having a solid educational background and work experience helps your self-confidence.

""You will always have setbacks in your career but you can learn as much from your successes and channel them toward future accomplishments.”

Were you always an entrepreneur or was there a specific turning point in your career?

This is a great question and I attribute the turning point to a specific class at St. John’s. I took what I remember as an organizational behavior class. We spent the entire semester reading and reviewing the original version of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey.

I truly embraced the learnings from that book in my personal life and realized that my goal was to pursue a career aligned with my values. I excelled when career opportunities allowed me to achieve that goal.

The desire to combine hard work with a passion for controlling the results of my efforts ultimately led me to explore my entrepreneurial side. Building a success story that motivates others became a personal challenge. I have been inspired by the small successes each year that have been the stepping-stones to building a growing enterprise.

What challenges do you often experience in your business that you believe graduate school helps you overcome?

Michael Chidester: It’s essential to prepare for the unknown and the unexpected. You must have the fortitude and positive energy to face the challenging realities of owning a business. The group work that makes up the majority of the St. John’s M.B.A. curriculum demonstrates the benefit of incorporating a variety of inputs to build the best solution. There are typically better ways to address a business challenge so the ability to listen to others and develop a collaborative approach is critical. Grad school provided that for me.”

What inspired you to pursue cheesesteaks?

Michael Chidester: I developed a love for cheesesteaks during my childhood when we took family vacations to the Jersey Shore. I became obsessed with eating a cheesesteak daily from a beachside grill in Cape May NJ. I then continued to try the Philly staple from as many spots in Pennsylvania as possible and unfortunately could not find a good one on Long Island. So it became my duty to the community to bring authentic Philly Cheesesteaks to Long Island!”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDEvMDMvanVzdGljZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LXBvc3RhbC1hYm9ydGlvbi1kcnVncy0wMDA3NjI3NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Justice Department clears Postal Service to carry abortion drugs into red states,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDEvMDMvanVzdGljZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LXBvc3RhbC1hYm9ydGlvbi1kcnVncy0wMDA3NjI3NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E30641F0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Quiet hiring is when an organization acquires new skills without actually hiring new full-time employees says Emily Rose McRae who has led Gartner's future of work research team since its 2019 inception focusing on HR practices. Sometimes it means hiring short-term contractors. Other times it means encouraging current employees to temporarily move into new roles within the organization McRae says. ""The reality for the next year is — whether or not we go into a recession — everyone's a little nervous"" she says. ""In a lot of cases organizations are not necessarily doing a hiring freeze or layoffs but maybe slowing down a little bit on their hiring."" But every employer still has financial goals to meet — often ambitious ones. ""The talent shortage that we talked about throughout 2022 hasn't gone away"" McRae says. ""So you're in a situation where it's harder to get head count and you have a desperate need for talent.""

Why quiet hiring is on the horizon

Hiring usually falls into one of three categories: backfilling old roles creating new ones to help the company grow or addressing an acute immediate need. Quiet hiring is all about that third category even if it doesn't technically involve any new hiring at all. The idea is to prioritize the most crucial business functions at a given time which could mean temporarily mixing up the roles of current employees. McRae refers to that as ""internal quiet hiring."" She cites a recent example: Australian airline Qantas which asked executives to address a labor shortage last year in part by rotating in as baggage handlers. ""The executives are doing it in part because it's the right thing to do to keep the company going but it's also just a rotation that makes sense for a lot of people"" McRae says noting that they also gained a deeper understanding of how their operations work. There's some inherent tension here: If you're temporarily reassigned to a different part of your company you might interpret that as being told that your regular job isn't particularly important. After all nobody's getting hired to backfill your old responsibilities. Bosses can help address that by clearly articulating why the specific project or business division is so crucial to the company's success. It'll help the employee feel valued and less likely to see the move as a sign that they need to start looking for jobs elsewhere. Alternatively companies with few movable employees can hire short-term contractors to help keep things afloat throughout the year. McRae calls that ""external quiet hiring."" ""We have to deploy our employees against the priorities that matter the most"" she says.

Cross-country ski at two of the nation’s top venues

Cross Country Ski Headquarters in Roscommon and Ironwood’s ABR Trails consistently make national lists of the best places to strap on skinny skis.

ABR (pictured above) voted North America’s fourth best cross-country ski resort in a 2019 survey by USA Today offers the greatest number of miles of groomed cross-country ski trails (62.7) in a single Michigan location. They are contained within an 1100-acre tract featuring a variety of landscapes along the Montreal River in the Upper Peninsula.

ABR is open from November through mid-March and trails measure from 1 to 8.5 miles. There are also 12.5 miles of snowshoe trails. On-site lodging ranges from luxury houses to rustic ski-in cabins next to trails. Lessons waxing and equipment rentals are available.

For more than a decade Coterra Energy has coordinated a shopping trip in support of efforts by Susquehanna County Interfaith Interfaith Friends which serves Wyoming County and the Wayne County Children’s Christmas Bureau.

Coterra and its industry partners spent more than $20000 at Walmart in Tunkhannock Pa. with carts overflowing with toys clothing and other gift items then a crew outside the store loaded them into a trailer.

“There’s probably nothing better than putting a smile on a kid’s face” said Matt Sheruda of Down to Earth Equipment Rentals of Montrose. “It’s a great feeling to have the opportunity to give back to the community this way.”

“It makes me feel good” Shawn Jagger of RLE Enterprises concurred. “I actually asked this year if I could do it.”

Rebecca Peterson of Folsom Engineering also had a combination of clothing and toys in her cart including several Squishmallows. “That is ‘the’ gift this year” Peterson said assuredly.

The annual shopping trip is coordinated by Bonnie Morris of Coterra and Cindy Beeman executive director of Susquehanna County Interfaith. The trailer returned to Coterra’s headquarters in Dimock where employees matched the purchased gifts with tags supplied by the partnering organizations representing actual requests from children and other family members.

The number of children registered for the holiday initiative often tops 800 and includes 150 to 200 families. That figure increased during the pandemic and has remained consistent with the high inflation that followed. The Christmas gift program takes a big burden off parents who want their children to have a happy holiday.

One might think all children care about at Christmas is toys but that is not the case – especially in recent years. In addition to art and school supplies youths ask for clothing bedding and sweatshirts. “Things that keep them warm” said Beeman noting that high school students increasingly put more practical items on their wish lists. One teenage boy asked for tools to work on his car.

In addition to the aforementioned participants in the shopping initiative included Moody & Associates United Drilling Rain For Rent Resource Environmental Ampro Northern Tier Industry Education & Consortium Lackawanna College School of Petroleum & Natural Gas Western Environmental C2G Select Energy and GasSearch Drilling Services a subsidiary of Coterra. Walmart supports Interfaith throughout the year including the agency’s Back to School program.

Additional support for Interfaith from Chesapeake Energy Southwestern Energy Dandy Mini Marts and PennDOT helps close the gap on holiday and winter needs like socks and pajamas food and gas cards. Many churches groups and individuals also contribute funds toward gifts and other winter needs.

“It’s not so much that there are more people that we are serving” said Beeman. “But we are able to go deeper to help break the cycle of poverty.”

After they were wrapped tagged and delivered to the agencies’ offices the gifts were distributed by December 25 to put them under the tree for Christmas morning."

A UnitedHealth Group data center in Elk River hit the top of the charts for industrial sales last year in a year-end transaction.

An entity of JP Morgan Chase & Co. sold the building at 14100 Business Center Drive NW for $90 million last week to an affiliate of global data center provider CloudHQ according to a recently published certificate of real estate value. The single-tenant property is approximately 239000 square feet setting the price tag at about $377 per square foot.

The property sits just south of Highway 10 on the western edge of town where it’s surrounded by multiple government facilities a golf course a Target data center and commercial properties.

JP Morgan Chase declined to comment and CloudHQ did not respond to requests for information.

The deal marks the top individual industrial transaction of last year overtaking the $54 million sale of a Best Buy warehouse in Bloomington that traded for about $93 per square foot. That also beats the sale of the Waters Business Center a six-building portfolio that nabbed $37.1 million or about $113 per square foot.

Elk River specializes in data centers. “A cooperative economic development department reliable electrical power and sufficient water capacity combine to make Elk River a very desirable location for Data Centers” according to the city website.

UnitedHealth Group has more than 435000 square feet of data center space between two properties in the city. Elk River is also home to data centers occupied by Thomson Reuters Target Unisys and other companies.

CloudHQ’s purchase of the building comes months after the Washington D.C.-based company cleared its first hurdle to building 1.4-million-square-foot data center in Chaska where the company has said it plans to invest $1 billion.

The company’s website says it has designed and developed more than 7 million square feet of data center space. It currently holds land capable of delivering 20 million square feet of data center space.

While data centers don’t offer as many jobs as manufacturing plants they employ people in highly paid roles.

In nearby Becker an Xcel Energy spokesperson told Finance & Commerce that it’s looking at plans near the Sherco coal plant.

“As part of that work we are coordinating closely with Elk River Technologies which plans a turnkey data center development on land that is currently part of our Sherco coal plant site” Kevin Cross Xcel’s senior media relations representative told F&C in an email last year. “This project will provide up to $1 billion in capital investments to the city of Becker as well as 100 high-paying permanent jobs and more than 1200 construction jobs.”

Among the most active VC investors has been General Catalyst which boasts a portfolio of more than a dozen behavioral health-focused companies from Eleanor Health and Elemy to Rippl and SonderMind. Managing Partner Holly Maloney has helped spearhead the firm’s behavioral health efforts.

“Behavioral health in particular has been a really strong focus area for us” Maloney told Behavioral Health Business. “And for myself in particular.”

In addition to Eleanor Elemy Rippl and SonderMind other examples of General Catalyst’s behavioral health investments include Circulo Equip Health and Osmind. The firm’s strategy Maloney explained has been to back businesses that “think about things holistically” and support whole-person care as opposed to operating with a very siloed approach.

That’s partly why it has its fingers in everything from autism treatment to eating disorder recovery.

“Everything is centered around our health assurance investment thesis which is focused on making our system more personalized proactive at a lower cost and creating greater accessibility for marginalized communities” said Maloney who co-leads the 10-person health care investment team at General Catalyst.

Along with its own portfolio General Catalyst has 15 partnerships with health systems where it serves as their strategic innovation arm. That growing list includes Banner Health Intermountain Healthcare and Universal Health Services Inc. (NYSE: UHS) the latter of which operates a network of over 330 behavioral health facilities.

While many firms have only targeted the behavioral health space since the COVID-19 pandemic the Cambridge Massachusetts-based General Catalyst has been exploring it since 2018 when the firm had its first mental health summit Maloney said.

“This was … well before COVID when the massive light was shown on the crisis that’s in our country” she said.

Building ‘an ecosystem of companies’

Mental health startups especially have seen high levels of venture capital interest since the middle of 2020.

Through the first full three quarters of 2022 there were at least 225 funding deals in mental health last year according to the latest quarterly data from CB Insights. The year prior saw at least 349 funding deals.

Combined over 2021 and 2022 mental health investment totaled more than $7.5 billion.

General Catalyst has been a part of some of the biggest individual fundraising rounds during that stretch. In April addiction treatment and mental health provider Eleanor Health announced a $50 million Series C. A month later Osmind – a company building a community and care platform for people with treatment-resistant mental health disorders – announced a $40 million Series B.

“We’re just really focused on developing and investing in an ecosystem of companies that is going to together break down those silos that have existed between mental and physical health for a really long time” Maloney said.

Broadly there are five pillars to General Catalyst’s health care investment strategy.

As Maloney previously noted the firm aims to support up-and-coming companies that break down silos and expand access to care. Patient-therapist match platform SonderMind is a good reflection of that concept.

“It’s really hard to get connected into care – never mind in real time but arguably ever” Maloney continued. “[We’re] focused on companies that are really focused on creating that access layer. That led to early investments in businesses like SonderMind companies that were insurance-enabling therapists so that they could think about a much wider patient population and really bring that near real-time connection into care.”

On top of those two pillars General Catalyst looks to invest in companies focused on outcomes and risk-taking models.

Population-specific business models and workforce support are likewise key focuses for the firm. Rippl – a technology-enabled startup that launched with the mission of better serving older adults with mental health conditions including dementia – is an example of those two pillars.

Founded by the former Starbucks Corp. (Nasdaq: SBUX) executive Kris Engskov Rippl came out of stealth mode in September armed with $32 million in seed funding.

“It’s no news to anyone that we have this massive workforce crisis and so we’re really focused on companies that are looking to meaningfully expand that workforce” Maloney said. “For many years [Engskov] was in the C-suite of Starbucks which may not sound like a natural progression but he then ran a long-term care facility. I think of Starbucks as one of the first workforce-transformation companies because they fundamentally rethought what it meant to be a barista. How do you recruit talent? How do you train and educate?”

Higher-acuity care to define 2023

While recent years have seen an influx of VC going into the behavioral health space some are forecasting 2023 to be more tepid due to the overall state of the U.S. economy. That may translate into fewer funding deals but it could also simply mean smaller funding rounds and more conservative investments.

In anticipation of having to stretch their cash reserves many VC-backed companies have already started cutting costs by trimming their staff.

Even a few of the behavioral health startups in General Catalyst’s portfolio have been impacted by this trend. In fact SonderMind Eleanor and Elemy all made cuts toward the end of last year BHB previously reported.

“Given the current economic conditions we made the decision to accelerate our path towards profitability in order to ensure we can remain independent and continue delivering high quality technology-assisted mental health care” SonderMind CEO and co-founder Mark Frank told BHB in an email.

Maloney doesn’t expect a major pullback with behavioral health in 2023 however at least not when it comes to General Catalyst and its long-term vision.

“You may have fewer super-broad horizontal firms coming in and plopping in giant checks” she told BHB. “But we’re just about to start investing out of our dedicated health care fund. And I have a pretty high degree of confidence that … a lot of that is going to go toward mental health. We’re certainly not slowing down.”

As far as trends that will define behavioral health investment in 2023 Maloney sees a heightened focus on higher-acuity care.

So far a lot of the investment activity has revolved around highly scalable lower-acuity models that are more understood. That’ll soon change she believes.

2022 showed investors why it is important to consider energy stocks for their portfolios.

For the most part of the last decade investors chased new-age technology stocks and overlooked the energy sector which was in the middle of an expensive transition to renewables.

In 2022 energy stocks outperformed broader markets despite high inflation and rising interest rates as elevated oil and gas prices helped these companies post record revenues and profits. Here we name some of the best energy stocks to watch and the energy sector outlook.

What are energy stocks?

Energy stocks refer to companies associated with the exploration production and distribution of energy sources like crude oil natural gas coal and renewable fuels.

The energy sector is crucial to the global economy. Without energy cars will not run factories will not function devices will not turn on and the world would come to a standstill.

Today the energy sector is at a crossroads. Industry insiders are working on new solutions to lower the dependence on fossil fuels. Global warming and climate change concerns and the limited supply of fossil fuels are driving innovation in the sector.

Despite the leaps made over the years in the adoption of renewable power generation our world still remains heavily dependent on oil coal and natural gas. According to Enerdata non-renewable sources made up about 72% of global electricity production in 2021.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) classified the primary sources of energy as oil gas coal renewables and nuclear.

There were two energy companies in the CompaniesMarketCap’s list of the top 10 largest companies in the world by market capitalisation as of 3 January. Middle East energy juggernaut Saudi Aramco was the world’s second largest company valued at $1.887trn. US-based Exxon Mobil (XOM) came in ninth at a market valuation of $454.24bn.

Energy sector trends for 2023 and beyond

If you are looking for the best energy stocks to buy in 2023 you will need to be aware of ongoing trends and developments in the sector.

Global energy crisis

2022 was a year that saw energy prices surge to multi-year highs following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Crude oil prices rose to trade over the $100 per barrel mark as the West imposed economic sanctions on Russia one of the world’s top three crude producers.

Brent crude oil live price chart

The natural gas market saw supply disruptions with European countries affected the most due to their over-dependence on Russia for gas imports. The high fuel prices and tight supply resulted in a “shock to the system” that had “far-reaching implications for households businesses and entire economies” said the IEA.

While consumers were the clear losers from the crisis energy producers saw windfall profits in 2022. The agency added:

“High energy prices are causing a huge transfer of wealth from consumers to producers back to the levels seen in 2014 for oil but entirely unprecedented for natural gas.”

Unsurprisingly energy producers dominated the list of the most profitable companies in the world taking up five spots in the top 10 compiled by CompaniesMarketCap on 3 January 2023.

Saudi Aramco was the highest earner in the world above tech giants Apple (AAPL) Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL). Other energy companies on the list were New York-listed Equinor and Exxon Mobil (XOM) Anglo-Dutch energy major Shell (RDS) and Brazil’s Petrobras (PBR).

Renewables sources of energy gain momentum

Over the years governments have come together to push for a green energy transition. Over 196 nations adopted a legally binding international treaty on climate change called the Paris Agreement in 2015.

The treaty aimed to “reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century”.

Another significant deal for the energy sector was the European Green Deal signed in 2019 to lower greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.

There is pressure from governments activists and shareholders on energy firms to transform their business away from fossil fuels that are considered “dirty”. As pointed out by ING:

“The share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix has been stubbornly high at around 80% for decades. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) this share needs to come down to 22% by 2050 in a net-zero economy.”

Energy companies are investing billions to increase their share of renewable energy. The elevated energy prices and windfall profits seen in 2022 are expected to help fossil fuel companies in this expensive transition.

How to select energy stocks to buy?

When searching for the best energy stocks to watch in 2023 market participants can sort companies by the following criteria:

Market capitalisation

Market capitalisation or market cap in simple words is the market valuation of a company which can be calculated by the share price multiplied by the number of shares. It is the total dollar market value of the number of outstanding shares of a security.

Companies gain high market valuations based on their financial health future prospects and upbeat investor sentiment.

Revenue and earnings

The revenue and earnings of energy companies are heavily dependent on the state of energy prices during the reporting period.

As mentioned earlier energy producers saw record revenue and profits in 2022 following a surge in energy prices.

Market participants looking to invest in top energy stocks should note that energy prices are volatile. Energy prices are dependent on global demand-supply dynamics. Leading oil-producing regions like the US and OPEC+ nations exert significant influence on energy prices.

Debt

Energy companies spend enormous amounts of capital on exploration drilling and production from new sources. These exploration projects are carried out based on geographical studies that may or may not lead to full realisation of expected results.

Moreover the transition of the sector to green energy sources has forced energy companies to invest in renewable energy. These initiatives are expensive and may require the company to take on debt.

Market participants should monitor if a company’s debt is at sustainable levels. Financial metrics such as debt-to-assets and debt-to-equity ratios are useful.

Environmental social and governance (ESG)

ESG is an important standard that market participants should be aware of. ESG investing refers to investing only in those companies that meet a set of environmental social and governance standards.

For energy companies environmental standards may refer to their commitment to reducing greenhouse emissions and increasing their share of renewables. Socially it could also mean safeguarding the interest of the native population by drilling sites. Governance standards refer to a company’s management internal controls and shareholder rights.

List of top-performing energy stocks

In our top energy stocks list we referred to the S&P 500 Energy Index. It consists of energy companies included in the US benchmark S&P 500 (US500).

In 2022 all of the 23 components of the S&P 500 Energy posted yearly gains underscoring investor preference for energy stocks amid elevated crude oil and natural gas prices during the year.

Here are the top energy companies from the S&P 500 Energy index based on their market performance over the last five years as of 3 January 2023 compiled by Trading View.

Hess Corp (HES)- 195%; ConocoPhillips (COP) - 114%; Marathon Petroleum (MPC) - 76%; Marathon Oil (MRO) - 58%; Targa Resources (TRGP) - 50%; Devon Energy (DVN) - 47%; Chevron (CVX) - 42%; Valero Energy (VLO) - 37%; Exxon Mobil (XOM) - 31%; Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) - 31%.

Energy sector forecast for years ahead

Financial services company Fidelity expected conditions of tight energy supply and rising demand that helped the energy sector post a “strong year” in 2022 to continue in 2023.

Maurice Fitzmaurice sector portfolio manager at Fidelity said this was due to the long lead time to ramp up new supply and refining capacity:

“For 2023 barring a severe global recession I believe that outperformance could continue as many of the forces that propelled the stocks in 2022 could persist. Oil and gas demand should continue to grow in 2023 as economies continue to rebound from the pandemic. And supply is likely to remain constrained due to disruptions related to the Russian war in Ukraine and years of low investment in production.”

Elsewhere McKinsey & Co expected the global energy mix to shift towards power synfuels and hydrogen rapidly and to make up 32% of the global energy mix by 2035 and 50% by 2050.

The company said crude oil demand is projected to “decline rapidly” only after 2030. McKinsey said natural gas will play a “pivotal role throughout the transition by its wide range of applications” with its demand projected to peak by 2035.

When researching the best energy stocks it’s important to remember that analysts’ forecasts can be wrong. Remember that past performance does not guarantee future returns.

Always conduct your own due diligence before trading looking at the latest news technical and fundamental analysis and a wide range of commentary. This article should not be used as a one-stop shop in your research.

Remember there are no guarantees. Markets are volatile. Never trade more money than you can afford to lose.

La nueva ley que fue firmada por la gobernadora Kathy Hochul y entra en vigencia en 2024 permite que las tiendas de mascotas trabajen con refugios para ofrecer animales rescatados o abandonados en adopción.

Este es un negocio muy grande. Nueva York tiende a ser un gran comprador y especulador de estos molinos y estamos tratando de reducir la demanda a nivel minorista” dijo el senador demócrata Michael Gianaris.

MIRA TAMBIÉN:

Agregó que la industria de las fábricas de cachorros trata a los animales “como mercancías” y dijo que “no hay tienda de mascotas que no se vea afectada”.

Las tiendas de mascotas han argumentado que la ley no hará nada para cerrar a los criadores de otros estados o aumentar sus estándares de atención y dijeron que resultaría en el cierre de las docenas de tiendas de mascotas que quedan en Nueva York.

California promulgó una ley similar en 2017 convirtiéndose en el primer estado en prohibir tales ventas. Si bien esa ley requiere que las tiendas de mascotas trabajen con refugios de animales u operaciones de rescate como lo está haciendo Nueva York ahora no regula las ventas de los criadores privados.

Le siguieron un puñado de estados. En 2020 Maryland prohibió la venta de gatos y perros en las tiendas de mascotas lo que provocó el rechazo de los dueños de tiendas y criadores que impugnaron la medida en los tribunales. Un año después Illinois prohibió a las tiendas de mascotas vender cachorros y gatitos criados comercialmente.

MIRA TAMBIÉN:

En Nueva York los grupos de defensa de las mascotas han pedido durante mucho tiempo el cierre total de las instalaciones que crían y venden animales con fines de lucro diciendo que los animales se crían en condiciones inhumanas antes de enviarlos a las tiendas.

Emilio Ortiz gerente de la tienda de mascotas Citipups en la ciudad de Nueva York dijo que la nueva ley podría servir como una sentencia de muerte para el negocio en el que ha trabajado durante más de una década.

El noventa por ciento de nuestro negocio es vender perros. No vamos a sobrevivir a esto” dijo Ortiz quien considera injusta la prohibición para las tiendas que trabajan con criadores responsables. “Están cerrando a los buenos actores junto con los malos actores”.

Jessica Selmer presidenta de People United to Protect Pet Integrity una coalición de propietarios de tiendas de mascotas de Nueva York calificó la ley de “descuidada” y “contraproducente” y dijo que espera que el gobernador “considere remedios legislativos para algunas de las trampas del proyecto de ley”.

La nueva ley no afectará a los criadores domésticos que vendan animales nacidos y criados en su propiedad.

Lisa Haney que cría perros en su casa de Buffalo junto a su esposo dijo que apoya la ley.

Una tienda de mascotas cerca de mí obtienen perros de todo el Medio Oeste y diferentes instalaciones grandes y no tienes idea de dónde vienen y quién es el criador. La gente no tiene ni idea y se lleva al cachorro” dijo Haney.

Su negocio Cavapoo Kennels se enfoca en parte en criar perros hipoalergénicos para personas que tienen alergias y su modelo de negocio opera según las necesidades. La lista de espera va de seis a 12 meses lo que garantiza que cada perro termine en un hogar.

MIRA TAMBIÉN:

Gianaris dijo que la ley permitirá a los compradores ser más conscientes de la procedencia de sus mascotas.

Si un consumidor fuera a un molino y viera las terribles condiciones no compraría estos animales” dijo. “Tratar con un criador permite que las personas vean de dónde viene su perro y elimina a los intermediarios que sirven como una forma de eliminar las horribles actividades que tienen lugar en el molino”.

(FDA por sus siglas en inglés) accederá por primera vez a que las farmacias minoristas ofrezcan píldoras abortivas en el país según ha anunciado la agencia a pesar de que cada vez más estados intentan prohibir el aborto con medicamentos.

“En virtud del Programa REMS de la mifepristona en su versión modificada el Mifeprex y su genérico aprobado pueden ser dispensados por farmacias certificadas y bajo la supervisión de un prescriptor certificado” dijo la agencia en su página web el martes.

El Mifeprex es la versión comercial de la mifepristona que en combinación con un segundo fármaco llamado misoprostol que tiene varios usos entre ellos la gestión de abortos espontáneos induce un aborto hasta las 10 semanas de embarazo en un proceso conocido como aborto farmacológico.

FDA autoriza la venta de píldoras abortivas en EE.UU.: ¿Cuáles son las condiciones para obtenerla?

Las farmacias de EE.UU. ya pueden empezar a solicitar la certificación para distribuir la píldora abortiva mifepristona con una de las dos empresas que la fabrican (Danco Laboratories y GenBioPro) y si la obtienen podrán dispensarla directamente a las pacientes pero siempre que cuenten con una receta actualizada de un médico certificado.

La FDA había dicho por primera vez que haría estos cambios en su normativa en diciembre de 2021 cuando anunció que relajaría algunas estrategias de evaluación y mitigación de riesgos o REMS sobre la píldora abortiva que habían estado en vigor desde que la agencia la aprobó en el 2000.

Los cambios incluían la eliminación permanente de las restricciones al envío por correo de las píldoras y su prescripción a través de la telesalud (o atención sanitaria a distancia).

En este sentido el cambio normativo ampliará potencialmente el acceso al aborto en un momento en que la administración del presidente Joe Biden se debate sobre la mejor manera de proteger el derecho al aborto. Este derecho se vio fuertemente restringido el año pasado después de la decisión del Tribunal Supremo de anular la histórica sentencia Roe vs Wade y las prohibiciones estatales que la siguieron.

¿Las píldoras abortivas pueden ser adquiridas en todos los estados de EE.UU.?

El cambio normativo de la FDA no garantiza que se proporcionará un acceso igualitario a todas las personas señaló en un comunicado GenBioPro empresa que fabrica la versión genérica de la mifepristona.

Esto se debe a que las prohibiciones del aborto algunas de ellas dirigidas contra la mifepristona han entrado en vigor en más de una docena de estados desde que el Tribunal Supremo de Estados Unidos anuló el derecho constitucional a interrumpir el embarazo.

De esta manera las mujeres de esos estados deberán desplazarse a otros para poder obtener la medicación.

Opiniones divididas sobre la venta de píldoras abortivas: ¿Es seguro o peligroso?

La presidenta del grupo antiabortista SBA Pro-Life America Marjorie Dannenfelser afirmó que la última medida de la FDA pone en peligro la seguridad de las mujeres y la vida de los niños no nacidos.

Sin embargo los registros de la FDA muestran un pequeño número de casos de mortalidad asociados a la mifepristona. Hasta junio de 2021 había informes de solo 26 muertes relacionadas con la píldora de los 4.9 millones de personas que se calcula que la han tomado desde su aprobación en septiembre de 2000.

Verizon officially turned down its 3G network on the final day of 2022. It had been the last holdout among national mobile network operators with AT&T and T-Mobile US already having completed their 3G shutdowns.

Verizon first began announcing in 2016—seven years ago—that it was planning a 3G shut-down in 2019. However the operator decided to delay the decommissioning first by one year (to the end of 2020) and ultimately to December 31 of 2022.

The carrier indicated in March of 2021 that it had been working with customers who still had 3G devices to migrate them to 4G or 5G-capable devices and that less than 1% of its customers were still using 3G at that point. Verizon indicated that customers who need help starting 4G or 5G service should call customer service at 800-922-0204.

AT&T phased out its 3G network in February of 2022. T-Mobile US has been undergoing an extensive network rationalization since its acquisition of Sprint both to reduce network costs as well as to migrate technologies. T-Mo shut down Sprint’s 3G CDMA network in March of 2022—after a two-month delay prompted by protests from Dish Network which wanted more time to transition the Boost Mobile customers which it had acquired from Sprint—followed by a turn-down of the Sprint LTE network in June 2022 and finally by the sunset of its own 3G UMTS network in July 2022. However the carrier has so far left its 2G network intact with no firm date set for a 2G shutdown.

While some rural operators continue to operate 3G networks the national network shutdowns pose an abrupt end to service for individuals and companies which rely on those legacy networks that are reaching the end of their operational life and not all customers are willing or able to be transitioned. Dish Wireless for instance reported that despite the additional two months that it was given to transition users around 126000 of its customers did not migrate off of the old T-Mo/Sprint 3G network before it was shut down. The Rural Wireless Association was among parties which asked the Federal Communications Commission in 2021 to step in and delay 3G shutdowns because its members were reporting degraded 3G availability even before the official shut-down dates; the Alarm Industry Communications Committee also wanted an extension of 3G service in order for companies to transition devices ranging from alarm systems and ankle bracelet trackers elevator emergency phones and emergency radios for lone workers in industries in isolated places such as agriculture and oil and gas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml0cHJvLmNvbS9pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS9uZXR3b3JrLWludGVybmV0LzM2OTc4Ni92ZXJpem9uLWVuZHMtM2ctc3VwcG9ydC1pbi11cy1maW5hbGlzZXMtbmF0aW9ud2lkZS1zaHV0ZG93btIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon ends 3G support in US finalises nationwide shutdown,"Verizon has officially decommissioned its 3G code-division multiple access (CDMA) networks becoming the last major US telco to do so.

Verizon announced that as of 31 December 2022 its 3G CDMA network was no longer functional in line with moves made by other US mobile network operators (MNOs) such as AT&T which ended its 3G support in February 2022.

The move essentially ends 3G access across the country. A single smaller operator UScellular originally committed to shutting its network down without a specified timeframe but later clarified that it also ended its 3G service on New Year's Eve.

Businesses using devices only capable of accessing 3G networks such as older models of mobile phones tablets or diagnostic machinery will no longer have network access. This applies even to emergency calls and numbers registered to accounts that have not migrated to more advanced networks by February will be disconnected.

Many businesses that still use 3G devices have worked with Verizon to create migration plans that will enable them to quickly switch to 4G and 5G-capable equipment.

Plans had been in place since 2016 to wind down the network and Verizon notified customers about the change well in advance. As a result the company reports that less than 1% of its customers still access the 3G network.

Network shutdowns of this kind referred to as the ‘sunset’ by MNOs have been planned by MNOs for a long time. Sunsets have allowed MNOs to focus on advanced network services such as 5G cut maintenance costs for older networks and to reuse frequencies previously reserved for 2G and 3G services.

“Initially we announced we would close down our 3G network in 2019” stated the telecoms giant in a blog post.

“However we extended our shut off date to the end of 2022 in order to care for our customers and give them every effort to minimise disruptions to their service as they moved to newer and more advanced technologies.

“That outreach included proactively communicating through billing messages digital and traditional outreach and even sending some customers updated devices proactively.”

2G has already been discontinued by the major US MNOs. AT&T ended support for its own 2G network in 2017 Verizon 2G was phased out in 2020 and T-Mobile started its own 2G sunset in December 2022.

3G services around the world

For services in the UK Ofcom has published an outline for shutting down 3G services including the provisionary dates that each UK MNO is aiming to cease their individual services. Vodafone is aiming to sunset all 3G services in the country by the end of 2023 while EE and Three are targeting early and late 2024 respectively.

In December 2021 the UK government confirmed that UK MNOs will cease 2G services by 2033 at the latest though it is likely that some will choose to shut down 2G networks prior to this absolute deadline.

Network availability across the EU is a mixed picture with some countries ahead of the US and UK on sunset targets. Germany Italy and the Netherlands have all discontinued 3G access and regulatory intelligence provider Cullen International has claimed MNOs in 22 EU countries plan to or have already switched off their legacy networks.

Many EU countries are aiming for a 2025 shutdown of 2G services which could impact internet of things (IoT) devices that currently rely on the technology to send and receive data such as first-generation smart meters.

India’s Airtel sunset 3G in 2020 and plans to do the same for its 2G network by the end of 2023. Japan sunset 2G as far back as 2012 though is only aiming to discontinue its 3G networks by 2026.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzAxLzAzL3Zlcml6b24taXMtZG93bi0zNi1mcm9tLWl0cy1oaWdoLXRpbWUtdG8tYnV5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon Is Down 36% From Its High.

Expectations are high for this year in the CRISPR research community as the world’s first therapy based on this technique nears a potential FDA approval.

CRlSPR gene editing has long attracted attention in the research community the media and the wider public. This peaked in 2020 when the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to two leading CRISPR researchers Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier. However the field has also faced controversies. In December 2019 He Jiankui a Chinese scientist was sentenced to a three-year imprisonment after news broke of him using CRISPR technology to edit human embryos that led to the birth of three babies. Jiankui was reported to have been released in 2022.

Additionally a legal battle between Feng Zhang and scientists from the Broad Institute and Harvard and Jennifer Doudna from the University of California over who invented the technique and patents linked to it has ensued in recent years. In February 2022 the US Patent and Trademark Office declared that the Broad Institute could keep its patents for CRISPR-Cas9 editing in eukaryotes and thus humans. Nevertheless questions surrounding the ultimate ownership of the technology remain as patent offices in other countries have reached different conclusions.

While some gene therapies work by adding functional copies of modified genes to correct a defect gene editing via CRISPR or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats can target and modify specific DNA sequences. A guide RNA leads the Cas9 enzyme to a targeted DNA sequence which can be edited for the desired change. Importantly CRISPR editing is more accessible than other methods making CRISPR-based research easier and more affordable.

Still no therapies that use this approach are approved yet. But this could soon change. At the 2022 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) some of the most advanced CRISPR-based treatments in development for the treatment of blood disorders were showcased. Of these the gene therapy made by CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals exagamglogene autotemcel–also known as exa-cel is the closest to a potential approval. Both companies plan to complete the therapy’s BLA submission for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia (TDT) by the end of Q1 2023 following positive data.

Clinical successes like exa-cel are bringing the potential of a CRISPR-based treatment closer to patients. “The momentum is real. 2021 was great and 2022 was even better” says Rodolphe Barrangou PhD Todd R. Klaenhammer Distinguished Professor in probiotics research at North Carolina State University Raleigh. Barrangou is the co-founder of Cambridge Massachusetts-based Intellia Therapeutics a developer of CRISPR gene therapies where he remains a member of the scientific board. In 2023 it will be important to continue testing such treatments in Phase I trials in diverse indications and patients for the next generation of gene therapies he says.

Although the first approval will be a milestone for CRISPR therapies some experts interviewed by Pharmaceutical Technology emphasised that the industry is making progress even outside of potential approvals and late-stage trials. This year will be critical for the establishment of regulatory precedents in CRISPR gene editing which some experts say is essential for the field’s further development.

Blood disease treatments lead the way

Trials of CRISPR-based treatments for hematological diseases such as SCD were particularly successful in 2022 says Guillermo Montoya PhD research director of the Protein Structure & Function Program at the University of Copenhagen.

Dr. Martin Steinberg professor of medicine Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine Massachusetts says exa-cel’s clinical success represents a certain milestone. “It is a landmark. Not a very long time ago it was unbelievable that you could do such a thing around the expression of a gene that was mainly suppressed and that will result in what appears to be a cure or a near cure” he says.

According to results from the Phase II/III CLIMB SCD-121 trial in SCD shared at last year’s ASH all 31 treated patients remained free of vaso-occlusive crises. The median time from exa-cel infusion to last red blood cell transfusion was 19 days.

Exa-cel is not the only product in clinical development that captured the attention of experts in the field. The SCD therapy OTQ923 which is being developed by Intellia Therapeutics and Novartis is in a Phase I/II study. Further study is warranted based on preliminary results from a study where two patients who were treated with OTQ923 saw improvements in their fetal haemoglobin levels says Dr. Akshay Sharma research associate at St. Jude Children’s Hospital in Memphis Tennessee an investigator on that trial.

In 2023 several companies are expected to deliver more news. Editas Medicine is aiming for a clinical update from the Phase I/II RUBY trial which tests the CRISPR-Cas12a therapy EDIT-301 in SCD in mid-2023. Intellia plans to file an IND for NTLA-3001 a CRISPR-mediated therapy for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency sometime this year. The company also plans to start a Phase II study for NTLA-2002 a CRISPR therapy for hereditary angioedema in H1 2023. Additionally Graphite Bio expects proof-of-concept data from a Phase I/II study in mid-2023 for its SCD treatment nula-cel. Nula-cel is part of the UltraHDR platform which the company describes as the next generation of gene editing.

Establishing regulatory framework important

However alongside clinical advances Barrangou says that progress in this field should not be reduced to a binary understanding of approvals and failures. According to him clearing the regulatory aspects of CRISPR research represents one of the major challenges to look out for the year.

“I think we have to see a convincing buy-in with more INDs filed in the US and the FDA having a heightened sense of urgency and collaboration with some of these companies to keep that momentum moving forward. That could be a little bit of an unknown for some of the analysts regulators and companies” he says.

Following the approval a pricing framework for CRISPR-based therapies also needs to be established. Exa-cel’s potential price will be important particularly in the context of potential competition from bluebird bio notes Sharma. bluebird’s approved gene therapy for TDT Zynteglo costs $2.8 million in the US and has previously faced questions over its pricing. Zynteglo is not a CRISPR-based therapy but instead uses a lentiviral vector to add working copies of beta-globin into the patients’ hematopoietic stem cells.

More work needed in other conditions

An important achievement in the coming months will be a further strengthening of the number of CRISPR clinical trials says Montoya. Testing CRISPR-based therapies in clinical trials for different diseases would show that the technology can be safe he explains. This could then provide confidence in testing the treatment for more complex diseases he notes.

In November 2022 the American biotech Verve Therapeutics announced that its IND application for a potential Phase I trial of its therapy VERVE-101 in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) was placed on hold by the FDA. In a letter the FDA requested further preclinical data on the risks of germline editing and the potency differences between human and non-human cells. However the Phase I heart-1 trial of this therapy is still underway in New Zealand and the UK.

In other conditions like epilepsy researchers are trying to understand the efficacy of potential CRISPR systems in terms of how many neurons can be affected by a treatment says Gabriele Lignani PhD associate professor of Clinical & Experimental Epilepsy at University College London’s Queen Square Institute of Neurology. The degree of a CRISPR-based treatment’s effect remains unknown given the complexity of brain diseases he says.

Lignani’s research includes studying how CRISPR systems can be used to treat genetic conditions such as Dravet syndrome. The next milestone in this area will be conducting long-term toxicity studies particularly in larger animals. According to Lignani a big challenge for CRISPR-based treatments in the brain is the immune system’s response to Cas9 expression.

Developing CRISPR therapies for these complex indications remains a long-term goal. Montoya says the development of new approaches and technologies to target complex diseases where multiple genes are involved will be the next frontier. “[That] may be one of the remaining and long-standing challenges that we will have to address in the future” Montoya says.

Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to: our other strategic initiatives including potential and completed divestitures and the transactions closed today may not achieve their intended benefits within the expected timeframe or at all; the implementation of our global restructuring initiatives and integration activities being more difficult time consuming or costly than expected or being unsuccessful; the potential impact of public health outbreaks epidemics and pandemics including the ongoing challenges and uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic; the Company's failure to achieve expected or targeted future financial and operating performance and results; actions and decisions of healthcare and pharmaceutical regulators; changes in healthcare and pharmaceutical laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad; any regulatory legal or other impediments to Viatris' ability to bring new products to market including but not limited to ""at-risk"" launches; Viatris' or its partners' ability to develop manufacture and commercialize products; the scope timing and outcome of any ongoing legal proceedings and the impact of any such proceedings; any significant breach of data security or data privacy or disruptions to our information technology systems; risks associated with international operations; the ability to protect intellectual property and preserve intellectual property rights; changes in third-party relationships; the effect of any changes in Viatris' or its partners' customer and supplier relationships and customer purchasing patterns; the impacts of competition; changes in the economic and financial conditions of Viatris or its partners; uncertainties and matters beyond the control of management including general economic conditions; and the other risks described in Viatris' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Viatris undertakes no obligation to update these statements for revisions or changes after the date of this release other than as required by law.

In particular the statements in this release that Viatris anticipates these acquisitions have the potential to add at least $1 billion in sales by 2028 relate to Viatris' Phase II strategy in 2024-2028 and its related goals targets forecasts objectives and commitments (such statements the ""Phase II Outlooks""). Viatris believes that the assumptions used as a basis for these Phase II Outlooks are reasonable based on the information available to management at this time. However this information is not fact and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such information. While certain of these statements might use language that imply a level of certainty about the likelihood that Viatris will attain these Phase II Outlooks it is possible that Viatris will not attain them in the timeframe noted or at all. These Phase II Outlooks reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause these Phase II Outlooks not to be achieved or that may change the underlying variables and assumptions on which these Phase II Outlooks were based and cause these Phase II Outlooks to differ materially include but are not limited to risks and uncertainties relating to our planned acquisitions and divestitures including whether such transactions are completed on the expected timelines or at all failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions or divestitures failure to receive the anticipated cash proceeds of any divestitures inability to manage base business erosion failure to bring new products to market on the expected timeframes or at all failure to execute stock repurchases consistent with current expectations stock price volatility higher than anticipated SG&A gross margins and R&D spend industry performance interest rate volatility foreign exchange rates tax rates the regulatory environment and general business and economic conditions as well as those set forth in the first paragraph of ""Forward Looking Statements"". In addition although certain of the outlooks are presented with numerical specificity they are still forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Further these Phase II Outlooks cover multiple years and such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. Accordingly there can be no assurance that any aspect of these Phase II Outlooks will be realized or that actual results will not differ materially. Therefore you should construe these statements regarding these Phase II Outlooks only as goals targets and objectives rather than promises of future performance or absolute statements.

Hospira which is owned by Pfizer recalled one lot of its vancomycin hydrochloride injection vials at the 1.5-gram dose because of glass particles in the vials.

Accord for its part pulled a lot of 500-mg daptomycin after receiving a complaint from a hospital pharmacy about mislabeled cartons.

In the lot of Hospira injections one vial was observed with two visible glass particles in it the FDA said in a recall announcement in late December. Pfizer has not received reports of adverse events related to the recall the agency added. The lot contained 100 vials and was distributed nationwide in the U.S. and Puerto Rico from June 23 through Sept. 19.

As for Accord its 500 mg daptomycin injections have been pulled for being incorrectly labeled as another dosage strength.

Both companies and the FDA ask that wholesalers distributors doctors and institutions with discontinue use of the lots and stop distribution.

Daptomycin is used to treat complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by certain bacteria. Vancomycin hydrochloride meanwhile is an antibiotic approved to treat serious or severe infections caused by certain strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococci which is known as a superbug that can cause difficult to treat staph infections. The antibiotic can also treat septicemia bone infections lower respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections.

This wasn't Hospira’s first recall of 2022. In June the company kicked off a similar recall after an internal inspection found visible particles in two vials of its 100-mL propofol injectable emulsion.

Buffalo Bill’s Hotel-Casino in Primm reopened on Christmas Eve after being closed since March 2020 because of the pandemic. It is one of three casinos operated by Las Vegas-based Affinity Gaming in the community along Interstate 15 at the Nevada-California border.

The privately held company did not make any formal announcement about the re-opening other than a post on the Primm Valley Resorts Twitter site saying it was proud “to have the reels spinning again at Buffalo Bill’s.”

Representatives from Primm did not respond to emailed questions about the reopening. Buffalo Bill’s was the last of the three Primm casinos to reopen.

In the Twitter statement Primm Valley said “multi-million-dollar upgrades” would be coming to the casinos in 2023.

Primm said slot machines and table games were available at the casino along with the Wagon Wheel Grill restaurant although a Nevada Independent photographer found only a handful of customers a few days after Christmas.

The Desperado Rollercoaster at Buffalo Bill’s remained closed. It was considered one of the world’s tallest roller coasters when it opened in 1994 with a height of 209 feet and a drop of 225 feet with a portion of the track running through the casino.

Affinity then known as Herbst Gaming acquired the three Primm casinos – Buffalo Bill’s Primm Valley and Whiskey Pete’s – from MGM Resorts in 2007 for $400 million. Herbst Gaming filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy two years later.

The company was rebranded as Affinity Gaming in 2011 following the bankruptcy reorganization. Affinity is now owned by Illinois-based Z Capital Group which took Affinity private in 2017. In 2019 Mary Beth Higgins was named CEO.

Affinity operates five casinos in Nevada – the three Primm properties Silver Sevens in Las Vegas and Rail City in Sparks. The company also owns two casinos in Missouri and a casino in Iowa.

GAN deal with WynnBet increases reach for the sports betting platform

Sports betting software provider GAN Ltd. is awaiting licensing by Nevada gaming regulators. But the absence of that approval hasn’t slowed the company’s growth in the continuously evolving market.

The Irvine California-based company which has offices in Las Vegas announced an agreement in late December to provide the sports betting platform and technology to WynnBet the sports betting subsidiary of Wynn Resorts operated by Wynn Interactive.

Terms of the deal between GAN and Wynn were not announced. In a statement GAN said its sports betting technology would be used for the retail sportsbook and online sports betting operations at Encore Boston Harbor when the activity launches in Massachusetts in the next few months.

GAN already provides the online platform for WynnBET’s operations in Michigan. Nevada licensing could eventually lead to GAN becoming the supplier for Wynn’s sports betting in Nevada which currently includes just a retail sportsbook at Wynn Las Vegas.

“We look forward to growing our partnership with GAN and bringing an enhanced sports betting experience to our players” Wynn Interactive President Ian Williams said in a statement.

The agreement with Wynn follows an announcement by GAN in October 2021 to build out the sports betting infrastructure for Station Casinos retail sportsbooks betting kiosks and the STN mobile app.

GAN’s technology and platform are being used by the sportsbook at the Island View Casino in Gulfport Mississippi.

GAN Vice President of North America Sports Rob Lekites said in a statement the company has developed a strong partnership with WynnBET in Massachusetts.

“The reception of GAN Sports remains highly encouraging as we look to carry this positive momentum into a strong cadence of new partner launches over the coming quarters” Lekites said.

In a research note Macquarie Securities gaming analyst Chad Beynon said Wynn and Station Casinos give GAN “two major partners.” He suggested GAN’s Massachusetts sports betting opportunity through Wynn would translate into $2.6 million of revenue and an annual cash flow of $700000.

GAN Vice President of Investor Relations and Capital Markets Robert Shore said in an email the deal with Wynn is “an exclusive national agreement” and additional markets “will be disclosed at the appropriate time.” He said GAN didn’t want to reveal much more to be respectful of the Nevada licensing process.

The company has caught the attention of the investment community as it moves to expand its presence in the ultra-competitive U.S. sports betting market. Ohio became the nation’s 31st state with legal sports betting when it launched on New Year’s Day.

During the Global Gaming Expo in October the GAN booth drew a strong share of interested customers.

VICI contributing $350M toward Fontainebleau’s $2.2B financing package

Real estate investment trust VICI Properties was part of one last Strip deal before 2022 ended.

The company will contribute $350 million toward a $2.2 billion construction loan package that will allow developers of the Fontainebleau resort to complete the long-stalled north Strip project.

Fontainebleau Development and Koch Real Estate Investments announced the loan package on Dec. 23. The Fontainebleau project restarted in November 2021 when the original Florida-based developer reacquired the 25-acre site nine months earlier. The project sat unfinished for 12 years after construction was halted in 2009.

“We believe the addition of the property will contribute to the increased vitality of the north end of the Las Vegas Strip” VICI CFO David Kieske said in a statement.

VICI is the Strip’s largest landowner controlling more than 660 acres that house a dozen properties leased to four companies – MGM Resorts International Caesars Entertainment Apollo Global Management and Hard Rock International.

Last year VICI completed a $17.2 billion buyout of rival real estate investment trust MGM Growth Properties and was part of a $6.25 billion purchase of the Strip properties that were operated by Las Vegas Sands Corp. VICI also owns the 77 acres underneath The Mirage whose operations were purchased in December by Hard Rock from MGM Resorts for almost $1.1 billion.

“VICI wraps an active 2022 which completely changed the complexion of the company increasing its size enhancing visibility with the investment community and upgrading portfolio quality” JMP Securities gaming analyst Mitch Germain told investors in a Dec. 17 research note.

VICI said in its statement the Fontainebleau investment would be funded in accordance with a construction draw schedule.

Fontainebleau Las Vegas is expected to open later this year with 3700 hotel rooms a casino 550000 square feet of convention and meeting space and a collection of dining retail and lifestyle attractions.

Following the construction financing announcement Fontainebleau named five executives who will oversee the day-to-day operations of the property including former Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas Vice President Colleen Birch who was named chief operating officer.

Maverick Gaming adds four more Washington cardrooms in an $80.5M deal

Privately held Maverick Gaming expanded its presence in Washington State acquiring four cardroom casinos for $80.5 million at the end of December.

The company which owns four hotel-casinos in West Wendover and Elko took over operations of Evergreen Gaming’s cardrooms in the Seattle area. Maverick now owns and operates 23 of Washington’s 44 licensed cardrooms.

“Strategically this acquisition is crucial to Maverick’s continued dominance in Washington State” Maverick Gaming CEO Eric Persson said in a statement. “We expect there to be enormous consolidation as well as operational and marketing benefits to our company as a result of this transaction.”

Cardrooms in Washington are limited to a total of 15 table games which can include baccarat poker and variations of blackjack.

Maverick which moved its corporate headquarters from Las Vegas to the Seattle community of Kirkland is seeking to add sports betting to its mix. The company failed in 2020 and 2021 to get the Washington Legislature to include cardrooms in legislation that allowed the state’s tribal casinos to offer sports betting.

Last year Maverick filed a federal lawsuit claiming the state unlawfully granted Native American casinos a “discriminatory tribal gaming monopoly.”

Maverick also owns three casinos in Colorado in Central City and Black Hawk which are 45 minutes outside of Denver.

$5.3B in casino revenue in 2022 marks Macau’s lowest in 18 years

Macau — once the world’s largest gambling market — ended 2022 with its casino industry reporting its lowest 12-month gaming revenue total since 2004.

China’s zero-COVID policies which included travel restrictions quarantines and business shutdowns put a damper on Macau casinos throughout the year. The constraints led to a final revenue figure of $5.3 billion a 51.4 percent decline from 2021 according to a report released by Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau on New Year’s Day.

One positive sign from the December numbers was gaming revenue of $435 million was 13 percent higher than November’s single month total.

However even as China has publicly stated plans to move beyond its zero-COVID policy Stifel Financial gaming analyst Steven Wieczynski said investors shouldn’t get too excited. In a research note published Monday Wieczynski predicted Macau “won’t become more ‘normal’ until after March.”

He said the positive signs that the Chinese government is changing from its “harsh COVID stance” could be upended by any spikes in the virus.

“We still believe the next couple of months will be a roller coaster as China goes through the Covid wave” Wieczynski said. “Investors have to understand the market probably won’t go into recovery mode until mid-2023 at the earliest.”

The gaming revenue results were announced shortly after Macau finalized its relicensing process with its six casino operators on new 10-year agreements. The companies including MGM Resorts International Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands agreed to invest upward of $15 billion into non-gaming entertainment attractions.

To put Macau’s gaming revenue decline into perspective casinos collected a record $45 billion in 2013 with analysts predicting the market would hit $100 million in a few years. Last year yielded one-ninth the revenue of 2013.

Economic conditions in China and a crackdown on the junket industry which delivered large-spending customers to the casinos led to revenue declines over the next six years resulting in $36.6 billion in gaming revenue in 2019 a year before the pandemic upended Macau’s gaming industry.

In 2020 Macau casinos reported gaming revenue of $7.56 billion its lowest figure in 14 years following the cancellations of Chinese New Year celebrations in January a 15-day casino shutdown in February and six straight months of 90 percent gaming declines.

The market rebounded in 2021 to $10.8 billion.

When the final numbers are counted the American Gaming Association suggested the combined gaming revenue from commercial and tribal operations could top $100 billion in 2022.

“We saw increased consumer demand coming out of the pandemic that’s been sustained. And operators have done a really good job in terms of serving those customers. Our industry probably doesn’t get enough credit for how innovative we always are about creating experiences that our customers want.”

Disgraced former gaming executive Steve Wynn is looking to sell a huge swath of his personal real estate for close to $300 million. Wynn the former chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts listed two adjacent Sun Valley Idaho properties for $27 million after listing a Palm Beach residence for $78.5 million and a New York City penthouse for $90 million. Wynn has also sought $100 million for the Beverly Hills estate he listed last year. He sold his Las Vegas home for $17.5 million in June records show.

Wynn is “not an easy seller. He wants what he wants” in terms of price. “Otherwise he doesn’t sell.”

The Nevada Gaming Commission approved new cybersecurity regulations to protect operators’ information systems from attacks that could shutter casinos and compromise customer data. Casinos are required to do a risk assessment of their systems by the end of 2023. Properties are also required to report any successful breach that compromised player or employee data credit card information and/or other records to gaming regulators within 72 hours.

“It doesn’t mean they can wait 72 hours to respond or react to the cyberattack but to notify us. We felt that was limited enough time that the Board if there were risks to the industry as a whole could take necessary measures to mitigate damage to other participants in the industry.”

She has worked as a TV producer social media intern radio anchor and data reporter in internships fellowships and jobs for Al Jazeera Politifact an NPR-affiliate radio station nonprofit Investigative Reporters and Editors and more. And when Xu graduated in 2019 with a master’s degree in journalism from the University of Missouri-Columbia she was going to become a data journalist.

Instead she applied to more than 70 jobs over the next year and a half most of which she never heard back from. Of those who did engage her some stopped following up after learning about her need for a visa sponsorship.

“Sometimes the identity is so ingrained I don’t see myself as a person I see myself as an international student who is disadvantaged” she said.

Maybe if I were even more skilled they would take a chance on me Xu thought. Unable to travel back home to China during the outbreak of COVID-19 and with her one-year post-graduation visa expiring Xu took up a second master’s degree in data analytics.

After completing her second degree two years later Xu was still faced with $10000 in attorney and immigration fees for a shot at an O-1 “Alien of Extraordinary Ability” visa which would allow her to stay and work in the U.S. for three more years.

Should it be this hard?

As newsrooms ramp up diversity initiatives and reexamine their hiring practices recruiters continue to leave out international students pursuing journalism in the United States. They are graduates from prestigious programs who like Xu struggle to get hired or have job offers rescinded due to their foreign status.

Upon graduation international students may apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT) a permit that allows them to work in the U.S. for up to a year or three years if their degree is a STEM-designated program. Students who want to stay beyond that must go back to school or switch to another work visa which in most cases is either the H1-B which uses a lottery system or the O-1. However many newsrooms refuse to sponsor any visas due to paperwork high fees and unpredictable wait times.

“You are investing in someone who’s going to be a permanent employee” said Theodore Kim director of career programs at The New York Times. “So typically if you are sponsoring someone it is someone who is at the very top of their field.”

Elizabeth Mayoral Corpus graduated with a master’s in journalism from the University of Southern California in 2019. Mayoral Corpus dreamed of working as a TV reporter in America — it’s dangerous to do journalism back home in Mexico especially as a woman. She soon learned how impossible it would be to land even an entry-level position.

“I remember recruiters were really excited to interview me for jobs but once they asked me if I needed sponsorship there my interview stopped” she said. “They’d say ‘You’re amazing and your professors have recommended you so much but we can’t do anything. Good luck.’ ”

Mayoral Corpus recalls how other times job applications would abruptly end during the electronic screening stage with a “Thank you for applying” after she checked the “Yes” box in response to whether she might need sponsorship in the future. “They didn’t even have a chance to know who I was.”

Other international students such as Xinyan Fu who graduated from Emerson College in 2022 with a bachelor’s degree in journalism have said they’ve had to go to great lengths to navigate around the tricky work sponsorship question.

“Some of my friends have suggested (I) swap my Chinese name to my English name so people will at least give me a first interview” she said.

The few job offers Mayoral Corpus did get that summer including a dream gig as a digital producer for a TV station in Texas co-owned by CBS and Telemundo would never be realized. She had to turn them all down because U.S. immigration took half a year to process her OPT work authorization. International students typically wait an average of three to five months for immigration to process their OPT though students aren’t allowed to work and it’s very risky for them to leave the country during the interim. As a result Mayoral Corpus had to stay with friends as she was applying to jobs throughout the summer and turn down opportunities she would have gotten had she not been waiting for her visa.

“I had amazing professors in USC and they had a lot of faith in me and hope in me. They told me ‘You’re going to be such a great reporter we have so much expectations on you.’ And I felt so frustrated because I graduated with no opportunities” she said. “Nobody wanted to hire me because of (the visa).”

“I feel like a failure to all of them.”

Securing the initial one-year work authorization however solves only half the problem. When they are applying for an OPT in the spring international students must put down what date they want their work authorization to start within 60 days after they graduate. It’s essentially a guessing game: Putting a start date that’s too late could bar students from accepting early offers as they cannot work yet but putting a start date that’s too soon before opportunities have surfaced could cut into their unemployment time.

Fresh grads on OPT cannot be unemployed for more than 90 days cumulative. It’s a tremendous stressor in a relatively unstable industry characterized by short-term contracts and frequent layoffs.

Grace Gao applied to around 200 jobs after graduating with a master’s in journalism at USC in May 2022. Her OPT allowed her to start working in July though she couldn’t find a job that was not on a short-term contract basis within three stressful months. And so she was forced to leave for home effectively ending her dream of staying in the U.S. as a reporter.

“It wasn’t worth it for me to stay in the States and worry about my visa every single day” said Gao who moved twice after she graduated as she was uncertain when she would have to relocate next.

The day she landed in China the American newsroom she had hoped to join emailed her to tell her she made it off their waitlist and extended an offer. It was too late.

As for Mayoral Corpus she now commutes up to 90 minutes daily across the U.S.-Mexico border to report for a local American newspaper. She is currently on a nonimmigrant visa exclusive to Canadian and Mexican professionals but those who don’t come from those countries must rely mainly on just two other ways to stay in the U.S. after their OPT expires.

The most common one is the H1-B visa a system for employers to sponsor foreign employees to work in the States for a few years. But many newsrooms including The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times explicitly state they will not sponsor new visas for applicants to their prestigious fellowships. Journalism job applications typically do not mention citizenship or sponsorship requirements.

A 2019 analysis done by Ruby Yuan as his senior capstone project at USC Annenberg showed that the majority of U.S. media organizations have filed 10 or fewer H1-B visa sponsorships for journalism-related jobs in the past three years. The low rates may be due to the fact that even after a company pays and files the paperwork to sponsor an employee the employee is subject to a lottery system that makes their chances of getting to stay uncertain. In contrast tech and business companies such as Google and McKinsey file thousands of sponsorships every year.

“The sponsorship process can take many months and our fellowship is only for a year” said Kim who noticed visa questions have become tougher over the years. “That’s to say nothing of the cost of sponsorship which can be in excess of $10000 dollars” he adds. “Every year we’re bringing in 30-35 fellows. It’s cost prohibitive.”

The other alternative for international students is to apply for an exceptional abilities visa. If granted the visa would allow applicants to stay in the U.S. for three years circumventing the uncertainty of the H1-B lottery. It’s the same visa that Justin Bieber and Nobel laureates are on and the one Xu paid for to stay in the country. Fees to attorneys and immigration can range from $6000 to $10000.

If it’s hard in print journalism it’s nearly impossible in broadcast. After she graduated from USC in 2019 Dongyao Nie reached the final round of interviews at a few major TV news networks only to be told that they have a hard “no” policy for sponsorship when she finally brought up the matter.

She has a theory about why: “Broadcast is already so competitive so why would they need a foreigner?”

Nie eventually managed to land a job at Al Jazeera as a researcher but left after realizing there was zero path for career advancement as a contract employee who could be terminated at short notice. She left the U.S. to anchor for a major news network in Hong Kong.

“It’s kind of discriminatory — you’re open to any race sexual orientation but why not a foreigner?” she said. “We’re not inferior to anybody just because we need a visa sponsorship. We’re really diligent and responsible and we can bring you different perspectives to local reporting.”

Even those who have secured a job could have their offer rescinded due to their visa status. This worst-case scenario was the reality for at least three other international students interviewed hoping to be journalists in the U.S. Bulbul Rajagopal who graduated from USC in 2020 was hired by one of the largest daily newspapers in the nation but her offer was rescinded because they decided not to sponsor her visa.

“You know what? I was good enough to get hired. The offer got rescinded because of the visa not because I wasn’t good enough. It gave me the extra push to keep on applying” Rajagopal said. She added that she wished newsrooms were more upfront and transparent about their hiring policies for non-U.S. citizens in need of sponsorship. The good news is that the local newspaper in California where she now works is sponsoring her and even covered a portion of her visa fees.

Degree programs have also failed to prepare students for the realities of being an international student pursuing journalism in the U.S. said Gao who thinks colleges should be upfront about expectations and job prospects – and prepare international students for future legal hurdles – before they enter the program.

“I didn’t know until a recruiter told me two months before I graduated which is already too late for me to build up my portfolio in visual storytelling” said Gao. Had she known she would have pursued something more technical such as data visualization in a STEM-certified program. In recent years some journalism degrees such as ones from Northwestern University and New York University have attained STEM certification.

Rajagopal argues that more newsrooms should consider hiring international students because of their cultural diversity language skills and the living experiences and perspectives that come from being raised in another country. These are qualities that give their reporting great depth she says.

“Everyone talks about America being a melting pot. But if that’s the case newsrooms should reflect that” Rajagopal said. “So many people came from so many different countries and American journalism can stand to have that as well.”

“There is a bit of a financial strain but it’s worth it” Rajagopal added. “International students will pay you back in dividends in the work they do.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRpbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UvZW4vbWkvcmVzZWFyY2gtYW5hbHlzaXMvc2VjdXJpdGllcy1maW5hbmNlLWRlY2VtYmVyLXNuYXBzaG90LTIwMjIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Securities Finance December Snapshot 2022,"December revenues $1.044bln

2022 revenues are highest in recent history $12.521bln

Corporate bonds finish the year with a bang

Government bond revenues increase during December

Securities finance revenues finished 2022 on a high generating $1.044bln during December (+4% when compared with November and +20% YoY). Despite balances being 6% lower YoY (-1%MoM) average fees increased 27% YoY (+0.5% MoM) and average utilization increased 5% YoY (-2% MoM).

Full year revenues for 2022 benefitted from the strong returns that were generated throughout Q4 2022 $3.034bln (+12.1% when compared with 2021). $12.521bln was generated over the course of the year which is an increase of 14.8% on 2021 and 34% on 2020. 2022 was the best year for securities finance revenues since the global financial crisis in 2008 ($13.2bln).

Revenues across most asset classes increased when compared YoY. Both Americas (+42%) and EMEA (+35%) equities saw impressive growth in revenues along with government (+27%) and corporate bonds (+58%). December was a strong month for fixed income assets as both corporate and government bonds had their best performing month of the year during December ($98.64m and $191.88m respectively). ADRs (-26%) experienced a decline which is a trend that has been witnessed throughout 2022 along with ETPs and Asian equities.

Average fees remained elevated when compared YoY across all asset classes with a strong 27% YoY increase. Average fees were higher for every month of the year when compared with 2021 and the year average was 5bps higher in 2022 when compared with 2021. The 2022 average fee was 45bps (Q1 38bps Q2 46bps Q3 48bps Q4 46bps).

As can be expected with the decline in asset valuations during the month on loan balances declined both MoM (-1%) and YoY (-6%). The only asset class seeing an increase in the value of stock on loan (+15% YoY) was EMEA equities. Average balances for all securities peaked in Q2 in 2022 and fell steadily throughout the year (Q1 $2.91bln Q2 $2.921bln Q3 $2.766bln Q4 $2.63bln).

Americas Equity

During a year where the main US indices have shed more value than at any point since the financial crisis in 2008 (DJIA -8.78% NASDAQ -33.1% S&P 500 -19.44%) securities finance revenues for the region remained very strong. $4.774bln in revenues was generated over the year with Q4 generating $1.057bln (Q1 $978.59m Q2 $1.245bln Q3 $1.492bln). $358m in securities finance revenues were generated during the month of December. This is an increase of 42% when compared YoY and an increase of 2% MoM.

Average fees were 8bps higher (70bps) for 2022 when compared with 2021. This is the highest yearly average since 2020 (81bps). Fees for the asset class rose throughout the year as market valuations declined. The increase in fees is reflective of the increased amount of specials activity that was seen in Americas equites throughout the year.

When December's numbers are compared YoY growth in revenues (+42%) average fees (+43%) and utilization (+15%) are all very impressive. MoM comparisons are less strong however with only increases seen in average revenues (+1.8%) and average fees (+2.7%). Average utilization decreased over the month (-2%) with average balances remaining flat.

Americas equities continues to be the most important contributor to equity revenues (48% during the month and 38% over the year). The top revenue generating stock of the month was Microstrategy (MSTR). As reported last month the stock remains under pressure following the fallout from the collapse of crypto exchanges and the prevailing uncertainty experienced in the broader crypto market (Bitcoin -64.21% over 2021). The software sector has increased in attractiveness from short sellers over the last two months of the year and is now one of the most shorted sectors in Americas equities (as reported in the December long /short report). Beyond Meat remains popular amongst borrowers and is one of the top revenue generating stocks of 2022 ($195.265m). Many of the other names seen in the table are well documented from previous snapshots. The EV sector continues to see interest from borrowers as interest rate increases are making car finance more expensive which has the potential to impact demand. Competition also continues to grow as the more traditional automobile makers are looking to make the switch to electric. Fisker Inc (FSR) generated more in borrow revenues throughout December than any other month of the year. The stock generated $73m in revenues over 2022. Lucid Group (LCID) another EV stock is likely to be the highest revenue generating stock of 2022 ($263.9m) and remains in focus from short sellers. Visa Inc (V) made the top ten during the month and remains a popular borrow (2022 revenues $73.55m).

APAC equity

APAC equities generated over $2bln in securities finance revenues throughout 2022 which is a 1.3% increase over 2021. Q4 was the second highest revenue generating quarter of the year (Q1 $534.87bln Q2 $504.5bln Q3 $504.6bln Q4 $507.8bln) and December ($178m) was the third highest revenue generating month of 2022 (March $205.6m and September $179.1m).

During December average revenues (-10%) balances (-1%) and fees (-8%) were all lower when compared YoY. When comparing MoM the inverse was true with revenues increasing 8.4% balances increasing 4% and average fees increasing 1bps (1%).

Taiwan was the best performing market of the year generating 27% of the regions revenues ($548m). Over the month however Hong Kong regained the top spot with its highest revenue generating month of the year ($48m). As China announced the end of its zero COVID policy throughout the month of December the market has benefited from a renewed focus. Half of the top ten highest revenue generating stocks over the month were listed on the HK exchange.

When compared YoY (entire 2022 vs entire 2021) Japan experienced a decline in average revenues of 2.8%. Average fees declined 7% but utilization increased 27% to 6.13%. Japan has traditionally been an important country in the APAC region for securities finance revenues given its size and was the second most important throughout 2022 in relation to full year revenues.

Both Malaysia and South Korea saw decreases in revenues and average fees throughout the month of December. When compared YoY revenues have decreased 70% in Malaysia. Average fees declined 47% YoY and on loan balances decreased by $325m (-42%). Interest in this market has reduced dramatically throughout 2022 despite lendable supply decreasing by 5%. Malaysia continues to be operationally heavy when compared with some of the other markets in the region with permissible borrow lists also having an impact upon activity.

In South Korea the reemergence of short selling bans continued to impact market activity when compared with December 2021. Revenues declined 49% when compared for the month of December on YoY basis average balances declined 17% YoY and average fees declined 39%. Despite the monthly declines revenues increased 5.1% on a full year basis for this market as average utilization for the year was significantly higher than during 2021 (5.69% 2022 vs 3.05% 2021). Average utilization was significantly higher for the first six months of 2022 when compared with the first six months of 2021.

Australia continued to shine throughout the month of December with a 24% increase in revenues YoY. December was the second highest revenue generating month of the year for this market. Average fees were 46% higher YoY and have remained close to 100bps throughout the year. Both average revenues and fees increased when compared MoM. Australia has two stocks in the top ten revenue generating names for the region Lake resources Nl (LKE) and Perpetual (PTT).

As mentioned in the previous month's snapshot Perpetual continues to be a popular borrow as the company's share price continues to struggle. Active utilization in this name remains high and the company currently has 21% of its outstanding shares on loan.

Within the region real estate stocks such as Country Garden Holdings Co Ltd (2007) remain popular borrows given the fragilities surrounding the Chinese property sector. Retail EV and consumer durables all remain key sectors for borrowers in this region.

EMEA equity

Securities finance revenues totaled $115m for the month of December for EMEA equity. This is an increase of 35% YoY but a 14.7% decrease when compared MoM. 2022 full revenues for the region totaled $1.495bln. This represents a 1% increase when compared with 2021 despite the region suffering a decline of 24% in lendable assets over the year. Q4 was the second highest revenue generating quarter of the year (Q1 $276.3m Q2 $574.6m Q3 $295.8m Q4 $347.8m). France was the highest revenue generating country of 2022 ($296m). This represents a 34% decrease on 2021 ($447.9m) however.

Sweden continues to generate strong returns for lenders and experienced a 104% increase in revenues when compared YoY. 2022 revenues for Sweden are 35% higher when compared with 2021 ($223.3m). Average fees (1.08%) are 94% higher in this market YoY.

France generated the highest revenues throughout the month. The country benefited from additional revenues generated from an increase in both borrow fee and on loan quantity for Totalenergies (TTE) and Orange (ORA). Both stocks paid a dividend during the month.

Many countries across the continent contributed to the increase in revenues experienced YoY. Germany the UK Switzerland Norway the Netherlands and Finland all noted increases YoY when compared with December 2021. Utilization increased across most countries with Germany experiencing a 94% increase. Germany continued to be the most heavily utilized EMEA market across lending pools during the month with 10.2% of all stock on loan.

Many of the top revenue generating borrows will remain familiar to regular snapshot readers. Volkswagen preference shares entered the table during the month. The preference shares are identical to the ordinary shares but they do not entitle the holder to voting rights. As a result an arbitrage opportunity has been created between the two lines.

Varta Ag remains a popular borrow and throughout 2022 this stock generated more than $51m in making it the highest revenue generating EMEA equity of 2022. Other top revenue generators throughout the year also appear in the table below these including Samhallsbyggnadsbolaget I Norden Ab (SBB B) which generated more than $22m in revenues and International Airlines Group (IAG) which generated $22m.

ADRs

ADRs generated $33m in revenues throughout the month of December which represents a decline of 26% when compared YoY. When compared MoM December's revenues are 37% higher than November.

Across the course of 2022 ADRs generated $302.9m in revenues which represents a 43.5% decline when compared with the full revenues of 2021 (Q1 $51.4m Q2 $68.6 Q3 $103.2m Q4 $79.7m). ADR securities finance performance has suffered greatly during 2022 due to the ongoing issue between the Chinese and US governments transparency requirements in relation to accounting practices. This issue has led many investors to invest in local lines rather than ADRs. This has had a knock-on effect in the securities lending markets as the number of transactions has declined.

Top ADR borrows remain concentrated in the EV sector with Polestar (PSNY) and Xpeng (XPEV) as the highest revenue generating stocks for the month. Despite reporting record deliveries last month according to S&P Global Mobility Auto Intelligence Xpeng remains under pressure from short sellers as the COVID restrictions on factory workers throughout the month of November continued to affect production. Polestar generated more than $45m of revenues during 2022 and continues to demand elevated borrow fees. KCE Electric (KCE-R) is a new name in the list and is a hard to borrow stock that is 94% utilized in the market.

ETPs

ETPs generated $847m in revenues throughout 2022 (Q1 $215.1m Q2 $238.1m Q3 $204m Q4 $189.6m). This represents a 34% increase when compared to 2021. Americas ETPs continued to dominate these revenue streams - 82% of December's revenues and 86% of the full year revenues. When compared with 2021 revenues generated from Americas ETPs increased 42.5% ($725m 2022 vs $508m Q1 $183.8m Q2 $204.8m Q3 $172m Q4 $164.3m). European ETPs contributed 11% of the full year revenues and 12% of the monthly revenues. When compared with full year revenues for 2021 European ETPs experienced an increase of 9.3% (Q1 $23.6m Q2 $24.7m Q3 $25.4m Q4 $19.1m).

For the month of December revenues generated by ETPs declined by 17% both YoY and MoM. On loan balances also declined YoY along with average fees (-10%) and average utilization (-20%). Average fees were down significantly when compared with November (77bps Nov vs 63bps Dec). Significant fee compression was seen across the high yield and corporate bond ETF borrows as inflation figures in both the UK and US were reported lower than expectation. Easing inflation subsequently lowers pressure for further aggressive interest rate hikes which affects the yields / prices of these assets. Speculation in the financial press also alludes to corporate bond fund activity increasing as investors start to see value at current market levels.

Many of the top revenue generating borrows have remained the same throughout 2022. In Europe iShares MSCI China generated the highest revenues. This stock generated $13.9m in securities finance revenues over the course of 2022. Uncertainty in China regarding the zero COVID policy has boosted demand for this stock and increased borrowing fees. High Yield assets continued to dominate the ETP activity in the region.

In the Americas a similar picture can be seen. Small / mid cap indices and high yield proxies all appear in the top revenue generating names. HYG moved to third place throughout the month as fees reduced given the easing pressures on corporate bonds. Throughout 2022 HYG generated $106m in securities finance revenues for asset owners. December was the lowest revenue generating month for this ETF by a significant margin.

Government Bonds

As was expected government bonds generated more revenues during December than at any other month throughout 2022. The asset class produced $191.8m in revenues throughout December which is an increase of 19% MoM and 27% YoY. Throughout 2022 the asset class generated $1.85bln in revenues (Q1 $420.3m Q2 $442.8m Q3 $472.3m Q4 $514m). Average fees also increased both MoM (+10.8%) and YoY (44%). Fees for government bonds increased throughout 2022 (Q1 13bps Q2 14bps Q3 16bps Q4 19bps) making the 2022 average 15bps. This is 19% higher than the 13bps average that was seen in 2021.

Utilization across government bonds was 9% lower YoY at 23.4%. Utilization remained lower throughout most months of 2022 (Q1 25% Q2 26.48% Q3 24.7% Q4 23.57%) when compared with 2021 with only June and September posting 1% increases YoY. As the assets have been more expensive to borrow however revenues have remained higher for every month other than January which saw a decrease of 4.7% YoY (Jan 2022 $138.47m vs Jan 2021 $145.23m).

Demand in both the US and Europe remained strong for short dated government bonds throughout the month. Demand for government bonds is likely to remain driven by inflation the size of future interest rate hikes and the impact that these changes have on the financial markets and the broader economy. The financial press has reported that they believe that US inflation may have peaked in June 2022 but it is likely to take up to two years for inflation to return to the 2% target. As the decline in inflation is taking place without a subsequent decline in employment there are glimmers of hope that in the US a ""softer landing"" may be achieved. A less aggressive FED or even a FED pivot in 2023 should prove to be bullish for asset prices (rates products equities corporate bonds). The subsequent impacts upon quantitative tightening and the reduction of central bank balance sheets will continue to dictate the amount of liquidity and the subsequent demand to borrow government bonds as we head into 2023.

Corporate Bonds

Corporate bonds continued their impressive year generating $98.64m during December. This was an increase of 58% YoY and 7.7% MoM. Over 2022 this asset class generated $963.1m in securities finance revenues which is the best performance for many years (+82% higher than during 2021). Q4 was the best performing quarter for the asset class generating $275.8m in revenues (Q1 $204.9m Q2 $231.6m Q3 $250.76m).

Average fees for corporate bonds were also significantly higher over both the month (+4%) and the year (+67%). The average fee for corporate bonds increased throughout the year. Average fees for December were 46bps (22bps 2021) and averaged 36bps over the year (22bps 2021) (Q1 29bps Q2 33bps Q3 37bps Q4 43bps).

Corporate bond lending has benefited from a hawkish interest rate environment throughout 2022. As interest rates have increased asset prices have fallen providing numerous opportunities for borrows. If inflation rates have started to fall and if interest rate increases slow as a result then corporate bond borrowing activity could begin to soften. A lot depends upon any looming recessionary periods and whether bonds manage to recover their diversification benefits which have not been present throughout 2022.

Conclusion

The securities finance markets finished 2022 with a bang. December continued the trend experienced throughout the year by generating more than $1bln in revenues over the month. Both Q4 and December revenues pushed 2022 to be one of the highest performing years for market participants. Throughout 2022 the securities finance markets remained well positioned to take advantage of the macro-economic environment and continued to offer liquidity to market participants despite the increased geopolitical risk and structural markets events (such as the Gilt market crash in October). Highlights from 2022 can be seen in corporate and government bond borrowing US equity specials and ETFs. All these asset classes have outperformed throughout the year pushing revenues higher.

Securities finance remains a key component of any well-functioning financial market and this has been proved throughout 2022. As we move into 2023 securities finance markets will continue to play their role in the broader financial markets. Revenues will be dictated by the economic environment and the impact of interest rates upon both inflation and the health of global economies.

Wabtec is a U.S.-based public company producing state-of-the-art locomotives and rail systems. The company employs approximately 25000 people and has a presence in 50 countries being the world's market leader in freight locomotives and a major player in the transit segment.

The firm's 2021 financial results give a revenue figure of $7.8 billion reporting a staggering 20% of the world's freight being moved by the 23000 of Wabtec's locomotives in global operation.

Wabtec discloses a data breach

In an announcement published at the end of the year Wabtec says hackers breached their network and installed malware on specific systems as early as March 15th 2022.

On June 26th Wabtec said they detected unusual activity on their network leading to an investigation of the attack and whether the hackers had stolen data.

On the next day news outlets reported that sources at one of Wabtec's plants indicated that it was a ransomware attack impacting the rail giant. However the company did not officially respond to the rumors.

A couple of weeks later LockBit published samples of data stolen from Wabtec and eventually leaked all stolen data on August 20th 2022 presumably after a ransom was not paid.

LockBit published all files stolen from Wabtec (BleepingComputer)

As Wabtec explains now its investigation of the incident was concluded on November 23rd 2022 when data review specialists confirmed that LockBit had stolen files containing sensitive personal information.

This stolen data exposed a wide variety of sensitive information including:

Full Name

Date of Birth

Non-US National ID Number

Non-US Social Insurance Number or Fiscal Code

Passport Number

IP Address

Employer Identification Number (EIN)

USCIS or Alien Registration Number

NHS (National Health Service) Number (UK)

Wabtec which has about 25000 employees and operates in 50 countries began sending out breach notification letters on December 30 letting people know that data was stolen from their systems during a cyberattack they discovered last June.

In a statement the company said it contacted the FBI and hired a cybersecurity firm which discovered that the hackers “introduced malware” to certain systems as early as March 15.

The investigation found that systems containing sensitive information were accessed and data was exfiltrated before being posted to a leak site. Wabtec confirmed the findings on November 23 and began sending out breach notification letters on December 30.

The company did not respond to requests for comment about how many people were affected by the incident but in their release it confirmed the leaked information included names dates of birth passport numbers USCIS or Alien Registration Numbers National Health Service Numbers for people in the United Kingdom health insurance information Social Security Numbers financial account information data on criminal convictions as well as on sexual orientation and more.

Unlike in many data breach incidents Wabtec is not offering any free credit monitoring and identity theft protections to the people affected. The company urged victims to simply “remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing their financial account statements and credit reports for any anomalies.”

While Wabtec would not confirm whether the incident involved ransomware the LockBit ransomware group posted data stolen from the company in July and eventually leaked all of the data in August.

Ron Fabela co-founder of industrial cybersecurity firm SynSaber told The Record that what stood out to him about the breach notification is the length of time since when the data was published.

“This lag in breach reporting is not uncommon and continues to be a focus for industry and government policy makers” he said.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) unveiled new cybersecurity regulations for passenger and freight railroad carriers in October mandating that companies develop network segmentation policies and controls that separate operational technology systems from other IT systems in case of compromise.

Fabela noted that the attack seemed to only target the company’s human resources systems and not any of their industrial control systems or plant operations.

“While industrial processes are not the intended target widespread IT outages can have a splash damage effect on processes” he said.

“Ransomware continues to be a challenge for organizations with the Wabtec breach being no different. This attack appears to be a straightforward double-extortion attack with the sensitive files published back in August 2022.”

Experts noted that as the rail industry continues to become more automated cyber risks have increased – making the potential consequences of a cyber event “damaging and deadly.”

The rail industry has seen its fair share of cyberattacks in recent years. In April 2021 the New York City’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority – one of the largest transportation systems in the world – was hacked by a group based in China.

While the attack did not cause any damage and no riders were put at risk city officials raised alarms in a report because the attackers could have reached critical systems and may have left backdoors in the system.

The same month the Santa Clarita Valley Transportation Authority was hit with a ransomware attack and in 2020 the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority was also hit with ransomware.

Last year Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced new cybersecurity regulations for U.S. railroad operators requiring them to disclose any hacks create cyberattack recovery programs and name a chief cyber official. Those regulations expired in December.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYWlucy5jb20vdHJuL25ld3MtcmV2aWV3cy9uZXdzLXdpcmUvYnJpZ2h0bGluZS11cGRhdGUtcHRjLXBsYW5zLW91dGxpbmVkLWZvci0xMjUtbXBoLW9wZXJhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brightline update: PTC plans outlined for 125-mph operation - Trains,"COCOA Fla. — Brightline crews are set to resume 110-mph tests this Friday Jan. 6 south of Fort Pierce Fla. as part of continuing preparations for the passenger operator’s expansion of service to Orlando. The tests in Martin and St. Luicie counties along an 11-mile stretch of the 129-mile segment of Florida East Coast Railway main line between Cocoa and West Palm Beach will see passenger trains operating up to that speed as soon as all Federal Railroad Administration-mandated test results are validated and remaining infrastructure improvements are completed.

Meanwhile the FRA has released Brightline’s plan for the sealed corridor west of Cocoa to Orlando International Airport. Unlike FECRs recently double-tracked north-south route which contains 156 highway and pedestrian crossings the 39-mile east-west trackage is crossing-free and engineered for 125-mph operation.

Overall construction is 87% complete and involved 6.6 million employee-hours of work through the end of 2022.

South of Cocoa work continues around the new double-track fixed spans at Crane Creek Turkey Creek and the Sebastian River. Rehabilitation of the single-track St. Lucie River drawbridge at Stuart Fla. will include replacing key structural components upgrading mechanical drive and electrical control systems and installing a bridge monitor countdown clock and a bridge app for mariners similar to the one the company uses at the Fort Lauderdale bridge.

Dual ATC/PTC system planned for 125-mph corridor

In December Brightline requested FRA approval to field test its Interoperable Electronic Train Management System (I-ETMS) between Cocoa and Orlando.

The request includes a description of the company’s “Concept of Operations” and specific test procedures. The proposed plans are available through the federal register website which has links to Docket FRA-2022-0098. The FRA will consider public comments submitted through Feb. 21 2023.

The downloadable documents consist of a 54-page test plan and appendices totaling 536 pages including Brightline and FECR operating rules and track charts of the Orlando extension. For this 39-mile segment the company’ proposes an Automatic Train Control and cab signal add-on “that supplements the Centralized Traffic Control system of blocks. In positive train control territory the I-ETMS PTC system will “supplement the ATC system to include enforcement of permanent and temporary speed restrictions and mandatory directives.” On the extension the ATC and I-ETMS PTC systems are to work in tandem utilizing a serial communication interface.

“The PTC system will send a message to the ATC system requesting it to enter ‘Higher Speed Mode’ and in this mode” the plan explains “ATC will permit operation at speeds up to 125 mph.”

The proposal says the PTC system “allows and enforces the proper aspect speed limit based on route data while ATC displays cab signal aspects and enforces lower speed restrictions such as ‘stop’ and ‘restricting’ to preserve core signal system functions. It will also warn and enforce the maximum territory speed of 125 mph.”

The document also notes that only passenger locomotives will be equipped with the ATC/PTC serial interface on the Orlando extension; the systems will separately govern work trains and no overhead freight traffic is anticipated.

Track charts show 29 miles of single track between the Orlando West interlocking 7 miles west of the airport and “Cocoa Junction.” There are about 23 miles with a 125-mph maximum speed limit on the segment and 21 block signals in each direction over that route.

New 110-mph system where crossings are present

Since October double track sections have hosted friction braking acceleration and systems testing south of Cocoa where all highway crossing warning devices crossovers and signals have been installed.

Dan Whitaker Brightline’s vice president rail systems tells Trains News Wire that the company “has worked with the FRA to identify modifications to Wabtec’s existing I-ETMS positive train control mixed system overlay south of West Palm Beach (to) satisfy additional requirements for certification at speeds up to 125 mph. If roads cross at grade speeds will be limited to the FRA-regulated maximum of 110 mph.”

The key I-ETMS add-on is a wireless crossing activation system to ensure consistent warning times are provided with train moves that exceed 79 mph.

Whitaker says “A complex algorithm is used by the train management computer to determine when the train will arrive at the crossing.” This system is used in conjunction with conventional track circuits which activate warning devices at speeds up to 79 mph.

“The enhancements which include Wabtec’s Precision Navigation Module Smart Direction of travel and automatic track selection allow the system to differentiate between trains traveling at different speeds and ensures that warning times are consistent regardless of train speeds” he adds.

Where higher speeds are permitted crossings are either equipped with quad gates or wide roadway-separated medians.

Both the north-south and east-west segments include deployment of ground-breaking technology components that must be verified by FRA staff engineers. Brightline’s Orlando Extension testing document says a “Revenue Service Demonstration” plan for that segment will be submitted to the agency in “Second Quarter 2023” but the company expects 125-mph trains to begin testing before then.",,,

“In addition improved awareness of the Pharmacy2U brand led to a lower marketing cost per patient” the online pharmacy said.

A combination of these factors “dramatically improved profitability” with a profit before tax of £2.9m compared to just £100000 in the year up to March 31 2021 the report said.

The marked improvement indicates a second year of growth for the company which incurred pre-tax losses amounting to £7.2m in 2019/20.

At the time Pharmacy2U pointed to the launch of a second automated dispensing facility in Leicester which it said increased its operating capacity while keeping operating costs low.

And in 2020 C+D reported that Pharmacy2U had incurred a £16m loss for the financial year to March 2019 although it said at the time that it expected “profitability to increase”.

“Striving” for higher market share

Pharmacy2U is “striving to gain a much higher share of the NHS repeat prescription market” by forging ahead with its “existing” multi-channel marketing approach according to its latest financial documents.

In 2021/22 Pharmacy2U increased the number of prescription items it dispensed by 17% and increased its patient nominations by 9% on the previous year the documents show.

The online pharmacy business launched another dispensing facility in the last quarter of 2021 they said.

They continued: “Together with the existing Leeds facility [this] will provide operational capacity for [circa] 10% of the repeat prescription market in England.”

The company believes it is “well positioned to play a significant role in the development and provision of pharmacy services including COVID-19 and other vaccinations” it said.

In November 2021 then-CEO Mark Livingstone announced he was “incredibly proud” that Pharmacy2U had delivered one million COVID-19 jabs.

And in November last year the company appointed former Walgreens Boots Alliance board member Kevin Heath as its new CEO replacing Mr Livingstone."

""I feel like a new man"" Marion told FOX 5 Wednesday.

He has reason to feel good. He just got a check for $108000 for being kind in the right place at the right time.

""This is just unreal"" Marion said.

Three weeks ago Rory McCarty needed some batteries.

McCarty went to the Walmart in Cumberland Maryland where he met Butch Marion – the cashier who checked him out.

McCarty an avid TikTok user had just seen a video on the platform where a woman started a GoFundMe for another Walmart employee to help her retire early.

In the moment McCarty bought his batteries he felt like Marion 82 could be a great beneficiary.

""I just wanted to put something in motion and the lord did the rest"" McCarty told FOX 5 two weeks ago.

McCarty made a TikTok when he bought those batteries from Marion and it got millions of views. He set up the GoFundMe and it took just days to meet the goal.

On Wednesday Butch Marion walked out of Walmart for the last time and Rory McCarty was waiting to present the check for $108000.

""I love you man"" McCarty told Marion.

""I love you too"" Marion said.

Marion worked about 30 hours a week. He retired years ago to help take care of his ex-wife’s husband before he passed. He later returned back to work at Walmart.

Marion says the money will pay off bills allow him to relax more and give him the money and flexibility for a three-week trip to Florida to see daughters and grandchildren he hasn’t hugged in years.

""Bird out of a cage"" Marion said.

Marion and McCarty have developed a friendship spending time riding ATVs and getting meals together. It’s a friendship McCarty says will continue.

But not everywhere.

Drone deliveries are already happening in parts of Arizona Arkansas California Florida North Carolina Texas Utah and Virginia as the two top retailers engineer ways to get deliveries into customers’ hands in faster smoother ways.

Walmart has 37 stores set up for drone delivery to homes and businesses— six stores in Arizona four in Arkansas nine Walmarts in Florida two in North Carolina 11 in Texas two in Utah and three in Virginia. Walmart has partnered with drone delivery service DroneUp Delivery to deliver customers’ packages that weigh 10 pounds or less. Walmart says that more than 10000 items are available for drone delivery and items can arrive as quickly as 30 minutes after the order has been placed.

There are restrictions: Customers must live within one mile of participating stores. Orders are accepted on the DroneUp Delivery website from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. local time.

The top-selling item at one of Walmart’s drone ports? Hamburger Helper...

“If it fits safely it flies” Walmart said in a statement. “Participating stores will house a DroneUp delivery hub inclusive of a team of certified pilots operating within FAA guidelines that safely manage flight operations for deliveries. Once a customer places an order the item is fulfilled from the store packaged loaded into the drone and delivered right to their yard using a cable that gently lowers the package.” Oh and the top-selling item at one of Walmart’s drone ports? Hamburger Helper. Just sayin’.

Amazon meanwhile has started drone deliveries in Northern California — Lockeford to be specific  50 miles south of Sacramento — and College Station Texas using its in-house Amazon Prime Air fleet of drones which can carry items up to five pounds.

Customers place their orders via the Amazon website. They get tracking information for their item and are told approximately what time the order will arrive by drone and be dropped off in their backyard. Amazon employees monitor the deliveries. To get delivery via Amazon Prime Air your home will need to be approximately four miles from either of the Prime Air Drone Delivery Centers and these are daytime deliveries only five days a week.

Walmart and Amazon have plans to roll out their respective airborne delivery services to other regions.

Customers reported Walmart stores in Topeka and elsewhere had double-taxed food items following Sunday's reduction in the state food sales tax rate.

Walmart receipts showed two tax lines one with the full 6.5% state sales tax rate plus local taxes and the second line with the lower 4% state rate on food plus the local taxes.

The receipts showed the second tax line correctly assessed the lower tax rate on food items. However the first line showed the full rate was assessed on the entire purchase including food meaning that customers paid taxes twice on food.

The problem has since been corrected.

""On Jan. 1 after the reduced state sales tax rate on food items went into effect in Kansas some customers were mistakenly charged the higher outdated rate along with the new rate"" said Walmart spokesperson Ashley Nolan. ""The issue has been resolved and we apologize for any inconvenience.

""Customers seeking a refund or with questions should bring their receipt to their local Walmart store and speak to a member of management.""

Similar problems haven't been reported at other grocers.

Jon McCormick president of the Retail Grocers Association said such missteps can happen when programming the point-of-sale system. The association represents independent supermarkets and McCormick said he hasn't heard of similar incidents at member stores.

""My members have adjusted their POS systems to follow the new regulations"" he said.

Kansas Department of Revenue officials said Tuesday that the agency was ""aware of a programming issue that various Walmart stores encountered related to the state sales tax reduction on groceries. The retailer has since resolved the issue.""

It is unclear how widespread the issue was but Nolan said all Walmart stores in Kansas were told how to process refunds.

""If a customer did not see that reduction on approved grocery items they should seek a refund for the excess tax charged by visiting the retailer with a valid receipt"" KDOR officials said in a statement.

Kansas and local sales tax rates

Kansas has a 6.5% sales tax. Food was supposed to be charged that full rate up until Jan. 1 when the first installment of the state's food sales tax cut reduced the rate to 4%. Non-food items are still assessed at 6.5%.

Your receipt will show a higher tax rate than 6.5% or 4% because there are also local taxes.

In most of Topeka sales taxes on non-food items are 9.15% and 6.65% on food. That includes a 1.15% county tax and a 1.5% city tax.

Certain areas of the city have higher rates due to additional 1% or 2% taxes to fund community improvement districts and STAR bonds raising the tax rates to 10.15% and 11.15%.

The rate doesn't yet include an additional 0.2% tax approved by voters in November to benefit Gage Park the Topeka Zoo and the Kansas Children's Discovery Center.

Local sales tax rates effective Jan. 1 are available online from the Kansas Department of Revenue.

Full elimination of food sales tax on Kansas horizon

The Kansas Department of Revenue issued a tax notice Dec. 1 and a publication detailing the changes. At the time the governor's office and KDOR touted their work with the retail grocery industry to educate grocers on tax changes.

""Even after providing the educational materials and opportunities as it rolls out these changes KDOR continues to be available to retailers to ensure the transition to these sales tax savings is as smooth as possible"" Revenue Secretary Mark Burghart said in a Dec. 2 statement.

The lower tax applies — according to the law's definition of food and food ingredients — to solid liquid frozen and other items ""sold for ingestion or chewing by humans and are consumed for their taste or nutritional value."" That includes bottled water candy dietary supplements food from vending machines and soft drinks. Alcohol and tobacco aren't included.

Prepared food such as restaurant meals or a cooked rotisserie chicken at a grocery store deli are generally still taxed at the full rate.

More:Laura Kelly again pushes food sales tax cut. Can she convince entrenched Republicans?

The food tax is scheduled to reduce to 2% in 2024 before hitting zero in 2025. Gov. Laura Kelly who campaigned extensively on axing the food tax has called for lawmakers to take up the issue again this year to eliminate the tax immediately.

The earliest possible date would be April 1.

McCormick of the Retail Grocers Association advocated for the Legislature to pass Kelly's proposal to reduce the food tax to 0% this spring instead of two years from now arguing it would benefit Kansans and retailers.

""That is the best scenario for families who buy food staples in lieu of going to a restaurant which carries high markups and makes food more expensive"" McCormick said. ""The Legislature is choosing to ignore the 'common folk' in their districts over the elite residents of Kansas.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8va2R2ci5jb20vbmV3cy93YWxtYXJ0LWVsaW1pbmF0ZXMtcGxhc3RpYy1wYXBlci1iYWdzLWluLWNvbG9yYWRvL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8va2R2ci5jb20vbmV3cy93YWxtYXJ0LWVsaW1pbmF0ZXMtcGxhc3RpYy1wYXBlci1iYWdzLWluLWNvbG9yYWRvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart eliminates plastic paper bags in Colorado,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://kdvr.com/news/walmart-eliminates-plastic-paper-bags-in-colorado/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8va2R2ci5jb20vbmV3cy93YWxtYXJ0LWVsaW1pbmF0ZXMtcGxhc3RpYy1wYXBlci1iYWdzLWluLWNvbG9yYWRvL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8va2R2ci5jb20vbmV3cy93YWxtYXJ0LWVsaW1pbmF0ZXMtcGxhc3RpYy1wYXBlci1iYWdzLWluLWNvbG9yYWRvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

As per the US copyright law the rights to characters expire 95 years after publication (for works published or registered before 1978). However don't expect writers or directors and rival studios to cash in on the opportunity to make their own Mickey Mouse movies and shows as only the 'Steamboat Willie' version of the character will go out of copyright. 'Steamboat Willie' in case you don't know was a 1928 animated short that marked the first appearance of Mickey. It was quite different from the wholesome and lovable anthropomorphic rodent we know him as today.

The more modern Mickey Mouse the cuddly mouse with red shorts and rounded features is still under the grubby paws of Disney. While it still must be a fairly big loss I doubt anybody at the House of Mouse is shedding a lot of tears. The media and entertainment conglomerate possesses some of the biggest and most profitable franchises in the world. The list includes the Marvel Cinematic Universe Star Wars Pirates of the Caribbean Pixar movies 'Avatar' countless animated classics like 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' and 'The Lion King' Indiana Jones and many more. The truth is the execs at Disney could not care less at the loss of Mickey Mouse particularly the less pleasant version of the character. But the reason it has taken 95 years for 'Steamboat Willie' Mickey Mouse to go out of Disney's stables makes for an interesting and a little unsettling story.

How Disney affected US copyright laws

The first federal copyright law in the US came into existence in 1790. It guaranteed ""fourteen years from the time of recording the title thereof"" with a provision for renewal for 14 more years if the author survived. The law was about books maps and charts and excluded music and paintings. They were included in the future. By the time Disney founded by Walt and Roy O. Disney came into existence in 1923 as Disney Brothers Studio (it later underwent two name changes and was called Walt Disney Studio and Walt Disney Productions at different points in time) the amendments in the copyright law (the latest was in 1909) allowed 56 years of protection of published works. This included the initial 28 years and an option to renew for 28 more years.

Also Read: Why Disney could lose the rights to Mickey Mouse

As per this 'Steamboat Willie' should have gone out of copyright in 1984 sending the character to the dreaded (by Disney anyway) public domain. But Disney began to make serious efforts with Congress (also called lobbying) to further amend the law and extend the expiration duration. It did make a sort of sense as there had been no changes in the law since 1909. The world on the other hand had changed radically including the wider prevalence of new forms of media like film TV and radio.

The Walt Disney Company's efforts paid off when Congress enacted the Copyright Act of 1976. It allowed published works to be under copyright for the whole life of the author plus half a century more or 75 years if the said work was owned by corporations. Mickey Mouse was now protected until 2003.

So why did 'Steamboat Willie' not enter the public domain in 2003?

For the simple reason that Disney was still loathe to let go of its first animated film. Emotional value and so on. Who am I kidding this was more likely a case of a corporation wanting to squeeze the last ounce of profit from an 80-year-old film. So as 2003 came closer Disney again lobbied for Congress to further extend the copyright expiration date. The efforts again bore fruit. And thus in 1998 Congress enacted the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998. Derisively called 'The Mickey Mouse Protection Act' it retained the copyright to the author's lifetime and added 70 years. For works of corporate authorship like with Disney the act allowed 95 years from the work's original publication or 120 years from the creation whichever expires first.

Will Disney again lobby to impede the expiration of 'Steamboat Willie''s copyright?

Unlikely. As said above Disney is in charge of by far the biggest collection of pop culture franchises in the world. It only became bigger with its acquisition of 20th Century Fox. The future in which Disney pretty much owns everything you watch on the telly or in theatres is not as unlikely as it looks any longer. Disney is like a mythical monster like the Greek Hydra or the African Kammapa which gobbles every IP it can get and grows ever larger. The company may have an image of a provider of cute cuddly content but the reality is much darker.

Disney does not need 'Steamboat Willie' or even Winnie the Pooh (AA Milne's 1926 stories set in the Hundred Acre Wood went out of copyright in 2021). It has absolute command over the box office with the MCU movies almost every one of which grosses close to $1 billion even in the pandemic-affected times. It owns the 'Avatar' franchise each film of which will likely gross $2 billion and the fifth and final film may cross that incredible $3 billion mark.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndkd2luZm8uY29tL3dhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkL2lmLXlvdS1jb3VsZC1jaGFuZ2UtYW55dGhpbmctYXQtbWFnaWMta2luZ2RvbS13aGF0LXdvdWxkLWl0LWJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If You Could Change Anything at Magic Kingdom What Would it be?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.wdwinfo.com/walt-disney-world/if-you-could-change-anything-at-magic-kingdom-what-would-it-be/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndkd2luZm8uY29tL3dhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkL2lmLXlvdS1jb3VsZC1jaGFuZ2UtYW55dGhpbmctYXQtbWFnaWMta2luZ2RvbS13aGF0LXdvdWxkLWl0LWJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvYm94LW9mZmljZS1kaXNuZXktMjAyMi13b3JsZHdpZGUtdS1zLTEyMzUyMTA2MTAv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWRpc25leS0yMDIyLXdvcmxkd2lkZS11LXMtMTIzNTIxMDYxMC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney Rules The Box Office Around The World In 2022 With $4.9 Billion,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvYm94LW9mZmljZS1kaXNuZXktMjAyMi13b3JsZHdpZGUtdS1zLTEyMzUyMTA2MTAv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWRpc25leS0yMDIyLXdvcmxkd2lkZS11LXMtMTIzNTIxMDYxMC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2C13070>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Discovery Announce Audience Measurement Agreement,"SANTA MONICA Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--VideoAmp today announced it has struck a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery to measure cross-screen campaigns across the global media and entertainment company’s iconic portfolio of sports news lifestyle and premium entertainment brands. Following the completion of a first-of-its-kind test-and-learn for alternative measures of video ad performance Warner Bros. Discovery will use VideoAmp’s measurement and data capabilities to better represent its audiences for advertisers looking to transact on linear streaming video and large digital and social media services through a unified cross-platform currency.

“The industry needs a better way to measure and transact on audiences–one that accounts for cross-platform supports both traditional and advanced audiences and provides attribution metrics in a manner that enables media sellers and buyers to unlock this potential and excel in a competitive environment” said Ross McCray CEO and Founder VideoAmp. “We are excited Warner Bros. Discovery is creating a more sophisticated marketplace and we’re looking forward to unlocking value for them and the industry as a whole.”

Warner Bros. Discovery’s assessment of measurement and currency solutions returned pivotal findings identifying the need for greater standardization identity resolution personification and transaction capability as industry priorities in order to move towards scaled adoption of multiple currencies by the 2023 Upfront.

“Traditional media measurement has not kept pace with how consumers are engaging with streaming and linear content. As a result these audiences have been undercounted and current measures no longer accurately reflect their true advertising value” said Andrea Zapata EVP Head of Ad Sales Research Measurement and Insights Warner Bros. Discovery. “We are gaining momentum as we act on our goals to offer best in class measurement capabilities and provide greater visibility into the return on ad spend across our award-winning IP.”

Brands across the Warner Bros. Discovery ecosystem will benefit from VideoAmp’s cross-platform advanced audience and outcome measurement with planning capabilities powered by the commingling of set-top box and smart TV data. In fact a recent Warner Bros. Discovery media delivery analysis that leveraged VideoAmp data for October showed high impact and efficiency across the media marketplace.

Discovery signs audience measurement deal with startup Nielsen rival VideoAmp,"In this photo illustration the Warner Bros. Discovery logo is displayed on a smartphone screen and in the background the HBO Max and Discovery Plus logos.

Warner Bros. Discovery has signed a deal with VideoAmp to measure its audience as an alternative means of data for advertisers the companies announced Tuesday.

The contract is a significant moment for VideoAmp a startup advertising measurement platform that has recently been growing its list of clients ahead of this year's upfronts in spring when TV networks look to secure long-term commitments from advertisers. Warner Bros. Discovery owns traditional TV networks and streaming services.

The deal also gives Warner Bros. Discovery another data set to provide to advertisers at a time when the industry is considering alternatives to legacy measurement firm Nielsen which was put under the microscope during the Covid pandemic when questions arose regarding its measurement panels. Warner will be using both Nielsen and VideoAmp.

Firms like Nielsen and VideoAmp offer audience estimates and data that TV networks and streamers use to sell slots for commercials. Nielsen's measurement system is based on a panel of approximately 40000 households that allow it to track what they watch. VideoAmp bases its data on log-in information from devices. Other competitors in the space include Comscore as well as startups like iSpot.tv and Samba TV.

VideoAmp wouldn't provide the length of its contract with Warner but founder and CEO Ross McCray told CNBC its deals with the media giant and others are for the long term. VideoAmp also works with Disney  which recently launched the ad-supported platform for Disney+ as well as TelevisaUnivision.

""Especially with Warner's investment in streaming and having a portfolio of so many channels WBD has so much opportunity"" said McCray. ""We are going to properly allow you to package it as a cross platform"" to advertisers.

The merger between Discovery and Warner Media closed in 2022 amassing a portfolio of TV networks including the Discovery Channel TLC TNT TBS and others. The merged company plans to roll out a revamped streaming platform in the spring combining its Discovery+ with Warner's HBO Max.

The company has also been in the midst of cost-cutting as it contends with a hefty debt load stemming from the merger. While WBD will still be using Nielsen's measurement services the deal with VideoAmp gives it another data set and the possibility of a more cost-efficient stand-alone alternative for the future.

""Traditional media measurement has not kept pace with how consumers are engaging with streaming and linear content. As a result these audiences have been undercounted and current measures no longer accurately reflect their true advertising value"" said Andrea Zapata Warner's head of ad sales research measurement and insights in a news release.

Nielsen's lock on TV viewership and ratings has spanned decades. However Nielsen's metrics came under scrutiny as concerns mounted earlier in the pandemic regarding inaccuracies and irregularities in its measurement according to media reports.

Nielsen disclosed undercounting issues in 2020 and has since lost its accreditation with the Media Rating Council the industry body that verifies the measurement process. Nielsen's status with the MRC remains suspended according to recent reports. VideoAmp which was founded in 2014 doesn't have accreditation from the MRC either.

Despite these issues Nielsen remains the measurement giant in the room working with all major media companies. Streamers work with Nielsen too. Amazon 's Prime TV uses Nielsen for its ""Thursday Night Football"" ratings. When Netflix launched its ad-supported tier last year it said its programming would be rated by Nielsen beginning some time in 2023.

This is a pivotal moment for the media industry as cord cutting accelerated recently and media companies look to make streaming profitable. Streaming services have added cost-efficient ad-supported options as subscriber growth slowed down in 2022.

While there's about $60 billion to $70 billion spent annually on U.S. linear TV advertising according to Insider Intelligence streaming ad revenue is steadily growing. Ad revenue for streaming services is expected to exceed $21 billion in 2023 up from nearly $17 billion in 2022 according to Insider Intelligence.

The Term of Reference is to be presented during the state environmental licensing proceeding and aims to improve plans’ legal security and standardizing structure content (setting minimum content) and presentation. According to Art. 24 of Federal Law No. 12305/2010 (Solid Waste National Policy) the Solid Waste Management Plan is integrated to environmental licensing proceeding and according to Art. 19 of State Law No. 12300/2006 this plan should cover generation segregation conditioning storage gathering transportation treatment and final disposal of waste as well as elimination of risks and protection of human health and the environment.



With respect to the structure and types of Solid Waste Management Plans the board decision provides for example an appendix with items and minimum content to be observed; that such plans should be presented by developers in electronic format by means of the State Online Management System of Solid Waste; and that collective and integrated plans can be applied to projects/enterprises located in the same condominium or local productive arrangement provided that the projects/enterprises:

(i) Involve activities characteristic of the same productive segment;

(ii) Have formalized collective governance or cooperation mechanisms involving common interest activities; and

(iii) Are supervised by a single environmental agency.

Furthermore the board decision establishes phases in which Solid Waste Management Plans should be presented:

(i) For new projects: When requesting an installation license. (If the project is subject to an environmental impact assessment the plan should describe the waste to be generated during the construction phase.)

(ii) For projects/enterprises already installed: When requesting an installation license for activity expansion since expansion represents change to the generation or management of waste foreseen in the previous Solid Waste Management Plan.

(iii) For projects/enterprises in operation: When requesting an operation license renewal.

The board decision also provides among other things for:

(i) Requesting a waiver to not present the Solid Waste Management Plan.

(ii) Presenting a Simplified Plan (applicable to micro and small companies in specific situations).

(iii) Presenting Management Plans for Civil Construction Waste for Health Services and for Ports Airports Railway and Road Terminals.

The board decision also establishes that provisions involving shared responsibility and reverse logistics systems should be presented in a separate document and under terms to be defined by the relevant authority.

The board decision will come into effect 30 days after the Solid Waste Management Plan module is made available on the State Online Management System of Solid Waste platform.

LaTourette announced today.

Funding for 2023 will be used to advance the DEP’s environmental justice and climate change priorities by prioritizing projects that offer equitable and meaningful public access and maximize social environmental and health benefits to the public particularly in neighborhoods identified as Adversely Stressed Overburdened Communities. These communities are so designated because they have a combined stressor total higher than the 50th percentile for total environmental and public health stressors. Projects located in or easily accessible by these communities will be eligible for new funding incentives.

The Green Acres Program is just one source for project funding. Another is the Urban Parks Program which is funded by a state budget appropriation and will be offered again in 2023.

""From our incredible Green Acres investments in local parks to our historic investments in local parks to our historic investments in the restoration of natural resources throughout the state including at Liberty State Park the Murphy Administration has put its money where its heart is” Commissioner LaTourette said. “Though this new round of Green Acres funding we will accelerate our work to put all of New Jersey's residents in touch with their environment with a long overdue focus on those communities that have not shared equally in the environmental and recreational benefits our great state has to offer.""

“Strengthening DEP’s investments in natural capital and community development supports sustainable economic growth that restores preserves and protects New Jersey’s natural recreational cultural and historic resources” said Assistant Commissioner for Community Investment and Economic Revitalization Elizabeth Dragon. “This is why it is vitally important for every New Jersey community to have clean and safe areas to gather play and enjoy nature all of which lead to an enhanced quality of life.”

“Green Acres’ far-reaching investments across New Jersey continue to ensure that every community in our state benefits from the values of environmental justice’ said Martha Sapp Director of the DEP’s Green Acres Program. “When we provide parks and open space in our communities we are investing in our residents and the promise of future generations.”

Project Categories

Eligible projects for funding consideration include the following:

Green Acres funding which includes:

Acquisition: The purchase of land for active or passive recreation or for natural resource conservation;

Park development: Projects that provide for outdoor games and sports boating fishing walking swimming biking picnicking camping or nature interpretation;

Stewardship: Natural resource enhancement activities on recreation and conservation lands;

Jake’s Law: Available to counties for the construction of completely inclusive playgrounds.

Urban Parks funding: Available to local governments for land acquisition park development and historic preservation projects located in or easily accessible by Adversely Stressed Overburdened Communities in Urban Aid municipalities.



Applications for both Green Acres and Urban Parks funding will be accepted until Wednesday March 1. Green Acres will host a series of information sessions starting next week and continuing through February to assist applicants in planning projects and completing applications. Upcoming workshops:

An overview about Green Acres and Urban Parks acquisition projects is scheduled from 10 a.m. to noon Wednesday Jan. 11. Click here to join the meeting. Park development stewardship and Jake’s Law projects will be reviewed and discussed from 1 to 3 p.m. that day. Click here to join the meeting. Both meetings will provide an overview of the application process and offer a question-and-answer session with participants.

Two question-and-answer sessions on all types of applications will be offered in February. The first will be from 10 a.m. to noon on Wednesday Feb. 1. Click here to join the meeting. The second will be from 10 a.m. to noon on Wednesday Feb. 22. Click here to join the meeting.

The Green Acres Program will prioritize projects that contribute to resilience or mitigate climate change impacts such as by preserving forested and flood-prone areas enhancing chronically inundated wetlands revegetating riparian areas connecting wildlife corridors expanding upstream flood attenuation potential promoting wildlife and including green infrastructure into park designs.

To prepare for the application process the Green Acres Program invited local governments and nonprofits to a series of stakeholder meetings in September to discuss new funding opportunities and proposed changes in application eligibility and project administration requirements. Based on those conversations recordings of which are available on the Green Acres Program website Green Acres has provided additional guidance in its application and extended the application period.

Since the number of project applications typically exceeds available funding the Green Acres Program will only consider funding requests from new applicants or from applicants making significant progress on open projects and following Green Acres rules on their parkland. Green Acres will review and rank the applications it receives and then send to the Garden State Preservation Trust a list of projects recommended for funding. The Trust will forward the approved list to the state Legislature for appropriation.

The Green Acres Program recently celebrated its 60th anniversary and is the oldest continuous program of its kind in the nation. The program with public and nonprofit partner agencies has protected more than 720000 acres of open space and provided funds to develop hundreds of outdoor recreational facilities statewide.

Here's what we know about nuclear waste disposal in ...,"Want more news from Southwest and Southside? Sign up for our free daily email newsletter. We have a weekly weather email too.

A number of questions swirl around the governor’s plan to put a small modular nuclear reactor in Southwest Virginia to generate carbon-free energy and many of them center around concerns about the waste it would produce.

Unfortunately with construction of the first SMR as much as a decade away and only one design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission there are many questions yet to be answered.

About nuclear waste By the numbers: 92 – Number of nuclear power plants in the U.S. 75 – Number of sites where nuclear waste is stored in U.S. 2000 – Metric tons of used nuclear fuel rods produced in the U.S. each year 86000 – Metric tons of spent nuclear fuel stored in U.S. 3124 – Metric tons of used nuclear fuel stored in Virginia Sources: U.S. Government Accountability Office; U.S. Department of Energy

Although there have been a few studies attempting answers on SMR waste they appear to be contradictory. For example a study published in May by Stanford University and the University of British Columbia states that despite their smaller size SMRs would actually produce more radioactive waste than conventional nuclear power plants.

Yet according to an analysis of the waste that would be produced by three SMR designs released in November by Argonne National Laboratory SMRs do not produce more waste. “All told when it comes to nuclear waste SMRs are roughly comparable with conventional pressurized water reactors with potential benefits and weaknesses depending on which aspects you are trying to design for. Overall there appear to be no additional major challenges to the management of SMR nuclear wastes compared to the commercial-scale large LWR (light-water reactor) wastes” said Take Kyum Kim senior nuclear engineer for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory.

Scott Burnell public affairs officer for the NRC said the agency is aware that several reports have been done on waste from SMRs.

“Some of those reports did not seek NRC input nor our review of their conclusions” Burnell wrote in answer to questions from Cardinal News. “It’s important to note that until companies formally apply for design approval and licensing of advanced reactor facilities there’s a great deal of uncertainty in what sort of volumes or material (and the corresponding disposal requirements) will come from a given technology. Applications for advanced reactor technologies will have to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate these facilities will meet the relevant requirements for public health and safety. There are diverse views on this topic and we welcome additional studies and analysis as we learn more about spent fuel and waste in advanced reactors.”

He added that the NRC will continue to work with stakeholders to understand these issues and protect the public and the environment.

The NuScale SMR design – the only design approved by the NRC – would be a light-water reactor like the traditional larger nuclear reactors operating in this country for decades. So more is known about the waste which would have much in common with what comes from conventional reactors according to Burnell.

Much less is known about how to deal with spent fuel from SMR designs cooled by something other than water Burnell said.

Nuclear waste from traditional reactors

Here’s what we know about the waste from today’s large reactors how it’s handled and where it ends up.

When you’re talking about waste from nuclear reactors you’re primarily talking about spent fuel. Each year about 2000 metric tons of used nuclear fuel rods are produced by the 92 nuclear power plants in the U.S.

As a result there are about 86000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors stored at 75 U.S. sites according to a U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report published in September 2021.

Still the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) says the total amount of nuclear waste produced in the U.S. over 60 years doesn’t take up a lot of space.

If stacked end to end it would “fill one football field 10 yards deep” the NEI states on its website.

Nuclear experts agree that the best solution for the waste is to bury it which is called deep geological disposal. The NRC describes a geological depository as using a mixture of natural and engineered barriers like tunnels to isolate the waste from the surrounding environment.

Since 1987 the plan has been to store all this country’s nuclear waste at one site Yucca Mountain in the desert in Nevada. But that plan has been mired in politics for decades and in 2010 the U.S. Department of Energy announced it would withdraw its application for a license to store nuclear waste there. But the Nevada site remains designated as the nation’s nuclear repository by law.

Since the federal government currently has no site for disposal it has paid reactor owners about $9 billion for storage the GAO says on its website.

Virginia’s nuclear waste

In Virginia there were 3124 metric tons of used nuclear fuel in storage at plant sites according to an October 2020 report by the U.S. Department of Energy. The report is based on numbers from Dec. 31 2019 and are the latest figures available according to the NRC.

Dominion operates four reactors at two nuclear power plants in the commonwealth North Anna in Louisa County and Surry in Surry County and each stores 1562 metric tons of spent fuel.

Spent nuclear fuel is mostly uranium and is considered dangerous high-level radioactive waste. The NRC has regulatory authority over the storage and disposal of all commercial nuclear waste in the U.S.

Radioactive waste naturally decays over time. But the time range for decay ranges from a few hours to hundreds of thousands of years according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Low-level radioactive waste includes contaminated protective clothing tools filters and rags from nuclear power plant maintenance and operations plus some medical facility wastes and a few other items.

According to the NRC low-level waste is normally stored at a plant site until it decays and can be disposed of like regular trash or shipped to a low-level waste disposal site.

Currently there are four existing low-level waste disposal facilities in the U.S. that accept several types of low-level waste and they are in Barnwell South Carolina; Richland Washington; Clive Utah; and near Andrews Texas.

Virginia’s spent nuclear fuel storage

In Virginia each reactor at the North Anna and Surry nuclear power plants holds 157 fuel assemblies and each assembly is made up of more than 200 fuel rods that each hold around 350 uranium dioxide fuel pellets about the size of an adult finger according to Scott A. Miller manager of communications and media relations for Dominion Energy Nuclear. That’s 10.99 million fuel pellets in each reactor.

The life of a fuel assembly for commercial reactors is about 4.5 years. Every 18 months about a third of the fuel reaches the end of its useful life and is removed from the core and entered into the long-term used fuel storage process Miller said.

“That means that every 4.5 years all the fuel assemblies in the reactor will have been replaced” Miller wrote in an email to Cardinal News.

Initially all used fuel assemblies are placed in the station’s spent fuel pool which is a steel- and concrete-reinforced structure filled with water to a depth of 40 feet. The water serves to shield the radiation and cool the rods. The ongoing circulation of water in the pool prevents the buildup of “decay heat” from the radioactive material in the used fuel Burnell said. The assemblies remain there for about five years until they cool enough to move to dry storage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvd250b2VhcnRoLm9yZy5pbi9ibG9nL3BvbGx1dGlvbi9wbGFzdGljLXdhc3RlLXdvZXMtYS1wcmltZXItb24taW5kaWEtcy1tYXJpbmUtbGl0dGVyLXByb2JsZW0tODcwNTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plastic waste woes: A primer on India's marine litter problem,"Only 60 per cent of the total collected plastic waste is recycled while the fate of the remaining 40 per cent is not accounted

India generates 55 million tonnes of municipal waste annually of which only 37 per cent is treated according to the Central Pollution Control Board.

Growing population rapid urbanisation shifting consumption pattern and changing lifestyles have resulted in the mismanagement of plastic waste leading to the accumulation of municipal solid waste.

Most of these items especially plastic items contribute significantly to the growing burden of marine debris. Land-based sources account for most of the plastic in the water.

Unaccounted waste from urban agglomerations is carried by river systems to oceans for final dumping.

India has a coastline spanning 7517 kilometres. It is spread across nine states and borders a 2.02 million square kilometre of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). India’s nine coastal states house a population of 420 million. Of this about 330 million live on or within 150 km of a coast.

Three in four metro cities of the country are located on the coast. Coastal districts are home to nearly 14.2 per cent of the country’s total population. Around 95 per cent of India’s trade by volume and 68 per cent by value is executed through waterways.

The country’s coastline contributes to its ecological richness biodiversity and economy. Every year thousands of tonnes of garbage composed of plastics glass metals sanitary products clothes etc. are dumped into it. However plastics contribute a major portion of about 60 per cent of the total marine debris that reaches the oceans.

Waste management in this intensely populated region is a meticulous task. Only 60 per cent (9205 tonnes per day) of the total collected plastic waste is recycled while the fate of the remaining 40 per cent is not accounted.

Currently India is reeling under the marine debris crisis which poses serious threats to its particularly rich marine biodiversity. Some 15343 tonnes of waste dumped in the south Asian seas daily are generated from 60 major Indian cities according to UNEP.

Some initiatives

The Ministry of Earth Sciences through its attached office National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR) has undertaken beach clean-up initiatives awareness programmes and beach litter quantification studies at regular intervals.

Many studies have been conducted across coastal states and Union Territories Puducherry Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep. NCCR has initiated monitoring of the temporal and spatial distribution of marine litter along the Indian coasts and adjacent seas in 2018 2019 and 2021.

Marine litter is spread along the entire water column. High quantities of sediments are noticed during monsoon due to their spread into coastal water through creeks/rivers/estuaries the research indicated.

An average of 0.98 metric tonnes of trash per km stretch of coastline averaging a weight concentration of 0.012 kilograms per metre square accumulated along the Indian coastline noted Swachh Sagar Surakshit Sagar campaign 2022.

Key finding of campaign:

S.N Marine litter item type / categories % Contribution of marine litter number in different category % Contribution of marine litter weight in different category 1 Plastics 55-57 30-31 2 Foam Plastic 0-2 0-2 3 Fabric 0-2 0-2 4 Paper 2-3 0-2 5 Glass 0-2 1-3 6 Religious materials 40-41 60-68

Previous estimates indicated that only 9 per cent of the plastics produced are recycled leaving nine billion tonnes in our landfills oceans and ecosystems.

Attempts made by some organisations in rescuing marine species from the debris are worth mentioning. TREE Foundation a Chennai-based non-profit has been incessantly working on this.

Their efforts on this front have shed light on the magnitude of the problem of ghost nets.

Over the last 20 years through a multi-disciplinary approach involving people from all sections of society — particularly unemployed youth from artisanal fishing communities the foundation has saved and released more than 3101000 Olive Ridley turtles.

“We formed a 363-member Sea Turtle Protection Force recruited from 222 coastal villages across the east coast of India” said Supraja Dharini chairperson and founder of TREE Foundation.

In June 2021 she spearheaded a ghost net retrieval programme by incentivising fishermen who retrieved 57353 kgs of ghost nets from the sea.

Way forward

Here are some suggestions for managing marine litter in a better way.

The National Marine litter Policy of India announced in 2018 should be formulated.

Marine litter and microplastics distribution and characterisation study should be conducted across the Indian coast.

A forum of coastal cities should be created for ensuring cross-learning ecosystem and to build a synergetic association of urban local bodies and local administration located on the coast.

A long-term vision plan should be developed for promoting partnerships among coastal towns cities and urban administration for the reduction of marine litter and the creation of sustainable waste management ecosystems. Initiatives like a multi-stakeholder approach that will recognise knowledge expertise technology research capacity building and advocacy as key drivers to safeguard life below water can be beneficial.

Regular beach clean-up and awareness programmes should be conducted instead of annual ones.

Many states claim Single Use Plastic above 50 microns is banned but on the ground the ban is not effective. Steps can be taken to execute such legislations.

Amy Hauk who became chief executive officer of the Victoria’s Secret brand in a restructuring in July is leaving the company as of March 31. In addition to leading the flagship brand Hauk had been CEO of the Pink business since 2018.

The pending departure was revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission which said Hauk gave notice last week that she was resigning.

A spokesperson added to WWD that Hauk was stepping down “in order to spend more time with her family in Florida” and that she has “graciously agreed to a managed transition between now and the end of March.”

After her departure Martin Waters corporate CEO will assume the responsibilities of brand CEO as well.

That makes a big job even bigger. The spokesperson noted: “Martin Waters will continue to lead VS & Co and chief merchant Lisa Rogers chief designer Janie Schaffer head of MPA Angela Wical and chief creative Raul Martinez will all report directly to Martin along with Timothy Johnson (chief administrative officer) Chris Rupp (chief customer officer) Greg Unis (chief growth officer) Dein Boyle (chief operating officer) and Mel McAfee (chief legal officer chief HR officer).”

In a separate release Waters focused on the Adore Me deal which was signed in November and closed swiftly.

“From the beginning we evaluated Adore Me as a two for one opportunity — a technology-led digital-first innovator in the intimates category and a highly efficient growing and profitable stand-alone business model” Waters said.

Victoria’s Secret used to epitomize a certain bombshell stereotype of feminine beauty but was caught in the cultural cross currents and has been looking to stand for a broader array of body types.

The Adore Me transaction fits with that new stance.

The deal included an initial cash payment of $400 million. But according to the SEC filing the sellers are due to receive at least another $80 million and up to $300 million more depending on how well the business performs.

The 12-year-old Adore Me generated about $250 million in profitable sales last year and focuses on inclusive looks. It has about 1.2 million active consumers and monthly subscription and home try-on options. In addition to intimates the brand sells activewear and swimwear.

That adds a new growth vector to Victoria’s Secret which projected in late November that its full-year net sales would slip 6 to 7 percent from $6.8 billion in 2021.

Waters also played up the digital benefits for Victoria’s Secret.

“In Adore Me we have acquired a business and a team that will help us deliver improved elevated and differentiated experiences for Victoria’s Secret and Pink customers” Waters said. “This acquisition will be a significant accelerant as we pivot toward growth and modernize the foundation of our company with technology at the forefront of everything we do. From a financial point of view we firmly believe the stand-alone Adore Me business can continue their industry-leading sales growth at operating margin rates that are similar or accretive to the VS & Co operating model. We view this acquisition as a win-win opportunity to drive long-term sustainable shareholder value.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL2FsYXNrYXB1YmxpYy5vcmcvMjAyMy8wMS8wMy93YXJtaW5nLXdhdGVycy1hcmUtZHJpdmluZy1iZXJpbmctc2VhLWNyYXNoZXMtYnV0LWFsYXNrYXMtZmlzaGluZy1pbmR1c3RyeS1pcy1xdWlldC1vbi1jbGltYXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warming waters are driving Bering Sea crashes but Alaska's fishing industry is quiet on climate,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='alaskapublic.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2023/01/03/warming-waters-are-driving-bering-sea-crashes-but-alaskas-fishing-industry-is-quiet-on-climate/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E5E21840>, 'Connection to alaskapublic.org timed out.

The lingerie and beauty products retailer announced Tuesday (Jan. 3) the upcoming departure of Brand CEO Amy Hauk and the completion of its acquisition of digitally native intimates brand Adore Me.

Following the news the company’s stock dropped about 8% Tuesday but picked up 2% Wednesday morning (Jan. 4).

Victoria’s Secret said in a Tuesday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that Hauk told the company Dec. 27 that she will resign her position effective March 31.

At that time Company CEO Martin Waters will take on the additional role of Brand CEO.

In a statement provided to PYMNTS Victoria’s Secret said Hauk is stepping down to spend more time with her family.

“Amy has graciously agreed to a managed transition between now and the end of March” the statement said. “There are no plans to replace her role.”

Hauk who had been CEO of Pink since 2018 was named to her current role July 12 amid a reduction of about 160 management roles and a corporate overhaul that brought Victoria’s Secret Pink and Beauty together under one umbrella.

In Tuesday’s other announcement Victoria’s Secret said that with the completion of its acquisition of Adore Me it will leverage that firm’s expertise and technology to improve the Victoria’s Secret and Pink shopping experience and digital platform.

“From the beginning we evaluated Adore Me as a two for one opportunity — a technology-led digital-first innovator in the intimates category and a highly efficient growing and profitable standalone business model” Waters said in a Tuesday press release.

The acquisition was designed to help Victoria’s Secret expand its audience online and off as it was looking to boost its growth after a difficult summer.

Victoria’s Secret has been in a state of transformation for about 17 months since announcing in August 2021 that it was charting a new path focused less on sex appeal and more on female empowerment.

“Our job now is to rebuild the foundation go back to the fundamentals and that’s where we start right now” then-new CEO Waters said at the time.

Seven months into the brand transformation PYMNTS reported that essentially everything that put the retailer on the map over the previous 30 years had either been changed or scrapped altogether.

As of Dec. 1 however Victoria’s Secret was working to entice customers with bargains and innovation amid a drop in sales and a “very cautious consumer.”

Customers trickle into the building rushing indoors to avoid the 17-degree weather on a breezy December day.

It's pitch-black outside for most of the day this time of year in Utqiagvik the northernmost U.S. city. It's at the very top of Alaska reachable only by planes from hundreds of miles away.

Some customers walk or drive to the branch. A few come by four-wheeler ATVs or snowmobiles that locals call ""snow machines"" which drivers put in idle while they go in to deposit money. Others take a flat-rate $6 cab visit the ATM and come right back out.

Many customers say they feel happy with Wells Fargo the country's fourth-largest bank and one that's spent years trying to rehabilitate its image following a series of consumer abuse scandals. Though there are some complaints many say they like the branch's six employees and feel at home.

""They're almost like family now"" Teodoro Aguilar López 60 said in Spanish. He moved to Utqiagvik from Mazatlán Mexico more than two decades ago.

But a common feeling among residents is that they want more choices.

""They're the only choice we've got"" said John Stoffa 50. ""They do me good. I have never had any problems with them but it's always good to have options.""

A desire for more banks reflects a challenge for consumers in rural parts of the United States whether in the northern tip of Alaska or in the lower 48 states. Access is even more limited in ""banking deserts"" where there's no branch nearby such as villages across Alaska or rural areas in other states where banks have steadily shuttered branches .

Some in Utqiagvik specifically clamor for Alaska USA Federal Credit Union which has online banking customers in Utqiagvik but lacks a physical presence here.

""Come on up Alaska USA. We want you"" said a woman in her 40s who uses both Alaska USA and Wells Fargo and did not want to be identified publicly. Others also requested anonymity to talk about their bank in a small community.

In a statement Wells Fargo said it's ""committed to meeting the unique needs of the community"" and that its customers ""value the personal connection they have with our branch bankers.""

""Wells Fargo's branches across Alaska continue to play an important role in the way we serve our customers in the state including in rural communities like Utqiagvik where other financial institutions have not made the same commitment"" the company said.

Some 5000 people live in Utqiagvik which in 2016 narrowly voted to change its name from Barrow and more than half of the residents are Alaska Natives.

The Wells Fargo branch displays some of the history of the Iñupiat people whose roots in the region go back thousands of years. A mural inside includes a 1930 beachside photo of an ""umiak"" the kind of boat that the Iñupiat still use to hunt whales next to an arch made out of the bones of a bowhead whale.

Another wall by the entrance has a photo of Wells Fargo's iconic horse-drawn carriage and a painting of a polar bear climbing out of the water and onto an ice sheet. It's not unheard of for polar bears to wander into town.

No change on the horizon

It doesn't appear that Utqiagvik residents will get another bank branch anytime soon.

Alaska USA which over the years has expanded in other states did not respond to several requests for comment on whether the credit union would consider opening a branch in Utqiagvik.

The $12 billion-asset credit union had a branch in the city going back to at least 1975 according to a National Credit Union Administration quarterly report that included a photo of the branch. It's not clear when the branch closed but by 1998 the credit union's website did not list the city among its locations according to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.

Other institutions contacted by American Banker don't have plans to expand in Utqiagvik anytime soon. Northrim Bank has no plans for an Utqiagvik branch in 2023 but is ""always considering ways we can connect with Alaskans for their banking needs"" spokesperson Kari Skinner said. In December Northrim opened a branch in Nome a western Alaska city that is more than 500 miles away from Utqiagvik and is also a ""hub"" city for nearby villages.

A top executive at First National Bank Alaska which last year celebrated its 100th anniversary said it's ""becoming harder and harder"" to justify opening a branch in some areas as consumers' adoption of online banking brings less foot traffic.

""I think we will continue to see challenges with bank branches in more remote locations and I don't think that's unique to Alaska"" said Karl Heinz First National Bank Alaska's branch administration director.

Lack of options can be 'pretty tough'

At least for some the lack of options has been frustrating.

Wiley Contrades a self-described ""60-plus"" Utqiagvik resident said it often feels like branch decisions are made elsewhere. Although she likes the branch's longtime employees Contrades said they often can't resolve issues without contacting Wells Fargo offices outside the city.

""They're limited to what they can do"" Contrades said.

She also said Wells Fargo's fees are ""harsh"" specifically calling out a $10 fee for cashier's checks and a $5 one for money orders.

Another resident who is in his 30s and asked to remain anonymous said Wells Fargo shut him out of loans when he was younger. His credit score had suffered from a small leftover fee for a canceled phone contract that went to collections prompting Wells Fargo to reject him for a small loan as he sought to rebuild his credit he said.

""Wells Fargo wasn't willing to help us but Alaska USA jumped right at the opportunity and coached us through how to build your credit"" he said adding that he got a $300 personal loan from the credit union and a $500 credit card ""all in the same sitting.""

Asked whether he likes Wells Fargo he said ""It's good because it gives us a local option but it's pretty tough because they kind of have a chokehold on us.""

In its statement Wells Fargo said its branch bankers ""provide important financial guidance and competitive products and services"" ranging from common branch activities like deposits to teaching customers how to use their mobile and online banking tools.



A long history in the city

Wells Fargo acquired the branch in the early 2000s as part of a national expansion strategy. But the branch has been operating since April 17 1962 when it opened as a branch of Nome-based Miners and Merchants Bank.

On its opening day the bank gave away prizes to people who walked into its doors and a gift to whoever opened accounts according to archives of the Nome Nugget newspaper. An F-27 airplane flew in from Nome sponsored by that city's chamber of commerce for those who wanted to attend the grand opening.

Miners and Merchants Bank which dated back to 1904 was acquired by Alaska National Bank of Fairbanks in the late 1960s. The merger was partly driven by staffing concerns given that Miners and Merchants ""had difficulty in attracting management because of its remote location and the severe climatic condition"" according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's decision to approve the merger in 1969.

One of the landmarks in Utqiagvik Alaska is an arch next to the Arctic Ocean made of the bones of a bowhead whale. Sitting alongside it is an ""umiak"" boat that the Iñupiat use to hunt whales. Polo Rocha

That bank which later went by Alaska National Bank of the North failed in 1987. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. moved its deposits to the National Bank of Alaska which was the state's largest bank after steadily growing for decades under the Rasmuson family's leadership.

Then in 1999 Wells Fargo agreed to buy National Bank of Alaska and its 54 branches for $907 million. In the announcement  then-Wells Fargo CEO Richard Kovacevich praised the Rasmuson family for the ""historic role they've played in the development of Alaska's economy and culture.""

The bank's former chairman Edward Rasmuson said at the time that ""the decision to sell was not easy."" His grandfather had become the bank's president in 1919 shortly after its founding. But the financial services industry's continued consolidation highlighted ""the challenge of a regional bank surviving with the changing financial climate that is upon us"" he said.

""To adequately compete I have always said that we need to be part of a large financial company"" Rasmuson said while assuring customers that the bank's commitment to Alaskans ""would continue to grow under the new Wells Fargo.""

At the time of the merger a few community groups warned regulators that Wells Fargo might decide to shut down branches in rural Alaska.

In the two decades since Wells Fargo has fully only exited one Alaska community: Metlakatla an island community that is a 45-minute ferry ride away from a Wells branch in Ketchikan. The bank has also trimmed its branch footprint in Anchorage Fairbanks Juneau and a couple of other cities.

""I work out in all these remote places around the state and they always seem to have a Wells Fargo"" said Charles Mullen who just moved back to Utqiagvik to work at the school district. ""So that's really why I've stuck with them.""

Robyn Burke 31 the executive director of human resources at Iḷisaġvik College in Utqiagvik has been a Wells Fargo customer her entire adult life and said the branch staff is ""really great.""

""When you walk in the door they greet you by your name"" she said.

But when she bought her first car she applied for a loan with Alaska USA based on recommendations from others that it's easier to get approved for credit there.

Data on that question is only available for mortgages which shows Alaska USA and its mortgage subsidiary approved roughly 71% of applicants in the region who sought to buy a home between 2010 and 2021. Wells Fargo's rate for approving loans was lower at 64% according to Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data. The fair lending analytics company FairPlay AI conducted the analysis on behalf of American Banker.

The data is hard to draw conclusions from given the limited amount of homes available to purchase and overall small amount of loans. But the figures showed Wells Fargo had virtually no disparities in its loan origination rates for Native and white applicants while Alaska USA was slightly more likely to approve white applicants.

The credit union had more significant disparities for the 60 applicants who sought to refinance their home during that time period. Alaska USA approved 43% of Native borrowers who sought to refinance compared with 69% of white ones. Wells Fargo had virtually no such disparities in originations among its 84 refinance applicants.

Alaska USA did not respond to requests for comment on its mortgage lending record.

Wells Fargo said it's engaged with government officials Alaska Native organizations and community groups to tackle the various housing-related challenges residents face. Those challenges include ""a very low inventory of single-family owner-occupied homes limited access to building materials short building seasons and few incentives for developers to build more homes"" the bank said.

Wells Fargo 'done just fine for us'

But even if Alaska USA comes to town some local residents probably wouldn't make the switch.

Jennie Elavgak who switched to Wells Fargo last year likes the bank because her direct deposit lands quicker than it used to at Alaska USA. She said the credit union's slower service caused her to miss a couple of bill payments. Alaska USA did not respond to questions about her issue.

Elavgak who is graduating from high school this year described Wells Fargo as a family-oriented bank that helps parents save for their kids' college education and open up bank accounts for them.

""It's just a welcoming branch"" Elavgak said before hopping back on her snow machine and leaving the parking lot.

Geoff Carroll a retired fish and game biologist brought up Wells Fargo's ongoing regulatory troubles stemming from the fake-accounts scandal that exploded in 2016.

""It's kind of scary when you hear the national news"" Carroll said. ""Seems like Wells Fargo is always in trouble for something or other. It makes you kind of wonder.""

But he said Wells Fargo has ""always done just fine for us.""

Stoffa meanwhile said he likes Wells Fargo because it's ""right here in town"" and provides ""excellent"" customer service. Stoffa used to bank with Alaska USA but he said he got tired of ""having to deal with them over the phone all the time.""

The banking industry is increasingly relying on phone support and mobile apps to help customers. But those actions risk losing customers like Stoffa who said he prefers working out any issues in person.

""Having that face-to-face communication with a banker is always good"" Stoffa said.

The Federal Reserve has rolled out a list of top US banks by assets and we’ve broken down exactly how these financial service giants manage to stay ahead of the competition. For decades banks have been merging partnering and expanding—so much so that the top four banks accounted for 50% of all US banking assets last year.

In addition to having more than a trillion dollars in consolidated domestic assets JPMorgan Chase Bank of America Citigroup and Wells Fargo increased their tech spending to meet the growing demand for efficient mobile banking apps and compete with neobanks and other fintechs.

The incumbents’ shift towards digital strategy gave them an edge among customers—from traditional to early adopters—regardless of their level of comfort with technology. This demonstrates that digital payment options are no longer complementary but crucial in today’s mobile-first world.

These are the top 10 banks in the US by assets with key insights as to how they got there where they plan to go in the future and how smaller banks can stand out in a competitive industry.

1. JPMorgan Chase – $3.31 Trillion

By targeting digitally-savvy consumers and introducing artificial intelligence (AI) to its offerings JPMorgan Chase has been able to outperform its competitors. JPMorgan is playing the long-game by acquiring millennials through digital channels—in hopes of eventually converting them to higher-value customers.

Additionally JPMorgan is investing heavily in banking technology and had the biggest tech budget of all banks in 2019 with $11.4 billion. A key focus of these funds is identifying use cases to implement AI techniques—such as leveraging voice assistants to enable investment banking clients to access analyst reports and stock exchange information.

In addition to keeping tabs on direct competitors JP Morgan is also keeping tabs on how companies in other sectors are marketing to clients. “We look across all industries—it may be totally unrelated to financial services” says Allison Beer. “When we find some delightful customer experience I’ll screenshot it on my phone and show it to my team as inspiration” adds Beer.

2. Bank of America – $2.41 Trillion

Bank of America has been able to cut costs and appeal to young users by adapting strategies for the digital age. The bank’s digitized branches–which allow customers to access contactless ATMs and connect with call centers via video-conference technology—accumulated half the traffic of nearby branches only five months after launching in 2017.

Bank of America’s voice assistant Erica has surpassed 15 million users per year. Android Community

Bank of America’s digital-only services have also re-defined what the company offers its customers. Its voice-enabled assistant Erica allows customers to make peer-to-peer (P2P) payments as well as bill payments. Since officially launching in 2017 Erica has surpassed 15 million users.

What’s more digital payments network Zelle allows users to digitally send real-time payments to friends and family. By integrating this feature into its mobile app Bank of America has opened the door for increased consumer engagement.

Among the new financial service products to launch this year Bank of America released a business-to-consumer (B2C) payout solution that gives users greater flexibility with payments; a new credit card meant for business travelers; and a new credit card tied to a cash rewards program.

3. Citigroup – $1.714 Trillion

For four years in a row Citibank has been named the “Best Bank for High-Net-Worth Families” by Kiplinger’s Personal Finance. For customers that maintain $200000 in deposit retirement and investment accounts the bank grants them access to its Citigold Package.

Insider Intelligence’s Mobile Banking Competitive Edge Study also shows that Citi took the top spot for digital money management tools as rated by consumers. Its in-platform features—including the ability to view recurring charges and see a financial wellness score—helped Citi secure a spot as one of the best banks in the US.

As for the future of growth it’s all about ensuring “that every product we deliver at Citi is digital first” says Michael Naggar chief digital officer of Citibank’s US consumer bank. “Today digital means taking transactions out of the call center and branch and digitizing them. But our goal is connecting analog and digital so that people can’t see where one ends and the other begins” adds Naggar.

Now due to rising interest from its customers Citigroup is looking into launching crypto services such as financing trading and custody. What’s more it narrowly beat out Wells Fargo this year securing the top 3 spot in assets of the big four banks in 2022.

4. Wells Fargo & Co. – $1.712 Trillion

Wells Fargo is following the lead of top competitors by targeting millennials through mobile financial services. Pay with Wells Fargo is a mobile service where users can access their most used payment features before signing into the app. Additionally Wells Fargo’s app Greenhouse helps customers simplify their bills and track spending.

Over the last year Wells Fargo has been optimizing its business to focus on sectors with strong revenue-generating potential like credit cards. For example the financial services firm has a new suite of Visa credit cards which will directly challenge a joint card from PayPal Synchrony Financial as well as Citigroup’s Double Cash per Bloomberg.

Joining the contactless payment market has also bolstered Wells Fargo’s position as a leading bank. This is not surprising as 78% of the top 100 US merchants are now accepting contactless transactions and 44% of US consumers prefer contactless payments per Insider Intelligence research.

5. U.S. Bancorp – $591.21 Billion

U.S. Bancorp the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association earned a spot on the list of top US banks due to its commitment to compete with tech giants making their way into the banking industry.

With Facebook Amazon Apple and Google all announcing their desire to launch financial services U.S. Bancorp was inspired to improve its own technology. According to Terry Dolan chief financial officer of U.S. Bancorp “the bank plans to partner with fintechs in order to maintain competitive banking technology.”

6. PNC Financial Services – $553.39 Billion

PNC Bank stands out as a top US bank due to its specialized customer perks and original products and services. For example PNC offers mobile payment options to corporate clients who hold Visa commercial cards—allowing them to leverage popular mobile wallets like Apple Pay.

What’s more PNC has taken steps to combat fraud a growing problem in the financial industry and the digital world—including piloted credit cards with card verification values that periodically refresh. While fraudsters may be able to guess three-digit CVV codes relatively easily due to the limited number of permutations periodically changing CVVs makes stolen data less valuable.

Most recently PNC responded to the rise in digital banking by rolling out hybrid branches called solution centers—housing self-serve tools such as video teller machines ATMs and mobile workstations while in-person staff assist with more complex needs. The hybrid approach is a strong tactic that aligns well with consumer preferences. For example a 2020 KPMG survey showed that once the pandemic eases customers would be less likely to visit branches to manage accounts (6%) or check balances (8%).

7. Truist Financial Corporation – $534.19 Billion

Truist is the bank formed by Branch Banking and Trust Company (BB&T) and SunTrust at the end of 2019. According to the Federal Reserve’s 2019 figures BB&T and SunTrust were ranked 11th and 12th in bank assets respectively.

Now operating over 2000 branches in 15 states and Washington D.C. the combined bank offers consumer and commercial banking asset management securities brokerage mortgage and insurance products and financial services.

8. Goldman Sachs – $513.91 Billion

A newcomer to the top ten Goldman Sachs is a well known global investment banking management and securities firm. Its clients have access to a variety of financial services including banking products through Marcus—its online banking division that made its debut in fall 2016 and began offering personal loans per Bankrate.

While its investment banking arm experienced a hit in Q3 of 2022 Goldman saw its consumer and wealth management revenue increase 18% YoY due to credit card balances and higher interest rates. Additionally its fixed income saw 41% YoY growth—helping Goldman exceed analysts’ estimates. The firm has also announced a full overhaul of its products and services to mitigate its losses in other areas.

9. TD Bank – $394.33 Billion

In addition to having extensive influence abroad TD Bank has become one of the largest banks in the US due to its integration of artificial intelligence and utilization of digital technology.

TD Bank has partnered with KAI Consumer Banking to launch Clari an AI-powered chatbot in Canada. Clari answers customers’ questions via text message and notifies them when credit card payments and when a payment is made. As Clari has significantly cut down the call volume in Canada it is likely that TD Bank may develop a similar chatbot for its US branches.

In another partnership the company teamed up with fintech provider Amount to leverage its suite of digital lending tools—including fraud detection and account verification.

10. Capital One – $391.81 Billion

Capital One has made the list of top US banks likely due to its ongoing commitment to digital transformation. Capital One increased its technology staff from 2500 in 2011 to 9000 in 2019 helping launch Eno—its AI-powered chatbot similar to Bank of America’s Erica.

Despite its major data breach in mid-2019 the bank also came first on our Banking Digital Trust Report where it was the frontrunner on all six pillars of trust: security privacy reputation reliability ease of use and feature breadth. Capital One’s high scores likely stemmed from its recent large-scale cloud migration which has improved service continuity facilitated upgrades and reinforced security protocols to get back into customers’ good graces.

Capital One also acquired fintech United Income in 2019 a digital platform that offers wealth management services for people transitioning into retirement. This combination allows the firm to offer technological capabilities with human facets. For example by providing access to a team of wealth managers this makes Capital One appealing to consumers who still desire human interaction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9jcmVkaXRvcnMtc2Vlay10by1mb3JjZS1zaHV0dGVyZWQtdW5pdGVkLWZ1cm5pdHVyZS1pbnRvLWJhbmtydXB0Y3nSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVpZ2h0d2F2ZXMuY29tL25ld3MvY3JlZGl0b3JzLXNlZWstdG8tZm9yY2Utc2h1dHRlcmVkLXVuaXRlZC1mdXJuaXR1cmUtaW50by1iYW5rcnVwdGN5L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wells Fargo seeks to force shuttered UFI into bankruptcy,"New details have emerged in recent court filings about United Furniture Industries’ financial health leading up to the company’s abrupt decision to cease operations two days before Thanksgiving.

Besides filing a petition Friday to force Mississippi-based United Furniture and its 10 affiliates into Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings Wells Fargo Bank submitted a 377-page emergency motion seeking the appointment of an interim trustee.

In its motion Wells Fargo asserts that UFI management contacted the bank “with little prior notice” on Nov. 21 — the same day the furniture manufacturer shuttered operations — advising the bank that it needed “substantial capital immediately” or it would not be able to fund continued operations.

“Wells Fargo advised UFI’s management that it could not agree to the request for additional funding on such short notice without additional information including a budget for restructuring purposes and internal credit committee approval” according to the emergency motion.

Later that day United Furniture’s management advised Wells Fargo that it had decided “to immediately cease operations and lay off all of its employees effective immediately” according to court documents.

Citing “unforeseen business circumstances” United Furniture’s management fired more than 2700 employees and truck drivers either by email or text late Monday notifying them not to report to work on Tuesday.

UFI’s ‘disorderly closure’

Wells Fargo claims in the lengthy emergency motion that United Furniture owes it more than $99 million in secured debt excluding interest fees and expenses. The bank also outlines why it along with two creditors filed the involuntary Chapter 7 petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Mississippi.

“The abrupt shutdown of United Furniture Industries Inc. (‘UFI’) by company owners has adversely affected thousands of UFI’s employees vendors customers and creditors” Wells Fargo said in a statement. “Wells Fargo has been diligently working to help those impacted by UFI’s disorderly closure. After analyzing all possible options we have determined the best way to proceed is through an organized and formal court process to properly handle all issues that have come to light after the company’s decision to close its doors. Our hope is that with court supervision everyone impacted will be treated fairly.”





The court filing states that Wells Fargo entered into a credit agreement to provide a revolving credit facility of up to $130 million to United Furniture and its related entities in January 2021. The agreement had been amended four times — March 8 2021 Jan. 31 2022 June 30 2022 and July 1 2022 — over a two-year period.

A source familiar with the furniture manufacturer’s abrupt closure said company owner David Belford had rehired United Furniture’s former controller Kimberly Harper as CFO to help with the company’s wind down. In early December Belford who also serves as chairman of the board of directors also hired Chicago-based attorney Mark S. Melickian of Sugar Felsenthal Grais & Helsinger to assist UFI’s lenders in liquidating assets. Melickian leads the firm’s restructuring insolvency and special situations practice group according to its website.

As of publication Harper and Melickian had not responded to FreightWaves’ repeated requests seeking comment.

Wells Fargo: Forcing UFI into bankruptcy is necessary

In its motion Wells Fargo claims the move to force United Furniture into bankruptcy is necessary after the bank was forced to step in after the furniture company ceased operations to preserve its collateral and make the liquidation process more orderly. Wells Fargo states that all of UFI’s officers and executive team resigned over a two-day period after the mass firing of workers at its facilities in Mississippi North Carolina and California.

UFI Transportation the company’s over-the-road division relied on backhauls of brokered freight as a revenue source after making furniture deliveries across the U.S.

Truckers were instructed to “immediately return equipment inventory and delivery documents” to the furniture company’s facilities in Winston-Salem North Carolina Verona Mississippi or Victorville California. However some freight that was still on trucks was left at UFI’s 12 other locations.

At that time United Furniture also abandoned all 24 of its properties leaving the sites without security to guard customers’ freight and without insurance coverage which forced Wells Fargo to step in to “preserve its collateral and maintain some order in liquidating UFI.”

Five weeks after the furniture company shut down frustrated brokerages and trucking companies still haven’t been able to retrieve their goods including 53-foot trailers full of inventory that remain impounded at UFI facilities.





In its four-page petition filed Friday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Mississippi Wells Fargo claims United Furniture is “generally not paying its debts as they become due” and that the bank is owed approximately $20000 for revolving credit facility claims. Other petitioners listed in the bare-bones filing are Security Associates of Mississippi/Alabama LLC owed $265000 for unpaid services and V&B International Inc. of Port Gibson Mississippi owed more than $30000 for purchase orders.

The petition lists 14 other creditors but doesn’t provide a monetary range for UFI’s assets and liabilities.

A hearing on the petition and emergency motion seeking to appoint an interim trustee is set for Friday.

As we learned to live with COVID-19 in our communities during 2022 the local news focus on my beats centered once again on public health legislative and economic developments.

Forsyth County's largest employer — Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center at more than 13000 workers — became a part of the national healthcare consolidation churn for the second time.

After tying its future in October 2019 to Atrium Health in a ""strategic combination"" featuring a long-sought medical school in Charlotte Baptist became on Dec. 2 part of the nation's fifth-largest healthcare system when Atrium merged with Advocate Aurora to form Advocate Health.

The great debate on Medicaid expansion in North Carolina came close to reaching an agreement between the state House and Senate in June only to be carried over into the 2023 session by Republican legislature leaders.

That meant between 450000 and 650000 potential beneficiaries were forced to wait another year for action as North Carolina remained one of just 12 non-expansion states all with Republican-controlled legislatures.

The stunning overnight collapse of United Furniture Industries Inc. on Nov. 22 permanently closed five Triad facilities — where it was reported to have had between 530 and 600 employees including between 50 and 70 in Winston-Salem. United also eliminated 199 jobs in ending local production in July.

United's shutdown — one of the largest manufacturing job cuts in the nation at 2700 overall — sent employees into a job market offering the promise of other manufacturing employment and the nation's most stringent unemployment benefits.

A major factor of COVID-19 during 2022 involved more Triad residents becoming overwhelmed by medical debt burdens an issue that became heated talking point in the legislature.

A local example was Kernersville resident Alicia Pender whose life turned into a physical and emotional tailspin since her COVID-19 diagnosis in December 2020.

However what is causing Pender the most stress she said is being overwhelmed by more than $30000 in COVID-19 related medical bills.

In April the nearly 18-year saga surrounding controversial Winston-Salem Dr. Anne Litton White came to a conclusion when she closed her practice as part of the indefinite suspension of her medical license issued in March.

White had been the operator of Carolina Laser and Cosmetic Center since 2004.

White has been subject to a board notice of charges and allegations six times before closing her practice the others occurring in 2004 2005 2008 2017 and 2018-20.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ1cm5pdHVyZXRvZGF5LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL3dlbGxzLWZhcmdvLWFuZC10d28tb3RoZXItY3JlZGl0b3JzLXNlZWstaW52b2x1bnRhcnktY2gtNy1mb3ItbGFuZS1mdXJuaXR1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wells Fargo and two other creditors seek involuntary Ch. 7 for Lane Furniture,"ABERDEEN Miss. – Three creditors including bank Wells Fargo have made moves to push Lane Furniture into an involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court here.

Joined by two other creditors of United Furniture/Lane Furniture Wells Fargo said in court documents filed Dec. 30 that the move is necessary to help offset the $99.2 million the furniture maker owes the bank.

Wells Fargo is joined in the petition by Security Associates of Mississippi/Alabama a security firm hired by Wells Fargo to protect the closed Lane factories; and V&B International a Port Gibson Miss. hardwood sawmill and wood products manufacturer. According to court documents United Furniture owes the three companies more than $99.5 million excluding interest fees and expenses.

United Furniture abruptly shuttered its doors Nov. 22 and informed all employees via email or text that the company was ceasing operations. The closure shocked the industry and has resulted in a number of lawsuits by former employees and suppliers.

The court filing outlines a few more details of the week of the company’s closing. According to a declaration included with the petition Marc Grossman managing director of Wells Fargo said United management contacted the bank Nov. 21 “with little prior notice” advising that the company needed “substantial capital immediately or it would not be able to fund continued operations.”

According to Grossman’s document the bank was owed more than $97.8 million in principal under the credit line and “UFI was in default under various provisions of the credit agreement.” Because of that default Wells Fargo told the management team that it “could not accede to its request for the additional funding on such short notice without additional information including a budget for restructuring purposes and internal credit committee approval at Wells Fargo.”

Late on that same day – Nov. 21 – United Furniture’s management told Grossman that it had decided to “cease operations and lay off all of its employees effective immediately.” In addition to shuttering its operations United Furniture left its 15 facilities without security and without insurance coverage after Nov. 30.

On Nov. 22 the bank was told that all “officers of UFI had resigned effective immediately with the exception of UFI’s CEO and CFO both of whom resigned on Nov. 23 2022.”

With the notice that the officers had resigned Wells Fargo hired Focus Management Group a turnaround company to help secure United’s properties and systems and to begin liquidating Wells Fargo’s collateral.

The court documents tell a tale of United Furniture’s financial struggles. The Grossman declaration shares details of a credit agreement signed Jan. 28 2021 that provided the company with a Wells Fargo credit line of up to $130 million.

The credit line is “fully secured by all of UFI’s personal property and other assets including all of UFI’s cash receivables inventory chattel paper furniture equipment and books and records on all of which Wells Fargo has a lien” according to the declaration. The agreement Grossman said was amended four times – March 8 2021; Jan. 31 2022; June 30 2022; and most recently July 1 2022.

Wells Fargo V&B International and Security Associates of Mississippi/Alabama have requested the bankruptcy court to appoint an interim trustee require one or more members of the United board to be responsible for filing financial details and appear under oath require United to respond to the filing within 10 days and set a trial within 20 days.

The law also aims to limit price hikes to the rate of inflation which has been historically elevated over the last year.

At the same time even large pharmaceutical companies are being forced to contend with inflation and supply chain squeezes that have led to a bump in manufacturing expenses Reuters points out. Still it remains to be seen how the industry's overall profitability in 2022 will compare with prior years.

These price hikes likely won't surprise industry watchers. Drugmakers routinely use the first day of the year and sometimes July 1 to raise their list prices.

So far the median percentage increase on the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of brand name drugs whose prices have risen in 2023 clocks in at 5% according to 46brooklyn. That’s about on par with the 4.9% median WAC increase the industry saw in 2022 according to the non-profit’s research.

All told drugmakers hiked the prices on more than 1400 drugs last year marking the greatest number of price increases since 2015 46brooklyn notes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vcGhhcm1hL25vdmFydGlzLXBheXMtMjQ1bS1zZXR0bGUtZXhmb3JnZS1nZW5lcmljLXBheS1kZWxheS1sYXdzdWl0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Novartis pays $245M to settle Exforge generic pay-for-delay lawsuit,"Novartis has decided to end a classic generic pay-for-delay legal battle with a series of settlements.

The Swiss pharma will pay altogether $245 million in separate settlements with direct purchasers indirect purchases and retailers who had accused the company of colluding with Endo’s Par Pharmaceutical to push back the launch of a generic version of Novartis’ high blood pressure med Exforge. A Novartis spokesperson confirmed the agreement with Fierce Pharma.

Once approved by a federal judge in New York the settlements will “resolve all outstanding claims” related to the Exforge case Novartis said in a statement. Of the settlements with the three plaintiff groups the one made with the retailer class—including pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens—doesn’t require court approval and will remain confidential the spokesperson explained.

The litigation started in 2018 and centered on an agreement Novartis and Par signed in 2011. As part of the deal Par agreed not to launch a generic version of Exforge until September 2014 more than two years after the expiration of a patent according to a complaint. In exchange Novartis agreed not to launch an authorized generic of Exforge during a 180-day period of exclusivity that the FDA granted to the Par version as the first copycat of the Novartis drug.

Without that deal Par would have launched its generic as early as September 2012 when the patent expired or March 2013 at the latest when the generic got its final FDA approval the plaintiffs argued.

The lawsuit alleged that as a result of the agreement between Novartis and Par the plaintiffs paid more for brand and generic Exforge than they otherwise would have. The so-called “pay for delay” agreement violated federal antitrust laws the plaintiffs said. Novartis denied those allegations and didn’t admit to any wrongdoing in a public settlement agreement with the direct purchasers.

Lawsuits challenging the legality of pay-for-delay deals are common in the biopharma industry. Such deals typically involve a branded drugmaker compensating a generic competitor to delay the launch of a generic product. In 2022 AbbVie inked a $54 million deal to settle pay-for-delay claims around its Alzheimer’s disease drug Namenda. AstraZeneca is battling a similar claim targeting its antipsychotic Seroquel XR. Par was also one of the defendants in another reverse payment lawsuit over Takeda’s constipation drug Amitiza.

Ending the Exforge civil case marks another step for Novartis to put some of its legacy problems behind it. The settlements allow Novartis to focus on its current business the company said in a statement.

Back in 2020 the Swiss pharma agreed to a $729 million settlement to end litigation alleging that it used sham speaker programs and events to offer kickbacks to doctors to boost prescription of its drugs including Exforge.

Also in 2020 Novartis shelled out $347 million and admitted to bribing doctors in several countries under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It also paid $195 million as part of an industrywide generics price-fixing scheme that also implicated several companies such as Teva Mylan and several Indian generic drugmakers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3NwaGFybWEuaW4vaG93LWRhdGEtaXMtdHJhbnNmb3JtaW5nLWJ1c2luZXNzLWZvci1waGFybWEtaW5kdXN0cnkv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwcmVzc3BoYXJtYS5pbi9hbXAvaG93LWRhdGEtaXMtdHJhbnNmb3JtaW5nLWJ1c2luZXNzLWZvci1waGFybWEtaW5kdXN0cnkv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How data is transforming business for pharma industry,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.expresspharma.in', port=443): Read timed out.

This article focuses on contract and private-label bottlers. While some of the larger bottlers produce their own branded products those that are listed here will also solicit business from other beverage/food makers usually offering either co-packing or private labeling and many times both. Bottlers use both plastic and glass bottles with some producers such as brewers and vintners almost universally choosing glass while many soft drink and bottled water makers opt for plastic. Sauces and the like are often packaged in glass bottles as well.

Missing from the list are the larger retail brand bottlers of nationally-known sodas beers etc. as it is assumed that these companies do not offer contract or private-label bottling or at least do not advertise it if they do. Some of these bottlers may be contract bottlers themselves with exclusive contracts for these well-known brands.

Jan 4 (Reuters) - Memory chip maker Western Digital Corp and Japan's Kioxia Holdings Corp have restarted merger talks Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday citing sources familiar with the matter.

The report added that the structure of a potential deal is fluid and both companies are considering merging into one publicly traded company.

Kioxia which was spun off from Toshiba Corp and Western Digital operate a joint flash memory chip plant in central Japan's Yokkaichi.

When asked about the report Kioxia said that it does not comment on market rumours or speculation while Western Digital said that it doesn't speculate on M&A activity.

Western Digital's shares rose about 8% in trading after the bell.

U.S.-based memory chip firm Western Digital said in June that it was reviewing strategic alternatives including options for splitting off its flash-memory and hard disk drive businesses.

Talks between the two companies had stalled over a series of issues including valuation discrepancies uncertainty over securing approval from the Japanese government Reuters had reported in October 2021 citing sources.

Find out more about how we test .

Comparison Products

The 1TB Solidigm P44 Pro is up against some very fast drives such as the WD Black SN850X the Kingston Fury Renegade the Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus-G the Samsung 980 Pro the SK hynix Platinum P41 and the Crucial P5 Plus. Also tested is the Solidigm P41 Plus to give some idea on what you’re getting in a higher-end product.

Trace Testing - 3DMark Storage Benchmark

Built for gamers 3DMark’s Storage Benchmark focuses on real-world gaming performance. Each round in this benchmark stresses storage based on gaming activities including loading games saving progress installing game files and recording gameplay video streams.

The P44 Pro is the fastest drive we’ve ever tested in 3DMark at 1TB as well.

Trace Testing – PCMark 10 Storage Benchmark

PCMark 10 is a trace-based benchmark that uses a wide-ranging set of real-world traces from popular applications and everyday tasks to measure the performance of storage devices.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The P44 Pro dominates in PCMark 10 too. This speaks well of SK hynix’s excellent new flash and its ability to optimize its controllers.

Transfer Rates – DiskBench

We use the DiskBench storage benchmarking tool to test file transfer performance with a custom 50GB dataset. We copy 31227 files of various types such as pictures PDFs and videos to a new folder and then follow-up with a reading test of a newly-written 6.5GB zip file.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The P44 Pro is first in DiskBench too being the fastest 1TB SSD we’ve tested.

Synthetic Testing - ATTO / CrystalDiskMark

ATTO and CrystalDiskMark (CDM) are free and easy-to-use storage benchmarking tools that SSD vendors commonly use to assign performance specifications to their products. Both of these tools give us insight into how each device handles different file sizes.

Image 1 of 12 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

There are no issues with the P44 Pro’s ATTO performance. It’s not the best but the CDM sequential results show the drive can hold its own with only a dip for QD1 writes. Random 4K QD1 latency is good but not the very best. The P41 Plus sibling struggles a bit more at 1TB with sequential performance due to dense QLC but this is not an issue with 4KB performance.

Sustained Write Performance and Cache Recovery

Official write specifications are only part of the performance picture. Most SSDs implement a write cache which is a fast area of (usually) pseudo-SLC programmed flash that absorbs incoming data.

Sustained write speeds can suffer tremendously once the workload spills outside of the cache and into the ""native"" TLC or QLC flash. We use Iometer to hammer the SSD with sequential writes for 15 minutes to measure both the size of the write cache and performance after the cache is saturated. We also monitor cache recovery via multiple idle rounds.

Image 1 of 5 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The 1TB P44 Pro manages almost 6.5 GBps in pSLC mode before falling to below 1.6 GBps afterwards. Both modes are a bit slower than they are with the 2TB model but still very fast. The cache is a bit smaller on the 1TB capacity but larger in relative terms at nearly 215GB. This underlines the fact that this hardware holds up better at 1TB than the competition. We have not yet benchmarked a 1TB 990 Pro but as of now the P44 Pro is the best drive on the market at this capacity in terms of overall performance.

Cache recovery is the same as with the 2TB model and the Platinum P41: fast for static slow for dynamic. This is typical and is a good way to balance endurance and performance.

Power Consumption and Temperature

We use the Quarch HD Programmable Power Module to gain a deeper understanding of power characteristics. Idle power consumption is an important aspect to consider especially if you're looking for a laptop upgrade as even the best ultrabooks can have mediocre storage.

Some SSDs can consume watts of power at idle while better-suited ones sip just milliwatts. Average workload power consumption and max consumption are two other aspects of power consumption but performance-per-watt is more important. A drive might consume more power during any given workload but accomplishing a task faster allows the drive to drop into an idle state more quickly ultimately saving energy.

Temperatures are gauged at both idle and load states via sensor and an infrared thermometer. The typical ambient temperature is at 24C. The load state involves sustained writes at maximum speed with measurement ensuing if and until throttling is demonstrated to discover the equilibrium temperature.

Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The 1TB P44 Pro is extremely efficient matching the class-leading Platinum P41 though it doesn’t quite see the edge that the 2TB model does. SK hynix and Solidigm have done an excellent job in optimizing this drive at all capacities. The P41 Plus on the other hand could use some work. However that drive is using flash that originated with Intel and the controller is not proprietary so we expect better things in the future for its lower-end options.

The 1TB model closely matched the 2TB in temperature testing. TLC writes are a bit faster at 2TB 1.65 GBps versus the 1.5 GBps here but both models throttled down to about 925 MBps after hitting 82C. A heatsink is again recommended.

Inter-city bus services in the Cariboo will be taken over by Ebus as of January 4 2023.

Since 2019 Adventure Charters a Williams Lake company expanded their charter bus services to offer inter-city bus connections between Prince George and Kamloops. However they announced on Dec. 21 2022 they would no longer be continuing the service and Ebus were taking over the route.

Ebus a company originating out of Alberta since 2011 and a sister company to Red Arrow offers bus services across Western Canada and had expanded into B.C. in 2018.

The company will now be taking over the route from Prince George to Kamloops which will connect with existing routes which include services to Vancouver and communities throughout the Okanagan and between Kamloops and Edmonton.

A ticket one-way to Kamloops from Williams Lake is $60 for an adult passenger. One-way to Vancouver for one adult with one transfer is $136.55 as of writing however route options which include Merritt result in a slightly higher fare of $142.82. Customers who already had tickets from Adventure Charters can still use those tickets with Ebus instead as the transition takes place.

Buses will run Kamloops to Prince George on Sundays Wednesdays and Fridays and from Prince George to Kamloops on Monday Thursdays and Saturdays. Connections can be made in Kamloops for Edmonton Kelowna or Vancouver.

Departures and arrivals in Williams Lake will be at the Petro Canada station at 750 Oliver St. and Kamloops connections will take place at the back of the Sahali Mall at 945 Columbia St.

For more detailed schedule and route information go to myebus.ca.

It was an Ebus inter-city bus which crashed on Highway 97C the Okanagan connector on Christmas Eve killing four people and injuring dozens of other passengers. The incident is still under investigation and police it say may have been caused by extremely icy road conditions.

The local company Adventure Charters will still be offering local charters and transportation options for the Williams Lake area which was the company’s original focus.

Buffalo Bill’s Hotel-Casino in Primm reopened on Christmas Eve after being closed since March 2020 because of the pandemic. It is one of three casinos operated by Las Vegas-based Affinity Gaming in the community along Interstate 15 at the Nevada-California border.

The privately held company did not make any formal announcement about the re-opening other than a post on the Primm Valley Resorts Twitter site saying it was proud “to have the reels spinning again at Buffalo Bill’s.”

Representatives from Primm did not respond to emailed questions about the reopening. Buffalo Bill’s was the last of the three Primm casinos to reopen.

In the Twitter statement Primm Valley said “multi-million-dollar upgrades” would be coming to the casinos in 2023.

Primm said slot machines and table games were available at the casino along with the Wagon Wheel Grill restaurant although a Nevada Independent photographer found only a handful of customers a few days after Christmas.

The Desperado Rollercoaster at Buffalo Bill’s remained closed. It was considered one of the world’s tallest roller coasters when it opened in 1994 with a height of 209 feet and a drop of 225 feet with a portion of the track running through the casino.

Affinity then known as Herbst Gaming acquired the three Primm casinos – Buffalo Bill’s Primm Valley and Whiskey Pete’s – from MGM Resorts in 2007 for $400 million. Herbst Gaming filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy two years later.

The company was rebranded as Affinity Gaming in 2011 following the bankruptcy reorganization. Affinity is now owned by Illinois-based Z Capital Group which took Affinity private in 2017. In 2019 Mary Beth Higgins was named CEO.

Affinity operates five casinos in Nevada – the three Primm properties Silver Sevens in Las Vegas and Rail City in Sparks. The company also owns two casinos in Missouri and a casino in Iowa.

GAN deal with WynnBet increases reach for the sports betting platform

Sports betting software provider GAN Ltd. is awaiting licensing by Nevada gaming regulators. But the absence of that approval hasn’t slowed the company’s growth in the continuously evolving market.

The Irvine California-based company which has offices in Las Vegas announced an agreement in late December to provide the sports betting platform and technology to WynnBet the sports betting subsidiary of Wynn Resorts operated by Wynn Interactive.

Terms of the deal between GAN and Wynn were not announced. In a statement GAN said its sports betting technology would be used for the retail sportsbook and online sports betting operations at Encore Boston Harbor when the activity launches in Massachusetts in the next few months.

GAN already provides the online platform for WynnBET’s operations in Michigan. Nevada licensing could eventually lead to GAN becoming the supplier for Wynn’s sports betting in Nevada which currently includes just a retail sportsbook at Wynn Las Vegas.

“We look forward to growing our partnership with GAN and bringing an enhanced sports betting experience to our players” Wynn Interactive President Ian Williams said in a statement.

The agreement with Wynn follows an announcement by GAN in October 2021 to build out the sports betting infrastructure for Station Casinos retail sportsbooks betting kiosks and the STN mobile app.

GAN’s technology and platform are being used by the sportsbook at the Island View Casino in Gulfport Mississippi.

GAN Vice President of North America Sports Rob Lekites said in a statement the company has developed a strong partnership with WynnBET in Massachusetts.

“The reception of GAN Sports remains highly encouraging as we look to carry this positive momentum into a strong cadence of new partner launches over the coming quarters” Lekites said.

In a research note Macquarie Securities gaming analyst Chad Beynon said Wynn and Station Casinos give GAN “two major partners.” He suggested GAN’s Massachusetts sports betting opportunity through Wynn would translate into $2.6 million of revenue and an annual cash flow of $700000.

GAN Vice President of Investor Relations and Capital Markets Robert Shore said in an email the deal with Wynn is “an exclusive national agreement” and additional markets “will be disclosed at the appropriate time.” He said GAN didn’t want to reveal much more to be respectful of the Nevada licensing process.

The company has caught the attention of the investment community as it moves to expand its presence in the ultra-competitive U.S. sports betting market. Ohio became the nation’s 31st state with legal sports betting when it launched on New Year’s Day.

During the Global Gaming Expo in October the GAN booth drew a strong share of interested customers.

VICI contributing $350M toward Fontainebleau’s $2.2B financing package

Real estate investment trust VICI Properties was part of one last Strip deal before 2022 ended.

The company will contribute $350 million toward a $2.2 billion construction loan package that will allow developers of the Fontainebleau resort to complete the long-stalled north Strip project.

Fontainebleau Development and Koch Real Estate Investments announced the loan package on Dec. 23. The Fontainebleau project restarted in November 2021 when the original Florida-based developer reacquired the 25-acre site nine months earlier. The project sat unfinished for 12 years after construction was halted in 2009.

“We believe the addition of the property will contribute to the increased vitality of the north end of the Las Vegas Strip” VICI CFO David Kieske said in a statement.

VICI is the Strip’s largest landowner controlling more than 660 acres that house a dozen properties leased to four companies – MGM Resorts International Caesars Entertainment Apollo Global Management and Hard Rock International.

Last year VICI completed a $17.2 billion buyout of rival real estate investment trust MGM Growth Properties and was part of a $6.25 billion purchase of the Strip properties that were operated by Las Vegas Sands Corp. VICI also owns the 77 acres underneath The Mirage whose operations were purchased in December by Hard Rock from MGM Resorts for almost $1.1 billion.

“VICI wraps an active 2022 which completely changed the complexion of the company increasing its size enhancing visibility with the investment community and upgrading portfolio quality” JMP Securities gaming analyst Mitch Germain told investors in a Dec. 17 research note.

VICI said in its statement the Fontainebleau investment would be funded in accordance with a construction draw schedule.

Fontainebleau Las Vegas is expected to open later this year with 3700 hotel rooms a casino 550000 square feet of convention and meeting space and a collection of dining retail and lifestyle attractions.

Following the construction financing announcement Fontainebleau named five executives who will oversee the day-to-day operations of the property including former Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas Vice President Colleen Birch who was named chief operating officer.

Privately held Maverick Gaming expanded its presence in Washington State acquiring four cardroom casinos for $80.5 million at the end of December.

The company which owns four hotel-casinos in West Wendover and Elko took over operations of Evergreen Gaming’s cardrooms in the Seattle area. Maverick now owns and operates 23 of Washington’s 44 licensed cardrooms.

“Strategically this acquisition is crucial to Maverick’s continued dominance in Washington State” Maverick Gaming CEO Eric Persson said in a statement. “We expect there to be enormous consolidation as well as operational and marketing benefits to our company as a result of this transaction.”

Cardrooms in Washington are limited to a total of 15 table games which can include baccarat poker and variations of blackjack.

Maverick which moved its corporate headquarters from Las Vegas to the Seattle community of Kirkland is seeking to add sports betting to its mix. The company failed in 2020 and 2021 to get the Washington Legislature to include cardrooms in legislation that allowed the state’s tribal casinos to offer sports betting.

Last year Maverick filed a federal lawsuit claiming the state unlawfully granted Native American casinos a “discriminatory tribal gaming monopoly.”

Maverick also owns three casinos in Colorado in Central City and Black Hawk which are 45 minutes outside of Denver.

$5.3B in casino revenue in 2022 marks Macau’s lowest in 18 years

Macau — once the world’s largest gambling market — ended 2022 with its casino industry reporting its lowest 12-month gaming revenue total since 2004.

China’s zero-COVID policies which included travel restrictions quarantines and business shutdowns put a damper on Macau casinos throughout the year. The constraints led to a final revenue figure of $5.3 billion a 51.4 percent decline from 2021 according to a report released by Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau on New Year’s Day.

One positive sign from the December numbers was gaming revenue of $435 million was 13 percent higher than November’s single month total.

However even as China has publicly stated plans to move beyond its zero-COVID policy Stifel Financial gaming analyst Steven Wieczynski said investors shouldn’t get too excited. In a research note published Monday Wieczynski predicted Macau “won’t become more ‘normal’ until after March.”

He said the positive signs that the Chinese government is changing from its “harsh COVID stance” could be upended by any spikes in the virus.

“We still believe the next couple of months will be a roller coaster as China goes through the Covid wave” Wieczynski said. “Investors have to understand the market probably won’t go into recovery mode until mid-2023 at the earliest.”

The gaming revenue results were announced shortly after Macau finalized its relicensing process with its six casino operators on new 10-year agreements. The companies including MGM Resorts International Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands agreed to invest upward of $15 billion into non-gaming entertainment attractions.

To put Macau’s gaming revenue decline into perspective casinos collected a record $45 billion in 2013 with analysts predicting the market would hit $100 million in a few years. Last year yielded one-ninth the revenue of 2013.

Economic conditions in China and a crackdown on the junket industry which delivered large-spending customers to the casinos led to revenue declines over the next six years resulting in $36.6 billion in gaming revenue in 2019 a year before the pandemic upended Macau’s gaming industry.

In 2020 Macau casinos reported gaming revenue of $7.56 billion its lowest figure in 14 years following the cancellations of Chinese New Year celebrations in January a 15-day casino shutdown in February and six straight months of 90 percent gaming declines.

The market rebounded in 2021 to $10.8 billion.

When the final numbers are counted the American Gaming Association suggested the combined gaming revenue from commercial and tribal operations could top $100 billion in 2022.

The Nevada Gaming Commission approved new cybersecurity regulations to protect operators’ information systems from attacks that could shutter casinos and compromise customer data. Casinos are required to do a risk assessment of their systems by the end of 2023. Properties are also required to report any successful breach that compromised player or employee data credit card information and/or other records to gaming regulators within 72 hours.

“It doesn’t mean they can wait 72 hours to respond or react to the cyberattack but to notify us. We felt that was limited enough time that the Board if there were risks to the industry as a whole could take necessary measures to mitigate damage to other participants in the industry.”

The New York Gaming Facility Board released the request for applications which includes a rating system that will determine the winners of the bids for the casino licenses — including the $500 million license fee paid within 30 days of the award of the license.

But the license fee can turn into a more pricey bidding war — separating well-resourced contenders from pretenders.

“An applicant may propose to pay a higher license fee” the siting board said.

The initial casino licenses will run from 10 years to 30 years based on the investment of the winning bidder and revenue to the state weighs heavily in the rating of the bidder’s proposals.

The operators awarded licenses to run any of the three New York City-area casinos will have to pay the state at least a $500 million fee. Stephen Yang

The category of “economic activity and business development factors” will account for 70 percent of the score of the proposals. That includes capital investment “maximizing state and local revenues” providing the most jobs and creating the “highest caliber” casino with an array of amenities.

Workforce development and diversity will account for a combined 20% of the overall score and local siting issues that include mitigating impacts on surrounding neighborhoods accounts for the remaining 10%.

But first applicants must obtain any necessary local government zoning/land-use approvals and receive the blessing of a local community advisory committee — which includes locally elected representatives — before the siting board can even review a bidder’s application.

Because of the community review process there’s no set deadline for when a decision will be made on the awarding of casino licenses according to the siting board. But insiders expect the awards to be made by year’s end.

A consortium proposing a casino for Coney Island immediately released a statement Tuesday saying it will submit a bid for one of the licenses. The group includes Thor Equities Saratoga Casino Holdings The Chicksaw Nation and Legends — the entertainment firm co-owned by the Yankees.

The group plans to submit a comprehensive casino hotel and entertainment proposal for Coney Island — fueled by private not taxpayer investment — to provide an economic boost for southern Brooklyn by creating permanent local jobs for residents.

Is The Times Square Casino A Natural Addition?

While a casino seems like a natural addition to the manic mecca of Manhattan the spending economy isn’t what it used to be. Moreover major upticks in NYC street crime have also impacted the area.

The imminent congestion pricing as well as less predictable commuting patterns are also factors to consider. Will city dwellers and city visitors volunteer to fritter away their hard-earned earnings on the spin of a wheel or turn of a card?

Broadway Casino

Times Square Not the Only Neighborhood in the Game

Another obstacle could also be some stiff competition from other bidders. In a high profile market like NYC there are bound to be challenges usually won by the highest roller. In this case there may be several.

The dynamic duo of Wynn Resorts and Related Companies have their sights for a casino set on new planned community Hudson Yards. The aesthetic would fit in there as well among the high rises and overall sleek vibe.

But don’t count out the outer boroughs just yet as bids are surfacing in Brooklyn and Queens as well.

Cashing In The Chips: A Broadway Casino Could Bring In Massive Revenue

Developers gambling moguls and local and state officials clearly believe that a casino could be just what the city needs to jolt it back into a pre-pandemic economy.

Tourists come with money to spend and with a presumably round-the-clock entertainment option right in the commercial hub of the city that never sleeps there’s plenty of money to be made.

Vacationers looking to let it all ride on red say after a show could do so without heading all the way to Vegas.

A casino could also solve the age-old problem of couples disagreeing on their activity of choice. Men are often dragged to Broadway shows while women tend not to frequent casinos so perhaps the addition would be a win-win with couples splitting up for a few hours to do their own thing.

Broadway Casino Criticism and Theoretical Impact on Broadway Shows

Critics of the Times Square/ Broadway Casino proposal suggest that a casino could compromise the character of the neighborhood one that has come a long way since the seedy 70s and 80s.

Yes Times Square often comes under fire for being Disneyfied but there’s no doubt that it’s much cleaner and safer than it used to be even with the recent crime spikes.

The Broadway League Always Hates New Ideas

As expected The Broadway League staunchly opposes a Times Square casino. They claim that such an enterprise would overwhelm an already dense and crowded region. There’s also a fear that it would take business away from Broadway shows which they contend that the Great White Way cannot afford.



Incidentally Actors’ Equity the stage actors’ labor union fully supports the Broadway casino purporting that the endeavor would increase safety and security levels to the area as well as contribute to sanitation efforts to make New York a cleaner greener place.

Timeline of New York City Casino

The initial review process will officially begin on January 6 2023. The timeline beyond the first round of application reviews remains vague with the newly formed state committee announcing that nothing concrete would be determined until late 2023 at the earliest.

What’s the Verdict? Hold Fold or Go for the Gold?

Would a casino in Times Square ultimately be a positive venture? Tough to say. In terms of crowd density and increased foot traffic it’s really a double bind.

The overcrowding certainly contributes to noise pollution and safety concerns. And willfully contributing to the congestion seems ill-advised. But that same overcrowding is what Times Square is built on— it’s most alive when filled with bright lights blaring sound and people. Nobody wants the apocalyptic looking Times Square of peak-Covid days.

Tourists and Locals Like The Idea

One last point to consider: A casino may not only appeal to tourists but to locals as well. While the average New Yorker only goes to Times Square to catch a Broadway show the chance to try their luck at craps or roulette may prove to be a huge draw.

The commission was directed by the legislature to investigate the option of allowing community choice electricity — currently allowed in 10 states — and to report back by Dec. 15.

Under a CCE arrangement municipalities and counties individually or in groups can pay an exit fee and leave their typically long-term franchise agreements with the investor-owned utility and buy their own electricity on the wholesale market or under contract with independent or “merchant” power companies.

They still depend upon and pay for access to the transmission systems operated by the investor-owned utility.

In other states CCE programs have been used as a tool to promote a quicker transition to clean energy and in some cases have lowered residential electricity costs 15% to 20% according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The PUC report will serve as a guide for potential enabling legislation to be filed this coming session according to Rep. Andrew Boesenecker a Fort Collins Democrat who co-sponsored the bill calling for the study.

“The next thing we look at is enabling legislation to move the process along” Boesenecker said. “A lot of conversations have to happen before then.

“The challenges as I read through the report really have to do with the implementation side and those are fair questions to ask” Boesenecker said. “The PUC process is a good starting point.”

A Senate co-sponsor also must be found Boesenecker said.

PUC spends just about twice as much space in the report outlining the risks and drawbacks of community choice or CCE as it does in describing the benefits which include local control and a possible faster move to clean energy.

“The report generally finds that while there are many benefits of enabling CCE there’s also significant costs risks and uncertainties that suggest a cautionary approach may be appropriate” Seina Soufiani a PUC staff engineer said in presenting the report for commission approval in late November.

Colorado’s investor-owned utilities — Xcel Energy and Black Hills Energy — opposed the CCE study legislation and in the PUC proceedings raised a number concerns about the policy

“It is a wolf in sheep’s clothing and hides the dangers of what a few see as a solution but is really trying to solve a diminishing problem” Xcel Energy said in a PUC filing pointing out it is quickly adding renewable generation.

The report includes some of the concerns voiced by Xcel Energy and Black Hills as well as ones by the state Office of Utility Consumer Advocate about the possible risk of higher bills under CCE and its impact on low-income customers.

“Maybe they put more emphasis into the risk than benefits” said Larry Miloshevich an independent CCE advocate who participated in the PUC docket. “It is likely the reader would take away the impression that the benefits are possible but drawbacks are likely.”

The first CCE program went into operation in Massachusetts in 1999. There are now 150 CCE programs in the state including one in Boston.

The approach became high profile when California adopted a law enabling CCE and the first program — MCE — started in Marin County in 2010. It now serves 1 million customers across four Northern California counties according to the company.

MCE customers have the option of getting 60% of their electricity from green sources or for a premium getting 100% of their energy from renewables.

By 2021 about 7 million customers received their electricity through community choice programs about 4% of all customers in the country with 4.4 million accounts in California and 1.1 million in Illinois according to renewable energy consultant Clean Kilowatts.

The PUC report found that CCE could enable communities to tailor energy resiliency and energy generation programs such as an emphasis on renewables to their needs and goals.

This in turn could help meet Colorado’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and also reduce the generation demands on Xcel and Black Hills Energy.

However the proliferation of CCE plans with communities getting power from a range of merchant energy companies could make planning for adequate generation difficult the report said and lead to “increased complication and uncertainty that could slow the state’s ability to deploy renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”

The states that have CCE programs also have wholesale electricity markets where bulk electricity is bought and sold daily usually automatically through computerized sales.

Colorado does not yet have such a market but by 2030 the major utilities in the state will be required to join an organized wholesale market under a bill passed in 2021.

“It is not clear how a CCE model could be successfully implemented and function prior to the implementation of an effective transparent and liquid wholesale market in Colorado” the report said.

This Miloshevich said was an example of the PUC’s overly cautious approach. “It would definitely be better in a whole number of respects if there was a wholesale market but Colorado has 29 municipal utilities who procure electricity successfully through bilateral contracts with a merchant power company.”

Miloshevich said that to pass CCE enabling legislation and for the PUC to draw up rules could take two to three years and then it could take another year for a community to develop a plan and get PUC approval bringing it all closer to the time when Colorado has a wholesale market.

“A lot of the uncertainty will work itself out over time” Miloshevich said.

Much of that uncertainty comes from not knowing how key components such as exit fees paid to the investor-owned utilities by CCE communities will be calculated and how opt-out provisions for customers who want to stay with the traditional utility are framed.

“There was caution on the part of the PUC” said former Rep. Edie Hooton a Boulder Democrat and the chief sponsor the CCE study bill. Boulder spent a decade trying to end its franchise agreement with Xcel Energy to create a municipal utility and fight climate change. “Those concerns are valuable because it makes for better legislation.”

“The report is a pretty good template for enabling legislation” Hooton said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vdGltYmVyd29sdmVzL25ld3MvdGltYmVyd29sdmVzLXRvLWhvc3QtcHJpZGUtbmlnaHQtb24tamFudWFyeS000gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Timberwolves to Host Pride Night on January 4,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.nba.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /timberwolves/news/timberwolves-to-host-pride-night-on-january-4 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E26D6E60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vdGltYmVyd29sdmVzL25ld3MvdGltYmVyd29sdmVzLXRvLWhvc3QtcHJpZGUtbmlnaHQtb24tamFudWFyeS000gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS1jb21tZXJjZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS9lbGstcml2ZXItZGF0YS1jZW50ZXItc2VsbHMtZm9yLTkwLW1pbGxpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elk River data center sells for $90 million,"Listen to this article Listen to this article

A UnitedHealth Group data center in Elk River hit the top of the charts for industrial sales last year in a year-end transaction.

An entity of JP Morgan Chase & Co. sold the building at 14100 Business Center Drive NW for $90 million last week to an affiliate of global data center provider CloudHQ according to a recently published certificate of real estate value. The single-tenant property is approximately 239000 square feet setting the price tag at about $377 per square foot.

The property sits just south of Highway 10 on the western edge of town where it’s surrounded by multiple government facilities a golf course a Target data center and commercial properties.

JP Morgan Chase declined to comment and CloudHQ did not respond to requests for information.

The deal marks the top individual industrial transaction of last year overtaking the $54 million sale of a Best Buy warehouse in Bloomington that traded for about $93 per square foot. That also beats the sale of the Waters Business Center a six-building portfolio that nabbed $37.1 million or about $113 per square foot.

Elk River specializes in data centers. “A cooperative economic development department reliable electrical power and sufficient water capacity combine to make Elk River a very desirable location for Data Centers” according to the city website.

UnitedHealth Group has more than 435000 square feet of data center space between two properties in the city. Elk River is also home to data centers occupied by Thomson Reuters Target Unisys and other companies.

CloudHQ’s purchase of the building comes months after the Washington D.C.-based company cleared its first hurdle to building 1.4-million-square-foot data center in Chaska where the company has said it plans to invest $1 billion.

The company’s website says it has designed and developed more than 7 million square feet of data center space. It currently holds land capable of delivering 20 million square feet of data center space.

While data centers don’t offer as many jobs as manufacturing plants they employ people in highly paid roles.

In nearby Becker an Xcel Energy spokesperson told Finance & Commerce that it’s looking at plans near the Sherco coal plant.

“As part of that work we are coordinating closely with Elk River Technologies which plans a turnkey data center development on land that is currently part of our Sherco coal plant site” Kevin Cross Xcel’s senior media relations representative told F&C in an email last year. “This project will provide up to $1 billion in capital investments to the city of Becker as well as 100 high-paying permanent jobs and more than 1200 construction jobs.”

During the height of the COVID pandemic many of us dealt with supply chain issues and not always getting what we wanted. Restaurants and food businesses had to adapt and customers were understanding for the most part. However when Taco Bell announced in September 2020 that it was removing the Mexican Pizza from its menu there were voices in unison saying ""What the hell Taco Bell?""The chain from Yum! Brands has long been a source of cheap late night fuel or a fast noonday lunch. For many Taco Bell offered after-school sustenance that teens (probably working at other fast food restaurants) could afford. When Taco Bell introduced its 39 49 and 59 cent menu in the 1980s we Gen Xers knew to the penny what combination of menu items we could afford that week. Some of us who waited tables had ready cash on hand to spot a pal a crunchy taco or bean burrito. On good days we might even have a little extra to add in some pintos 'n cheese with the solid lid of cheddar cheese on top.In 1985 Taco Bell introduced the Pizzazz Pizza which eventually became the Mexican Pizza. For teens and broke college kids it was a menu item that was ordered when funds were a little more on the positive side. It had two crispy shells with seasoned ground beef and refried beans layered inside. It was topped with tomato sauce three cheeses diced tomatoes green onions and sliced black olives. The green onions and black olives were eventually taken off the pizza probably due to the fact that young people usually ordered the pizzas without them anyway.The decision to remove the Mexican Pizza from the menu in November 2020 was made according to Yum! Brands  due to the environmental impact of its packaging. What followed were petitions galore a rap song by Doja Cat and even a Tik Tok special called. The musical streamed on September 15 2022 and included celebs such as Dolly Parton and Doja Cat who takes credit for bringing the Taco Bell treat back.However when Taco Bell reintroduced the Mexican Pizza in May 2022 customers who rushed back in hordes were often disappointed because the pizzas routinely sold out. I was one of those customers. Stopping to pick up a few bean burritos for my cross country-running teen last summer I was denied my craving because they didn't have the ingredients. Looking over the new menu I saw that many things had disappeared. When I asked about a grilled steak taco I was told it was no longer on the menu but that they could make me one. Rather confusing but apparently part of Taco Bell's M.O. Let's not get started on its other dropped items.Now the supply issues for the Mexican Pizza seem to be remedied but there are other points of contention regarding the reintroduced pizza. Some felt the crusts weren't quite as crispy as before but the Taco Bell website says the ingredients are all the same.I didn't think much more about Taco Bell's Mexican Pizza since middle-aged spread and disgust with fast food's infiltration of our food systems has made me more cognizant of what I eat. I am not anti-fast food just aware of its nutritional and environmental impact. However I received a press release recently announcing a new Double Crunch Pizza ($4.99) at Taco Cabana. I was intrigued. I had to see how it stacked up against Taco Bell's much loved version.Taco Cabana is a Texas-based chain founded in San Antonio in 1978. Unlike Taco Bell many of its salsas are made fresh along with its flour tortillas and other items. It also differentiated itself from its Tex-Mex rival by offering beer and margaritas in a more fast-casual style and its patios have been home to many late night gatherings.Since my husband Classic Rock Bob was out running errands I asked him to pick up a Double Crunch Pizza and a margarita or two. During the pandemic Texas liquor laws were amended to allow restaurants to sell alcoholic beverages along with food purchases. Most restaurants served the liquor on the side in sealed mini-bottles and Taco Cabana did the same with its margaritas. They were virgin drinks with a tiny bottle of tequila to mix in. Now the restaurant serves the margaritas sealed with the liquor already blended in. It's an improvement because the liquor keeps the frozen margaritas from melting as quickly.My Double Crunch Pizza arrived in a purple cardboard box with a foil liner. That helps to keep the box recyclable. The Taco Cabana pizza is two crispy shells that are a blend of flour and corn which I love. H-E-B grocery stores sell a blended tortilla and I think it's the best of both worlds.The six-inch pizza was loaded with grated cheeseand a hefty drizzle of sour cream. Like the Taco Bell Mexican Pizza it has refried beans and seasoned ground beef in between the shells. It also has chipotle ranch dressing and more cheese inside. I am not a big fan of chipotle but it was not an obtrusive amount. Unlike Taco Bell's version the cheese was not melted which was a little bit of a downside. Overall it was a fresher take on the Mexican Pizza with the pico de gallo adding a palate-pleasing vibrancy. I regrettably realized that this might become a fast food craving.I had to compare the two so a few days later I ordered the Taco Bell Mexican Pizza ($4.99). When I opened it it was just not as visually pleasing as Taco Cabana's pizza. The melted cheese was carelessly distributed with some of it stuck like glue to the container. The pizza sauce just didn't taste as it did years ago. While Taco Bell's meat and bean flavors are almost burned into our culinary memories it was not as satisfying as it used to be. It was still good but not as crave-worthy.I had added some bean burritos to the order for my son. I used to be a huge fan of Taco Bell's bean burritos but I will no longer eat them because they look and taste like... something that is not good. And after having tried the bean burritos at Taco Casa Taco Bell's version doesn't even compare. Unfortunately there's only one Taco Casa in the Houston area and it's in the wilds of Cypress. If you're a bean burrito lover though it's worth the drive. However Taco Casa's refried beans are not vegetarian.I felt pretty blah after eating the Mexican Pizza from Taco Bell but not Taco Cabana's Double Crunch Pizza. Both certainly filled me up but I didn't feel slightly sick with Taco Cabana's version like I did with Taco Bell's.With the New Year rolling upon us I decided to have another taste of Taco Cabana's Double Crunch Pizza before my healthy-eating resolutions are attempted again. I also ordered one of its frozen Mangonada Margaritas. It made a festive late lunch after I plated my pizza and poured my rita into a salted glass. I don't know if my friendly demeanor in the drive-thru earned me a particularly hefty pizza but it was definitely loaded even more than the first one I sampled. I was also given five plastic ramekins of Taco Cabana's freshly made red salsa for an added bonus. It was worth the calories on a hot winter's day in Houston.For us Taco Cabana's Double Crunch Pizza beat Taco Bell's Mexican Pizza for freshness eye appeal and taste.We apologize in advance for any New Year's resolutions that might be broken due to this review.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ybi5jb20vZnJhbmNoaXNpbmcvd2h5LWZyYW5jaGlzaW5nLWV4cGVjdGVkLWdyb3ctMjAyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Expect more franchising vertical integrations this year,"In inflationary environments such as the one we’re currently navigating franchising becomes a particularly attractive business model. For companies it means they’re using someone else’s capital and collecting revenue from the topline.

“Inflated costs tend to benefit brands charging royalties” said Kevin Maher partner at Baker & McKenzie LLP. Maher leads the firm’s international commercial practice group and works with several major restaurant brands. Because of the current macroeconomic picture he predicts a continued uptick in franchising in 2023 and is basing that forecast on what most of his clients are saying. Others share this observation: According to a recent survey from FranConnect about 50% of franchisors say they anticipate double-digit increases in franchise sales in 2023.

This could very likely lead to a big-getting-bigger scenario and in the past few years we’ve witnessed this trend manifest as restaurant companies and their franchisees work to bolster their rosters and better insulate themselves amid various crises.

“We have ginormous franchisees now and I don’t see that trend going away” Maher said. “It’s attractive to not have all of those (locations) on the balance sheet – just positioning yourself as a brand company versus a restaurant company. We saw some of that after the previous downturn where companies sold off company units to be franchised units. All that comes off your balance sheet. You don’t have the upside of profit potential but you have the guaranteed royalty stream. In these markets those with a stronger balance sheet will do well and find an opportunity in a down cycle.”

That’s certainly not the only opportunity of course. The bigger the operator the more benefits of scale come into play. Maher also believes this will lead to more vertical integration opportunities across the industry – specifically supply chain vertical integration. Starbucks uses a vertically integrated supply chain for instance. So does McDonald’s.

“The pandemic made restaurant companies realize vulnerabilities they have in their supply chains and I think vertical integration is where bigger brands will continue their focus” Maher said. “How can brands continue to acquire within verticals to be able to control supply issues and de-risk? Not having that control over signature items is top-of-mind in the c-suite and we’ll see more strategic acquisitions to get more control.”

Those acquisitions are likely to extend to technology as well. We’ve seen this from Yum Brands Chipotle McDonald’s and others and are likely to see more Maher predicts.

“Acquiring tech startups so their tech stack isn’t owned by a third party that might get tied up or acquired by a competitor will be a bigger focus” he said. “Being able to bring technologies in house has become more attractive for competitive advantages and data and we’ll see bigger players looking more at this.”

What about the little guys?

As franchisees get bigger and scale more effectively and perhaps flex some acquisition muscle where does that leave the smaller players? Maher believes there is a big opportunity for them as well as pent-up demand remains strong for dining out. But Peter Cadigan consumer products partner and senior analyst at RSM U.S. adds they also have to start operating with a tech-and-data-focused mindset to survive.

“There are going to be some struggles ahead. The smaller restaurants may have a tough time because they don’t have scale and they don’t have customer data. Repeat customer usage will be one of the only ways for growth ahead and they need data to drive that” Cadigan said. “They have to learn what their customers want so they don’t lose them. They have to get creative.”

Getting creative means adopting strategic partnerships he said gathering data in a variety of ways (surveys social media etc.) and investing in repeat customers versus new customer acquisition. Also as consumer budgets are expected to tighten up it will be critical for those smaller concepts to make sure they execute against a simple high-quality menu and that they offer a consistent digital experience despite a return to dine-in.

“If you’re just trying to cut costs that could hurt because the consumer has become really sophisticated. Consumer expectations of quality have really gone up” Maher said. “At the same time it’s important to lean into digital because it is going to continue to be huge. If you don’t have an easy way to order you’ll lose business with huge segments.”

It's hard to imagine a life without a McDonald's a Chipotle a Dunkin' or a Texas Roadhouse somewhere nearby right? Well as it happens if you were to hop into a time machine and travel back 30 years two of the restaurants mentioned just now would not yet exist but they changed dining forever.

And neither would any of the restaurant chains we're featuring here today either: every chain noted here is less than 30 years old. T birthday is fast approaching for several restaurant chains below while one of the chains is in fact a mere 15 years old at the time of this writing.

Be glad you live today in a time when mighty burritos smashed burgers and lettuce wraps are nearly ubiquitous because back in your parents' day—or your earlier days even—these nine restaurant chains didn't even exist.

6 Restaurant Chains That Bake Their Own Fresh Bread—Instead of Using Frozen

Texas Roadhouse

The first Texas Roadhouse was established in February of the year 1993. And in Clarksville Indiana not in Texas FYI. Today in terms of sales Texas Roadhouse is the biggest steakhouse in America with $3.717 billion in total revenue in 2021. For reference runner-up Outback trailed notably with $2.621 billion in sales that same year. Those impressive sales were generated by Texas Roadhouse's 615 locations which span every state.

Chipotle

Also turning 30 in 2023 is Chipotle which was founded in the summer of 1993 in Denver Colorado. Formally called Chipotle Mexican Grill today the chain boasts an impressive 3095 locations in America and around the world. And per data sourced from YCharts the chain enjoyed 2021 revenues of $7.547 billion USD.

P.F. Chang's

Also in the 1993 founding turning 30 in 2023 ""club"" is P.F. Chang's home to those beloved lettuce wraps and spring rolls and wonton soups and more sodium than you should even think about. There are some 300 P.F. Chang's restaurants on the planet today per the restaurant's website and per Zippia the chain enjoyed revenues of $1.2 billion in 2021.

Qdoba

Qdoba was founded in Denver in the year 1995 though it was then known as Zuma Fresh Mexican Grill. The name changed to Z-TECA a couple of years later in 1997 and the final change came in 1999 when the chain was switched to QDOBA. Today there are more than 730 QDOBA restaurants and per Restaurant Business Online the chain saw sales of around $820 million in 2020 the most recent year for which data was readily available.

Bonefish Grill

The first Bonefish Grill was opened a little over two decades back in the year 2000. Today there are 180 Bonefish Grill locations most of which are concentrated up and down the East Coast and in the South though a few can be found in Texas Colorado Nevada and other states. The chain enjoyed revenues of about $619 million in 2021 per Zippia.

5 Fast-Casual Chains With the Most Food Quality Complaints

Wingstreet

Hard to believe it but it's true: WingStreet is not yet 20 years old at the time of this writing the chain having been founded in 2003. The Pizza Hut partner launched big though with 1000 units opening within four years per the Pizza Hut Fandom wiki. It's hard to tell how much money WingStreet generates annually as it's in the Yum! Brands portfolio but Yum! is doing fine with annual overall revenues of $6.58 billion in 2021 per Statista.

Shake Shack

Shake Shack is still a teenager having been founded in 2004. The burger and shake joint grew fast though spreading out from coast to coast by 2014 and going public with an IPO in 2015. Today there are more than 360 locations and the chain is present in dozens of countries. Revenues were around $739.9 million in 2021.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

7 Burger Chains That Raised Their Prices the Most in 2022

Duck Donuts

The first Duck Donuts opened back during the second term of President George W. Bush in 2007. And what ""started as a whim"" according to the chain's founder soon grew into a successful chain. The chain aims to hit 215 locations in the near future and per GrowJo the chain enjoys revenues around $134.3 million annually.

Smashburger

Like Duck Donuts Smashburger was founded in the year 2007. And like Chipotle and Qdoba it was founded in Denver. But this burger chain hardly stayed there: today there are nearly 220 Smashburger locations spread around America with many found on the East Coast plenty out West and a number of units in Texas Florida and other states including of course Colorado. And per Zippia systemwide the chain generated some $338.3 million in sales in 2021."

Army veteran Tyler Rezachek is one such Wisconsinite. His frustration with constantly having to clean mussels off of his boat led him to identify a problem that was the catalyst for the creation of his startup AntiMussel.

Rezachek truly began relying on his entrepreneurial side after joining the Army in 2008 and serving over four years as a Chinook helicopter mechanic. His transition to civilian life was less than smooth.

“Like most veterans I had about 30 jobs in the 10 years between now and when I got into the military” Rezachek said. “I quickly realized I was unemployable and needed something to myself.”

The first business he founded was an industrial hemp brokerage in Plymouth. From there Rezachek ventured into the landscaping industry. It wasn’t last December when he attended an entrepreneurship bootcamp for veterans at Texas A&M University that he leaned into an idea that had lingered in his mind for years.

“That was one of the most pivotal moments in my life” Rezachek said. “It gave me the confidence to start thinking about AntiMussel.”

Rezachek grew up fishing on Lake Michigan and like most fisherman he became quickly familiar with the nuisance that is the zebra mussel. He officially launched AntiMussel last May hoping to provide a solution to the problem.

That solution is to have the mussels vacuumed up by boats that are set to patrol an automated path. Once the mussels are collected they are converted into calcium carbonate.

“The innovation here is the process of removal (of the mussels) processing and the end product” Rezachek said. “We normally get calcium carbonate from rocks. The process right now is mining big rocks smashing them into a really fine powder putting it into a pill form and selling it. The rocks they’re mining are limestone which are several million year old seashells. In my mind you can just skip that million years and we can pull them off the lake.”

The calcium carbonate made of out zebra mussels has a higher purity rate than the product made from limestone. It is the world’s only source of renewable calcium carbonate according to the nonprofit economic development corporation The New North. One zebra mussel provides enough calcium carbonate to make one piece of printer paper.

AntiMussel took home second place at The New North’s pitch competition which was held at Titletown Tech last December. Aside from the $1000 won from The New North pitch competition Rezachek has also received $16900 in grant funding. Outside of that funding he has been bootstrapping.

Rezachek is hoping to launch a pilot program in Plymouth this spring. His goal is to remove a 250 square meter area of mussels. He’ll do this himself with the help of a diver.

In March AntiMussel will also seek feedback from the community via an online survey. This will help with the customer discovery process.

“I didn’t realize how big of a problem this was until I started working on it” Rezachek said. “It’s astounding. We’re taking about trillions of mussels in the Great Lakes. It’s literal piles and blankets of mussels across the bottom of the lake and we intend to suck them up.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkY2V4ZWMuY29tL3dhcmVob3VzaW5nL2F1dG9tYXRpb24vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMjYxNzg4Ny93YXJlaG91c2UtYXV0b21hdGlvbi13aGF0LXRvLWV4cGVjdC1pbi0yMDIz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warehouse Automation: What to Expect in 2023,"The implementation of automation in the warehouse is a crucial step in increasing safety productivity and process efficiency; reducing operational costs; and optimizing warehouse space.

These objectives are top priority for almost every warehouse manager no matter the industry yet when it comes to automation we still have a long way to go.

In fact according to Lisa Chai partner and senior research analyst at ROBO Global 80% of warehouses today have no automation at all. Another 15% have some automation while a small 5% have implemented more advanced technologies.

Despite these numbers many industry experts believe we will start to see an increase in adoption over the next 5 years driven by several trends including an ongoing labor shortage a more integrated warehouse and the introduction of better and more affordable solutions.

Labor shortage is driving adoption

The logistics industry has been plagued by a workforce shortage for years. While many efforts have been made to attract workers such as increased wages and added incentives like sign-on bonuses and tuition reimbursement warehouses are still struggling to keep up with demand.

“Working in the warehouse is not the sexiest occupation right? There are very few folks that go into that with long-term aspirations of being a warehouse picker so there's super high turnover” explains John Santagate VP of robotics for Körber Supply Chain Software adding that in addition to low availability of workers competition for those workers is incredibly competitive.

Earlier this year Berkshire Grey released its 2022 State of Retail & eCommerce Fulfillment Report which found that more than half of executives they surveyed (57%) believe labor shortages have hindered their ability to meet demand. While close to two-thirds of executives (60%) said they were planning to increase hiring to improve fulfillment costs half of the executives said they are also planning to improve internal processes (52%) and increase investments in warehouse automation (47%).

Without the ability to fill their workforce automation is rising to the top of solutions.

“Our customers simply can’t find the labor force they need to get goods to their customers” says Chris Geyer VP at Berkshire Grey. “In the words of one of our customers ‘The labor pool just does not exist.’ And they can’t retain the labor they do have. Some of our customers have reported 300% turnover. That’s three people per year for any given role. Many of our customers’ shipping volumes have been growing year over year but the population isn’t growing so lack of labor is an existential threat to these businesses and is the No. 1 2 and 3 factor leading to interest in warehouse automation.”

Software will integrate the warehouse

In today’s typical warehouse each technology or solution is often individually linked to the warehouse management system. This creates operational silos and makes any type of data analysis a manual headache.

In the next 12-18 months Santagate predicts a trend toward warehouse execution technology consolidation. This means warehouses will be able to orchestrate execute and standardize across a broad range of technologies using one software platform.

This integration of technologies into a singular interface tied to a warehouse management system (WMS) is a huge step toward a more optimized supply chain and Santagate notes it will be a major driver toward the commoditization of technologies.

Amy Gracia and Nilopal Ojha lead research analysts for robotics and automation at BIS Research note that the availability of sufficient support services will remain critical in the deployment of automated robots.

“If the maintenance/repair of robots takes longer timelines the warehouse operators will delay or reduce the number of robots on account of time delay and associated disruptions. The suppliers of warehouse automation solutions will need to provide sufficient support and training to their customers for a market wide uptake of these emerging technologies” Gracia and Nilopal say.

Innovation moves full speed ahead

The level of innovation in the warehouse automation space is reaching a pinnacle with better and more affordable solutions hitting the market every day.

“Innovation is the highest I’ve ever seen it…Customers are happy and we are starting to see some type of standardization coming into place” says Chai. “ROI is getting shorter. It used to be 24 months-plus and now it’s down to about 18 months for most of these automation and robotic solutions. And maybe in the next year or two ROI will go down to 12 months and that’s really going to be a driver of adoption.”

Chai adds that while companies often are hesitant to be early adopters we are now entering a period of time where the early adopters have helped to solve a lot of the challenges of early automation solutions.

“We are coming to a place now where [companies] are more educated…and we have service providers that are educated and familiar with technologies that can install and educate the customer. We have a lot of things still being worked on. I wouldn’t say we are there yet in terms of all the robotics solutions being adopted but we are getting there” she concludes.

Here are four areas of innovation to keep an eye on this year:

A. Mobile autonomous robots

The case for autonomous mobile robots (AMR) is growing as warehouses work to keep up with demand. AMRs are devices that can move around in an active environment without any type of guidance mechanisms working alongside people in the same aisles.

Santagate says the appeal of these robots is that they can “be deployed into a facility without having to break down your racks and create new workspace for them.”

With the traditional approach to automation where equipment is bolted to the floor there is little to no flexibility.

“What we're seeing now is the evolution to more flexible forms of automation leveraging mobile robotics that allow an organization to deploy automation without the fixed infrastructure therefore the cost of the fixed infrastructure and therefore enable scalability over time” adds Santagate. “Instead of building a facility to support demand for five years down the road you build for the current 12-month period and then increase your deployment of the technology incrementally as you start to see demand growth.”

Mobile robots also create a multibody approach in a picking environment which “allows you to decouple the worker from the work itself” explains Santagate. “The worker doesn't have to walk up and down every aisle anymore to do their work. Instead the worker stays in a smaller zone and picks to the robots as the work is brought to them. It's truly transformative.”

Santagate adds that beyond the boost to warehouse productivity AMRs make training faster and easier.

“You can get trained up on how to pick with these robots in under an hour. In fact you could walk up to it and be full speed in an hour in your first interaction with one of these robots” he notes.

Chai adds that self-driving drones are another great use case for AMRs in the warehouse.

“The infrastructure is changing. The fulfillment center physical layout is getting smaller but it is also getting very tall. The average warehouse is now 50 feet tall. That means a warehouse worker now has to climb up on a ladder. What if they don’t want to? Then you need a drone to fly around and scan everything on top” she explains.

B. Picking robots

According to Chai the biggest investment in the next year will be in picking robots that can move goods as fast as possible.

“Sorting and picking and moving is very very labor intensive and most people don’t want to do it but robots can do it faster because it loves to anything very manual. That’s an area we are seeing massive growth” says Chai.

C. Artificial intelligence

There are a lot of promising technologies backed by artificial intelligence (AI) entering the market and according to Chai everyone wants it.

“Everyone wants the intelligence. They want to be able to predict what and where and how much it’s going to cost” she explains.

AI promises the ability to do just that by predicting and forecasting trends breakdowns and financial impacts.

And while the technology is not quite there yet Chai says the future is bright for companies hoping to capitalize on predictive logistics.

Cost remains biggest barrier

With traditional automation the high initial cost and availability of space continues to be a major hurdle for many warehouse operations. For example the setup cost of robots for an average warehouse operation ranges from $2-4 million for 50-100 robots to $15-20 million for 500-1000 robots in a large warehouse operation according to research from BIS Research.

However a more modern and flexible approach to automation is emerging as a more attainable solution for automation adoption.

“A lot of companies don’t want to fork out a lot of money for capital goods” says Chai. “We are seeing companies say ‘I love it but I can’t afford it so what are some payment plans?’’

The solution is financing and leasing options such as robot-as-a-service (Raas) which allows companies to lease a certain amount of robots over a set period of time rather than making a large up-front purchase.

“Now instead of having to spend several million dollars on an automation system you could spend $150000 per year for flexible robots that are delivering 200-300 percent productivity improvements” explains Santagate.

Geyer further points to the potential RaaS offers for small- and mid-sized companies looking to invest in automation and remain competitive with the largest players.

“Typically smaller operators don’t have the capital needed for expensive automation projects or will outsource logistics to 3PL firms but robots-as-a-service offerings from BG and others give these smaller operators access to automation” he explains. “They don’t have to put capital up front. They pay subscriptions for modular automation. That allows them to be cost-competitive and maintain control over their operations.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc2VyZ2Vpa2xlYm5pa292LzIwMjMvMDEvMDQvMjAtZ3JlYXQtc3RvY2staWRlYXMtZm9yLTIwMjMtZnJvbS10b3AtcGVyZm9ybWluZy1mdW5kLW1hbmFnZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,20 Great Stock Ideas For 2023 From Top-Performing Fund Managers,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc2VyZ2Vpa2xlYm5pa292LzIwMjMvMDEvMDQvMjAtZ3JlYXQtc3RvY2staWRlYXMtZm9yLTIwMjMtZnJvbS10b3AtcGVyZm9ybWluZy1mdW5kLW1hbmFnZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E4260820>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

GE Healthcare Is a Standalone Company,"It’s finally complete. GE Healthcare is now a standalone company. The firm is now trading on Nasdaq after spinning off from General Electric its parent company.

The company is now trading on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol “GEHC.”

GE Healthcare’s spin-off is part of a plan to break GE into three separate companies. GE will combine its renewable energy power and digital businesses into a separate company in a second spin-off slated for 2024. The remaining GE business will focus on aviation.

GE Healthcare is being led by Peter Arduini. He stepped down from his role as CEO at Integra LifeSciences to assume the position of president and CEO at GE Healthcare.

“We are on the verge of true industry transformation as digital innovation reshapes the experience of patients and providers with an increased need for more precise connected and efficient care Arduini said in a release. “GE HealthCare colleagues worldwide are united in our purpose to create a world where healthcare has no limits and we look forward to delivering for providers patients and shareholders in the years ahead.”

GE HealthCare has some impressive stats at launch. The company has a presence in more than 160 countries and about 51000 employees worldwide serving more than one billion patients a year. GE Healthcare generates about $18 billion in revenue with an installed base including more than 4 million pieces of equipment across its four business segments – Imaging Ultrasound Patient Care Solutions and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics.

The company said it expects its addressable markets will expand from $84 billion in 2021 to $102 billion by 2025. That expansion provides significant opportunities for growth and execution of the Company’s precision care strategy to safely and securely integrate patient data from imaging lab pathology genomics and other sources.

Talks of GE Healthcare spinning off began nearly five years ago. The rationale behind the spin-off plans in 2018 was to allow GE to focus more on its industrial offerings. However those plans were scrapped in early 2019 when GE sold its pharmaceutical unit to Danaher for $21 billion.

The Spin is In

In early 2021 on an episode of the Let’s Talk Medtech podcast EY’s John Babitt said that the spin was in referring to the growing number of spinoffs in the medical device industry.

Outside of GE one of the biggest spinouts announced in 2021 was Johnson & Johnson. The New Brunswick NJ-based company announced it was splitting its consumer products business from its medical device and pharmaceutical businesses.

Other notable spinoffs include Zimmer Biomet’s ZimVie; 3M and its healthcare unit and Becton Dickinson’s Embecta which won Reader’s Choice for Company of the Year.

Most recently Medtronic announced plans to spin off its patient monitoring and respiratory interventions businesses into a new company.",,,,,,,,,,,,
